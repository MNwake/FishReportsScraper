                "narrative": "<p>Ochotto Lake is a small body of water (40 acres) located near Avon, in Stearns County.  Although the lake is very close to the Spunk chain of lakes, it has no connection to the chain.  A city park adjacent to the lake contains a public boat access.  \n\nThe Northern Pike catch was similar to that of 1983 and above the local median. Females were three times as abundant as males in the gill net catch. Females ranged in length from 16 to 26 inches and males from 17 to 20 inches in length were sampled. Ages 2-6 were sampled with age 3 fish predominant. All ages showed good growth. Receding water levels since 1986 may have reduced the availability of spawning areas spawning success. Bluegill abundance was similar to that of 1978 and 1983. Growth of the seven age classes sampled was slow. Age 5 fish dominated the sample. Age distribution suggested that spawning success was consistent over time. Nearly 15% of the Bluegills sampled were between seven and nine inches in length. Black Crappie abundance was near the local median. All Black Crappie from trap nets were age 3 or age 4 but younger ages were sampled in gill nets. Black Crappie grew slowly until age 2 and had good growth thereafter. Yellow Bullhead abundance remained high relative to the local median. Length ranged from six to twelve inches with a median length of 9.5 inches. No forage species were sampled in this survey due to the inability to conduct shoreline seining.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ochotto Lake is a small body of water (40 acres) located near Avon, in Stearns County.  Although the lake is very close to the Spunk chain of lakes, it has no connection to the chain.  A city park adjacent to the lake contains a public boat access.  A resurvey was conducted in 2001, and included electrofishing, gillnetting, trapnetting, seining, and a vegetation survey.Ochotto Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass.  No stocking is needed for these species, as the lake provides suitable spawning habitat.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2001 was high for lakes like Ochotto, but down slightly from 1989.  Average size in 2001 (2.9 pounds) was good, and was higher than in 1989 (1.9 pounds).  Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in early May.  Although the catch rate was lower than average for the area, average size was high.  Nineteen bass were sampled, ranging from 6 inches to over 20 inches.  Over half were larger than 12 inches.The catch rate of bluegill in 2001 was lower than in previous surveys, but within the normal range.  Mean weight was below average, and growth of bluegill appeared slow.  The catch rate of black crappie was average, and individuals ranged from 6.5 to nearly 11 inches.  Yellow perch abundance appeared low in 2001, as it has in all previous surveys.  This is typical of clear lakes with high northern pike populations.  Other species sampled during the 2001 survey included yellow bullhead, pumkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.Ochotto's small watershed (70 acres) is reflected in its good water quality.  Chlorophyll-a (a measure of algae), total phosphorus, and water clarity all were in the mesotrophic (moderate clarity) range.  Ochotto supports a diverse submerged plant community, some growing to 18 feet.  Water lilies and several emergent plant species are also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ochotto Lake is located in Stearns County, near Avon. The lake has a surface area of 40 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet. The watershed is very small and mostly residential and agriculture. A public access is located in a city park on the south side of the lake. The survey was conducted in July, 2012. Northern pike, largemouth bass, sunfish species, and black crappie are present in the lake. Water quality was excellent and a diverse plant community grew to a depth of 21 feet. Twenty-four species of aquatic plants were found and emergent and floating-leaf plants such as water lilies, cattail, bulrush, and wild rice covered 37% of the lake area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in numbers well above the expected range for similar lakes. The 2012 catch rate was higher than any previous survey. Average length was 20.1 inches and the largest northern pike caught was 27.3 inches long. Average weight was two pounds and within the expected range. Eleven percent of northern pike caught in gill nets were longer than 24 inches. Growth was average; northern pike grew to 20 inches in four years and most were three to five years old. Northern pike are abundant; the fishery would benefit if anglers kept more small pike (<24 inches) and released larger ones. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 23, 2012. The catch rate was 91/hr. This is well above the Montrose median value of 38/hr for daytime electrofishing. Average length was 11 inches and average weight was one pound. The largest individual caught was 21.1 inches. Growth was slow; largemouth bass reached 12 inches in six years. The catch rate in 2001 was much lower, but average size was higher. Anglers can help by keeping some smaller bass (<14 inches) and releasing larger ones. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was lower than 2001 but within the expected range for similar lakes. Average length was six inches, higher than in 2001 (five inches). Growth was slow; bluegill reached seven inches in six years and most were five or six years old. The largest individual caught was eight inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates in 2012 were low and nearly identical to 2001, but within the expected range for the lake type. Previous surveys have also had low catches. Average length was almost nine inches and growth was average; black crappie reached nine inches at age four. Most black crappie were age four and the largest individual was nearly twelve inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were captured in 2012 and only three in 2001; previous surveys found none. Other species captured included: hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

A city park adjacent to the lake contains a public boat access.  \n\nNorthern Pike abundance (7.0/gill net) is about average compared to local median and has dropped from 11.0/gill net in 1978. Age classes 1-5 were sampled with age 2 being the most numerous. Growth of Northern Pike was average when compared to statewide data. Bluegill abundance (37.3/trap net) was about twice the local average. Most fish were in the 3-5 inch size range. Black Crappie abundance (1.3/trap net) is about average. Yellow Bullhead, at 23.3/trap net, are about five times the local median in abundance. A large portion of these fish were in the 9-13 inch size range. Largemouth Bass were sampled only by shoreline seining.\n</p>",
