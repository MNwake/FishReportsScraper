                "narrative": "<p>       Little Rock Lake is the largest lake in Benton County and has high value both for shoreline development and recreational use.  The lake, however, does have a history of severe algae blooms in mid to late summer, which affect both the recreational value and fish community.   Little Rock has a wide connection to the Mississippi River, which also influences the fish species composition in the lake.  Lack of vegetation and turbid water make the lake less suitable for largemouth bass and bluegill. <br> \n        The lake receives heavy winter and spring fishing pressure for walleye and black crappies.  Walleye natural reproduction has been successful at maintaining the population and meeting fishing pressure demands.  This assessment was different from past surveys due to the timing of the survey and gear types used.  Gamefish sampled in the survey included walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  Most of the walleye captured in the survey were from 12 to 20 inches in length, however, larger fish are available.  Little Rock Lake is not known for its northern pike fishery, and anglers will have to work to locate them.  Average size of the pike observed in the survey was about 3.3 pounds and most of the pike reported by anglers are good size.  Although neither largemouth or smallmouth bass appear to be abundant, some nice largemouth over 18 inches and smallmouth over 17 inches were found.   <br> \n        Black crappie can tolerate the turbid waters found in Little Rock Lake and they are prolific.  Angler success depends on the strength of the year class of fish that have grown to acceptable size.  Most of the crappie found in the assessment were from the 2005 year class and ranged from 7.5 to 9 inches in length, a size at which  anglers will begin targeting these fish.  White crappie are also present in the lake, although they are not as abundant as the black crappie.  Although bluegill are not that abundant, Little Rock Lake does produce some quality fish.  Most of the fish caught in the assessment were over 7 inches in length with some over 9 inches being measured. <br> \n        Although not many yellow perch were observed in the assessment, it was noted that young of the year perch were abundant in the electrofishing effort.  Numerous other species such as trout perch, shiners, small suckers, and redhorse may also substitute as prey species for the gamefish.  Roughfish such as bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin or dogfish, common carp, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, and white sucker are major components of the fish community.  White sucker were the most numerous roughfish sampled, but net catches also suggest high populations of bigmouth buffalo.  Most of the buffalo were from 18 to 21 inches in length suggesting the presence of a strong year class.  Carp can provide an additional sport fishery, whether it be angling or bow fishing.  Carp just over 33 inches were measured and it's likely there are bigger ones in the lake.  Black bullhead were the only bullhead species sampled in the assessment, although both brown and yellow bullheads have been captured in previous assessments.  Black bullheads can be an indicator of water quality as they are more tolerant of poor water quality than the other two bullhead species.   <br> \n      The last survey in 2002 indicated that the channel catfish were increasing in abundance and doing well in the lake.  Fewer catfish were caught in this assessment, but with the river connection, there is ample opportunity for migration. <br> \n      Improving the water quality in Little Rock Lake has been a goal of an active lake association as well as local government and state agencies.  Work has been done with landowners in the watershed to reduce nutrient run-off to streams feeding the lake.  The Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District is conducting a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) study on the lake to identify nutrient sources and needed remedies.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fall nighttime electrofishing was conducted for juvenile Walleye on Little Rock Lake in late September of 2013.   Little Rock Lake had a long history of Walleye stocking until 1991 when natural reproduction along with the connection to the near-by Mississippi River was found to sustain the lake's Walleye population at levels which meet management goals and angling pressure demands.   Electrofishing has been conducted periodically since 1996 with the current schedule being odd-numbered years.   While most electrofishing has been done at night, some daytime efforts have occurred.  Past surveys on the lake have noted the presence of high numbers of juvenile Walleye while electrofishing for county fair fish during the day, usually in the month of July.   <br> \n     Daytime electrofishing for young of year Walleye was tried in both 2011 and 2008 with the assumption that the poor water clarity from annual summer algae blooms would encourage the young fish to be shallow.   Those two efforts, however, produced some of the lower juvenile Walleye catches for the lake, 6.3/hour in 2011 and 3.6/hour in 2008.   Poor water clarity has been a common theme in all the electrofishing efforts, both day and night, making capture and fish identification difficult. <br> \n     The 2013 night electrofishing effort produced the highest juvenile Walleye catch for Little Rock Lake with 151 young-of-year Walleye netted.  The 147/hour was well above the previous nighttime catch rates of 11.6/hour in 2009, 5.3/hour in 2006, 82/hour in 2001, 24.6/hour in 1999, 47/hour in 1997, and 2.4/hour in 1996.   <br> \n     An additional seventeen Walleye between 11 and 23.6 inches were also captured in the 2013 electrofishing effort.  Scales were taken from the seventeen Walleye to verify year class.  Ages 1, 2, 4, and 7 were represented in the adult sample.  A significant year class appears to have been produced in 2012 as 53% (n=9) of the adult fish were yearlings.       <br> \n     Other fish species observed during the 2013 electrofishing effort included Yellow Perch, Trout Perch, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Channel Catfish, White Sucker, Spottail Shiners, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n     Nighttime electrofishing will be used for future Walleye reproduction assessment as it appears to be more effective.  Daytime electrofishing will be discontinued. <br> \n     An attached document (Little Rock YWAE Electrofishing) shows the year fall electrofishing was done, the catch rate, and the number of fish caught from those year classes in subsequent summer surveys.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rock Lake (DOW# 05-0013-00; Lake Class 41) is a 1,310 acre lake located near Rice, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south Shore. Little Rock Lake has 10.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. Little Rock Lake is in Lake Class 41; lakes in this class are generally very large, shallow, have a very high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have very hard water, turbid, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 an ice-out survey targeted at mature Northern Pike and Walleye was completed. Abundance of Northern Pike was similar to past surveys and size structure of the population was very good with fish up to 37 inches captured. Walleye abundance was similar to past surveys, but a sufficient number of fish was not captured to make any judgements about the size structure of the population. Walleye up to 24 inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Zebra Mussels and Curly Leaf Pondweed have been identified in Little Rock Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rock Lake (DOW# 05-0013-00; Lake Class 41) is a 1,310 acre lake located near Rice, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south Shore. Little Rock Lake has 10.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. Little Rock Lake is in Lake Class 41; lakes in this class are generally very large, shallow, have a very high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have very hard water, turbid, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nAn ice-out survey targeting gamefish species was completed on Little Rock Lake from April 11-13, 2022. Ice-out trapnetting is effective as several gamefish species are attracted to shorelines for spawning or feeding as shallow waters warm in spring. A total of 284 Black Crappie were captured which was a moderate catch when compared to previous surveys. Mean length of Black Crappie sampled was 9.19 inches with lengths ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 inches. Good numbers of keeper size fish were present as 19.0% of the catch exceeded 10.0 inches. A record number of 441 Bluegill were also captured during spring sampling. Bluegill grow exceptionally fast in the lake and should provide bonus angling opportunities for anglers. Bluegill captured ranged from 3.2 to 10.4 inches and 40.0% of fish captured were greater than 7.0 inches. The high catch of Bluegill suggests a possible positive effect on water quality from the 2019 drawdown as this species tends to thrive in clearer water. Another species that may have benefitted from the drawdown was Northern Pike. Pike catches were also the highest recorded and size structure of the population was very good with fish up to 35.2 inches captured. Northern Pike over 24.0 inches comprised 25.4% of the catch. Eighteen Walleye were captured and abundance was similar to past surveys, but a sufficient number of fish was not captured to make any judgements about the size structure or abundance of the population. Walleye from 7.1 to 18.0 inches were sampled. A total of 48 Largemouth Bass were caught in trapnets which was the second highest catch recorded in spring netting. Largemouth Bass is another species that prefer clearer water and may have benefitted from the drawdown in 2019. Other gamefish species captured included a low catch of Channel Catfish and a fairly high catch of Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Bigmouth Buffalo (all yearlings), Bowfin, Common Carp (mostly yearlings and a few adults), Common Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Trout-Perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. Overall, the species sampled in this survey was similar to that seen in previous spring ice-out assessments. <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing has been utilized annually to assess natural reproduction of Walleye on Little Rock Lake. Sampling in 2022 was conducted on August 31 and effort totaled 1:04:10 of on-time. A total of 19 young of the year Walleye were captured during the assessment for a catch rate of 17.8/hour which was below the median (30.0/hour). Catch rates from previous fall electrofishing surveys have ranged from 3.6/hour in 2008 to 147.1/hour in 2013. Young of the year Walleye sampled in 2022 ranged from 4.3 to 6.7 inches and averaged 5.5 inches, which was smaller than average. Sampling conditions in 2022 were challenging with high temperatures and heavy algae blooms present which made it difficult to see fish. Catch rates were probably negatively impacted due to poor visibility and catch rates would have been higher if the water had been clearer. Although fall electrofishing catch rates below 25.0/hour have not produced large future year classes, it is expected that a moderate year class was produced in 2022 that should contribute to good angling opportunities in a few years. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Zebra Mussels and Curly Leaf Pondweed have been identified in Little Rock Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     An ice-out assessment is conducted on Little Rock Lake every third year to evaluate changes in the black crappie population.  While Little Rock Lake is not actively managed for crappies, the goal in the lake management plan is to  maintain a black crappie population with 40% or more of the spring trapnet catch exceeding 9 inches in length.  Ten lake survey trapnets were set in the lake on April 15 and removed April 16 after an adequate sample size of 303 crappies was captured.  This was about one fourth of the 1428 crappies estimated to be caught in the 2004 ice-out after a one night set.  Net catches of  218, 123, and 234 black crappies were recorded in the the 2001 , 1998, and 1995 ice-out assessments, respectively.  There were also fair catches of bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, bowfin, carp, largemouth bass, northern pike, and white sucker in the 2007 assessment.   <br> \n     The black crappie length distribution had remained fairly consistent when comparing the previous assessments at around 3 to 13 inches.  Crappies in the 2007 spring assessment ranged from 5 to 14 inches in length with a mean length of 8.6 inches, equal to that observed in all the surveys except for 2004 which was 7.5 inches.  Crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 34% (n=104)  of the catch in 2007 while in 2004 an estimated 18% of the crappies were over 9 inches due to a big 2003 year class.  In 2001, 23% of the crappies exceeded 9 inches while in 1998, 54% were over 9 inches and in 1995, it was 40%. The modal length for the 2007 crappie sample was 7.5 to 8 inches which was likely due to a strong 2004 year class.   Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment with the age 2 fish displaying fast growth and the older fish normal growth.   <br> \n     White crappies are also present in Little Rock Lake.  Only one 9-inch white crappie was identified in the 2007 assessment while none were identified in the 2004 assessment.  The 2001 assessment captured 21 white crappies between 9 and 11 inches in length, 3 white crappies between 3 and 11 inches in 1998, and 40 white crappies between 7 and 11 inches in 1995.   <br> \n     The 2007 assessment netted 88 northern pike between 14 and 34 inches in length with a mean length of 22.6 inches and modal length of 20 - 21 inches with 31% of the pike exceeding 24 inches.  The 2007 assessment produced the highest spring northern pike catch for Little Rock Lake.  Ages 2 thru 9 were represented in the female pike sample with ages 2, 5, and 7 exhibiting fast growth and the remaining age groups normal growth.  The male portion of the sample was comprised of ages 1 thru 8 with only the age 1 fish displaying fast growth while the older fish showed normal growth.  The female northern pike grew from 3 to 6 inches longer than males of the same age.  Almost an equal number of male and female northern pike were caught in the assessment. <br> \n     Only 4 walleye were caught which was the lowest catch for spring assessments while the 2004 catch was the record at 89 walleye.  The fish measured from 10 to 26 inches while in 2004 they ranged from 7 to 21 inches in length.  A record number of largemouth bass (n=118) were netted in the 2007 assessment compared to an average of 3 bass in each of the previous surveys.  The bass ranged from 8 to 20 inches with a average length of 14 inches which suggests that  there have been numerous year classes represented in the catch.  With the broad connection to the Mississippi River, fish can move freely between the two bodies of water.  One species that is found in abundance in the river is smallmouth bass.  Only one smallmouth bass had been documented in the previous surveys (1998),  however, the 2007 assessment sampled five smallmouth bass between 13 and 15 inches in length.   <br> \n     The 2007 assessment produced the highest bluegill spring catch so far and they were the only sunfish species to be sampled with 106 fish being netted that measured from 4 to 10 inches in length.  Mean length for the catch was 6.5 inches with a modal length of 5.5 - 6 inches.  Bluegills exceeding 7 inches accounted for 30% (n=32) of the sample but only 8% (n=9) were more than 8 inches in length.  Ages 3 thru 5 were represented in the aged sample from the assessment with all of the age groups displaying fast growth.  A strong year class was produced in 2004 which accounted for almost 80% of the bluegill catch.  Bluegills and largemouth bass may be more prevalent due to increased vegetation growth of curly leaf pondweed.  No curly leaf or vegetation was found in Little Rock Lake in 2007 due to the turbidity of the water. <br> \n     The yellow perch catch (n=135) in 2007 was much less than the record catch of 3,254 in 2004.  The fish measured from 7 to 11 inches in length with most of the perch (70%) exceeding 9 inches in length.  Only one channel catfish (20-inch) was netted even though the lake has a healthy population.  Common carp and bigmouth buffalo made up much of the biomass in the 2007 assessment with 96 carp and 44 buffalo being caught.  Buffalo were not recorded in the 2004 assessment but carp were quite numerous with 408 being caught.  Little Rock Lake has a healthy population of white sucker with 190 being counted in the assessment.  Other catastomidae species caught were shorthead redhorse and silver redhorse.  All three species of bullheads were sampled with black bullheads being the most abundant.  A fair number of bowfin were seen in the 2007 assessment as 50 were netted in the overnight set.  One golden shiner and one trout-perch were also caught in the assessment. <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Fall night electrofishing was conducted for juvenile Walleye on Little Rock Lake in mid-September of 2015.  The timing of the electrofishing effort was set back about an hour while waiting for a  thunderstorm to pass through the area.  The first station was conducted along the east shore of the south basin due to moderate southeast winds.  Only one electrofishing station was completed and fish measured due to equipment issues. <br> \n    Little Rock Lake has a long history of Walleye stocking dating back to 1945 and continuing until 1991.  It was determined that natural reproduction along with the connection to the near-by Mississippi River was adequate to sustain the lake's Walleye population at levels which meet the management goals and angling pressure demands.  Electrofishing has been conducted periodically since 1996 with the current schedule being odd-numbered years.  While most electrofishing has been done at night, some daytime efforts were tried.  Past surveys on the lake have also noted the abundance of juvenile Walleye while electrofishing for county fair fish during the day, usually in the month of July. <br> \n    The 2015 night electrofishing effort produced a catch rate of 95 Walleye per hour for Little Rock Lake, the second highest catch recorded for the area office crew.  The 2013 assessment recorded a catch rate of 147/hour which indicates significant natural recruitment in recent years. Other nighttime catch rates have ranged from 2.4/hour in 1996 to 82/hour in 2001.  Daytime electrofishing for young of year Walleye was tried in both 2011 and 2008 under the assumption that the poor water clarity from annual summer algae blooms would encourage the juvenile fish to be shallow.  Those two efforts, however, produced some of the lower young of year Walleye catches for the lake, 6/hour in 2011 and 4/hour in 2008. <br> \n    The Walleye fingerlings caught in 2015 displayed better growth when compared to fingerlings caught in 2013.  The 2015 fingerlings ranged from 4.8 to 8 inches in length compared to 4.3 to 7 inches in 2013.  In 2013, 87% of the fingerlings were from 4.5 to 5.5 inches while in 2015, 44% of the fingerlings were more than seven inches in length.   <br> \n     An additional three Walleye between 12.6 and 15.6 inches were also netted during the 2015 electrofishing effort.  Also observed were an abundance of Trout Perch, shiners, and Yellow Perch.  A few Bluegill, small Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and White Sucker of various sizes were noted.  Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo were also present.   <br> \n    Nighttime electrofishing will continue to be used as the method for evaluating Walleye natural reproduction in Little Rock Lake as it appears to be more effective than daytime efforts.  Poor water clarity has been a common theme in all electrofishing efforts, both day and night, making capture and fish identification in the water difficult.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population of Little Rock Lake, with regard to selective net catch data and ecological lake classification can be described as follows:  The walleye net catch is low at 2.67/set, which is below the first quartile of 2.71/set.  There has been no \"real\" change in the population since the previous survey in 1985.  Mean fish size is within the normal range as is growth rate.  Age groups present in the sample include II, III, V, and VI.  The lake is stocked with fingerlings.  Natural reproduction has been documented by several checks during the 1980's.  The contribution of naturally reproduced fish to the fishery may be considerable, however, it has been difficult to assess.Northern pike show a \"real\" increase in numbers, though the net catch falls within the normal range.  Average size is large at 3.1 pounds, compared to 2.1 pounds in 1985.  Age groups II through VI are represented and growth rates are normal for all age groups.Yellow perch show a \"real\" decrease in numbers.  Although both numbers and mean size are normal for this lake class.  Age groups II, III, and IV are present in the sample and median length group is 7.0-7.4 inches.A significant population of white crappie is present in the lake.  The net catch (8.9/set) is many times higher than recorded in any previous survey.  The current population is considered average in numbers and mean size.  Mean weight is 0.23 pounds and median length group is 7.5-7.9 inches.  The 1988 year class dominates the catch comprising 93% of the sample.  The 1984 year class showed similar dominating characteristics, however, that group is no longer prevalent in the lake.The black crappie population is also dominated by the 1988 year class which makes up 79% of the net catch.  The population is considered normal in terms of number and mean size.  The black crappie net catch of 1.8/set is much lower than the white crappie catch indicating the predominance of the white crappie.  Black crappie display normal growth rates and mean weight is 0.24 pounds.Bluegill net catches increased to four times the 1985 catch, however, numbers are in the normal range.  Mean size is also normal and has changed little since 1985.  Several age groups up to age VII are present including seven hundred young-of-the-year captured during late summer seining.  Normal growth rates are evident in all groups.  Adult bluegill were stocked in 1986 and 1989 to augment the previous low population and stimulate natural reproduction.Other gamefish found in the net catches include largemouth bass (1 fish) and channel catfish (2 fish).  Largemouth bass populations are difficult to assess using lake survey gear and low catches may not alway indicate low numbers.A large variety of roughfish species are also present in the lake.  The common carp net catch doubled since 1985, but is still within the normal range.  Shorthead redhorse catches also doubled while silver redhorse numbers have remained stable.  White sucker numbers are high and the net catch increased 100% from 1985 levels.  Average white sucker is normal at 1.57 pounds.  Yellow, brown, and black bullheads are all present in low numbers for this lake class.  Bowfin are found in high numbers and average size is large.  Smallmouth buffalo were discovered in the net catch for the first time (5 fish) on record, while bigmouth buffalo were absent.</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south shore. Little Rock Lake has 10.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike. The lake was initially surveyed in 1960 and 26 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016 (targeted ice out survey for Northern Pike and Walleye). Fall night electrofishing has been completed on a biennial basis since 2006. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Rock to evaluate Walleye natural reproduction. The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 74.00 fish per hour. This was lower than in 2015 (95.20 fish per hour), and the lowest catch rate since 2011 (6.25 fish per hour). Catch rates in Little Rock have ranged from 5.29 to 147.08 fish per hour. Mean length of YOY Walleye was 6.12 inches. This was smaller than 2016 (6.64 inches), but similar to past surveys (5.23-6.74 inches).   <br> \nAn additional 33 age-1 and greater Walleye were also captured during the survey. The mean length of these fish was 13.53 inches and lengths ranged from 9.0 to 21.2 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Ice-out, or nearly after ice-out assessments targeting multiple species have been conducted on Little Rock Lake since 1995. In this assessment ten standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted on two consecutive days for a total of 20 lifts.  No aging structures were collected other than for Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \n     Excessive nutrient loading from a transformed and highly agricultural watershed, prompted area staff to consider more active approaches to reservoir management. To improve water quality, increase available fish habitat and offer additional erosion protection, a drawdown was completed August 1-September 15, 2019. Along with monitoring of plants and water quality data, increased frequency of fishery sampling has been scheduled. Electrofishing was conducted both during day and night hours, for multiple species following the drawdown and refill of Little Rock Lake. <br> \n <br> \n     The 2019 ice-out results indicated an average Black Crappie population for Little Rock Lake, as 71 crappie were sampled in two consecutive net lifts, during mid-April 2019. Length distribution was between 5.9 and 13.9 inches with a larger portion of fish between 11 and 11.5 inches. Previous age determination indicated Black Crappie grow well in Little Rock Lake, as average length at capture for five year old fish was near 10.2 inches. Age determination during 2019 incated results similar to previous efforts, although, individuals were present from ages ages 2 through 7 and ages 10 and 11. Stronger year classes were notoed for ages 3 (8.1 inches) and 6 11.4 Inches). Prior spring trapnet surveys have indicated a considerably more abundant population as 943 Black Crappie were sampled in 2016 between 3.2 and 13.9 inches, however, spring sampling can have variable catch rates. Black Crappie were also noted in both day and night (24, 3.5-9.7 inches) electrofishing efforts.  <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 91 Northern Pike with an average length of 22.7 inches and individuals between 8.8 and 34.1 inches. Pike recruitment has been variable on Little Rock Lake as access to appropriate wetland spawning habitats and in-lake vegetation is minimal.  Pike growth has been good as most fish tend to attain 24 inches by age three and can live for more than 10 years. The 2016 ice-out survey captured 43 pike between 9.8 and 36.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 13 Walleye between 10 and 19.9 inches. Prior surveys have indicated a slightly higher catch (2016 sampled 27), however, spring sampling results tend to be highly variable. Electrofishing both during daylight hours and at night indicated additional walleye recruitment and evidence of excellent natural reproduction. One hundred sixteen walleye were sampled during October night electrofishing. Individuals varied in length between 5.8 and 19.8 inches as several year classes appeared to be present. Young-of-year walleye catch rate was high, with 94.3 fingerlings per hour.   <br> \n  <br> \n     Bluegill were sampled in all efforts during 2019. During years of more abundant vegetation growth, Bluegill populations tend to respond favorably. Ice-out sampling captured 69 Bluegill between 5.6 and 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.7 Inches. During 2016 ice-out trapnetting, 274 Bluegill were sampled between 4.0 and 10.4 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. Catch rates during ice-out netting can be variable. Growth has been good as most Bluegill obtain catchable size by age 5-7. Bluegill were also sampled during day (27, 1.7-8.5 Inches) and night (28, 3.5-8.8 inches) electrofishing efforts following the drawdown in 2019.  <br> \n <br> \n     Electrofishing following the drawdown during daylight and evening hours sampled both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass during 2019. Twenty-four Largemouth Bass were sampled (42.5/hour) between 2.5 and 17.2 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Largemouth Bass were also sampled during ice-out trapnetting efforts in 2019, as 30 between 12.6 and 19.3 inches were measured. Smallmouth bass were not common, however, 10 were sampled (17.7/hour) between 4.5 and 18 inches with an average length of 11.8 inches. Bass tend to respond well to the presence of vegetation growth in the shallow areas of Little Rock Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n     Other species sampled during various methods in 2019 included Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, Silver Redhorse, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Common Shiner, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. Continued efforts to evaluate the fish community response to the drawdown is planned for 2020 with a standard mid-summer fishery survey.  Various vegetation and habitat monitoring will also be conducted.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ice-out, or nearly after ice-out assessments targeting multiple species have been conducted on Little Rock Lake since 1995. In this assessment ten standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted on two consecutive days for a total of 20 lifts.  No aging structures were collected other than for Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \n     Excessive nutrient loading from a transformed and highly agricultural watershed, prompted area staff to consider more active approaches to reservoir management. To improve water quality, increase available fish habitat and offer additional erosion protection, a drawdown was completed August 1-September 15, 2019. Along with monitoring of plants and water quality data, increased frequency of fishery sampling has been scheduled. Electrofishing was conducted both during day and night hours, for multiple species following the drawdown and refill of Little Rock Lake. <br> \n <br> \n     The 2019 ice-out results indicated an average Black Crappie population for Little Rock Lake, as 71 crappie were sampled in two consecutive net lifts, during mid-April 2019. Length distribution was between 5.9 and 13.9 inches with a larger portion of fish between 11 and 11.5 inches. Previous age determination indicated Black Crappie grow well in Little Rock Lake, as average length at capture for five year old fish was near 10.2 inches. Age determination during 2019 incated results similar to previous efforts, although, individuals were present from ages ages 2 through 7 and ages 10 and 11. Stronger year classes were notoed for ages 3 (8.1 inches) and 6 11.4 Inches). Prior spring trapnet surveys have indicated a considerably more abundant population as 943 Black Crappie were sampled in 2016 between 3.2 and 13.9 inches, however, spring sampling can have variable catch rates. Black Crappie were also noted in both day and night (24, 3.5-9.7 inches) electrofishing efforts.  <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 91 Northern Pike with an average length of 22.7 inches and individuals between 8.8 and 34.1 inches. Pike recruitment has been variable on Little Rock Lake as access to appropriate wetland spawning habitats and in-lake vegetation is minimal.  Pike growth has been good as most fish tend to attain 24 inches by age three and can live for more than 10 years. The 2016 ice-out survey captured 43 pike between 9.8 and 36.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 13 Walleye between 10 and 19.9 inches. Prior surveys have indicated a slightly higher catch (2016 sampled 27), however, spring sampling results tend to be highly variable. Electrofishing both during daylight hours and at night indicated additional walleye recruitment and evidence of excellent natural reproduction. One hundred sixteen walleye were sampled during October night electrofishing. Individuals varied in length between 5.8 and 19.8 inches as several year classes appeared to be present. Young-of-year walleye catch rate was high, with 94.3 fingerlings per hour.   <br> \n  <br> \n     Bluegill were sampled in all efforts during 2019. During years of more abundant vegetation growth, Bluegill populations tend to respond favorably. Ice-out sampling captured 69 Bluegill between 5.6 and 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.7 Inches. During 2016 ice-out trapnetting, 274 Bluegill were sampled between 4.0 and 10.4 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. Catch rates during ice-out netting can be variable. Growth has been good as most Bluegill obtain catchable size by age 5-7. Bluegill were also sampled during day (27, 1.7-8.5 Inches) and night (28, 3.5-8.8 inches) electrofishing efforts following the drawdown in 2019.  <br> \n <br> \n     Electrofishing following the drawdown during daylight and evening hours sampled both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass during 2019. Twenty-four Largemouth Bass were sampled (42.5/hour) between 2.5 and 17.2 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Largemouth Bass were also sampled during ice-out trapnetting efforts in 2019, as 30 between 12.6 and 19.3 inches were measured. Smallmouth bass were not common, however, 10 were sampled (17.7/hour) between 4.5 and 18 inches with an average length of 11.8 inches. Bass tend to respond well to the presence of vegetation growth in the shallow areas of Little Rock Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n     Other species sampled during various methods in 2019 included Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, Silver Redhorse, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Common Shiner, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. Continued efforts to evaluate the fish community response to the drawdown is planned for 2020 with a standard mid-summer fishery survey.  Various vegetation and habitat monitoring will also be conducted.  <br> \n</p>",

The lake typically has poor water clarity from algae growth which makes it possible to conduct electrofishing during the day.  Natural reproduction along with the connection to the near-by Mississippi River has been found to sustain the walleye population in the lake at levels which meet management goals and angling pressure demands.  Eight young of year walleye were captured in three stations over 1.3 hours of effort for a CPUE of 6.3/hour.  An additional nine older walleye were also netted.  The young of year walleye ranged from 5.3 to 6.9 inches in length while the older walleye were between 10.7 inches and 26.6 inches.   <br> \n     Eight of the older fish were found to be from 1 to 4 years of age.  The three younger year classes all showed fast growth while the age 4 walleye (n=1) displayed slow growth.  Half of the fish aged were from the 2010 year class. <br> \n     Daytime electrofishing was also conducted in September of 2008.  Four young of year walleye were netted in that effort with a CPUE of 3.6/hour.  Six night time electrofishing efforts were done between 1996 and 2009.    The lowest catch was 2.4/hour in 1996 and the highest 82/hour in 2001.  The other four catches averaged 22/hour.  The young of year walleye length range for most of the electrofishing catches were similar to that in 2011, however, the walleye fingerlings in 2009 displayed excellent growth with fingerlings measuring up to nine inches in length.  Growth was also good in 2001 when fingerlings up to 8.3 inches were measured. <br> \n      One of the past surveys noted that while electrofishing for county fair fish in the 1990's, usually in July, over 100 young of year walleye were netted.  Poor water clarity was a common theme in the majority of electrofishing efforts, both day and night, making netting and fish identification difficult.   <br> \n      Other fish species observed during the electrofishing runs were smallmouth bass adults, bluegill, young-of-year northern pike, largemouth bass, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, common shiner, bigmouth buffalo, trout perch, logperch, spottail shiner, yellow perch, and common carp.</p>",

The lake had a long history of walleye stocking which began in 1908.  The practice was discontinued in 1990 when it was determined that enough natural reproduction was occurring to maintain the population at management goal levels.  One electrofishing run was made along the north shore of main basin and another split run done around a point and rock reef in the main basin as well as the channel under the Highway 10 bridge.  Only 6 young-of-year walleye were netted suggesting limited natural reproduction in 2006.   Eleven other walleye of various sizes were also netted during the 1.1 hour of on-time.  The highest young-of-year catch rate (153/hr) was recorded in 1996 while 2006 was the lowest.  The average catch rate of the assessments from 1996 to 2001 was about 46/hour. <br> \n    Water clarity has typically been poor while doing the elecrofishing which affects netting success and fish identification.  Daytime electrofishing has also proven successful in the past as a catch rate of over 100 per hour was produced in the 1990's although night electrofishing over all has produced more consistent catches.  The daytime assessments have usually occurred in conjunction with the collection of county fair display fish. <br> \n    Some other fish species that were observed during the 2006 night electrofishing effort were both largemouth and smallmouth bass, black crappies, yellow perch, bluegill, northern pike, buffalo, carp, white sucker,  trout perch, and various shiner species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Rock Lake to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance from natural reproduction on 30 August 2021. A total of 28 young of the year Walleye were captured in 1.23 hours of EF on time for a catch rate of 22.68/hour.  The 2021 catch rate was at the low end of the range observed in previous fall EF assessments. Walleye captured ranged from 5.0 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.4 inches in total length.  Mean lengths of young of the year Walleye measured in previous assessments ranged from 5.2 (2013) to 6.9 (2019) inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing catch rates have corresponded very well with gill net catches suggesting it is a very good indicator of future recruitment to the fishery.  One exception was the very high fall electrofishing catch rate of 147.1/hour in 2013.  No yearling fish were caught in the 2014 summer gillnet survey.  It is possible that due to the summer survey occurring in June, yearling Walleye were still too small to be captured in gillnets.  Age seven Walleye were represented in the summer gillnet survey in 2020 however, suggesting the 2013 year class was present but not sampled in 2014.  In general, fall EF YWAE catch rates over 30/hour correspond to future gillnet catch rates over 2/net for that year class.  No complete recruitment failures have been evident in the lake's history and catch rates over 30/hour have been exceeded in all other past efforts since 2013.  Other species sampled during the survey included Largemouth Bass (many young of year), Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch (all sizes). <br> \n</p>",

Along with monitoring of plants and water quality data, increased frequency of fishery sampling has been scheduled. Electrofishing was conducted both during day and night hours, for multiple species following the drawdown and refill of Little Rock Lake. <br> \n <br> \n     The 2019 ice-out results indicated an average Black Crappie population for Little Rock Lake, as 71 crappie were sampled in two consecutive net lifts, during mid-April 2019. Length distribution was between 5.9 and 13.9 inches with a larger portion of fish between 11 and 11.5 inches. Previous age determination indicated Black Crappie grow well in Little Rock Lake, as average length at capture for five year old fish was near 10.2 inches. Age determination during 2019 incated results similar to previous efforts, although, individuals were present from ages ages 2 through 7 and ages 10 and 11. Stronger year classes were notoed for ages 3 (8.1 inches) and 6 11.4 Inches). Prior spring trapnet surveys have indicated a considerably more abundant population as 943 Black Crappie were sampled in 2016 between 3.2 and 13.9 inches, however, spring sampling can have variable catch rates. Black Crappie were also noted in both day and night (24, 3.5-9.7 inches) electrofishing efforts.  <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 91 Northern Pike with an average length of 22.7 inches and individuals between 8.8 and 34.1 inches. Pike recruitment has been variable on Little Rock Lake as access to appropriate wetland spawning habitats and in-lake vegetation is minimal.  Pike growth has been good as most fish tend to attain 24 inches by age three and can live for more than 10 years. The 2016 ice-out survey captured 43 pike between 9.8 and 36.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n     Ice-out trapnets sampled 13 Walleye between 10 and 19.9 inches. Prior surveys have indicated a slightly higher catch (2016 sampled 27), however, spring sampling results tend to be highly variable. Electrofishing both during daylight hours and at night indicated additional walleye recruitment and evidence of excellent natural reproduction. One hundred sixteen walleye were sampled during October night electrofishing. Individuals varied in length between 5.8 and 19.8 inches as several year classes appeared to be present. Young-of-year walleye catch rate was high, with 94.3 fingerlings per hour.   <br> \n  <br> \n     Bluegill were sampled in all efforts during 2019. During years of more abundant vegetation growth, Bluegill populations tend to respond favorably. Ice-out sampling captured 69 Bluegill between 5.6 and 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.7 Inches. During 2016 ice-out trapnetting, 274 Bluegill were sampled between 4.0 and 10.4 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. Catch rates during ice-out netting can be variable. Growth has been good as most Bluegill obtain catchable size by age 5-7. Bluegill were also sampled during day (27, 1.7-8.5 Inches) and night (28, 3.5-8.8 inches) electrofishing efforts following the drawdown in 2019.  <br> \n <br> \n     Electrofishing following the drawdown during daylight and evening hours sampled both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass during 2019. Twenty-four Largemouth Bass were sampled (42.5/hour) between 2.5 and 17.2 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Largemouth Bass were also sampled during ice-out trapnetting efforts in 2019, as 30 between 12.6 and 19.3 inches were measured. Smallmouth bass were not common, however, 10 were sampled (17.7/hour) between 4.5 and 18 inches with an average length of 11.8 inches. Bass tend to respond well to the presence of vegetation growth in the shallow areas of Little Rock Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n     Other species sampled during various methods in 2019 included Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, Silver Redhorse, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Common Shiner, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. Continued efforts to evaluate the fish community response to the drawdown is planned for 2020 with a standard mid-summer fishery survey.  Various vegetation and habitat monitoring will also be conducted.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rock Lake (DOW# 05-0013-00; Lake Class 41) is a 1,310-acre lake located near Rice, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the south Shore west of Highway 10. Little Rock Lake has 10.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. Little Rock Lake is in Lake Class 41. Lakes in this class are generally very large, shallow, have a very high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have very hard water, high turbidity, and are an irregular shape. Primary management species on Little Rock Lake include Walleye and Black Crappie, Secondary management species includes Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye stockings may have occurred prior to accurate record keeping, historical records show Walleye stocking beginning on Little Rock Lake in 1945 and ending in 1990. Stocking consisted primarily of fingerling and yearling Walleye. Due to the documentation of natural reproduction in 1991, stocking was discontinued to observe whether population management goals could be met through natural reproduction. No stocking has been needed since stocking was terminated. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing has been utilized annually to assess natural reproduction of Walleye on Little Rock Lake. Sampling in 2023 was conducted on September 6, and effort totaled 1.0 hour of electrofishing on-time. A total of 40 young of the year Walleye were captured during the assessment for a catch rate of 40.0/hour which was above the median (30.0/hour). Catch rates from previous fall electrofishing surveys have ranged from 3.6/hour in 2008 to 147.1/hour in 2013. Young of the year Walleye sampled in 2023 ranged from 4.5 to 8.9 inches and averaged 7.1 inches, which was larger than the average (6.0 inches) calculated since 1997. Sampling conditions in 2023 were challenging with heavy algae blooms present which made it difficult to see fish, a condition not uncommon during fall assessments. Catch rates were probably negatively impacted due to poor visibility and would probably have been higher with clearer water conditions. Moderate fall young of the year Walleye catch rates have produced good future year classes in the past on Little Rock Lake. The catch rate (40.0/hour) of juvenile Walleye observed in 2023 suggests a good year class was produced and should contribute to good angling opportunities in a few years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species commonly observed during the assessment included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, Trout-perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. Additional information can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rock Lake is a large, shallow, fertile lake.  Champion Paper Company's damat Sartell effects water levels and the rate of flow through the system.  The lakehas an extensive watershed, approximately 68,000 acres, with land use that ispredominantly agricultural.  Summer algae blooms caused by excess phosphorus haveoccurred in Little Rock Lake for years.  The Mississippi River connection and thelake's water quality influence the species composition in the lake.  Lack ofvegetation and turbid water makes the lake poorly suited to largemouth bass andbluegill.  Little Rock Lake has been a noted walleye and crappie fishery in centralMinnesota.  The primary gamefish species, (walleye, northern pike, black crappies,and yellow perch), showed population increases in the summer survey.  The mostabundant walleye size group sampled was 16 - 17 inches in length, however fish upto 27 inches were caught.  Natural reproduction has been successful at maintainingthe population and meeting fishing pressure demands.  Winter angling for blackcrappies has been popular on the lake.  Size varies depending on year classstrengths entering the population susceptible to angling.  A winter creel conductedin the '95 - '96 season showed the average size kept by anglers to be 10 - 12inches.  White crappies are also present in the lake, although their numbers havenot been as abundant as the black crappies.  Anglers reported good fishing fornorthern pike in 1995 and 1996.  Five to ten pound pike were common with fish upto 38 inches reported.  The summer survey showed an average size of 21 - 22 inches,however five northern over 30 inches were also sampled.  Yellow perch numbers werehigh for the lake and fish ranged in size from 5 to 10.6 inches in length.  Perchare an important food fish for the walleye and northern pike.  Bluegill numbers arelow, however, fish up to nine inches were observed.  Largemouth bass and channelcatfish are present, but the populations are difficult to assess with survey gear. Roughfish such as bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, bowfin, carp, shortheadredhorse, and white suckers are major components in the fish community.  Whitesuckers were the most numerous roughfish sampled in the summer survey.  Carp andbuffalo populations are also difficult to assess with lake survey gear.  Numerouscarp are seen in shallow bays and streams in late spring.  Shorthead redhorse andblack bullhead numbers suggest low abundance, while bowfin abundance appear to benormal for the lake.If improved water quality is a desired goal for Little Rock Lake, best land usemanagement practices will need to be implemented in the watershed.  Reestablishingvegetation in the lake basin would provide fish habitat, slow shoreline erosion,and help water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Being the largest of the two lakes in Benton County, Little Rock Lake has high value both as recreational water and shoreline development.  Little Rock has a wide connection to the Mississippi River and the International Paper Company's dam at Sartell effects water levels and the rate of flow through the system.  The lake is relatively shallow being only about 17 feet deep with much of the shoreline sand.  The lake has an extensive watershed, approximately 68,000 acres, with land use that is predominantly agricultural.  Summer algae blooms resulting in secchi disk reading as low as 1.5 feet and advisorys against swimming being common.  The combination of poor water clarity, carp, and wave action prevents much vegetative growth in the lake.  The Mississippi River connection and the lake's water quality influence the fish species composition in the lake.  Lack of vegetation and turbid water makes the lake poorly suited to largemouth bass and bluegill.    Little Rock Lake receives heavy winter and spring fishing pressure for walleye and black crappies.  Walleye natural reproduction has been successful at maintaining the population and meeting fishing pressure demands.  The most abundant walleye size group seen in the survey was 14 to 16 inches, however larger fish over 25 inches were caught.  Black crappie angler success depends on year class strength of the fish susceptible to angling and acceptable to the fisherman.  Two size groups were dominant in the summer survey, 4.5 - 5.5 inches and 9.5 - 10.5 inches, suggesting crappie fishing could be good this winter and in another 2 years.  White crappies are also present in the lake, although they are not as abundant as the black crappies.    Northern pike numbers showed a significant increase from the last survey and anglers could have more action from this species.  The size range seen in this survey was not as impressive or desirable as the previous survey, however, the average size was not bad at 2.5 pounds.  Over a quarter of the pike caught in the survey were over 24 inches in length and several were over 30 inches.  One negative change seen in the survey was the decrease in yellow perch numbers.  This may have been a result of the higher pike population and could effect the growth of the gamefish as perch can be an important food species for northern pike and walleye.  Most of the perch seen in the survey were between 5 and 8 inches, a good size for gamefish, but usually considered too small for anglers.  Many substitute prey species such as trout perch, shiners, small suckers, and redhorse are available due to the river connection.    Although the 2002 bluegill catch was a record high for the lake anglers will have to work to find the fish.  For those willing to put the time and effort into seeking bluegills the return could be worth it.  Average size of the bluegills seen in the survey was 6.5 inches with several individuals over 9 inches measured.  One of the biggest changes seen in the lake was the increase in catfish numbers.  Size of the catfish ranged from 13 to 29 inches with many of them over 24 inches in length.    Roughfish such as bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, carp, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, and white suckers are major components of the fish community.  White suckers were the most numerous roughfish sampled in the summer survey.  Although most of the suckers were over 12 inches in length, smaller suckers were also seen in good numbers suggesting another food source for the larger gamefish.  Carp can provide an additional sport fishery, whether it be angling or archery.  Lake survey nets are typically not effective at catching carp, however, the fish seen in the survey were impressive with many of them over 26 inches.  The largest carp caught was about 32 inches or around 15 pounds.  Black bullheads were the most abundant of the three bullhead species which is indicative of the water quality.  Black bullheads are more tolerant of poor water quality.    Improving the water quality in Little Rock Lake has been a goal of the lakeshore owners as well as local government and state agencies.  Work has been done with landowners in the watershed to reduce nutrient run-off to streams feeding the lake.  A study was conducted in 2001 by the Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District documenting the lake bottom type, water moving into and out of the lake, and vegetative cover and/or culture practices on the lakeshore.  This study was to begin planning for a process to identify problem sources for the lake.  Reestablishing vegetation in the lake basin would provide fish habitat, slow shoreline erosion, and help improve water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tFall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Rock Lake in late September to evaluate the success of walleye natural reproduction.  Natural reproduction and the connection to the Mississippi River has been found to sustain the walleye population in Little Rock Lake at levels which can meet the management goals for the lake.  Water clarity on the night of the electrofishing was poor which made fish identification and netting difficult.   Twelve young of the year walleye were captured in just over an hour of on-time for a catch rate of 11.6/hour in the 2009 natural reproduction check.  The runs were at various locations around the lake mostly on sand substrates.  Four adult walleye between 13.6 and 18.1 inches in length were also netted. <br> \n\tDaytime electrofishing was conducted in 2008 for young of the year walleye.  Only four young walleye were captured which was the second lowest catch since 1996 when two young of the year walleye were netted.  The catch rate between 1997 and 2001, three night electrofishing assessments, averaged 51/hour.  A night assessment in 2006 captured six young walleye or 5.3/hour.  Daytime electrofishing for county fair fish in the 1990's has produced young of the year walleye catches of over 100 per hour .  <br> \n\tOther fish species caught included trout perch, spottail shiners, yellow perch, white sucker, black crappie, common carp, northern pike, bigmouth buffalo, and bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Little Rock Lake is the largest lake in Benton County.  Though large and close to a major metropolitan area, the lake's development and recreational value has been limited by poor water quality. Severe algal blooms have historically occurred in mid to late summer, which affect both the recreational value and fish community diversity.  At the time of the 2014 survey in mid-June the secchi disk reading was 4.1 feet which was better than usual for the time of year.  Little Rock Lake is a popular destination when Walleye season opens but by early June, few boats are found on the lake after algal blooms begin. The lake likely receives more fishing pressure during the winter season than summer.  <br> \n       The lake has limited vegetation due to poor water clarity.  Four feet was the deepest any vegetation was found to grow.   Filamentous algae was more common than any aquatic plant species when documenting vegetation diversity in August.   The most common shallow water substrate was sand.   <br> \n       A broad connection to the Mississippi River has some influence on the fish species composition in the lake as many of the species found are associated with riverine conditions.  Lack of vegetation and turbid water make the lake less suitable for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Due to its shallow nature, Little Rock is one of the first lakes to freeze over in the area and fishermen are quick to take advantage of this targeting Walleye and Black Crappie.  Little Rock also warms up rapidly in the spring making it a good season opener destination.  Walleye natural reproduction maintains the population in the lake and for the most part has been successful at meeting fishing pressure demands.  The Walleye gill net catch rate was below management goals and low when compared to similar type lakes.  Occasional strong year classes appear to sustain the Black Crappie population.  Most crappie caught in surveys and reported \"hot bites\" are of similar sized fish.  The Northern Pike catch was also low when compared to similar type lakes and most of the fish caught in the survey were small by most anglers' standards.  An occasional large pike is caught in spring sampling and ice fishing also. <br> \n      Channel Catfish are quite common and averaged 21 inches or about four pounds in the survey and are rarely targeted by anglers.  All three species of bullhead are known to inhabit Little Rock Lake.  Brown and Yellow Bullhead were the two species caught in the 2014 survey and abundance appears to be low for both.   Species in the sucker family found in Little Rock Lake are White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and Bigmouth Buffalo.  Common Carp were also caught in the summer survey and abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Carp bowfishing has become increasingly popular and Little Rock Lake has an abundance of shallow flats to accommodate the sport. Yellow Perch numbers showed a significant improvement from the last survey.  Although most anglers consider perch to be nuisance when fishing, the species can be an important food species for most game fish.       <br> \n        Improving the water quality in Little Rock Lake has been a goal of an active lake association as well as local government and state agencies. Work has been done with landowners in the watershed to reduce nutrient run-off to streams feeding the lake. The Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District is conducting a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) study on the lake to identify nutrient sources and needed remedies. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     An ice-out assessment was conducted on Little Rock Lake to evaluate changes in the Black Crappie population.  An extended period of below average Spring temperatures in 2013 lead to late ice-outs and kept water temperatures from warming up in lakes.   The Black Crappie assessment in 2013 was conducted in early May compared to mid-April for most of the previous crappie assessments.  Water temperature was 54 degrees when nets were set.  The cooler spring conditions were likely responsible for the lowest number of Black Crappie caught of the six crappie assessments conducted since 1995.   <br> \n     A total of 85 Black Crappies (8.5/TN) were netted in 2013, less than the 303 caught in 2007 (30.3/TN) and 1,429 (142.9/TN) caught with the same amount of effort in 2004, ten trap nets.  While the 2013 assessment produced the lowest number of crappie, the lowest catch rate was 5.1/trap net in 1998.   <br> \n     Several favorable size structure characteristics were evident in the2013 assessment.  Black Crappies between 3.4 and 11.7 inches were caught in 2013 with a mean length of 9.7 inches and modal length of 9.5 - 10 inches for the sample.  Fish that exceeded nine inches accounted for 88% (n=75) of the catch with 39% (n=33) exceeding ten inches, and 18% (n=15) more than eleven inches in length.   <br> \n     The largest Black Crappie, 14.2 inches, was caught in 2007; however, the mean length for the sample was 8.6 inches and modal length, 7.5 - 8 inches.  Mean length has ranged from 7.5 inches in 2004 to 8.7 inches in 2001.  Fish exceeding nine inches comprised 34% of the 2007 sample while in 2004, only about 18% of the fish were more than nine inches.  In 2001, 23% of the fish exceeded nine inches with 54% in 1998, and 40% in 1995.  Crappie exceeding eleven inches in length have comprised from 0.4% (2001) to 3% (2007) of the samples from earlier netting efforts.  Three of the six spring trap net assessments have met the lake management goal of 40% of spring Black Crappie exceed nine inches in length, 2013, 1998, and 1995. <br> \n     Ages 1 through 9 were represented in the 2013 ice-out assessment crappie sample.  Two year classes, 2009 and 2008, dominated the crappie catch, comprising 45% and 59% of the sample, respectively.  Growth appeared fast for ages 1 through 5 and normal for the older age groups when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table. <br> \n     The spring ice-out assessments have also presented opportunities to catch other fish species of interest although catches have not been consistent between the assessments.  Walleye catches have ranged from four (2007) to 89 fish (2004) and Northern Pike from nine (1995) to 88 fish (2007).  In three of the assessments, fingerling Walleye were caught and in the remaining three assessments, yearlings were the youngest Walleye.   <br> \n     Ages 3 through 10 and 12 were represented in the 2013 Walleye catch indicating consistent recruitment.  The two most prominent year classes were 2009 and 2008, each contributing 21% of the sample.  Surprisingly all of the Walleye caught were females with age 3, 7, 8, and 12 exhibiting normal growth and the remaining age groups fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table. <br> \n     Thirty-one Northern Pike (3.1/TN) were netted in the 2013 ice-out assessment.  The fish ranged from 16 to 32 inches in length with a mean length of 23.3 inches for the sample.  Pike exceeding twenty-four inches accounted for 39% (n=12) of the catch with 10% (n=30) more than thirty inches in length.  Some nice Northern Pike were observed in all of the crappie assessments with the largest being 37.7 inches in 2004.  Pike exceeding 30 inches were caught in all past assessments.  \t  <br> \n     Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the 2013 Northern Pike sample.  The strongest year class in the catch was from the 2008 year class which comprised 41% (n=13) of the sample.  Fourteen of the fish were females and fifteen males.  Age 3 females showed fast growth while the remaining age groups of both sexes exhibited normal growth when compared to the Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  After age 3 the females were from 1.8 to 5.2 inches longer than males of the same age. <br> \n      Largemouth Bass have not typically been sampled in a significant numbers in the spring trap nets as Little Rock Lake is not considered a bass lake.  Usually fewer than eight bass have been caught in spring assessments; seven between 14.5 and 18.2 inches were netted in 2013.  Five of the fish (71%) were more than sixteen inches in length.  The exception to that observation, however, was in 2007 when 118 Largemouth Bass were sampled.  Medium sized fish dominated the 2007 catch with 67% (n=79) between 12 and 16 inches in length.  Fifteen of the bass were more than 16 inches in length with the largest being 20.2 inches.    The bass population explosion may have been related to the availability of vegetated habitat when extensive curled pondweed growth occurred in 2004.   <br> \n      Ages 8 through 10, 12, and 13 were represented in the 2013 Largemouth Bass catch.  Ages 8 through 10 showed normal growth and the older bass slow growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  <br> \n      Bluegill are usually sampled in relatively low numbers in Little Rock Lake.  The highest catch in a spring assessment was 106 Bluegill in 2007 and the lowest two in 2001.  The 37 Bluegill caught in the 2013 crappie assessment ranged from 4.6 to 9 inches in length with a mean length of 7.4 inches for the sample.  Fish exceeding seven inches accounted for 76% (n=28) of the sample with 32% (N=12) more than eight inches in length.  Bluegill in the 2007 assessment measured from 4.3 to 9.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 6.5 inches and modal length 5.5 - 6 inches.   The dominant year class in the sample came from 2004 (36%) which corresponded with the summer of dense vegetation growth.   A ten-inch Bluegill was sampled in the 2004 spring assessment.    <br> \n     Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the 2013 Bluegill catch with all the age groups displaying fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  One year class (2008) accounted for 59% (n=22) of catch. <br> \n     Numerous species of roughfish are present in Little Rock Lake and those catches have also varied greatly in the spring assessments.   The lowest Common Carp catch was three fish in 1998 and the highest 408 in 2004.  The highest Black Bullhead count was in 2007 at 242 but three of the spring assessment recorded no Black Bullhead including 2013.  The record catch of Bigmouth Buffalo was also in 2007, n= 44, but other assessments had from zero to seven buffalo recorded.  White Sucker have accounted for a significant portion of the catch in three of the six spring assessments with between 131 to 190 fish being caught.  Only 30 fish were caught in 2013 which was the lowest.  Channel Catfish have not been plentiful in the crappie assessments.  The highest catch was five in the 2013 assessment while one fish was caught in three of the five previous assessments. <br> \n     The highest Yellow Perch catch was 3,254 in 2004.  Other catch rates have ranged from 36 (2001) to 732 (1998) with 69 in 2013.  Although no Smallmouth Bass were caught in the 2013 crappie assessment, they were recorded in the 2007 (n=5) and 1998 (n=1) assessments.  The most unusual catch was a Brown Trout in 1998. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey using 11 gill nets was completed on July 13-17, 2020. Fisheries of significance include Walleye, Channel Catfish, Black Crappie, and to a lesser extent, Northern Pike. Little Rock Lake continues to exhibit a fish community typical of a high-nutrient reservoir lacking extensive beds of vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 189 Walleyes were captured in 2020, the most ever collected since surveys began in 1974. Walleye abundance is being sustained by natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking is necessary. Little Rock's Walleye population can be looked at in an interesting timeline: years prior to 2002, five separate surveys captured Walleyes at a median rate of 3.1 fish/gill net. In survey years following 2002 to today, Walleye catch rates have essentially doubled to a median of 6.0 fish/gill net. The current Walleye catch rate for fish 10 inches and larger is 14.8 fish/gill net. The majority of fish caught were 14-15 inches and 2-3 years old. In-lake habitat conditions are improving and may be a reason for the population upswing. A similar occurrence is happening with Channel Catfish. The population appears to be expanding dramatically from what it was in the early 2000s. At this time, catfish numbers are abundant, and average about 22 inches in length with large individuals exceeding 27 inches. Channel catfish are an excellent sport fish; are hard fighters and can be good eating.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also caught during the survey but their numbers are low relative to other Area lakes. Because pike reproduce well and have voracious appetites, lower presence often means that other species can do better. The largest pike sampled in 2020 was just under 30 inches, however fish in the 30-36 inch range have been observed in past assessments.  Pike prefer clear-water lakes with abundant vegetation so habitat in Little Rock is not ideal at this time.  <br> \n <br> \nBecause this survey used gill nets only, species such as Bluegill and Black Crappie were not effectively sampled. However, spring trap netting in the past indicates that both species are present, with Black Crappie the more abundant of the two. Over 70% of the crappie caught in the 2020 gill nets were 9 inches or larger. No Bluegill were captured in gill nets in 2020 however Bluegills (some >10 inches) have been measured in past spring trap net assessments.  Similar to other sunfish, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are not effectively sampled by gill nets but are included in compendium reports summarizing electrofishing results for various years when sampling occurred. The lack of extensive beds of vegetation is a limiting factor in terms of habitat for species such as Bluegill and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Rock Lake received a drawdown from August 1 through September 19, 2019. Maximum pool-drop was 2.8 feet and a pool elevation of about nine feet (from about 11.6 feet) was maintained for a period of four weeks. Visible improvements in water clarity were reported following pool re-fill. Water clarity measurements ranged from 5.0 to 8.6 feet from late September 2019 to October 2020. Early indications are that aquatic vegetation, whether planted during the drawdown or naturally germinated as a result of the drawdown, has been noticeably more extensive and abundant.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Little Rock Lake is the largest lake in Benton County.  Though large, its development and recreational value has been limited by poor water quality.  The lake has a history of severe algae blooms in mid to late summer, which affect both the recreational value and the fish community.  At the time of the 2009 survey in mid-June the secchi disk reading was 1.5 feet and the water looked like pea-soup.  Algae coated the survey nets which likely affected the efficiency of the nets.  Little Rock Lake is a popular destination when walleye season opens but by early June, few boats are found on the lake after algae blooms begin.  The lake likely receives more fishing pressure during winter rather than summer.  A wide connection to the Mississippi River has some influence on the fish species composition in the lake.  Lack of vegetation and the turbid water make the lake less suitable for largemouth bass and bluegill. <br> \n       Black crappie, channel catfish, and white sucker were the most numerous fish species sampled in the 2009 summer survey.   In winter, Little Rock Lake is a popular crappie fishing lake.  Most of the crappie in the 2009 summer survey, however, were less than 9 inches in length, but by winter the fish may have reached a size acceptable to anglers.    Occasional strong year classes appear to sustain the crappie population as most of the fish looked to be from the 2005 year class.  The channel catfish caught in the survey averaged about 22 inches or 4 pounds and abundance has remained about the same since the last survey in 2002.  All white sucker caught were over 15 inches in length.  Other species in the sucker family found in Little Rock Lake are shorthead redhorse and silver redhorse.  Common carp and bigmouth buffalo were also caught in the summer survey and abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   Carp bowfishing has become increasingly popular and Little Rock Lake has an abundance of shallow flats to accommodate the sport.  <br> \n       Catches of many of the species was low due to netting conditions.  Walleye natural reproduction has been successful at maintaining the population and meeting fishing pressure.   The low walleye catch may have been due to the natural fluctuation of reproduction success  and poor netting conditions as most of the walleye in the 2009 survey came from the 2005 year class with only a few from other year classes.  The northern pike catch was down from the previous survey but a range of sizes was documented.  Although the average size in the survey was 24 inches or 3 pounds, past surveys have caught fish over 36 inches.  Yellow perch also showed a drop in abundance with the catch being the lowest to date for Little Rock Lake, and below the normal range for similar type lakes.  Although perch can be an important prey species for walleye and northern pike, there are likely enough other prey species like white sucker that have filled that niche.   <br> \n       All three species of bullhead were caught in Little Rock Lake, but abundance appears to be low for all three.   The black bullhead, which tend to be more tolerant of turbid water, were the most numerous of the three species.   <br> \n       Improving the water quality in Little Rock Lake has been a goal of an active lake association as well as local government and state agencies.  Work has been done with landowners in the watershed to reduce nutrient run-off to streams feeding the lake.  The Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District is conducting a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) study on the lake to identify nutrient sources and needed remedies. <br> \n</p>",
