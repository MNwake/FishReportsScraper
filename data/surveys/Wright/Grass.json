The Clearwater River flows into the Mississippi River at the town of Clearwater, past a larger dam that is a barrier to fish movement.  The watershed is large and dominated by agriculture.  The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. This is the first survey since 2005. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation was abundant; cattail and white waterlily were the dominant species along shore.  No submergent plant survey was done in 2014, but coontail, chara, and northern milfoil were predominant in 2005 and submerged vegetation was abundant in 2014.  Eurasian watermilfoil was not found in the 2005 survey, but is now widespread in Clearwater Lake and likely exists in Grass Lake.  Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 7.0 feet in August 2014. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were similar between 2014 and 2005 and remained within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Grass Lake.  Northern Pike in 2014 ranged in length from 15.0 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Although catch rates were similar, only 11% of Northern Pike in 2014 were longer than 24 inches versus 28% in 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were surveyed in May by daytime boat electrofishing.  The catch rate was well below the Montrose Area average.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 9.2 to 18.4 inches with an average length of 13.6 inches.  Of the catchable size fish (> 8 inches) caught, 46% were longer than 15 inches; however, only 11 fish were captured. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was lower than 2005, but still in the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.4 to 8.4 inches; average length and weight were 5.1 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Black Crappie were caught in low numbers (below the expected range) in 2014 and catch rates in 2005 were similarly low.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 7.5 to 10.0 inches with an average length and weight of 9.3 inches and 0.52 pounds.  Only seven Black Crappie were caught in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nOne Walleye was captured in the survey; Walleye are stocked in Clearwater Lake and some likely migrate to Grass Lake.  Only one Yellow Perch was sampled; Yellow Perch catches have been very low since the 1985 survey.  Other species captured included: Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grass Lake is an 89 acre lake located four miles north of Annandale.  The lake is part of the Clearwater River system, and has 2.4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  During early August 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen for fish present to a depth of 13 feet.  The lakeshore is developed with 43 homes and cabins concentrated on the west side of the lake, as well as a nine cabin resort. Twenty-nine aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  Public access to the lake is available via the Clearwater River from Clearwater Lake.Grass Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and receives moderate fishing pressure.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Walleye are all present in the lake.  In a lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997, test netting revealed the following information about the fish population.The Northern Pike catch rate was 19.3/gill net, which was higher than expected for lakes similar to Grass.  This catch rate was higher than the 1991 survey catch of 5.3/gill net.  The average Northern Pike weighed 1.3 pounds and was 18.1 inches long, which was smaller than expected for similar lakes.  Pike growth was average compared to other populations in the state.  Gill net catch of Walleye (0.7/gill net) was in the expected range for this lake type.  Walleye averaged 1.2 pounds and 17.7 inches long, which was smaller than expected for similar lakes. Trap net catch of Black Crappie (1.3/trap net) was below the expected level.  Black Crappie ranged from 6.7 to 10.3 inches and averaged 10.3 inches.  Growth rates were average, with Black Crappie typically reaching 8 inches in 4 years.  Bluegill catch rate (10.8/trap net) was in the expected range as it was in previous surveys.  The average size Bluegill was 4.9 inches and they ranged from 2.8-8.3 inches long.  Bluegill reproduction and growth were good, and the average Bluegill reached 6 inches by age 4. No Largemouth Bass were caught in trap nets, but they are difficult to capture in trap nets, so this is not unusual.  Largemouth Bass are abundant throughout the Clearwater River lakes.  Grass Lake has good spawning habitat and young bass were present in shoreline seine samples.</p>",

Northern Pike were average in abundance (5.3/gill net) but size was small (1.6 pounds). Given that growth rates were average, the small size is due to the age composition of the catch; only Northern Pike of ages 2, 3, and 4 were present in gill nets.  Only three Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets, all in the 6-6.9 inch length group.  Numbers were lower than average for this lake class.  Walleye appeared in gill nets this year after being absent from 1985 survey nets.  The catch rate (2.0/gill net) and average size (1.6 pounds) were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Grass.  Walleye lengths from gill nets ranged from 12-19.9 inches, with ages 2, 4, 5, and 6 present.  Two Walleye in the 22 inch length group were caught in trap nets. Growth rates were average. \n\nImportant species caught in trap nets included Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Black Bullhead catch rates were average (2.2/trap net), but size was large (0.8 pounds).  Lengths ranged from 7.5-12.9 inches. Yellow Bullhead were abundant (10.0/trap net) with an average size of 0.6 pounds.  Pumpkinseed and Bluegill were both present in average numbers.  Pumpkinseed ranged from 3.0-6.9 inches with an average length in the 4.0-4.4 inch group. The average length group of Bluegill was 5.0-5.4 inches, and lengths ranged from 2.5-7.9 inches.  Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 1.0/trap net.  Ages I, 2, and 4 were present.  Lengths ranged from 5.5-12.9 inches and growth was average.  Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 3.0/trap net, which was within the expected range for lakes similar to Grass.  Average size was 0.2 pounds.  Lengths of Black Crappies were evenly distributed from 4.0-7.9 inches, and one ten inch crappie was caught.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grass Lake is accessible via navigable channel from Clearwater Lake.  It has no other public access.   From an angling standpoint Grass Lake is interesting to explore.  It is not as heavily developed and the east side is fringed with cattails.  Water depths drop off quickly from the shoreline.  For some reason Eurasian water milfoil has not colonized Grass Lake even though it is present in Clearwater and Augusta Lakes.In  2005 all the lakes of the Clearwater Chain were surveyed including Louisa-Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater and Grass.  The lake surveys included electrofishing for largemouth bass, trap and gill nets, and various measurements of the biological, chemical and physical communities.Largemouth Bass Sampling largemouth bass abundance was not accomplished, however, it is thought that the largemouth population is similar to Clearwater Lake.  Largemouth bass were sampled by evening electrofishing on Clearwater Lake at a rate nearly 1.5 times the median for Montrose area lakes.   Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), 45 percent were greater than 12 inches.  The average length oflargemouth bass sampled was 11.2 inches, while the largest bass sampled was 20.1 inches.  Approximately 10 bass tournaments are conducted each year on Augusta, Clearwater, Grass and Otter Lakes.Northern PikeImportant sport species captured with gill nets included northern pike and walleye.  Of these only northern pike were abundant, 10.3/gill net.  The catch of northern pike was above that of lakes similar to Grass.  Northern pike ranged in length from 16.5 to 30.4 inches with a mean length of 21.5 inches.  Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller northern pike.WalleyeWalleye are present at a low level of abundance.  Walleye are not stocked but fish may freely move into the lake from adjoining Clearwater Lake, which is stocked with walleye fry every other year.  During this survey walleye ranged in length from 19.5 to 23.1 inches with a mean length of 20.9 inches.Bluegill and Black CrappieImportant species captured in trap nets were bluegill (18.7/trap net) and black crappie (1.3 /trap net).  The catch of bluegill was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Grass.   Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 5.8 inches. Black crappie ranged in length from 9.0 to 9.8 inches with a mean length of 9.4 inches.</p>",

Bluegill growth was initially slow but was good by age 3. Abundance was high (35.7/trap). Fish over 8 inches were caught, with the 1982 and 1984 year classes showing dominance. Black Crappie numbers (1.3/trap net) were below the local average, but showed good growth and fairly even year class strength.
