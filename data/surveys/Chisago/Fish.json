                "narrative": "<p>  In August, 1991, a lake survey was conducted on Fish Lake.  This lake is classified as a centrarchid lake and managed as a centrarchid-largemouth bass lake.  Most recent stocking plans involved walleye fingerling stocking once every three years.  To determine the status of the fish populations, six gillnets and four trapnets were set and three shoreline stations were seined.  Based on results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are described.  \n  The northern pike net catch (9.83/set) showed a real increase from the previous survey catch in 1986 (4.00/set) and was above the statewide median catch (6.50/set).  This 1991 catch was the highest recorded since the first survey in 1957.  The northern pike captured ranged 14.0 to 30.9 inches with a median length group of 19.0-19.9 inches.  The mean weight was 1.80 pounds which is below the first quartile (1.94 pounds) for northern pike of this lake type.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from one to seven years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical of normal growth rates throughout the state.  All age classes represented were the result of natural reproduction.\n  The walleye net catch (5.83/set) was higher than the previous survey catch (4.00/set) and above the statewide median catch (2.44/set).  The walleye captured ranged from 11.0 to 28.9 inches with a median length group of 15.0-15.9 inches.  The mean weight was 2.56 pounds which was above the statewide median weight (1.87 pounds) for walleyes in this lake type.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were two, five and nine years old.  These fish correspond to fingerling stocking in 1989, 1986, and 1982.  Average back-calculated lengths for age classes I-V indicated fast growth when compared to statewide averages and age classes beyond age V indicated normal growth.  \n  The bluegill net catch (44.50/set) was higher than the previous survey catch (23.00/set) and the statewide median catch (30.39/set).  The bluegills ranged from 3.5 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.12 pounds which falls within the normal weight range for bluegills in this lake type.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from two to eight years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for age classes III-V indicated growth on the slower side of normal.  The remaining age classes expressed normal growth.  Shoreline seining captured only 4 YOY bluegill while 252 yearling/adult bluegills were taken in the same hauls.  This may indicate a poor year-class of bluegill natural reproduction.\n  The largemouth bass net catch (0.50/set) was above both the previous survey and the statewide median catch, (0.25/set) and (0.38/set), respectively.  The two fish captured were in the 6.0-6.4 inch group.  Shoreline seining captured 6 YOY and 1 yearling largemouth bass.\n  The black crappie net catch (1.00/set) was higher than the previous survey catch (0.25/set) but was below the first quartile (1.45/set).  The fish ranged from 8.5 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 8.5-8.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.48 pounds which above the third quartile (0.31 pounds) for black crappie weights of this lake type.  Age analysis of black crappies taken in all gear types determined that fish were one, two, four, six, and seven years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class indicated that black crappies have generally grown on the slow side of normal.  Shoreline seining efforts failed to capture any black crappies.\n  The yellow perch net catch (0.33/set) showed a real decrease from the previous survey catch (0.67/set) and remained below the first quartile (1.50/set).  The past four surveys dating back to 1977 have indicated low yellow perch populations.  Shoreline seining efforts captured 7 YOY yellow perch.\n  Seven other species were captured during the survey (bowfin, carp, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed).  Bowfin, carp, and white sucker net catches indicated low populations and the four other species net catches indicated normal populations when compared to net catches of the same lake type.\n</p>",

A vehicle fee is charged on weekends and holidays. The lake managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The Walleye population is maintained by stocking 141,000 fry annually. A survey was conducted in August 2018 with 8 gill net sets and 8 trap net sets to assess the fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 0.75 fish per net. This is lower than other similar lakes and a substantial decrease from the past couple of surveys. The Walleye catch rate in this lake has been quite variable through the historical record. Average weight was 5.5 lbs. which is exceptionally large but the sample is made up of only 6 fish. The smallest of these was 22 inches in length and the largest was an impressive 30.9 inches. All fish sampled were 8 years old or older.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was 10 fish per net which is typical for the lake but much higher than similar lakes. Average weight was 2.7 lbs. which is average for similar lakes but larger than the historical average. Fish averaged 22.7 inches in length with a decent number in excess of 30 inches. Ages were widely distributed with all year classes from 2015 to 2007 represented.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 2.7 fish per trap net with a high mean weight of 0.47 lbs. Fish ranged from about 7.5 to 10 inches in length with one 12 inch fish sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 23 fish per net which is typical relative to similar lakes and historical surveys. Average weight of 0.19 lbs. was also typical. Fish ranged from 3.6 to 8.7 inches in length and averaged 6.1 inches. <br> \n    <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was conducted in late May to assess the Largemouth Bass population. The catch rate was 60 fish per hour which is equal to the previous survey and only slightly higher than the historical average. Average weight was also typical relative to historical surveys. A wide range of sizes were sampled with an average length of 12.3 inches and a maximum of 17.8 inches. Thirty-five percent of bass sampled were longer than 15 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

The largemouth bass had about average figures but its general status is considered to be excellent.  The bluegill was average at 25.00 per set and ranged from small to fair size.  The pumpkinseed was slightly low at 3.16 per set.  The black crappie while extremely low at 0.83 in the trapnet, has fluctuated over the previous surveys and has been well represented in the gillnet.  The black and brown bullheads had extremely low populations.  The yellow bullhead while slightly low in the trapnet, was high in the gillnet and of a very good average size.  The green sunfish, white sucker and bowfin had low to extremely low populations respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 306 acre basin managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Fish Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Fish Lake was netted and electrofished during the summer of 2001.The lake's management plan currently calls for alternate year walleye fryling stocking.  After comparing fryling success to past fingerling stocking the management plan will be ammended to include the most effective method.  Long range management goals for the lake are to maintain the walleye catch between 4 and 6 per gillnet lift with a 2 pound average, the northern pike at 4 per gillnet with a 2.5 pound average, and the largemouth bass at 40 per hour of electrofishing with a 1 pound average.  The gillnet catch rates for northern pike and walleye were 3.9 and 3.8 per set respectively.  Both species were at low levels compared to historic net catch data for Fish Lake but were within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class.  Both species were below management goals in numbers.  Walleye average weight (2.5 pounds) exceeded the management goal while northern weight (1.5 pounds) was below both the management goal and the lake class norm.  Compared to the 1996 catch rate both species showed decreases close to 50%.  Growth rates for both walleye and northern pike were similar to the statewide norm.  All aged walleye could be attributed to a stocking year with the 1995 and 1998 year classes each representing nearly half the catch.  Northern year classes ranged from 1995 to 2000 with 3 and 4 year olds accounting for 65% of the sample.   Sixty seven minutes of electrofishing sampled 56 largemouth bass yielding a catch rate of 49.5 per hour.  Captured bass ranged from 5.5 to 19.0 inches with a 12.3 inch and 1.3 pound average.  The 2001 catch showed an increase in both size and numbers compared to 1996.  The largemouth bass catch exceeded the management goal in both numbers and size.  Four shoreline seine hauls sampled 11 young of the year largemouth bass that averaged 2.3 inches.  Scale samples indicated that the largemouth catch was well distributed from the 1992 through the 1999 year classes.  Growth occured at a normal rate compared to the statewide average.The black crappie gillnet catch was sparse (1.9/set) but fish were quality sized.  Seventy percent of the catch was over 8.5 inches with an average weight of 0.4 pounds.  The 1996 catch was noticeably higher (8.3/set) but the mean weight was only 0.15 pounds.  Compared to other catches in the lake class, the crappie catch rate was low but their size was larger than expected.      The bluegill trapnet catch rate (18.9/set) was very similar to the 1996 catch and within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class.  As in 1996, sampled bluegill were below the norm for size, averageing 5.5 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Shoreline seining sampled 29 young of the year bluegill indicating that reproduction was successful.Yellow perch abundance was again extremely low with only one fish being sampled in the trapnetting and 2 in the shoreline seining.Other species sampled during the assessment included black bullhead, bowfin (dog fish), brook silverside, brown bullhead, fathead minnow, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, spottail shiner, and yellow bullhead.Fish Lake receives moderate fishing pressure.  Based on the 2001 data, the lake should provide angling opportunities for quality sized walleye, largemouth bass, and black crappie with moderate to small sized northern pike and bluegill available.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish is a 306-acre lake in northwestern Chisago County.  The nearest town is Harris.  Of the 306 acres, 141 (46%) are shallower than 15 feet (littoral area).  Maximum depth is 57 feet.  The shoreline length is 3.5 miles and has a maximum fetch of 1.3 miles.  Despite being bordered on the north by a county highway and having moderate development on the remaining shoreline, Fish Lake maintains higher than normal water clarity for Chisago county area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nFish Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Fish Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Fish Lake was netted and electrofished during the summer of 2006.  Various stockings have occurred through the years of mainly northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.9 per net) was normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but low compared to historic net catch data for Fish Lake.  Average weight per fish was high at 3.0 pounds.  Nearly two-thirds of the walleyes captured were over 20 inches in length.  Growth was similar to the statewide norm.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 5.2 fish per net which was normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average weight was low at 1.6 pounds.  The northern pike that were sampled ranged from 15.3 to 29.3 inches in length with an average of 19.5 inches.  Just 6 percent of the northern pike sampled were over 24 inches in length.  Growth was similar to the statewide norm.   <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  The catch rate of the sample was 25.9 bass/hour.  The sizes of the sample ranged in length from 7.3 to 18.2 inches, averaging 13.1 inches.  The number of bass sampled was down from what was sampled in 2001 (49.5 bass/hour), the first time that largemouth bass were electrofished on Fish Lake.   However, the average size of the fish increased slightly from 12.3 inches.  Growth occurred at a normal rate compared to the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 17.2 fish per net, which is normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and typical of catches in past surveys.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches with an average of 5.3 inches.  Nearly ? of the bluegills sampled were less than six inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth trapnets and gillnets sampled black crappies.  The trapnets caught an average of 0.8 fish per net.  The gillnets caught an average of 3.0 fish per net.  Black crappies ranged in size from 4.6 to 11.2 inches in length.  The average size was 8.0 inches.  Approximately 20% of the samples of black crappies were greater than 10 inches in length.  Growth was fast compared to the statewide average with fish at age 5 reaching 10.7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included bowfin, brown bullhead, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and carp, hybrid sunfish.  These species have historically been sampled in fairly low numbers on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThirty species of aquatic plants were sampled throughout the lake.  Fairly diverse populations of various emergent, submergent and floating-leafed species were present.  Recently the presence of Eurasian water milfoil was confirmed in Fish Lake.  Extra caution is urged to thoroughly inspect boats and trailers, and drain any water when leaving the lake to reduce the risk of spreading the exotic species to uninfested waters.    <br> \n</p>",

A county park on the east shore provides boat access and a swimming beach; a user fee is charged on weekends and holidays. Water clarity is higher than most lakes in the area.  A quality largemouth bass and walleye fishery is present with additional opportunity for acceptable-sized panfish and smaller northerns. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was typical of comparable lakes and similar to the lake's long term mean.  Walleye size exceeded the lake class norm with an average of 20.7 inches and 3 pounds.  Fish Lake is stocked in June of even-numbered years with walleye frylings as part of a statewide walleye stocking study. The 2008 fryling stocking represented more than half the catch. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers are above average, but quality sized fish are rare. Northerns averaged 1.5 pounds and 19.1 inches with only 10% of the catch surpassing 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing in late spring revealed an abundant largemouth bass population with some good sized fish present. Lengths ranged from 8 to 17.6 inches with a 13.5 inch, 1.4 pound average. Bass growth was similar to the statewide rate. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie numbers were low compared to similar lakes; however, both are plentiful enough to warrant angling. Half the sampled crappies were 8 inches or larger while 39% of bluegill exceeded 7 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 306 acre lake having an oval shape to its basin and is about 1.3 miles long.  The shoreline is roughly half developed with homes and sand being the primary substrate in those areas.  Clay, muck, and silt substrates are found more predominantly in the undisturbed natural areas.  Much of the shoreline is commonly fringed with good aquatic plants such as cattail, bulrush, coontail, and many pondweeds.  In fact, forty-two plant species are found throughout the lake growing as deep as 10 feet.  This largemouth bass-panfish lake is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.  The maximum depth is 57 feet with about half of the lake's volume being deeper than 15 feet.   During most summers, the lake is subject to moderate algal blooms and thermal stratification, making dissolved oxygen concentrations very low in depths of  20 feet and below.  Summertime water clarity ranges from 4 to 10 feet from the surface.  Past survey records have not documented winterkill or summerkill that affected the fish population.  Various stocking has occurred through the years.  Present management plans call for walleye fingerlings stocked on 3-year rotation.During August 12-16, 1996, a lake survey  was conducted to evaluate the present fish population in Fish Lake.  Gear types consisted of: six standard gillnets and eight standard trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass on May 29, 1996, and standard seining natural reproduction checks on August 16, 1996.  Fish Lake is in lake class 24 and fish abundances are based on the mean ranges observed in other lake class 24 lakes.Walleye abundance was high for this type of lake.  Each of the past six surveys since 1957 have indicated that the walleye present in this lake are primarily due to stocking of fingerlings.  The consistency of stocking has no doubt maintained this level of walleye, however, limited natural reproduction has at times produced some adequate year-classes of walleye.   Fish Lake does not have suitable gravel/rock spawning habitat for walleye.  The walleye sampled ranged from 10.0 to 25.3 inches with an average of 18.1 inches.  The average weight was 2.5 pounds.Northern pike abundance was normal which has been the case for many years.  Standing cattail and bulrush beds along the shore and other submerged plants make for excellent northern pike spawning habitat.  Removal of the natural plants would no doubt reduce the fish production in the lake.  The northern pike sampled ranged from 13.3 to 29.3 inches with an average of 18.9 inches.  The average weight was 1.5 pounds.  These fish were represented by ages one through six but with ages two, three, and four making up 90% of the entire sample.  With younger fish dominating the sample, it gave the impression that the pike population ran small in lengths and weights.  Actually, these fish were growing at normal rates.Night electrofishing is a technique used to sample largemouth bass.  The sample of bass (40.5 bass/hr) ranged in length from 5.9 to 19.0 inches, averaging 11.4 inches.  Ages one through six were sampled indicating good natural reproduction and exhibiting normal growth.  This was the first time Fish Lake was electrofished by the DNR, and this will also continue on a 5-year rotation.  Seining sampled many of this year's bass which averaged 2.09 inches on August 16, 1996.The 1996 sampling indicated the bluegill abundance was normal for this lake type, which was typical of catches in past surveys.  This year's catch sampled bluegill from 2.9 to 7.5 inches with the average being 5.7 inches.  Seining did not sample many bluegill hatchlings which could suggest a low hatch due to the very cold month of June in 1996.  Most fish spawning depend on many factors, but water temperature is probably the most important.  If it is too cold, sometimes fish will hold their eggs and miss the spawning window.  The fish will reabsorb and use the eggs as energy.Two methods, gillnets and trapnets measured black crappie abundance.  Catches were normal in gillnets but low in trapnets.  Their abundance has varied through the survey years from being mostly normal to sometimes high.  The 1996 catch sampled crappie ranging from 4.3 to 10.6 inches with the average being 6.6 inches.  Aging determined a presence of ages one through six with age two fish making up 75% of the crappie sampled.   These two-year-old fish averaged 6.3 inches at capture and will be the dominant crappie year-class common to anglers in the next couple of years.  Seining sampled no crappie from this year's hatch.Yellow perch abundance was very low for this lake type.  In fact, they were not sampled in normal abundance in the last five surveys.  All gear types in 1996 only sampled nine adult perch averaging around 5.0 inches.  Seining sampled a fair amount of this year's hatch and they were 2.03 inches on August 16th.   Considering that Fish Lake has very good populations of a walleye and northern pike, it is likely that their predation keeps the perch numbers at low levels.Common carp were not sampled by netting but two adults were observed during night electrofishing.  In the past, they have been sampled in low numbers.  Currently, if carp removal were attempted, a contracted commercial fisherman would do it.  Judging by the number of years carp have been in the system, they have apparently not caused major shifts in game fish abundance nor have they exploded to excessive levels.Thirteen other species were represented in the netting gear: bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead,  green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, blackchin shiner, banded killifish, brook silverside, johnny darter, and spottail shiner.  The black bullhead, white sucker, and green sunfish were at low levels while the remaining species were sampled at normal abundance levels for this lake type.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Fish Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting on July 27, 2020. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with three sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three sites, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed dominated the trap net catch numbers, but only comprised approximately 46% of total trap net biomass. Of the Bluegills sampled, 50% were between 5 and 7 inches, 6% were over 7 inches and no Bluegills over 8 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nThese trap net and nearshore survey data are combined with data from an August 2018 gill net survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Fish Lake is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates an exceptional fish community is present in this lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
