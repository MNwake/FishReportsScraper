Black crappie, northern pike, walleye, and white suckercatch per lift were above the high expected value for lakes similar to Pearl Lake. The gill net catch rate for black crappie significantly increased from 2.14/lift in 1992 to 21.57/liftin 1998 and fish length remained similar, ranging between 4.0 to 8.9 inches in 1992 to 4.0 to 9.5inches in 1998.  Growth was slightly above average for Minnesota lakes as fish reached 4.60,6.22, 8.11 and 9.00 inches by Age I, II, III and IV, respectively. The gill net catch rate for northern pike significantly increased from 4.14/lift in 1992 to 10.57/liftin 1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained unchanged at 2.29 lbs.  Length of fishsampled ranged from 10.0 to 28.0 inches, with a mean length of 21.5 inches.  Northern pikegrowth was slightly above average for Minnesota lakes as fish reached 18.27, 20.85, 22.16, and24.58 inches by Age II, III, IV, and V, respectively.  The 1994 and 1995 year classes representedthe largest portion of northern pike sampled in 1998. The gill net catch rate for walleye appeared to decrease from 10.43/lift in 1992, to 7.00/lift in1998, and mean weight per fish decreased from 2.09 lbs. to 1.59 lbs.  Length of fish sampled in1998 ranged from 11.0 to 26.0 inches, with a mean length of 16.1 inches.  Walleye growth wasslightly above average for Minnesota lakes, as fish reached 13.35 inches by Age II, 15.51 inchesby Age III, 14.57 inches by Age IV, and 18.78 inches by Age V.  Evidence of survival from the1993 and 1996 fingerling stockings was found in the 1998 sample; the 1996 year class representedthe largest portion of fish captured.Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of four major species:bluegill (37.00/set), white sucker (3.00/set), pumpkinseed sunfish (1.80/set), and  black crappie(1.30/set).  Bluegill abundance was between second and third quartiles, pumpkinseed sunfishabundance was between first and second quartiles, while white sucker abundance was above thirdquartile range, and black crappie abundance was below the first quartile value for lake class 24.  The trap net catch rate for bluegill appeared to decline from 41.10/set in 1992 to 37.00/set in1998.  Both surveys indicated levels between second and third quartile values for lake class 24. Bluegill sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.0 inches, with a mean length of 4.8inches. Growth for Age I, through IV fish appeared to be above the statewide average with 3.09,4.43, 5.64, 6.15 inches, respectively, and slightly below average for Age V and VI individualswith 6.64, and 7.21 inches, respectively.  Of the bluegill sampled, the 1996 and 1992 yearclasses represented the largest component. The trap net catch rate for pumpkinseed sunfish has appeared to decrease from 2.90/set in 1992,to 1.80/set in 1998, which was between first and second quartile values for lake class 34.  Lengthof pumpkinseed sunfish from the 1998 sample ranged from 4.0 to 7.0 inches, with a mean lengthof 5.5 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre lake located one mile east of the City of Marty in southeastern Stearns County.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is considered littoral (< 15 feet deep).  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and in 2009 special fishing regulations were enacted for these species.  Regulations include: a 17 inch minimum size limit and 3 fish daily bag limit for Walleye and a 24 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike (daily bag of 3, only one over 36 inches allowed).  Pearl Lake was selected as a sentinel lake as part of Minnesota's long term monitoring program (SLICE).  This means Pearl Lake will receive more frequent sampling of fish populations, aquatic vegetation and water quality to identify impacts of climate change, land use changes, invasive species, and other stressors. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been managed through a combination of yearling and fingerling stocking since the 1940s.  Since 1998, the Walleye catch has averaged 5.7/gill net.  The 2014 Walleye catch (5.4/gill net) was similar to this average and within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pearl Lake.  Walleye captured ranged in length from 7.5 to 26.1 inches and averaged 16.6 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Seven year classes of fish were captured with age 4 fish comprising 46% of the aged sample.  Multiple year classes are a reflection of a healthy fish population.  Forty percent of the Walleye collected were longer than 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nUntil 1992 the Northern Pike catch was within the expected range (5.6/net).  However, since 1992 the average catch has increased to 15.7 fish per net.  The 2014 catch (13.4 fish/gill net) was lower than the 2013 survey (20.8/gill net), but similar to the average from 1998 to 2013.  Northern Pike collected ranged in length from 11.8 to 39.0 inches and averaged 21.7 inches long and 2.4 pounds.  Twenty eight percent of the northern pike caught were longer than 24 inches and 25% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been less than one fish per net since the 1992 survey.  No Yellow Perch were sampled in either the gill nets or trap nets.  However, 45 were collected during fall daytime electrofishing.  These fish averaged 3.2 inches and likely are too small to recruit to gill nets or trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nIn an effort to standardize bass electrofishing, seven random sites where chosen around Pearl Lake.  Consequently, catch and effort data should not be directly compared to previous surveys.  Spring nighttime electrofishing captured 26 Largemouth Bass ranging in length from 6.3 to 16.6 inches.  There were 9 year classes present ranging in age from 2 to 16 years old.  On average Largemouth Bass reached a length of 13.7 inches at 6 years of age. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets captured 71 Black Crappie in 2014 for a catch rate of 7.9/gill net which is above average for this lake class.  Trap nets caught an additional seven Black Crappie.  Black Crappie collected ranged from 4.5 to 11.5 inches long and averaged 8.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Bluegill catch (9.0/trap net) was low for this lake class.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  Nine year classes were observed, with age 3 fish making up 35% of the aged sample.  Bluegill reached 7 inches in 4 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining in July of 2014.  A total of 14 fish species were captured, including Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter which are considered intolerant species.  They are usually negatively impacted by poor water quality, so their presence in this survey is an indicator of good water quality. Other species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bluntnose Minnow, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733-acre lake located one mile east of the City of Marty in southeastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. In addition to Walleye and Northern Pike, Pearl Lake provides anglers with the opportunity to catch Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2023 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been managed through a combination of yearling and fingerling stocking since the 1940s. The catch in 2023 was three times higher than that of 2020 but identical to 2017 (when catches reached a 25 year high) and exceeded the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pearl. Walleye ranged in length from 13 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 17 inches and 2 pounds. Nineteen percent of the Walleye collected were longer than 20 inches. Eleven year classes of Walleye were captured, with age-2 fish comprising 54% of the aged sample.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike began to increase in 1992 before peaking in 2013. The catch in 2023 was higher than 2020 and above the range of expected values for the lake class. The average size also increased to 22 inches and two pounds. Northern Pike caught in 2023 ranged in length from 10 to 33 inches with 20% being longer than 24 inches and 5% being longer than 30 inches. Anglers should note that the 24- to 36-inch protected slot on Northern Pike in Pearl Lake will be discontinued starting with the 2024 fishing opener. This regulation had been in place since 2009 but failed to appreciably increase the size structure or average size of pike in the lake. Northern Pike regulations for anglers on the lake will now revert back to the statewide limits for the North-Central zone which includes a possession limit of 10 fish (not more than 2 over 26 inches, all from 22-26 inches must be immediately released). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by nighttime electrofishing during spring 2023. The catch rate of 82/hour was significantly higher than 2016 (8/hour) but similar to the Sauk Rapids Area average of 74/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8 to 18 inches with an average length of 13 inches. Angler's can expect to catch a number of medium size bass (12 - 15 inches) as 70% of the catch were in this size range. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2023 was much less than the 2020 survey and the long-term average. Ninety-seven Bluegill were sampled during the survey and ranged in length from three to nine inches with an average length of five inches. Nine-year classes were observed, with age 4 and older fish making up 77% of the aged sample. Growth of Bluegill is above average and reach over six inches in four years. Anglers can expect to catch a number of Bluegill over a variety of sizes. The practice of catch and release is likely a reason that we see Bluegills over eight inches. Besides Bluegill, anglers can also expect good fishing for Black Crappies. The 2023 gill net catch of Black Crappie was similar to 2020 and remained within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Pearl. Black Crappies ranged in length from five to twelve inches with an average length of ten inches. Anglers can expect good fishing for harvestable size crappies as 63% of the crappies collected were 10 inches or larger. Low lake levels from several years of below average precipitation likely contributed to light panfish catches observed in trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been less than one fish per net since the 1987 survey. Only one Yellow Perch was sampled during this survey although Yellow Perch are occasionally captured while sampling for other species; however, most of them are too small to meet angler satisfaction.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. All additional species were sampled in low abundance except for Yellow Bullhead, which exceeded the expected range of values for similar lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre lake located one mile east of the City of Marty in southeastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and in 2009 special fishing regulations were enacted for these species. Regulations included: a 17 inch minimum size limit and 3 fish daily bag limit for Walleye and a 24 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike (daily bag of 3, only one over 36 inches allowed). In addition to Walleye and Northern Pike, Pearl Lake provides anglers with the opportunity to catch Bluegill and Black Crappie. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been managed through a combination of yearling and fingerling stocking since the 1940s. The Walleye catch in 2017 was twice as high as 2015 and above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pearl Lake and was the highest recorded since 1992. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 14 to 26 inches and averaged 17 inches and 1.7 pounds. Fifty six percent of the Walleye collected were longer than 17 inches compared to 30% observed in 2015. Eight year classes of fish were captured with age 4 fish comprising 50% of the aged sample. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike has fluctuated significantly from 1992 (record low) to 2013 (record high). The catch in 2017 was lower than 2015 and about half of what was sampled in 2013, but is still above the range of expected values for the lake class. While the catch has decreased over the past five surveys the average size has stayed the same averaging 21 inches and two pounds. Northern Pike caught in 2017 ranged in length from 9 to 36 inches with 24% being longer than 24 inches and 10% being longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2017 was similar to 2015 and the long term average. Two hundred and thirty Bluegill were sampled during the survey and ranged in length from two to nine inches with an average length of six inches. Seven year classes were observed, with age 5 fish making up 29% of the aged sample. Bluegill growth was average, reaching six inches in four years. Anglers can expect to catch a variety of sizes. The practice of catch and release is a likely reason we see Bluegills over eight inches. Anglers can also expect good fishing for Black Crappies. Black Crappies were measured from 8 to 11 inches with an average length of 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been less than one fish per net since 1992. No Yellow Perch were sampled in either the gill nets or trap nets. Yellow Perch are occasionally captured while sampling for other species; however, most of them are too small to meet angler satisfaction.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2017. Recent electrofishing surveys from 2014 to 2016 have sampled Largemouth Bass at catch rates below the Sauk Rapids Area average. This is mostly due to changes in the way sampling sites were selected to include areas that are not necessarily prime bass spawning habitat. In recent surveys Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches with an average length of 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733-acre recreational development lake located five miles north of the City of Kimball in southeastern Stearns County.   The maximum depth is 17 feet and the lake is 70% littoral.   Pearl Lake has also been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes Project and will be intensively studied over a long term. Pearl Lake will have experimental fishing regulations beginning in 2009.  The regulations are for three walleye per day with a 17inch minimum size, and a protected slot limit of 24-36 inches for northern pike (daily bag of 3, one over 36 inch). This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management in Pearl Lake consists of regular alternate year stocking of fingerlings.  Mill Creek, a tributary to Pearl Lake, was enhanced in 2002 by creating rock riffles for walleye spawning.  Low precipitation and spring run-off has not allowed these to be successful.  For three of the past four assessments the walleye gill net catch has exceeded the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pearl. The population abundance is the result of successful fingerling stocking.  Walleye sampled in 2008 ranged in length from 10 to 28 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  Walleye grew at a rate exceeding the statewide average through age four, but growth slowed to within statewide averages thereafter.  Walleye grew to a length of 18 inches in five years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches have generally been within the range of expected values, albeit on the high end.  The catch (14/net) peaked in 2008 while the average size was less than two pounds.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11 to 32 inches with an average length of 21 inches. Female northern pike reached 23 inches in four years, whereas males reached 21 inches in four years.  In 2008, 16% of northern pike taken in gill nets were 24 inches or greater, the same percentage as existed in 1998. <br> \n <br> \nAs the population of northern pike increased in Pearl Lake, the yellow perch have diminished.  None were taken in gill nets in 1998 or 2008.  White sucker were captured at a rate of 2/gill net in 2008, somewhat less than 1998 (7/gill net).  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on May 20, 2008.  The electrofishing catch rate for largemouth bass was 24.2/hour, lower than the Stearns County average of 67/hr.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.4 to 19 inches, with an average length of nearly 14 inches. Of the catchable largemouth bass (larger than eight inches), the proportion larger than 12 inches was 73%.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch for bluegill has been within the range of expected values in four out of the past five surveys.  Bluegill sampled in both trap and gill nets ranged in length from three to eight inches, with an average length of nearly six inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap net catches have been historically low in Pearl Lake and have been below the expected range in four of the last five surveys dating back to 1981.  Black crappie sampled in both trap and gill nets ranged in length from four to ten inches, with an average length of 7.5 inches. Black crappie reached seven inches by age three. <br> \n <br> \nPearl Lake is a very popular lake for angling in both summer and winter.  Anglers report good fishing for most species.  Because of the near-shore shallowness which prevents trap nets from fishing very well, it is possible that we have underestimated the abundance of panfish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre recreational development lake located one mile east of the city of Marty in southeastern Stearns County.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Since 2008, Pearl Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes (Slice) Project and will be intensively studied over a long term.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike and in 2009 special fishing regulations were enacted for these species.  New regulations include: a 17 inch minimum size limit and 3 fish daily bag limit for walleye and a 24-36 inch protected slot for northern pike (daily bag of 3, only one over 36 inches allowed).\n\nWalleye have been managed through fingerling stocking since the 1940s.  Historically, the walleye catch has been high.  In 2011, the walleye catch was the lowest on record; however, the catch was still above average for lakes similar to Pearl Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 - 26 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth was fast for both sexes.  Both males and females reached 16 inches by age 3.  Thirty-three percent of the walleye collected were longer than 17 inches and 22% were longer than 20 inches.\n\nThe northern pike catch has historically been within the range of expected values over the past six surveys.  Since 1992, the northern pike catch has increased significantly.  This year the catch was the highest on record.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14 - 36 inches and averaged 21 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Growth of both male and female northern pike was average.  Both males and females reached 24 inches in 5-6 years.  Twenty-one percent of the northern pike sampled were 24 inches or larger and 4% were 30 inches or larger.\n\nAs the population of northern pike increased, yellow perch abundance has decreased and none were collected in gill nets in 1998, 2008, and 2011.\n\nThe electrofishing catch of largemouth bass (87.3/hr, on time) in 2011 was above the Montrose area night time average (67/ hr, on time).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.3 - 18.1 inches and averaged 13 inches.  Growth of largemouth bass was average.  Largemouth bass reached 12 inches in 4 years.  Seventy-two percent of the largemouth bass sampled were 12 inches or larger and 27% were 15 inches or larger.\n\nHistorically, the black crappie catch has been low.  The black crappie catch was similar to previous surveys and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5 - 11 inches and averaged 8 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Growth of black crappie was fast.  Black crappie reached 8 inches in 3 years.  Forty-six percent of the crappies collected were 9 inches or larger.\n\nThe bluegill catch was similar to previous surveys and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 - 8 inches and averaged 6 inches.  Growth of bluegill was slow.  Bluegill reached 7 inches in 6-7 years.  Twenty-five percent of the bluegills were 7 inches or longer.\n\nCurled pondweed was mapped during peak abundance and found to be at or near the surface on 41.7 acres or 5.6% of the lake surface.  A vegetation survey was conducted on August 22 - 24, 2011.  A total of 20 species were sampled.  The most common species were chara, sago pondweed, and coontail.\n\nOther species sampled included: banded killifish, black bullhead, bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook stickleback, brown bullhead, fathead minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre lake located one mile east of the City of Marty in southeastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. In addition to Walleye and Northern Pike, Pearl Lake provides anglers with the opportunity to catch Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2020 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been managed through a combination of yearling and fingerling stocking since the 1940s. The catch in 2020 was only a third of that of 2017 (when catches reached a 25 year high), but remained within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Pearl. Walleye ranged in length from 15 to 24 inches with an average length and weight of 19 inches and 2.6 pounds. Thirty-one percent of the Walleye collected were longer than 20 inches. Seven year classes of fish were captured, with age-3 fish comprising 54% of the aged sample.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike began to increase in 1992 before peaking in 2013. The catch in 2020 was lower than 2017 and about half of what it was in 2015, but still above the range of expected values for the lake class. While the catch has decreased over the past six surveys, the average size has stayed the same averaging 21 inches and two pounds. Northern Pike caught in 2020 ranged in length from 12 to 36 inches with 16% being longer than 24 inches and 5% being longer than 30 inches. Anglers should note that there is a 24 to 36 inch protected slot on Northern Pike with a bag limit of three of which only one can be over 36 inches. This regulation has been in effect since 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2020 was similar to 2017 and the long term average. One hundred and seventy Bluegill were sampled during the survey and ranged in length from three to nine inches with an average length of five inches. Seven year classes were observed, with age 4 and younger fish making up 86% of the aged sample. Growth of Bluegill is average and reach six inches in four years. Anglers can expect to catch a large number of fish over a variety of sizes. The practice of catch and release is likely a reason that we see Bluegills over 8 inches. Besides Bluegill, anglers can also expect good fishing for Black Crappies. The catch of Black Crappie in both gill nets and trap nets were higher than 2017 but remained within the expected range of values for lakes with similar characteristics to Pearl. Black Crappies ranged in length from four to twelve inches with an average length of nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been less than one fish per net since the 1987 survey. Only one Yellow Perch was sampled during this survey although Yellow Perch are occasionally captured while sampling for other species; however, most of them are too small to meet angler satisfaction.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. Recent electrofishing surveys from 2014 to 2016 have sampled Largemouth Bass at rates below the Sauk Rapids Area average. This is mostly due to changes in the way sampling sites were selected to include areas that are not necessarily prime bass habitat. In recent surveys Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches with an average length of 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Principal species sampled in gill nets were Walleye (10.4/net), Northern Pike (4.1/net), Black Crappie (2.1/net), and Yellow Perch (0.6/net).  Walleye were abundant, with a catch rate greater than the third quartile (7.4/ gill net) for lake class 34.  The majority (90%) of the walleye were from stocked year classes (1984, 1986, 1989, 1990), but limited natural reproduction was evident by the presence of fish from non-stocked years.  The catch rate for Walleye typically has been high in Pearl Lake, but a significant decrease from 25.0/gill net in 1987 to 10.4/gill net in 1992 was observed.  The high catch in 1987 was attributed to very abundant year classes from fingerling stockings in 1981 and 1984.  The growth rate for Walleye was average when compared to statewide length at age values.  Walleye captured during 1992 were similar in length and weight to those sampled during 1987, ranging in length from 12.0 to 25.9 inches, with a modal length of 14.0 to 14.9 inches.  They had a mean weight of 2.1 pounds.  Northern Pike abundance (4.1/gill net was average for lake class 34, but had decreased significantly from 9.0/gill net in 1987, which was above the third quartile.  Pike showed a growth rate faster than the statewide average for the first three years, with fish reaching 20 inches by age three. Lengths sampled were similar to those of 1987, ranging from 15.0 to 28.9 inches with a modal length of 21.0 to 21.9 inches.  With the fast growth rate, larger (30 inches and greater) Northern Pike might be expected in the catch; but the oldest individual was age 5.  These conditions might be an indication of high fishing pressure and harvest of large pike, or high natural mortality.  The Black Crappie catch (2.1/gill net) was lower than the third quartile for lake class 34, but remained similar to previous surveys.  Black Crappie captured during this assessment ranged in length from 4.0 to 8.9 inches with a modal length of 6.5 to 6.9 inches. Black Crappie captured during the 1987 survey were larger with a range of 5.0 to 11.4 inches and a modal length of 7.5 to 7.9 inches.  The mean weight of Black Crappie also decreased from 0.24 pounds in 1987 to 0.18 pounds in 1992, but remained average for lake class 34.  Young of the year Black Crappie were not sampled, and no crappies were sampled in trap nets during this assessment.  The Yellow Perch catch has been variable in Pearl Lake showing a significant increase from below the first quartile during the 1981 netting (0.9/gill net), to about the median value for lake class 34 (8.8/gill net) in the 1987 netting, and back to below the first quartile (0.6/gill net) in the 1992 assessment.  Although the catch decreased from 1987, the length range (3.5-6.4 inches) and modal length (5.5-5.9 inches) remained similar.  Six yearling Yellow Perch were seined, but young of the year were not sampled.  Four additional species were captured in gill nets.  Largemouth Bass (1.0/gill net) and White Sucker (3.3/gill net) catches were average for the lake class, and Brown Bullhead (0.7/gill net) and Black Bullhead (0.7/gill net) were low for the lake class.  The six Largemouth Bass sampled exhibited above average growth when compared to statewide length at age values, and six young of the year were seined.  Principal species sampled in trap nets were Bluegill (41.1/net) and Yellow Bullhead (2.3/net).  The Bluegill net catch (41.1/net) was average for the lake class, but varied from the 1987 survey (5.9/net); both values were within the first and third quartiles.  The length range and mode remained similar to the 1987 survey, with the 1992 sample ranging in length from 3.0 to 6.9 inches with a modal length of 3.0 to 3.4 inches.  The mean weight (0.06 pounds) was low for the lake class, because of the large number of three inch fish. Many Bluegill were sampled with seines, of which eight were young of the year.  The Yellow Bullhead catch (2.3/net) was within the first and third quartile for lake class 34. Length range (5.0-13.9 inches) and modal length (10.0-10.4 inches) remained similar to the 1987 survey.  The mean weight (0.7 pounds) was average for lake class 34. Three additional species were sampled in trap nets.  Pumpkinseed (2.9/net), Green Sunfish (0.5/net), and Bowfin (0.5/net) catches were average for the lake class.  The mean weight for Bowfin (3.5 pounds) was average for the lake class while Pumpkinseed (0.09 pounds) and Green Sunfish (0.05) mean weights were low.  Three additional forage species:  Banded Killifish, Brook Stickleback, and Iowa Darter were sampled with seines.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre recreational development lake located one mile east of the city of Marty in southeastern Stearns County.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Since 2008, Pearl Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes (Slice) Project and will be intensively studied over a long term.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and in 2009 special fishing regulations were enacted for these species.  New regulations include: a 17 inch minimum size limit and 3 fish daily bag limit for Walleye and a 24-36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike (daily bag of 3, only one over 36 inches allowed). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been managed through fingerling stocking since the 1940s.  Historically, the Walleye catch has been high.  In 2013, the Walleye catch was the lowest on record; however, the catch was still above average for lakes similar to Pearl Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 10 - 27 inches and averaged 17 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Growth was fast, as fish reached 14.3 inches by age 3.  Forty percent of the Walleye collected were longer than 17 inches and 22% were longer than 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch has historically been within the range of expected values.  Since 1992, the Northern Pike catch has increased significantly.  This year the catch was the highest on record.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 8 - 36 inches and averaged 22 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Growth of Northern Pike was fast, as fish grew to a length of 24 inches in 4 years.  Thirty percent of the Northern Pike sampled were 24 inches or larger and 10% were 30 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAs the population of Northern Pike increased, Yellow Perch abundance has decreased and none were collected in gill nets in 1998, 2008, and 2011.  One Yellow Perch was collected in 2013 gill nets.  Fifty-eight Yellow Perch were collected during fall daytime electrofishing.  These fish averaged 3.6 inches and likely are too small to recruit to summer gill nets or trap nets.  These fish are maturing at small sizes, with young of the year males maturing as small as 2.1 inches and females maturing as small as 3.8 inches at age 1 <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2013.  The electrofishing catch of Largemouth Bass (87.3/hr) in 2011 was above the Montrose area night time average (67/ hr).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.3 - 18.1 inches and averaged 13 inches.  Growth of Largemouth Bass was average.  Largemouth Bass reached 12 inches in 4 years.  Seventy-two percent of the Largemouth Bass sampled were 12 inches or larger and 27% were 15 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, the Black Crappie catch from trap nets has been low in Pearl Lake, as it was in 2013.  However, the Black Crappie catch from gill nets exceeded the range of expected values for similar lakes, likely indicating that most Black Crappie are off shore in deeper water in late August.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 - 11 inches and averaged 7 inches and 0.2 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was similar to previous surveys and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  Ten year classes were observed, with age 2 and 3 fish making up 43% of the aged sample.  Growth of Bluegill was slow.  Bluegill reached 7 inches in 5-6 years. <br> \n <br> \nAn index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey was conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  A total of 19 fish species were captured, including Blackchin and Blacknose shiner, which are considered sensitive species. <br> \n <br> \nA point-intercept vegetation survey was conducted between June 5, 2013 and June 6, 2013 to assess the abundance of curly leaf pondweed in Pearl Lake.  Curly leaf pondweed was identified at 21.6% of sampling stations.  Curly leaf pondweed was found throughout the lake but was concentrated in the North and West parts of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Banded Killifish, Black Bullhead, Bluntnose Minnow, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

In terms of size and abundance, Yellow Bullheads appear to at commercially harvestable levels.  Forage species appear to be in good abundance. Walleye were sampled in numbers higher than expected based on similar lakes. Yellow Perch numbers declined in gill nets, but young of the year abundance in shoreline seine hauls is similar in both numbers and ratio to adults to the 1975 survey. Northern Pike increased about fivefold to three times the state median.  Six age classes present with ages 3, 5, and 7 being dominant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pearl Lake was conducted on June 21-23, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing  and seining with a 50-foot seine,. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates that the fish community in Pearl Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency as well as to the Long Term Monitoring program; Pearl Lake is a Long Term Monitoring Sentinel Lake. As such, several FIBI surveys have been completed on Pearl Lake, and it was identified as vulnerable to impairment during the previous watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill net figures when compared with nettings in 1981, show increased catches of Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Walleye. Northern Pike catches in Pearl Lake is displaying a steady increase since 1975. Catches in 75', 81', and '87 have been 1.8/lift, 7.6/lift, and 9.0/lift, respectively. Age classes 3, 4 and 5 are well represented, and growth rates are normal. The median length group of the species is 21.0 - 21.9 inches. Although Yellow Perch abundance is average for the area, numbers caught this year indicate a tenfold increase since the assessment in 1981. This increase has ironically taken place despite a significant increase in Walleye abundance. Shore line seining also displayed good young of the year and yearling representation. The 1987 gill net catch for Walleye in Pearl Lake, (25.0/lift), is the highest in the three county area. A scheduled seven net survey was reduced to five after above average numbers were taken on days two and three of the field work. The Walleye catch has risen from 6.0/lift and 10.6/lift during the years 1975 to 1981, respectively. Dominant year classes of 3 and 6 year old fish directly correspond to major stocking years. Although there is some representation from non- stocked years (82 and 83), year class gaps in 1985 and 86 suggest spotty reproduction if any. Growth rates are average and individual condition appears to be good. Individuals ranging in size from 15 to 17.9 inches were most abundant in the catch, with 16.0-16.9 inch fish representing the modal length. Assessment of panfish populations through trap netting was difficult because shallow shoal water sets did not readily capture fish. Black Crappies were caught at a rate of 2.4/ trap net in Pearl Lake. Numbers caught from previous survey ranged from 0-2.9/trap net. The Pumpkinseed catch was 0.8/trap net and is presently below the lower quartile for the area. From the years 1975 to 1981, catch was 2.7/trap net to 2.2/trap net, respectively. Bluegill numbers have decreased in the catch, making a significant drop (14.0/trap net in 1981 to 5.9/ trap net in 1987). Growth of Bluegills is average suggesting that numbers may not be as low as they appear. Bowfin, White Sucker, Black, Yellow and Brown Bullheads are present in Pearl Lake. White Suckers are abundant at 9.2/gill net. Yellow Bullhead numbers have decreased since 1981 (53.6/lift to 7.9 lift) perhaps as a result of commercial fishing operations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is a 733 acre lake located one mile east of the City of Marty in southeastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 70% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. A public access is located on the north side of the lake. Pearl Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and special fishing regulations for these species began in 2009. Regulations include a 17 inch minimum size limit and 3 fish daily bag limit for Walleye, and a 24 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike (daily bag of 3, only one over 36 inches allowed). In addition to Walleye and Northern Pike, Pearl Lake provides anglers with the opportunity to catch Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked every other year and Walleye catches have been near or above the range of expected values for lakes like Pearl. The Walleye catch in 2015 was below the recent average, but still above average for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 26 inches and averaged 15 inches and 1.4 pounds. Walleye reached 12 inches in length at age 2 and 17 inches at age 5; 32 percent of Walleye were 17 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2015 was above the expected range of values and similar to the average from 1998 to 2013. Catches prior to 1998 were lower. Northern Pike ranged in length from 11 to 37 inches and averaged 20 inches and 2 pounds. Despite high numbers, Northern Pike size was good; 22 percent were longer than 24 inches and 9% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch from nighttime electrofishing in May was 26.6/hour (on time). Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 17.3 inches with a mean length of 13.4 inches. PSD was 97 and RSD 15 was 40. A new method was used in 2014 and 2015, so these catch numbers are not comparable to past surveys. However, past numbers for Pearl Lake have been above the Sauk Rapids Area average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were similar to other lakes like Pearl. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches and averaged 9 inches. The Bluegill catch was also within the expected range for lakes similar to Pearl. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.6 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches. Growth was average; Bluegill reached 7 inches in 4 years. Surveys in late summer likely underrepresent panfish abundance and size; nearshore surveys around spawning time would be more effective at representing the abundance and size structure of the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has historically been low, less than one fish per gill net or trap net since 1992. In 2014 and 2015, no Yellow Perch were sampled in either gill nets or trap nets. Yellow Perch numbers are likely limited by abundant Northern Pike. Other species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nA nearshore survey targeting smaller fish species was conducted in August using seining and backpack electrofishing. A total of 12 non game species were captured, including: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Spottail Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter are considered sensitive species and their presence indicates good water quality. <br> \n</p>",
