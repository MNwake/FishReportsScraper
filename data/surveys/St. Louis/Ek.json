Northern pike numbers were higher than usual for this lake type.  The average length was 21.8\", and the largest pike was 31.8\".  Yellow perch were abundant, but slow growing and small.  They were probably better suited to pike forage than to angler harvest.  Black crappie were also slow growing, but appeared to live long enough to become large enough to catch.  About 70% of the sample was over 8\", and 30% was over 10\".Pumkinseed and white sucker were collected in earlier surveys, but none were sampled in 1996.  Largemouth bass were stocked from 1949 to 1965, but were apparently unsuccessful at establishing a wild population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ek Lake is a small (89 acre) bog-stained lake located on the Kabetogama Peninsula of Voyageurs National Park.  The lake is within the National Park's proposed wilderness area and therefore motors are not allowed on the lake.  Ek Lake can be accessed via a short portage trail beginning at Lost Bay on the east end of Kabetogama Lake.  One Park maintained campsite is located on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community sampled in 2006 was simple.  Only four species were reported in the catch.  Northern pike was the top predator present in the lake.  Pike abundance (9.00/net) was high compared to other lakes in the same class and the average size (2.96 pounds) was also above average.  Pike ranged from 18.7 to 42.5 inches, but averaged 22.9 inches.  Other than two pike over 36 inches in length, the remaining catch were all less than 25 inches.  Growth of pike in Ek Lake is slow. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance (1.89/net) in this investigation was less than either 1979 (6.83/net) or 1996 (7.33/net).  The size structure of the black crappie population favored large individuals.  Lengths of crappie caught in this investigation ranged from 5.3 to 14.7 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  Fifty percent of the crappie caught however, exceeded twelve inches in length and 33% exceeded 13 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species reported in Ek Lake in small numbers include yellow perch, pumpkinseed and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ek is a 92 acre lake, located on the Kabetogama Peninsula in the Voyageurs National Park and 17 miles northeast of Ray, MN.  The lake has soft water and low productivity.  Over 80 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and the maximum depth is 19 feet.  Northern Pike are the primary focus of management and Yellow Perch are the secondary management species in Ek Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Average weight of Black Crappie in trap nets was about a half pound, which was well above what is found in 75 percent of lakes that are similar to Ek.  Black Crappie fishing has been popular on Ek Lake, especially in winter.  One thing that attracts anglers are the large Black Crappies present in Ek.  The largest crappie captured during the 2016 fisheries investigation was 14.8 inches.   Many year-classes were present (n=7) which should keep fishing consistent with time.  The 2014 year-class looked promising, representing 34 percent of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance and average weight were within the expected range for this lake type.  The largest fish sampled was 33.1 inches.  Recruitment of new fish was consistent; most year-classes from age 2-9 were represented.  Growth was well below the Area average.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",
