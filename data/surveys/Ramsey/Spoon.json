Ramsey County owns all of the shoreline and has created a county park that has ample shoreline fishing opportunities. A boat launch gives access to both Keller and Gervais Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are the main attraction on spoon Lake. Over 40% of the bluegills sampled during the 2007 survey exceeded 6 inches. Black crappies abundance has dropped since the last survey but is still within average numbers for this type of lake. The average size of black crappies sampled was 6.3 inches. Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, carp, and golden shiner. Although not sampled in this survey of Spoon Lake, walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and hybrid muskellunge are present in Gervais Lake, which is directly upstream.    <br> \n</p>",

Ramsey County owns all of the shoreline and has created a county park that has ample shorefishing opportunities. A boat launch gives access to both Keller and Gervais Lakes.Bluegills are the main attraction on Spoon lake. Over 40% of the bluegills sampled during the 2001 survey exceeded 6 inches. Black crappies are of average abundance, but are small. Other species sampled include pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish; black and yellow bullhead; and northern pike. Although not stocked in Spoon Lake, an occasional walleye or hybrid muskellunge are possible. These species are stocked in Gervais Lake which is directly upstream.</p>",
