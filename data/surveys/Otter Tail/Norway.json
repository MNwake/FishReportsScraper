                "narrative": "<p>     Norway Lake is a 384-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 63% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Norway Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 35 along the east shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A special \"conservation regulation\" is in effect for Norway Lake.  The regulations are:  a protected slot length limit for Largemouth Bass - 14.0 to 20.0-inches, with one over 20.0 inches in possession, a reduced bag limit for Sunfish - 5 fish, and reduced bag and length limits for Black Crappie - 5 fish in combination with a 10.0-inch minimum length limit.  Statewide limits apply for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n     Norway Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant game-fish species.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the quantity of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Data indicate that Largemouth Bass are abundant and that the population is well balanced.  Bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 15.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data indicate that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2012 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Black Crappie angling.  Seventy-seven percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance appears to be high due to consistent levels of reproduction.   Sixty-three percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 9.0 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was the highest recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 12.2 to 30.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 4.7 pounds. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     Norway Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

This was a severe winterkill; although, not complete.   <br> \n     Age and growth data indicates excellent growth for all principal game fish species.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance increased from 10.0 per gill net lift in the 1985 survey to 14.3 per gill net lift.  The average weight decreased from 2.9 lbs. to 1.8 lbs.  Age data indicate that all northern pike in the sample were from ages I+ to III+.  This verifies the observation made in 1985 that northern pike exhibit good growth and high mortality.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined to 4.5 per trap net lift; however, 90% of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.  The decline in abundance may be a function of the variability in the sampling and not a real decline in the population.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 114.6 per gill net lift in 1985 to 69.7 per gill net lift.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 5.0 per gill net lift, very similar to the 1985 survey. Average weight of walleye increased from 1.0 lbs. in 1985 to 2.5 lbs.  Walleye ages ranged from age-II+ to VI+, which corresponds with years the lake was stocked. There is no evidence of natural reproduction of walleye in Norway Lake. <br> \n</p>",

Abundance is average for walleye at 6.0/gillnet lift.  Caution should be taken to not overstock walleyes at the expense of the excellent northern pike population.  At most, walleye fry stocking should be done every other year.  <br> \n</p>",
