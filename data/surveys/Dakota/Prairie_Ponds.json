Bluegill and black crappie were stocked in 2005 and 2006.  Current abundance is moderate to high for both species, but size is small. Bluegill averge size was under 5 inches and crappie average was under 6 inches. Laremouth bass are also present and abundance appears to be moderate, with some nize-sized fish.  A 17 inch largemouth bass was sampled during this assessment.  Yellow perch, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Bluegill and Black Crappie were stocked in 2005 and 2006 and adult Bluegill only in 2014.  Current abundance is moderate to high for both species, but size is small. Bluegill average size was less than 5 inches and Black Crappie average was less than 7 inches. Green Sunfish are also present and abundance is average, however some nice-sized fish are available.  Yellow Perch and Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled in low numbers and small size.</p>",
