BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT IN WHAT COULD BE TERMED A LOW POPULATION LEVEL BASED ON THE CATCH DATA FALLING BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE. ALTHOUGH NET BIAS IS PRESENT, LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN AND FALLING ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE. IN BOTH THE 1982 AND 1986 SURVEYS, SIX GILLNETS SET AND SET LOCATIONS WERE REPEATED. BASED ON CATCHES FROM THESE SETS IT CAN BE SAID WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT BOTH THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS REMAINED SOMEWHAT CPE SAME. ANALYSIS OF NORTHERN PIKE AGE AND GROWTH INDICATES THAT YEAR CLASSES I-V AND VII ARE PRE- SENT WITH III BEING THE STRONGEST. GROWTH FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES AND FOR BACK CALCULATED LENGTHS WAS LIKEWISE COMPARED, SHOWS A SHIFT TO A NARROWER SIZE RANGE 4.5-18.9 INCHES VS. 8.5-16.9 INCHES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION APPEARS TO BE MUCH THE SAME NUMBERWISE, HOWEVER, A FEW 9-10 INCH FISH WERE SAMPLED IN 1986 WHEREAS THIS SIZE FISH WAS ABSENT IN THE 1982 SAMPLING. GROWTH OF FISH IN ALL SIZE CLASSES AS WELL BACK CALCULATED LENGTHS WAS GOOD. THE NORTHERN CISCO CATCH RATE FELL BET- WEEN THE FIRST THE THIRD QUARTILE AND GREATER THAN THE 1986 LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION HAS REDISTRIBUTED COMPARED TO 1982. THE 1986 DATA SHOWS 70% OF THE FISH BETWEEN 8.5-10.9 INCHES AND 23% BETWEEN 16.0-19.9 INCHES. IN 1982, 12% OF THE FISH WERE BETWEEN 8.5-9.4 INCHES AND 88% BETWEEN 14.0-20.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT IN 1982 WAS 1.8 PDS WHILE IN 1986 IT WAS 1 PD. BROWN AND YELLOW BULLHEADS WERE BOTH FOUND PRESENT. YELLOW BULLHEAD APPEAR TO BE MORE NUMEROUS THAN BROWN BULLHEADS EXCEEDING THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN BUT ARE LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. CONVERSELY, BROWN BULLHEAD ARE LOWER THAN BOTH STATEWIDE AND LOCAL MEDIAN FIGURES BOTH SPECIES HAVE A MEAN WEIGHT OF 6.7 POUNDS.</p>",

Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 16.5'.  Access is obtained through a channel from East Fox Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers when compared to similar lakes, at 10.3/gill net.  Average length was 21.2\", with 25% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern pike at least 26.0\" in length made up only 5% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked every third year into West Fox.  The walleye catch of 1.0/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes.  All walleyes sampled were from stocked years.  Walleyes were good size and ranged from 20.5\" to 28.4\", with an average of 23.1\".  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in above average numbers in gill nets at 2.7/net.  Average length was nice at 9.9\", with fish up to 13.1\" sampled.  Trap nets sampled black crappies in average numbers at 0.7/net.  Average length was 8.1\".  For both gears combined 70% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 10.7/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 4.3\".  Only 6% were at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in West Fox Lake, but they are located in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Fox can be accessed through a shallow channel from East Fox.  Most species were present in average numbers for this type of lake.  Those that appear to offer the best angling opportunities were northern pike and black crappie.  The northern pike population has steadily grown to the point where their numbers are now high (12.3/net).  Average length was 21.2\", with 25% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  We encourage anglers to release any northern pike they catch above 24\" to improve the size structure on this lake.  Black crappies were caught in good numbers in gill nets (3.0/net), with 57% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species weren't as impressive.  While bluegill numbers were average (15.2/net), size was small, with an average length of 4.1\" and only 4% of the fish 7\" or larger.  No electrofishing was done for bass, but of the fish caught in nets, 29% were 12\" or larger.  Walleye numbers would be considered average for this lake (1.6/net) and size was good, with an average length of 22.7\" and all but one fish over 19\".   All of these fish came from years in which stocking occurred, suggesting very little natural reproduction has occurred recently. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Fox Lake was conducted on August 15th, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including 10 species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eleven species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill (39%) and Hybrid Sunfish (23%) comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin (28%), Yellow Bullhead (15%), and Northern Pike (14%) comprised a majority by biomass. The number of Bowfin, Largemouth Bass, and Rock Bass sampled per net were all above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes. Conversely, the number of Brown Bullhead and Yellow Perch sampled per net were at the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in West Fox Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIn addtion, a temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on West Fox Lake on August 16th, 2022 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 25.2 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 12.8?C (55.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. Data collected in 1996-2019 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2008. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience lower levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Fox is a 472 acre lake located about two miles west of Fifty Lakes.  It adjoins 239 acre East Fox Lake.  West Fox has a maximum depth of 55 feet and about 29% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is generally at or slightly above average for the area.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand or marl, but some areas of gravel to boulder size rock are present, also.  Muck is found in marshy areas.  There is a fairly diverse aquatic plant community.  Emergent plants, like bulrush, are important for maintaining water quality and for increasing the quality of spawning habitat for fish like largemouth bass and panfish.  Submergent plants provide food and cover to a wide range of aquatic animals, including many fish species.Major game fish sampled in the 1996 test netting included northern pike, walleyes and largemouth bass.  Bluegill was the major panfish species sampled in '96.Walleyes have been stocked on a regular basis since 1979.  The 1996 catch was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes, but was lower than past net catches.  Several year classes were present.  Walleyes averaged 21 inches long and 3.1 lbs. in 1996, compared to 20 inches and 3.6 lbs. in 1991.Northern pike were caught in numbers \"average\" for the lake type and similar to catches in previous nettings.  The strongest of the four year classes sampled was 1993.  Due to the abundance of that year class in the catch, average size was 21 inches and 2.4 lbs. in 1996 compared to 24 inches and 3.9 lbs. in 1991.Largemouth bass were sampled in \"average\" numbers in 1996, but at a rate somewhat below that seen in the last two nettings.  Bass were not aged because the catch was too low.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in past nettings but not in 1996.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers when compared both to similar type lakes and past nettings of this lake.  Five age classes were sampled and showed slow growth.  Only about 5% of bluegills measured from trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length in '96, similar to 1991 netting results.  Black crappies were caught in \"low\" numbers in '96.  Previous catches were usually in the \"average\" range.  Crappies are sometimes difficult to sample in summer and tend to have wide fluctuations in abundance over a span of several years.Forage species that are important in West Fox include yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee.  Yellow perch were present in low numbers in 1996, similar to previous nettings.  Tullibees and white suckers were caught in \"average\" numbers in '96, as they have been in most previous nettings.Other species which were present in the '96 net catches included  bowfin (dogfish), common shiner, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  In general, net catches in West Fox were fairly similar to the results seen in adjoining East Fox Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Fox Lake is 472 acres and is located about two miles west of Fifty Lakes.  It adjoins 239 acre East Fox Lake.  The lake may be accessed through a channel from the public access on the west end of East Fox Lake.  Maximum depth is 55' and 29.2% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand and marl with some areas of gravel and boulder sized rock as well.  Marsh areas have primarily mucky soils.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes have been stocked as fingerlings on a regular basis since 1979 and are currently stocked every third year at a rate of 1lb per littoral acre (138lbs).  The 2001 walleye catch of 1.6/gill net is similar to 1996 and average when compared to similar lakes.  Year classes when stocking was not done accounted for 50% of the sample.  Compared to 1996, average length and weight decreased from 21.3\" and 3.1lbs to 18.5\" and 2.2lbs.Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers at a rate of 10.0/gill net, which is the highest of all nettings to date.  Previous catches have ranged from 1.3 to 4.2/gill net.  Average length and weight were similar to 1996 at 21.0\" and 2.1lbs.  Growth was considered to be average.The largemouth bass catch of 1.8/trap net was above average when compared to similar lakes.  Average weight was 0.2lbs and only two largemouth bass measured at least 12\".The 2001 bluegill catch of 36.1/trap net was comparable to similar lakes and past catches.  Bluegill growth was slow and 10.5% of bluegills sampled by trap net measured 7\" or larger compared to 4.5% in 1996.  Black crappie abundance was average at 0.9/trap net.  About 82% were from the 2000 year class, averaging 4.6\" in length.  Growth was average and one crappie was over 8\" compared to none in 1996.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibees are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch abundance remained below average for the fourth consecutive year at 0.1/gill net.  The white sucker catch was below average for the first time to date at 0.1/gill net.  Tullibee have been sampled in the past, but none were caught in 2001.</p>",

West Fox is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 1-2, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 5 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 3 sampling sites.  Eighteen species were sampled, including 7 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, least darter, blacknose shiner, logperch, mottled sculpin, banded killifish, and rock bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 29-August 1, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",
