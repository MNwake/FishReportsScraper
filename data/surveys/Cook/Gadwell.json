This survey was done with two gill net sets which sampled a total of 24 brook trout ranging in length from 9.8 to 16.4 inches (average length was 13.5 inches).  The catch of 12 brook trout per net was higher than the average of six per net seen in stream trout lakes in this area.  All fish were two years of age, from the fall 2013 stocking. Growth was good with sampled fish exceeding the area average for brook trout at age two by almost an inch. Possible forage fish were observed in the form of large schools of dace along the shoreline and a few brook trout regurgitated brook stickleback when handled. Brook trout were the only fish species sampled in the survey gillnets.  <br> \n\tGadwall Lake is a small designated stream trout located in the BWCA on a non-motor route.  Access is via a moderate-length but rugged portage trail from the south shore of Pine Lake. The field crew noted shore fishing opportunities provided by some foot paths around at least part of the lake, presumably made by anglers fishing from shore who chose not to carry their watercraft over the portage.  Caution should be used when crossing Pine Lake to access this lake as even a moderate West (or East) wind can produce large waves and dangerous conditions for canoeing on that lake.  <br> \n <br> \n  </p>",
