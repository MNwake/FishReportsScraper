                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is managed by the DNR as a bass / panfish / northern pike lake.  The lake sustained a partial winterkill in the winter of 1991-1992.  This was the first winterkill ever recorded for this lake.  While some species of fish were affected, the kill was not complete and some fish migrated in from connected waterways that did not winterkill.     As is typical of many post-winterkill situations, the numbers of black bullhead, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish were high in 1995.  These species can often survive when oxygen levels are too low for other species, and they thrive temporarily when competition from other species is reduced.     Numbers of bluegill sunfish were somewhat lower than in 1990 but were still within normal range for this lake class.  An unusually high percentage of the catch was in the eight to nine inch range.     Black crappie and white crappie are both present in the lake, although black crappie are far more abundant.  Numbers of black crappie are normal for this lake class.  Most crappies were 6-8 inches long, but some were up to 11 inches.       The largemouth bass population is thought to have been affected the most of any species by the winterkill.  Although no good population estimates were available for bass before 1995, anglers reported good bass fishing before the winterkill, and an absence of bass after.  Approximately 800 fingerling largemouth bass were stocked in the fall of 1993.  Night electrofishing in the spring of 1995 showed a catch of 3.4 bass per hour of electrofishing, which is low compared to other lakes in the area.  However, young-of-year largemouth bass were sampled by shoreline seining in late summer 1995, indicating that a sufficient spawning population is present.     Northern pike stocking from 1993-1995 has helped that population grow to above-average numbers for this lake class.  In the past, Horseshoe Lake had low numbers of northern pike due to limited natural spawning areas.  Most northern pike seen in test nets in 1995 were from 16-22 inches long, but a few 30+ inch northerns were seen.     Other species present in Horseshoe Lake include bowfin (dogfish), carp, golden shiner, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, tadpole madtom (a small member of the catfish family), and yellow perch; none of these species are overly abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a fertile, hard water basin of 197 acres.  The lake is managed for primarily northern pike.  The only stocking in recent years was after a partial winter kill in 1991-92 and consisted of fingerling largemouth bass and northern pike.       To evaluate lake management goals, a lake survey was conducted which included night electrofishing on May 19th, trap and gill netting from June 21st to June 24th, and shoreline seining on August 12th.     Anglers on Horseshoe Lake should encounter an assortment of fishing opportunities.  Good numbers of bluegill were present in variety of sizes.  Though few bluegill were over 7 inches, more than half exceeded 6 inches.  Northern pike numbers rebounded since the 2000 survey.  While not as abundant as in the 1995 nettting, they fell well within the normal range given the lake type and averaged 2.6 pounds.  Largemouth bass abundance and quality continues to increase.  Bass averaged 12.7 inches.  Black crappie numbers and size may not be acceptable to some anglers.  All sampled black crappie were less than 8 inches.      Shoreline seining indicated reproduction of bluegill, green sunfish, and largemouth bass.       Other species sampled during the survey include;  bowfin (dogfish), common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white crappie, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.     Horseshoe Lake receives moderate fishing pressure.  Anglers typically target bluegill, bass, and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In June, 1990, a lake survey was conducted on Horseshoe Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, five gillnets and four trapnets were set and three shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows:  \n  The northern pike net catch (1.00/set) was lower than the statewide median (4.50/set) and was below the first quartile (2.58/set).  The 1990 northern pike net catch was lower than the net catch of the previous survey in 1982 (2.40/set) and represented a real decrease in northern pike abundance.  The five northern pike that were captured ranged in length from 21.0 to 27.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0 to 23.9 inches and an average weight of 3.34 pounds.  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from three to six years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were below those typical of northern pike throughout the state, indicating below average growth.  \n  The bluegill net catch (48.50/set) was higher than the statewide median (25.00/set) but remained below the third quartile (65.80/set).  The 1990 bluegill net catch was lower than in the previous survey (30.00/set) but remained consistent with other, previous surveys.  The sub-sample of bluegills that were measured (103 of 194 captured) ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 6.5 to 6.9 inches and an average weight of 0.15 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from two to eight years with four, five, and six year old fish representing 24, 21, and 40 percent of the catch, respectively.  Average back-calculated lengths of all age classes were lower, particularly for older fish, than typical of bluegills throughout the state, indicating slow growth.  Natural reproduction was evident from the abundance of young-of-the-year and juvenile bluegills in the seine catches.  \n  The black crappie trapnet catch (2.50/set) was below the statewide median (5.25/set) but remained above the first quartile (1.75/set).  The 1990 black crappie trapnet catch was the lowest ever recorded for Horseshoe Lake; however, the gillnet catch (17.00/set) was the highest ever recorded and was substantially higher than the statewide median (3.50/set) and third quartile (10.00/set).  The black crappies ranged in length from 4.0 to 10.9 inches with a median length group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches and an average weight of 0.15 pounds.  Age analysis estimated that fish ranged in age from one to eight years with two year old fish (1988 year class) representing 62 percent of the catch.  In addition, the 1988 year class fish dominated the gillnet catch.  Average back- calculated lengths for all age classes were lower than typical of black crappies throughout the state, indicating below average growth.  Older age classes were just above lengths typical of crappies throughout the state.  Natural reproduction of black crappie in Horseshoe Lake was evident from the consistent year classes.  \n  The yellow bullhead net catch (4.75/set) was higher than the statewide median (1.60/set) but remained below the third quartile (5.00/set).  The yellow bullhead catch was also higher than in the previous survey (1.25/set) but remained within the range of previously recorded catches.  The yellow bullheads ranged in length from 7.0 to 11.9 inches with a median length group of 9.5 to 9.9 inches and an average weight of 0.47 pounds.  In contrast, the black bullhead net catch (0.25/set) was lower than the statewide median (5.83/set) and the first quartile (1.25/ set).  The 1990 black bullhead net catch was also the lowest ever recorded in Horseshoe Lake.  The brown bullhead net catch (1.25/set) was slightly higher than the statewide median (1.00/set) but remained below the third quartile (5.50/set).  The brown bullhead catch was lower than previously recorded in Horseshoe Lake, excluding the most recent survey (1982) when no brown bullheads were captured in the trapnets.\n  Two largemouth bass were captured in the gillnets during the survey.  One largemouth bass was captured in the trapnets.  An additional 43 young-of-the-year largemouth bass and 31 juvenile and adult largemouth bass were captured in the seine hauls.  Largemouth bass net catches and seine catches were consistent with previous surveys of Horseshoe Lake.  \n  The yellow perch catch rate (0.20/set; one perch captured) was lower than the statewide median (3.00/set) and was below the first quartile (1.50/set).  The yellow perch net catch was the lowest ever recorded in Horseshoe Lake.  \n  Six other species were captured during the survey (bowfin, golden shiner, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish).  The white sucker net (0.60/set) was lower than the statewide median (1.00/set) but remained above the first quartile (0.50/set).  The bowfin, golden shiner, and green sunfish net catches were below both their respective statewide medians and first quartiles.  The pumpkinseed catch rate (0.75/ set) was below the statewide median (1.78/set) and remained at the first quartile (0.75/set).  Overall, the catch rates of these additional species were consistent with the results of previous surveys on Horseshoe Lake.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a fertile, hard water basin of 197 acres.  The lake is managed primarily for bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappies and secondarily for northern pike.  The only stocking in recent years was after a partial winter kill in 1991-92 and consisted of fingerling largemouth bass and northern pike.            To evaluate lake management goals, a lake survey was conducted which included night electrofishing on May 17th, trap and gill netting from June 19th to June 22nd, and shoreline seining on September 1st.          Anglers on Horseshoe Lake should encounter a assortment of fishing opportunities.  High numbers of bluegill were present in variety of sizes.  Northern pike, while not as abundant as in the previous assessment, were still within the normal range given the lake type and averaged 2.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass increased dramatically since the 1995 assessment with some quality fish present.  Black crappie were present in acceptable numbers with many between 7 and 8 inches.  Black bullheads were by far the most abundant species and small in size.            Shoreline seining indicated reproduction of sunfish, largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.            Other species sampled during the survey include;  bowfin, golden shiner, blacknose shiner, common carp, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white crappie, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.          Horseshoe Lake has received light fishing pressure since the 1991-92 winter kill.  Anglers typically target bluegill, bass, and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a fertile, hard water basin of 197 acres assigned to lake class 24. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike. All populations are self-sustaining. Electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted in May and gill and trap nets were set in June 2017. The previous survey was conducted in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 3.67 fish per net was a decrease from the previous survey but typical for the lake class. Average fish size was slightly larger than the lake class median with individuals ranging from 18 to 35 inches and averaging 23.44 inches. Year classes from 2006 to 2012 were represented. With the exception of two larger fish, growth was fairly slow and may explain why no fish from more recent year classes were sampled (smaller Northern Pike are not as likely to be caught in the gill nets used). The population is very close to the long term management goals for this lake with respect to abundance and surpasses the goal for average size.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at a rate of 36.7 fish per net, a typical rate for the lake class and the historical catch for the lake. There was an increase in average size putting it near the 75th percentile for the lake class. Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8 inches long with a mean of 6.4 inches. The population is meeting the long range management goals set for abundance and size.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled below the first quartile in trap nets with 0.67 fish per net. The gill net catch was the higher than the last several surveys however at 5.5 fish per net. The crappie population in this lake has historically been fairly low. Despite low numbers, mean size was quite good with trap net fish averaging 8.3 inches and gill nets averaging 8. Individuals over 11 inches were sampled. Adult crappies may be more oriented to pelagic habitat in this lake resulting in poor sampling by trap nets. White Crappies have been sampled in low numbers in the past but none were detected in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was much lower than the previous surveys 13.6 fish per net with only 3.1 fish per net sampled in this survey. This puts abundance near the first quartile for the lake class. Mean size was much better and exceeded the third quartile for the lake class. Perch ranged from 6.3 to 10 inches and averaged 7.9 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNight time electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 73 fish per hour. This was a large increase over the previous survey but the quality size structure was maintained. Bass ranged from 6.1 to 20.2 inches in length and averaged 12.3 inches. This provides plenty of adult sized fish with good recruitment and a few individuals of trophy size.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were; Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Common Carp. <br> \n</p>",
