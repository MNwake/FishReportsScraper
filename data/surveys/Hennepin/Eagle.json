                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 291 acre (199 littoral acres), Class 24 lake located in the city of Maple Grove, Hennepin County.  Eagle Lake was first stocked with muskellunge in 1982 in an attempt to create a brood source lake for DNR muskellunge propagation program.   Eagle Lake was abandoned as a brood source due to poor netting results and the introduction of non-Leech Lake strain muskellunge, however Eagle Lake is still stocked at the brood density of 2 fingerlings/littoral acre in even years.  The minumum length limit on muskellunge in Eagle Lake is 48 inches.  The northern portion of Eagle Lake is an expansive shallow flat averaging 3 feet in depth.  This area of the lake is difficult to net due to the gently sloping shorelines and cattail fringe.  It is believed a large portion of the muskellunge population uses this part of the lake after ice-out, resulting in poor net catches in nets throughout the remainder of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nTen large frame trapnets were set the day after ice-out in an attempt to sample the muskellunge population and mark fish for a subsequent population assessment.  These nets were fished from 4/21/08 to 5/02/08.  Forty adult muskellunge, 11 females and 29 males, were sampled and marked with a top caudal clip (0.66 MUE/net night).  The leading edges of anal fins were removed from each fish in an effort to increase muskellunge aging accuracy.  Female muskellunge averaged 46 inches and 23.5 pounds, with the largest individual captured 49.8 inches.  Male muskellunge averaged 39.1 inches and 13.6 pounds with the largest individual captured 44.3 inches.  Five year-classes were represented in the trapnet catch (1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002) with the oldest age present age 14.  Eighteen (47%) of the muskellunge were age-10 originating from the 1998 year-class and 10 muskellunge were age 12, while only 3 and 4 individuals were age 6 and age 8 respectively.  The typical number of fingerling muskellunge stocked is 400, but in 1998 657 fingerlings were stocked.  It appears the larger number of fingerlings stocked in 1998 survived well.  The abundant number of age 10 and age 12 fish may be suppressing recruitment of younger fish into the adult population.  Male muskellunge growth in Eagle Lake through age 8 was average when compared to other Class 24 muskellunge lakes.  Female muskellunge length-at-age averaged 4.9 inches greater than average for Class 24 Lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBoat electrofishing was performed two weeks after completion of the trapnet survey over two nights in an attempt to recapture marked muskellunge for the calculation of a population estimate.   Surface water temperature during these two nights was 58F.  The \"hunting\" method was used to capture muskellunge.  This method entailed driving the boat slowly in shallow areas throughout the lake while the netters used large spotlights to find muskellunge.  Once a fish was spotted, the boat was maneuvered over the fish.  The electricity was not activated until the muskellunge was within the electrical field and in reach of the netters.  This proved to be very effective as the spotted muskellunge rarely spooked while the boat was being positioned and the muskellunge were only subjected to the electrical field for several seconds.  Most of the stunned muskellunge recovered while on the measuring board, and all muskellunge swam away forcefully when released.  Presence of an upper caudal clip indicated whether the muskellunge had been captured in previous trapnets.  All muskellunge captured during electrofishing were given a lower caudal clip.  Thirteen muskellunge were captured during the first night, none of which were trapnet recaptures.  The second night of electrofishing resulted in the capture of 10 muskellunge, 5 of which were trapnet recaptures.   The largest fish sampled was a 49.8 inch female.  A majority of the captured muskellunge were found in the shallow northern portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nTwo variances of the Peterson Estimator were used to calculate a population estimate.  The Chapman modification is calculated without replacement while the Bailey modification includes replacement during the recapture event.  The data used in the calculations was 40 marked fish, 23 caught fish, and 5 recaptured fish.  The Chapman estimator resulted in a population estimate of 163 adult muskellunge with 95% confidence limits of 78 and 378.  This estimate results in 0.56 adult muskellunge per surface acre.  The Bailey estimator resulted in a population estimate of 160 adult muskellunge with 95% confidence limits of 76 and 370.  This estimate results in 0.55 adult muskellunge per surface acre.  These density estimates are the highest found by MNDNR to date.  Muskellunge population estimates have been performed on 10 other lakes in Northern MN.  Density estimates from these lakes range from 0.07- 0.39 adult muskellunge per surface acre. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The present fish population of Eagle Lake is dominated by above average numbers of small panfish, however, an above average population for several gamefish species also exists.  Muskellunge and walleye are the primary management species for this lake and their populations are maintained through biennial stocking of fingerlings. Muskellunge were introduced in 1982 as part of a program to establish a broodstock source for the Leech Lake strain of Muskellunge. A 48 inch minimum harvest size was implemented to protect these adult fish through their prime egg producing years. None of the 3 Muskellunge captured during this assessment were above 48 inches in length. Northern pike were sampled at the highest net catch rate since 1983. The average size northern pike captured was 24.8 inches and 3.8 pounds. Growth rates for both Esocid species was found to be above average.  Walleye were sampled at the highest gill net catch rate ever recorded on this lake (7.8 fish/set). The average size of the walleye captured was 16.0 inches and 1.5 pounds. The improved population of walleye currently present is like a result of the change from fry to fingerling stocking in 1994. Walleye growth rates were found to be above average. Largemouth bass are also present, but only small individuals were sampled. Yellow perch (6.1\" average length) abundance was down slightly from that observed in 1993, but is still well above average for this lake type.  Bluegill were sampled within the normal range for abundance in this lake type, but at the highest catch rate ever observed for this lake. The average bluegill captured was only 5.5 inches long and 0.13 pounds. Less than 40 percent of all bluegill captured in this assessment were 6.0 inches or larger. Black crappie were also sampled in above average numbers by gill nets, but they too averaged small in size (6.2\" long and 0.18 pounds). Growth rates for bluegill and black crappie were found to be near average. Black and yellow bullheads were captured in record low abundance and a steady decline in catch rate for both species by both gear types has been observed since 1988. </p>",

The last survey completed in 2001 had about 7 walleye per gill net, but 70% of these fish were from one year class, 1996, when over 4,000 fingerling walleye were stocked.  None of these fish were observed in this survey.  Five age-1 walleye were captured and subsequent sampling should determine whether this year class is present in any numbers.  Unlike the walleye population, northern pike are abundant and good-sized in Eagle Lake.  A large number of these fish are 3 years old, over 28 inches long, and in fairly good condition (Wr=95).  Although no muskies were sampled during this survey, spring electrofishing crews noticed over 10 large muskies located in shallow water.  Bluegill and yellow perch in Eagle Lake are abundant, but primarily small.  A majority of these fish are under 7 inches.  Black crappie are not as abundant as bluegill or yellow perch, and have a little larger size.  Most individuals are over 7.5 inches TL and average about a quarter a pound in weight.  Largemouth bass were also sampled, but most were small individuals less than 8 inches TL.  Growth of all fishes appeared to be average for this lake type.</p>",

Eagle Lake offers a diverse sport fish community consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Since 1996, walleyes of differing sizes have been stocked on a regular basis: <br> \n <br> \n1996: 4831 fingerlings <br> \n1998: 1177 fingerlings; 424 yearlings <br> \n2000: 1324 fingerlings; 1054 adults <br> \n2001: 1300 fingerlings <br> \n2003: 1073 fingerlings <br> \n2005: 3500 fingerlings <br> \n <br> \nSince 2001, Eagle Lake has been part of a research project investigating the most effective walleye stocking regimes in moderate sized (200-1000 acre; class 23, 24, 25, and 31) Minnesota lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough pike numbers (9.3/gill net) are down from the 2004 assessment (13.0/gill net), they still were above average when compared to Minnesota class 24 lakes.  Fifty-six sampled pike averaged 22.0 inches and 2.5 lbs.  Fifty-seven percent of the population exceeded 21 inches.  Additionally, the number (N=10) of pike larger than 24.0 inches is down from the 2004 assessment (N=59).  One age-2 muskellunge measuring 21.2 inches was sampled by gill net.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye relative abundance increased from 1.0/gill net in 2004 to 3.8/gill net in 2006.  2006 walleye catch rates were average for class 24 lakes.  Sampled walleye (N=18) averaged 18.4 inches with the largest fish measuring 24.6 inches.  Thirty-five percent of the population exceeded 20 inches.  The 2008 population assessment will assess contributions of the 2005 fingerling stocking to the overall walleye population.  57% of sampled walleyes (N=23) were from the 2003 fingerling stocking (age-3).   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough yellow perch numbers were above average when compared to class 24 lakes, perch abundance (27.8/gill net) was down from the 2004 assessment (53.7/gill net).  Average length was 6.1 inches with the largest fish measuring 7.7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a productive 291-acre lake located in Maple Grove.  There is a DNR-owned public access on the northeast corner of the lake.  Muskellunge and walleye are the primary species of management and the lake is secondarily managed for largemouth bass.  The lake is stocked biennially with walleye and muskellunge on alternating years.  In July 2011, a population assessment was conducted to determine the size structure and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not effectively sampled with the gear used in the summer population assessments.  However, one 35-inch muskellunge was captured.   In the spring of 2008, an ice-out muskellunge population assessment was conducted with large trap nets.  In this assessment, 40 adult muskellunge (11 females and 29 males) were collected.  Female muskellunge averaged 46.0 inches and 23.5 pounds, with the largest individual captured measuring 49.8 inches.  Male muskellunge averaged 39.1 inches and 13.6 pounds with the largest individual captured measuring 44.3 inches.  Five year-classes were represented in the trapnet catch (1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002) with age 14 fish being the oldest sampled.  An estimated 163 adult muskellunge live in Eagle lake, which equates to 0.56 adult muskellunge per acre. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, walleye abundance in Eagle Lake has been as high as 7.8 per gill net and averages 3.5 per net.  However in the summer assessment of 2011, 3 walleye were sampled at a rate of 0.50 per net.  This is the lowest recorded abundance of the previous nine assessments.  Currently a study is being implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of different walleye stocking strategies in moderate sized (200-1000 acre; Class 23, 24, 25, and 31) Minnesota lakes.  The three walleye sampled were 20.5, 20.6, and 22.7 inches and averaged 3.1 lbs.  One was age-6, the other two were age-8.       <br> \n <br> \nTwo largemouth bass were collected during the assessment; however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  The data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance or size structure.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  The two bass were 5.4 and 6.2 inches in length.  A largemouth bass fishery is present in Eagle Lake, but the true status of the population can't be determined from this survey's small sample size. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were found at median levels (3.7/gill net) and below the long term average of 7.1 per net.  Pike averaged 27.1 inches and 4.5 lbs, with the largest measuring 32.9 inches and 5.9 lbs.  Ninety-three percent were 14 inches or longer, 83% were 21 inches or longer, and 36% were 28 inches or longer.  Overall, northern pike were in fair body condition.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9, with the 2005 and 2006 year classes representing 53% of the population.  Northern pike grew relatively fast compared to statewide averages.  Pike were 18.5 inches by age 3, 24 inches by age 5, and 30 inches by age 7.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has varied over previous assessments ranging from 0.5 to 63.0/gill net and averaging 10.8/gill net.  The same trend is true of trap net catch.  Currently the population is near Lake Class median levels (5.83/gill net) compared to other similar lakes.  For all fish sampled, black crappie averaged 7.1 inches and 0.17 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.8 inches and 0.34 lbs. Eighty-six percent were 5 inches or longer, and 32% were 8 inches or longer.  Crappie were in fair body condition, with the smaller fish in better condition than the larger.  Black crappie ranged in age from 1 through 6; however 59% were from the 2007 (age 4) year class.  Growth was near average, where fish were 6.9 inches by age 3, and 8.1 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is moderate (23.1 per trap net) and has remained relatively stable over the previous 4 assessments (mean = 33.9/trap net).  In 2011, bluegill averaged 5.4 inches and 0.12 lbs.  The largest measured was 7.4 inches and 0.26 lbs.  Twenty-seven percent were 6 inches or longer. Bluegill were in fair body condition, with the smaller fish in better condition than the larger.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 through 6 with the majority (53%) age 4 (2007 year class).  Thirty-eight percent were relatively equally divided among the 2006 and 2008 year classes.  Bluegill growth was near the state average, with fish reaching 4.6 inches by age 3 and 6.6 inches by age 5.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has been decreasing since 2004 (3 assessments since that time, mean = 35/gill net), but is still at a moderate level (11.5/gill net).  Yellow perch size structure is small, averaging 6.6 inches and 0.13 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.0 inches and 0.20 lbs.  Yellow perch were in fair body condition and condition did not vary by fish size.  Four year classes of yellow perch were sampled.  Age-4 perch were the most common (80%), followed by age 3 (14%), age 2 (4%), and age 7 (1%).  Growth was near the statewide average except for the age-7 individual ,where growth was slow.  Perch reached 5.7 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were golden shiner, pumpkinseed, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  It is important to note that due to the State government shutdown, the 2011 assessment was conducted two weeks later than most of the previous assessments of Eagle Lake.  It is unknown whether this affected the net catch of any species.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Fourteen species were sampled.  Fish species not present in gill nets and trap nets were Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, brook silverside, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, and golden shiner.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters can contribute to a low IBI score.  Eagle Lake contains several of these sensitive species; therefore, it scored 88.5 out of a maximum of 160, ranking it high compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area, but still indicating some impairment of water quality and habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 291-acre lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet. It is located in north central Hennepin County, in the city of Maple Grove. There is a DNR-owned public access on the northeast corner of the lake. Eagle Lake is actively managed for Muskellunge and Walleye, which are stocked to maintain the population. Eagle Lake also supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Eagle Lake during the week of 7/13/2020 to assess the fishery. During the 2020 survey, Eagle was highly productive (brown/green stained water), with poor water clarity, measured at 4.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 13 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil was confirmed present in Eagle Lake in 1992 and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2020 survey Walleye were captured with gill nets (2.0/net), near the expected catch rate compared to similar lakes in the area. There were 12 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 20.5 inches, a minimum size of 18.0 inches, and a maximum length of 23.7 inches. Growth rates were similar to the statewide average. Despite large sizes and adequate growth rates, zero Walleye were sampled between age 0 and 4. The missing year class (age - 3), matches up with the 2017 stocking that was limited due to a Walleye fingerling shortage. A full complement of Walleye were stocked in 2019, with these fish expected to contribute to the catchable fishery in 2-3 years (2021-2022).  Walleye in Eagle Lake are sustaining a catchable population despite stocking complications. Catch rates and size structure should be meeting or exceeding angler's expectations. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (7.7/net) above the expected catch rate of similar lakes. Although catch rates are down from the previous survey in 2016 (12.0/net), average size of Northern Pike has not increased. There were 46 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 23.1 inches and the largest measured at 31.9 inches. While numbers of pike have decreased from the previous survey, Eagle Lake still supports high abundances, which likely keep competition high and sizes low. Anglers can help control pike numbers through harvest. Effective 2018, anglers can keep 10 northern pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Eagle Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2020 survey due to COVID-19 sampling restrictions. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 5 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 10.9 inches and the largest measured at 14.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo Muskellunge were sampled in the summer fisheries survey; such under-sampling is typical with standard Lake Survey nets/techniques. However, angler reports reflect establishment of a viable, consistent muskellunge fishery with a desired size structure. Targeted sampling is intended for the next survey (scheduled for 2025 + 1 yr). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled with gill nets (29.2/net), above the expected catch rate. Average size of Yellow Perch in the 2020 survey was 5.9 inches, with the largest measured at 7.3 inches. Yellow Perch are seldom utilized as a sport fishery in the Metro area due to small sizes. Despite providing limited fishing opportunity, Yellow Perch provide an important forage component for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral panfish species (Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie) were all sampled at high rates during the 2020 survey. Trap net catches for Bluegill (51.3/net), Pumpkinseed (14.7/net) and Black Crappie (7.6/net) exceeded their expected catch rates compared to similar lakes. High numbers, likely affected growth potential and overall size of these species. Bluegill sampled in trap nets averaged 5.3\" with the largest measured at 7.9\", Pumpkinseed averaged 5.1\" with the largest measured at 7.8\", while gill net and trap nets captured Black Crappie averaging 7.2\" with the largest measured at 9.5\". The high number of predators in the system may also be impacting the overall size and abundance of panfish. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 291-acre lake located in north central Hennepin County, in the city of Maple Grove. There is a DNR-owned public access on the northeast corner of the lake. Eagle Lake is actively managed for Muskellunge, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass. Present long-range goals look to: 1) establish and maintain quality Muskellunge and Walleye fisheries through stocking (400 Muskie fingerlings stocked in even-numbered years and 400 pounds of Walleye fingerlings in odd-numbered years). Eagle Lake also supports catchable populations of Northern Pike, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie. A standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Eagle Lake during the week of 7/5/2016 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Spring nighttime electrofishing was also completed during 2016 to sample Largemouth Bass. Eagle Lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet. During summer sampling, dissolved oxygen dropped to 0 parts per million at depths greater than 14 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Eagle Lake were sampled with gill nets at a catch rate of 4/net, which accomplishes long-range management goals. Walleye numbers have fluctuated from 0.5 to 7.8/net in the last 25 years, although it appears the current stocking regime is producing desired results. Of the 24 Walleye caught, fish averaged 11.6\" with a maximum length of 24.9\". Size structure shows a balanced population with good numbers of small fish and fewer numbers of larger individuals. Body condition of sampled Walleye was normal. All Walleye year classes correspond with stocked years, suggesting little to no natural reproduction is occurring. Walleye are reaching 13\" by age 3, indicating moderately fast growth rates. Catch rates, size structure, and condition are meeting or exceeding management goals and should provide good angling opportunity into the future. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in 2016 with spring nighttime electrofishing (28.5/hour) which was a substantial increase from the 2004 catch rate (17.9/hour). Average size also increased in 2016, with an average length of 11.4\" and maximum length of 18.9\". Age analysis suggests consistent recruitment among years with fish from every year class since 2007 sampled. While the population of Largemouth Bass in Eagle Lake may currently be lacking the largest individuals (20\"+), good body condition indicates fish are healthy and have the potential to reach larger sizes. Largemouth Bass abundance, size structure, and body condition are currently at or above historical levels and should provide good angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nNo Muskellunge were sampled in the summer fisheries survey; such under-sampling is typical with standard Lake Survey nets/techniques. Targeted sampling is intended for the next survey (scheduled for 2021 + 1 yr).  Recent results of the Metro Muskie Tournament reflect presence of fish over 45 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Eagle Lake have varied (range since 1993 of 2-13 per gill net), periodically with big fluctuations. The 2016 survey captured Northern Pike at a rate of 12.0/net, nearing the all-time high and a large increase from 2011 (3.7/net). Northern Pike averaged 22.8\" with a maximum size of 33\", with 57% of fish sampled greater than 21\". High numbers of Northern Pike may create problems for other top predators such as Muskellunge and Walleye, as the Northern Pike directly compete with these species for resources. Current numbers and sizes of Northern Pike, coupled with the proposed changes to the statewide Northern Pike regulations, should provide plenty of angling opportunity now and into the future. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral panfish species (Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie) were all sampled at high numbers compared to similar lakes across the state. Trap net catches for Bluegill averaged 27.2/net, with Pumpkinseed averaging 4.1/net, while gill net catches of Black Crappie averaged 14.7 fish/net.  High densities, combined with competition factors, likely affected growth potential and overall size of these species. Bluegill sampled in trap nets averaged 5.9 inches with the largest measured at 7.8 inches, Pumpkinseed averaged 6 inches with the largest at 7.4 inches.  Gill nets captured Black Crappie averaging 7.3 inches, with the largest individual sampled at 8.7 inches. The high number of predators in the system may also be impacting the panfish population. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, and Shorthead Redhorse (a species not typically found in lentic environments).  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 40 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 75.0 (+/- 3.3) out of 100 possible indicating moderate shoreline condition. Approximately 40 percent of the sites were developed with a much lower mean score of 58.5 (+/- 5.0) compared to undeveloped sites with a mean score of 86.0 (+/- 2.5).</p>",

Walleye averaged 23.1 inches long and 4.6 pounds, while northern pike averaged 26.2 inches and 4.3 pounds each. Growth rate for both species is good. No walleye smaller than 19.5 inches were captured during this survey indicating that recent fry stockings have done little to contribute to the fishery. Six Muskellunge were captured ranging in size from 21.6 to 43.3 inches in length. Minimum legal harvest length is 48 inches long on Eagle Lake. Bluegill and black crappie were also sampled within the normal range for abundance. The average length for bluegill captured is 5.6 inches, with the larger fish (6.4 inch average length) found in deeper water. Black crappie also were small in size with the average sampled fish being less than 6.5 inches long. Growth rate for both species was found to be slow. Anglers report the presence of some quality LMB, but only smaller sizes were captured in this survey during shoreline seining. Black bullhead are present in above average numbers with an average length of 10.1 inches. Brown and yellow bullhead are also present but in lesser abundance. Yellow perch are above average in abundance, but below average in size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Eagle Lake was conducted on June 29th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but five stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter), and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 13th, 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
