The lake contained 81 homes/cabins along 6.4 miles of shoreline during the 2005 survey.Walleyes have not been stocked into Big Pine since 1993.  The walleye catch rate (3.0/gill net) was average in 2005 when compared to similar lakes.  Average size was 19.7\" and 2.6 lbs.  All of the fish were over 12\".The northern pike catch rate was in the average category (4.0/gill net).  Average size was 20.7\" and 2.2 lbs., with 15% of the fish being 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass gill net catch rate was high in gill nets (1.0/net).  Average size was 14.3\" and 1.8 lbs.  The trap net catch rate was in the average category (0.4/net).  Average size was 12.3\" and 1.4 lbs.  When both net types were combined, 86% of the fish were 12\" or larger.The black crappie catch rate was low in both gill nets (0.7/net) and trap nets (0.2/net).The bluegill catch rate was average (22.2/trap net).  Average length was 5.4\" and only 6% of the fish were 7\" or larger.The yellow perch catch rate was average (7.7/gill net).  Average length was 6.2\" and none of the fish were 8\" or larger.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Other fish species captured during seining included banded killifish, brook silverside, bluntnose minnow, Iowa darter, and Johnny darter.</p>",

Development is heavy on this lake, as it is located in a popular, desireable area.In 1995, northern pike were found in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes and have remained at a similar density since the 1986 survey.  A variety of sizes were sampled and 25% were at least 24 inches in length.  Six year classes were present and pike growth was good.  Walleyes and black crappies were sampled in \"low\" numbers, however, their catch rates were similar to the 1986 catches.  Yellow perch were sampled in \"average\" numbers for this type of lake and their growth was also good.  The bluegill sample was \"average\" compared to similar lakes and they had good growth rates.  Largemouth bass were taken in \"high\" numbers and had good growth.  Brown bullheads and bowfin (dogfish) were also sampled in \"high\" numbers.  Shorthead redhorses, silver redhorses, rock bass, white suckers, pumpkinseeds and yellow bullheads were sampled in \"average\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a reservoir of the Pine River just south of Crosslake, MN.  The rock dam that created Big Pine Lake built in 1970 that has required frequent costly repairs was replaced in the winter of 2020 with an arched-rock-rapids-style dam that allows for fish passage.  This was made possible by a $1.2 million grant from the Outdoor Heritage Fund and the cooperation of many partners, led by Crow Wing County.  Much of the lake is less than 10' deep, with one small hole reaching 17'.  Heavy vegetation is found in much of the lake.  Water clarity is good, with a secchi disk reading of 12'. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 5.7/gill net when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 23.0\", with 59% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Fish over 26.0\" made up 18% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average number in gill nets (2.0/net), and had an average length of 6.2\".  Trap nets captured black crappies in low numbers at 0.4/net.  Average length was 8.1\".  For both gears combined 50% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 5.4/trap net.  Average length was 5.9\", with 22% measuring at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nBig Pine Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested water because of zebra mussels and Eurasian milfoil.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowfin and northern pike net catches indicate populations that are above the regional average because net catches were above the third quartile of the regional median. White sucker, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye net catches per unit effort fell between the first and third quartile of the regional median, thus indicating an average population. Black bullhead, brown bullhead and bluegill were below the first quartile of the regional median indicating a below regional average population. Lake whitefish and shorthead redhorse catch rate was above the statewide median. Silver redhorse catch effort was below the statewide median. Three gillnets were set July 26- 27, 1967 and August 11-12, 1981 and 1986. Based on catch per unit effort, no significant change in population took place in any of the lake survey years for northern pike or yellow perch. The age classes in net catches for northern pike were 1-5, with age classes 2 and 3 possessing 17 out of 22 fish. The northern pike in Big Pine averaged 14.5 inches at annuli 2 and 26.4 inches at annuli 5. The median length was 18.4 inches and weighed 1.5 lbs. The median length in 1981 was just under 18 inches, while in 1967 it was 22.9 inches. The 1981 and 1967 surveys had 5 and 10 northern pike 26 inches and up in the nets. The 1986 lake survey had two fish 26 inches and up. Black, yellow and brown bullhead each had mean weights of 0.7 lbs. Yellow bullheads was the predominate bullhead specie, had only one fish over 12\" in length, none of the other bullheads had any. Only four rock bass were caught and had a length-frequency range of 4.5-7.4 inches. Bluegill abundance is very low with age classes 3-5 present in the nets. Growth was average for age class 3, and below average for 4 and 5 when compared to statewide averages. Largemouth bass were taken in low numbers with age class 4 averaging 9.0 inches at annuli 4 and showing a slow growth rate. Age class 5 averaging 11.9 inches at annuli 5 and showing average growth rate. Age classes 3 and 4 were present in the black crappie net catches and both had average growth rates. The mean weight of the fish was 0.56 lbs. Yellow perch have size ranging from 5.0-9.9 inches, with the most common mode being the 6-inch group. Three walleye were caught. One belonged to age class 4 and was 13.5 inches at annuli 4 which is average growth. The other two fish were of age class 5 and were 17.2 inches at annuli 5, again exhibiting average growth rate compared to the statewide mean growth rate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a 324 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 17', located 20 miles north of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  Big Pine is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on July 12, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 5 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 4 sampling sites.  Fourteen species were sampled, including 4 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, pugnose shiner and smallmouth bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on August 19-21, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",
