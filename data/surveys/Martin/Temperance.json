BIB ARE ALSO DOING WELL AT 15 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BLB WERE CAUGHT AT ABOUT HALF THE LOCAL MEDIAN, WITH LENGTH-FREQUENCY INDICATING TWO STRONG YEAR CLASSES.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT LOW BLH CPUE OCCURS HERE WITH HIGH PERCH CPUE.  THIS INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCH AND BLH HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN SOME OTHER LOCAL LAKES.  YEB WERE SAMPLED AT RATES CLOSE TO LOCAL MEDIANS. CARP AND WTS CATCHES WERE CLOSE TO LOCAL MEDIANS IN GILLNETS.  BUT SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN LOCAL MEDIANS IN TRAPNETS.

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nTemperance Lake is a 176-acre lake located just east of the City of Sherburn in Martin County.  Temperance Lake is shallow, having a maximum depth of 5 ft. Due to its shallowness, the lake is prone to low oxygen levels in the winter. The last recorded low oxygen event occurred during the winter of 2008-2009; however, it was determined that the low oxygen had minimal effects on the fish population. Although Temperance Lake is located near the top of the watershed, the water quality during the survey was poor as the secchi depth was 0.5 ft. The poor water quality is likely a result of nutrient runoff from nearby agricultural fields. The practically unlimited nutrient supply provides an environment in which microscopic organisms such as algae can thrive, resulting in extreme algae blooms. The lake bottom sediments could also be disturbed by wind action due to the lakes shallowness or by benthic omnivores such as common carp, both contributing to the poor water quality. Temperance Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch. Northern pike are stocked at a rate of 20 fingerlings per acre once every three years and have been stocked in 2005, 2008, and 2011 and are due to be stocked in 2014 if available. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 23, 2013 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nCatch rates of northern pike have varied greatly in Temperance Lake, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 1996 to 48.5 per gill net in 1991 and from 0.7 per trap net in 1996 to 17.6 per trap net in 1991. Record high catch rates were observed in 1991, the result of a very successful naturally reproduced year class. The 2013 trap net catch rate was up from the previous survey in 2007, increasing from 1.3 per trap net in 2007 to 5.2 per trap net in 2013. Size structure of trap netted northern pike was small, as they ranged in length from 18.5 to 25.4 inches and averaged 22.9 inches. Northern pike were skinny. It does not appear that prey is limited in this system, as yellow perch were captured at a rate of 29.0 per gill net, which is above the expected catch rate for similar lakes. The below average weights of northern pike may be related to increased stress levels during the growing season, caused by warm water temperatures during the summer, as northern pike are a cool water species that can be sensitive to increased water temperatures. The northern pike in Temperance Lake are likely fish that were stocked; however, natural reproduction has been documented in previous years, making it a possibility that they were naturally spawned in the lake. The availability of northern pike spawning habitat is often influenced by the amount of precipitation. Successful spawning is likely limited to years with above average precipitation when water levels are high enough to inundate vegetation. The current stocking regime appears to be effective at providing a fishable northern pike population and should be continued. Northern pike could be an easy target for anglers because of the small size of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \nGill net catch rates of yellow perch in Temperance Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 29.0 per gill net in 2013 to 161.0 per gill net in 1991 and averaging 80.0 per gill net since 1991. In 2013, the catch rate of yellow perch was 29.0 per gill net, which is the lowest observed gill net catch rate for Temperance Lake; however, the catch rate exceeded the expected catch rate range (2.7 per gill net to 25.0 per gill net) for similar lakes indicating that the yellow perch population is doing well. The 2013 trap net catch rate also exceeded the expected catch range (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net) for similar lakes, which is also indicative of an abundant population given that trap nets typically do not sample yellow perch well in the August heat. Yellow perch were small ranging in length from 4.8 to 8.9 inches and averaging 6.1 inches. Although the small size structure of yellow perch is not desirable for angling, it does provide a great forage base for the northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nCommon carp were captured at a rate of 27.0 per gill net in 2013, which is high when compared to similar lakes and is the highest catch rate observed for Temperance Lake. The trap net catch rate of common carp was 2.3 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net). Common carp ranged in length from 12.2 to 28.2 inches and averaged 16.8 inches. The poor water quality in Temperance Lake is likely somewhat attributable to the abundant common carp population, as carp tend to uproot vegetation and stir up sediments when feeding. The common carp population will likely be abundant until a severe winterkill event occurs.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were captured at a rate of 30.0 per gill net which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Black bullheads have never been a problem in Temperance Lake, as the highest catch rate recorded was 46.0 per gill net in 1991. Gill netted black bullheads ranged in length from 6.9 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSince the initial survey in 1991, bigmouth buffalo gill net catch rates have exceeded the expected range of catch rates (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net) for similar lakes. The 2013 catch rate followed this trend as bigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 9.0 per gill net. The bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 4.1 to 28.4 inches and averaged 18.5 inches. It appears bigmouth buffalo had a successful spawning season, as young-of-the-year (YOY) buffalo were sampled in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included white sucker, yellow bullhead, and black crappie. In addition to these species, a near shore survey conducted after the population assessment sampled fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish. Young-of-the-year black bullheads, orangespotted sunfish, and yellow perch were extremely abundant, indicating that ample forage exists in Temperance Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperance is a 176 acre lake with a maximum depth of 5.0 feet located near Sherburn in Martin County.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  A survey was conducted during the week of 07/30/2001 using eight trapnets while shoreline seining was done on 09/05/2001 to check for natural reproduction of all fish species.The abundance of northern pike was fair compared to lakes like Temperance.  Some northern pike sampled were in the 19 to 27 inch range but most of the pike were young of the year from 8 to 10 inches.  The young of the year northern pike were either from natural reproduction or they immigrated in from downstream.The abundance of yellow perch was high compared to lakes like Temperance.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 10.4 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Growth of the yellow perch in Temperance must have been quite good since the survey.  We had reports of good yellow perch fishing during the winter of 2001 and 2002 with lengths in the 8 to 9 inch range.The abundance of black bullhead was low compared to lakes like Temperance.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 7.2 to 10.3 inches with an average length of 9.1 inches.Shoreline seining indicated natural reproduction of bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, and yellow perch.Other fish species sampled during the survey included creek chub, golden shiner, fathead minnow, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Temperance through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperance Lake covers 176 acres and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by undeveloped woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  The near shore areas are dominated by sand substrate.  Although the majority of the lake lacks aquatic vegetation, some emergent vegetation is located primarily on the west end of the lake.  Because Temperance Lake is relatively small and shallow and susceptible to winter fish kill events, active fisheries management has been limited in the past.  With the construction of a modern public access in 1996, future interest in the lake will likely increase.  An up-to-date fisheries management plan is currently being devised for Temperance Lake with the fisheries information collected in 1991 and 1996.Northern pike numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Pike collected in trapnets ranged in length from 18 to more than 31 inches with an average length of 24 ? inches.  The current population is supported through natural reproduction and immigration.  To improve the natural migration of northern pike into Temperance Lake, plans are currently being devised to modify a fish barrier downstream.Yellow perch numbers remain high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 4 to almost 10 inches with an average length of approximately 6 inches.  Perch growth appears slow in Temperance Lake which is expected for a high population.  Data collected in 1996 suggest yellow perch reproduce naturally.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1991.Temperance Lake also supports populations of black and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead numbers are considered normal.  Black bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 5 to 10 ? inches with an average length of almost 8 inches.  Although less abundant than black bullhead, the yellow bullhead population is considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 5 ? to 11 inches with an average length of almost 9 inches.Carp and bigmouth buffalo numbers are comparable to the survey conducted in 1991.  Carp numbers are considered normal whereas bigmouth buffalo numbers remain high.Other species observed during the 1996 survey include white sucker, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and fathead minnow.Temperance Lake does not currently have an aeration system in place.  Although an aeration system does not always guard a lake from low dissolved oxygen levels and subsequent winter fish kills, it could prove effective in Temperance Lake during years which might otherwise \"freeze out.\"  Aeration systems are normally sponsored by the county in which the lake is located or by local sportsman's clubs.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Temperance Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nTemperance Lake is a 176-acre lake located just east of the City of Sherburn in Martin County.  Temperance Lake is shallow lake, having a maximum depth of 5 ft. Due to its shallowness, the lake is prone to low oxygen levels in the winter. The last recorded low oxygen event occurred during the winter of 2018-2019; however, it was determined that the low oxygen had minimal effects on the fish population. Although Temperance Lake is located near the headwaters of the watershed, the water quality during the survey was poor as the water clarity was only 0.6 ft. The poor water quality is likely a result of nutrient runoff from nearby agricultural fields, stirring of sediment from common carp, and mixing of the lake bottom by wind events. The virtually unlimited nutrient supply provides an environment in which microscopic organisms, like algae, can thrive resulting in extreme algae blooms.  Temperance Lake is managed for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Northern pike are stocked at a rate of 20 fingerlings per acre once every three years and have been stocked in 2005, 2008, and 2011. No Northern Pike were stocked in 2014 or 2017 due to low production of fingerlings in rearing ponds and a high population in the 2013 survey.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 19, 2019 to monitor fish populations using 1 gill net and 6 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nCatch rates of northern pike fluctuate a lot in Temperance Lake, ranging from 0 per gill net in 2019 to 48.5 per gill net in 1991. Record high catch rates were observed in 1991, the result of a naturally reproduced year class. The 2019 trap net catch rate was down from the previous survey in 2013, decreasing from 5.2 per trap net to 0.3 per trap net. Size structure of trap netted northern pike favored larger fish, as the 2 fish were 27.6 and 27.8 inches.  The northern pike in Temperance Lake are likely fish that were stocked in 2011; however, natural reproduction has been documented in previous years, making it a possibility that they are naturally spawned fish. The availability of northern pike spawning habitat is often influenced by the amount of precipitation that floods plants near shore for fish to spawn in towards the end of March or beginning of April.  The current stocking is maintaining some Northern Pike in the lake, but stocking will be used to boost the population.  Northern Pike fingerling will be stocked in 2020 to help increase the population provided the rearing ponds produce.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nGill net catch rates of Yellow Perch in Temperance Lake have been up and down, ranging from 29 per gill net in 2013 to 348 per gill net in 2019.  In 2019, the catch rate of Yellow Perch was 348 per gill net, which is the highest gill net catch for Temperance Lake.  This comes after the 2013 survey which had the lowest catch rate.  Size of the Yellow Perch was above average for southwest Minnesota.  Yellow perch ranged in length from just over 5.5 inches to just shy of 10.5 inches and they averaged 7.5 inches.  The size range of Yellow Perch is perfect for anglers, especially over the next year or two as they grow.  Yellow perch were plump indicating they are finding adequate food.  Angling for Yellow Perch should be good, if and when they bite, over the next few years.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOther species sampled in 2019 were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker were caught within the expected catch rate ranges.  Black Bullhead ranged in length from just over 6.5 inches to just shy of 11 inches and averaged nearly 9.5 inches indicating they may be large enough to target by anglers looking for some Black Bullhead to eat.  Bigmouth Buffalo were caught slightly more than the expected catch rate range.  Bigmouth Buffalo, along with Common Carp, can negatively impact lakes when they are at high abundance by suspending sediment that muddies the water with nutrients and chemicals that negatively impact water quality.  Only 1 Green Sunfish and 4 Orangespotted Sunfish were caught, so not much can be said about them.  They are typically found in and around rocks near shore if anglers wish to target Green Sunfish and Orangespotted Sunfish.    <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY    <br> \nOverall, Temperance Lake is typical of what is seen in southwest Minnesota when the lake is highly degraded and extremely shallow.  The DNR often sees highs and lows in gamefish populations in these lakes, which is limited to Northern Pike and Yellow Perch for Temperance Lake.  The DNR also observes undesirable species like Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Black Bullhead dominating the fish community.  Those three species together in Temperance Lake made up 53% of the gill net sample and 65% of the trap net sample by weight.  On a positive note, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch tend to do well in shallow prairie lakes that are susceptible to low dissolved oxygen in the winter, like Temperance Lake.  It appears that the Northern Pike and particularly the Yellow Perch populations are doing well and will provide a great angling opportunity over the next few years.        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperance Lake, near Sherburn, is a shallow bowl shaped lake located in Martin County.  This relatively small lake, near the top of the watershed, has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  The lake has had a history of low dissolved oxygen because of it\u0019s shallowness, shape, and lack of aeration.  Most of the shoreline remains undeveloped and has a narrow fringe of hardwoods.  However, within the last 5 years there has been some interest in developing some of the shoreline.  Temperance is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch, which tend to be more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 13, 2007 using 8 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was similar to the previous assessment.  The catch rate for northern pike in trap nets was 1.25/set, which was lower than expected.  Total lengths ranged from 17.7-29.5 inches with an average of 22.2 inches.  Most of the northerns sampled (70%) were 2 years old, which may have come from a fingerling stocking (761 fish) in 2005.  The highest catch rate occurred in 1991, which was from natural reproduction and consisted primarily of Age 0 fish.  Seasonal weather patterns often dictate the availability of northern pike spawning habitat and thereby influence their numbers.  Given the lakes size, there is a good chance that anglers could successfully target northern pike during mid-summer near any cool water refuge (tile inlet, emergent vegetation, deepest point in the lake). <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was the lowest ever seen on Temperance Lake, but was still nearly 3 times that of other Windom Area lakes.  Total lengths ranged from 3.9 to 9.9 inches with a mean of 6.8 inches.  While yellow perch numbers were down at the time of the survey, the size of fish may be worth some of those limited fishing hours in a year or so. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were the highest documented in 3 previous assessments.  The average length bullhead was 7.9 inches.  Temperance may be a good choice to take a kid fishing because of the likely good action and the availability of shore fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were once again sampled since the initial survey in 1991.  Their numbers were within the expected range and averaged 7.4 inches.  Black crappie, of all the species sampled, had the best overall condition, which suggests the crappies are plump and healthy.  Given their condition and numbers, crappie fishing may improve sooner rather than later.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 sampled 9 species compared to 14 species in 2001.  Other species sampled were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n  <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",
