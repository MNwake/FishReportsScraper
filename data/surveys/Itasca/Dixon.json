                "narrative": "<p>Dixon Lake is in ecological lake class #34 and in the Mississippi River Watershed (#7).  Lakes in this classification are of moderate size and depth and have hard water.  Dixon has a surface area of 616 acres, a littoral area of 478 (78%) acres and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  The Secchi disk reading was 5.5 feet in this assessment.  Dixon Lake is managed as a walleye lake and is currently stocked with walleye fry every three years.     Northern pike abundance has remained stable over many years.  They were sampled at 6.1/gill net in this assessment, above the lake class median.  The fish ranged in length from 13.5 to 29.3 inches and had a mean length of 18.8 inches.  They had a mean weight of 1.4 pounds.  Many of the northern sampled (67%) were between 16 and 19 inches.      The walleye population in Dixon Lake has been influenced by emigration and immigration from Lake Winnibigoshish, experimental regulations, stocking and natural reproduction.  This assessment evaluated a period of stocking and the installation of four artificial walleye spawning riffles in the upstream portion of the Third River.  Walleye were sampled at the lake class median of 2.7/gill net and near the 3rd quartile of 0.8/trap net.  Nine year classes were represented in the gill net catch.  Twelve of the 30 walleye (40%) sampled were from stocked years (1998 and 2001). They ranged in length from 8.1 to 24.8 inches and had a mean length of 16.2 inches.  The mean weight of those sampled was 1.7 pounds.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages (within 15%) for all age groups.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate (10.8/set) was the lowest observed in any previous assessment and just below the lake class median.  Perch sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 5.5-11.7 inches and had a mean length of 8.6 inches.             The bullhead species have historically been abundant in Dixon Lake.  In this assessment, brown bullhead were sampled at 11.5/gill net and black bullheads at 9.2/gill net.  The brown bullhead ranged in length from 7.2 to 13.7 inches.  The black bullheads ranged in length from 7.3 to 11.4 inches.  Yellow bullheads were also sampled but at only 0.3/gill net       The black crappie trap net catch of 0.9/set and gill net catch of 0.6/set was near the 1st quartile for this lake class. All crappie captured in the trap net were aged at one year old.  They ranged in length from 4.3 to 4.9 inches. In the gill net they ranged in length from 4.4 to 13.2 inches.  Four of these were also aged at one year old.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages.     Other species sampled were bluegill, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, bowfin and white sucker.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Past sampling has indicated panfish populations in Dixon Lake had low to moderate population densities with quality size structure.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  Targeted surveys for panfish were conducted in the spring of 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2023 to monitor trends in the panfish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, a total of 147 Bluegill were sampled, ranging from 3.4 to 10.3 inches, with an average length of 7.3 inches.  The Bluegill catch rate was 3.3/trap net and has ranged from 0.4 - 3.9/trap net in previous targeted surveys.  Like past years, quality size Bluegill were present in the survey with fish over 10 inches observed.  Bluegill averaged 7.8 inches after 4 years of growth, which is similar to previous surveys and above average compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 99 Black Crappie were sampled ranging from 5.7 to 14.1 inches, with an average length of 9.1 inches.  The Black Crappie catch rate was 2.2/trap net and has ranged from 1.5 - 2.5/trap net in previous targeted surveys. Like Bluegill, size structure was good and fish larger than 14 inches were noted.  Crappie averaged 8.7 inches after 4 years of growth which is similar to previous surveys and average compared to similar lakes.  Future angling opportunities look promising as there are numbers of Bluegill and Black Crappie just below the preferred size ranges that will be recruiting to the fishery in the coming years.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish ranged from 5.8 to 7.9 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Hybrid Sunfish ranged from 7.1 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  Other species noted in the survey included Bowfin, Bullheads, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Walleye and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dixon Lake is a medium size, rather shallow, hardwater lake located just north of Lake Winnibigoshish in northern Itasca County.  The lake has historically supported a good walleye population but also provides good northern pike and black crappie fishing. This survey was conducted to evaluate the fish population after the partial winterkill that occurred in the winter of 1993/94.  It also evaluated the natural reproduction of walleye that occurred after fry stocking was discontinued in 1992.     All species present in Dixon Lake prior to the partial winterkill were observed in this survey.  Walleye were sampled at 1.4/gill net, the lowest of six assessments.  Aging indicated that only 3 of the 15 walleye sampled were from prior to the winterkill.  Although natural reproduction appears to have been poor in the spring following the winterkill (1994) and the following year (1995), 1996 appeared to have been a good year.  Ten of the 15 walleye sampled were from that year class.  The walleye sampled in the gill net ranged in length from 8.5-24.0 inches. Trap nets sampled 8 walleye, above the lake class median.       Northern pike gill net numbers have been stable in the past years reflecting the excellent spawning habitat present in the lake.  In this survey, they were sampled above the lake class median at 6.4/net.  Most of the northerns (84%) were aged from after the winterkill.  Small northerns (age 2 and 3) made up 78% of the catch.     Black crappie, although not abundant, were of quality size in this survey.  They ranged in length from 9.3-13.0 inches and had a mean length of 10.6 inches.  Both shoreline seining and electrofishing indicated that excellent natural reproduction occurred in 1997.  Hundreds of young-of-the year black crappie were observed during the electrofishing survey in the fall.     Natural reproduction of yellow perch has always been good on Dixon Lake.  Gill net abundance has been above the lake class median in all past assessments.  In this survey, they were sampled near the third quartile at 23.2/gill net.  The perch ranged in length from 5.1-11.5 inches and had a mean length of 8.1 inches.     The bullhead species which have historically been abundant in the lake, were sampled at low levels in the gill nets.       Other species observed in this survey were golden shiner, tullibee, white sucker, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, and largemouth bass.                  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Dixon Lake is moderately-sized lake in the Mississippi River watershed near Squaw Lake, Minnesota.  Dixon has a surface area of 616 acres, a littoral area of 478 acres (78%) and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  The Third River enters Dixon Lake and outflows about 7 miles to Lake Winnibigoshish.  Water levels in the lake can vary by 4 feet because of the large watershed. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the lake is relatively shallow and low oxygen levels occasionally occur during severe winters.  The water is hard and very fertile.  Residential development is moderate. The lake historically supported a diverse aquatic plant community.  Dense aquatic plant growth and algae blooms can be a nuisance to lake users and property owners given the lake's nutrient load and shallow mean depth. The infestation of curly-leaf pondweed in the early 2000's has impacted the aquatic plant community and, if untreated, may limit aquatic recreation.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2016.  Walleye and Bluegill were considered primary management species because they are actively managed and Northern Pike and Black Crappie were considered secondary management species.  Goals of the 2016 LMP were to maintain Northern Pike catches near 5.1/gill net and Black Crappie near 2.5/gill net, and to provide a seasonal Walleye fishery characterized by a catch of 2.0/gill net.  The goal for the Bluegill fishery was to maintain a quality size distribution with 25% of the sampled fish exceeding 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June of 2022 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets.  Dixon Lake has typically been sampled in July and the timing of the survey may have influenced catch rates.   <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake has a history of producing moderate numbers of Northern Pike with poor size quality.  Northern Pike were the most common fish in the gill net catch.  The catch of 15 per gill net was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and above the LMP goal.  High pike numbers are undesirable because they contribute to slow growth and poor size quality.  Size structure remained poor in 2022.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 34.9 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  Poor size structure limits the popularity of pike in Dixon Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to utilize the abundant small pike while releasing pike over 22 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches were historically moderate to high in Dixon but have declined.  Gill net catches were generally above average for the type of lake from 1979 to 1997 but have been lower since that time.  The catch of 13.6 per gill net in 2022 was the highest recorded since 1997.  Yellow Perch ranged from 5 to 9.9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Although the average size is too small to interest anglers, perch are an important prey item for pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have never been sampled in high numbers from Dixon Lake, despite frequent fry stocking.  Spawning Walleye from Lake Winnibigoshish are known to migrate to Dixon Lake, providing good spring angling.  The 2022 gill net catch of 1.7 per lift was typical for lakes with similar habitats, average for Dixon and near the LMP goal.  Captured Walleye ranged from 7.9 to 26.8 inches and averaged 17.1 inches.  Given the habitat, it is unlikely Dixon will ever support a large, year-round Walleye population and the fishery will remain dependent on migration via the Third River.  Anglers are reminded that Dixon Lake has a special regulation and that all Walleye from 18-23 inches must be immediately released as a connected water to Lake Winnibigoshish.   <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake has a history of producing a Black Crappie population characterized by moderate numbers and quality size structure.  Like many lakes in Northern Minnesota, irregular recruitment results in dominant year-classes, shifting age and size structure, and inconsistent angler success.  Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 3/gill net in 2022 which was within the expected range for the lake type and typical for Dixon Lake.  Captured crappie ranged from 5.9 to 10.0 inches but the sample was predominantly age-2 fish that averaged 6.7 inches.  Summer assessments on Dixon have generally resulted in low sample sizes.  Spring trap net assessments may provide better data on this species.  A targeted spring assessment in 2015 captured 71 Black Crappie ranging from 7.6 to 13.6 inches with an average of 9.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling indicated relatively low sunfish densities with size structure dominated by large sunfish.   The 2022 trap net catch of 3.8 Bluegill per trap net continued to confirm a low-density population.  The sampled Bluegills ranged from 4.2 to 9.9 and averaged 7.2 inches.  Nearly half of the sampled sunfish exceeded 8 inches indicating a high-quality size structure.  Five age-classes with fish from age 2 to 7 were sampled.  Growth was excellent with fish averaging 7.9 inches by age 4.  Anglers should note Dixon Lake is managed with a 5 fish bag limit for sunfish to protect size quality. <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake supports invasive curly leaf pondweed.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed, and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Past sampling indicated quality panfish populations in Dixon Lake that were characterized by low to moderate population density and quality size structure.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented on Dixon Lake in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  The lake was sampled with targeted trap nets in the spring of 2011 and 2012 to collect data on the panfish populations and provide a benchmark for future evaluations.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 93 bluegills and 80 black crappies were captured in 47 net sets resulting in catches of 2.0 and 1.7 per net in the 2012 assessment.  Caution should be used when interpreting catch rate data, however, as targeted sampling is designed to maximize catches and provide sufficient sample sizes for length and age structure determination but does not use standardized protocols to produce reliable catch rate data.   <br> \n <br> \nPast summer sampling indicated low sunfish densities with size structure dominated by large sunfish.  The 2012 bluegill catch was the highest observed for the lake, as only 37 were captured during the 2011 special assessment (0.4/trap net).  The 2012 special assessment suggests that bluegill sunfish are present in catchable numbers and that the size structure remains dominated by large individuals, as bluegill ranged from 5.7 to 10.8 inches in length with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  The proportional stock density (PSD) of bluegill exceeding the quality size of 6 inches was 98, the relative stock density of angler preferred bluegill (RSD-P, >8 inches) was 35, and the relative stock density of memorable -sized bluegill (RSD-M, >10 inches) was 11.  Age and growth indices were similar to the previous assessment.  Growth was relatively fast compared to similar lakes, as individuals typically exceeded 8 inches by age 5.  Recruitment was inconsistent, as the 2009 year classes comprised 49% of the sample.  The age distribution was balanced, as ages ranged from 2 to 10 years and bluegill averaged 4.7 years old, suggesting relatively low mortality of adult bluegill compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish are somewhat less desirable than bluegill, as they typically grow to a smaller size.  Past samples resulted in higher pumpkinseed sunfish catches than bluegill catches, suggesting the pumpkinseed may be the dominant sunfish species in Dixon Lake.  Pumpkinseed can tolerate somewhat lower winter oxygen than can bluegill, which may give them an advantage in Dixon Lake, as Dixon is prone to occasional winter kill conditions.  Pumpkinseed were captured in lower numbers than bluegill (N=25, 0.53/trap net) in 2012 and fewer were captured than in 2011 (N=112, 1.2/trap net).  The two species have slightly different spawning behaviors and the weather and timing of the assessment may influence the catch ratio of bluegill to pumpkinseed.  Although the sample size was too small to calculate reliable length indices, the lake appeared to support a quality population, as lengths ranged from 3.8 inches to 8.4 inches with a mean of 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTen hybrid sunfish were captured, indicating that some mixing of bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish occurs in Dixon Lake.   The presence of hybrids is not uncommon in lakes were both species occur.  Hybrid sunfish tended to be large, ranging from 8.1 to 10.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured in lower numbers than in the 2011 assessment when 139 were captured (1.5/trap net) but the catch rates were similar as fewer nets were set in 2012.  Crappie ranged from 5.0 to 13.1 inches, with a mean of 10.0 inches.  The PSD of quality sized crappie (>8 inches) was 91, RSD-P (>10 inches) was 45, and RSD-M (>12 inches) was 20, indicating a size structure dominated by relatively large individuals and the potential to produce exceptionally large crappies.  The 2011 assessment resulted in few crappies less than 10 inches, as the population was dominated by fish older than age 5.  The increased proportion of crappie from 8.0 to 10.0 inches suggests recent recruitment to the adult population.  Spring trap netting may be a poor tool to evaluate year class strength, however, as juvenile crappie (younger than age 4) are not likely to be caught.  Growth was similar to past assessments, as individuals exceeded 9 inches by age 4.  Inconsistent reproduction and recruitment is a common trait for many crappie populations and past sampling indicates that Dixon Lake crappie recruit sporadically.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent in 2012, as 34% of the catch belonged to the 2009 year class and 20% of the catch belonged to the 2006 year class.  </p>",

To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  Targeted surveys for panfish were conducted in the spring of 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2017 to and monitor trends in the panfish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, a total of 136 Bluegill were sampled, ranging in length from 3.1 - 10.3 inches, with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  The Bluegill catch rate was 1.7/trap net and has ranged from 0.4 - 3.9/trap net in previous targeted surveys.  The size structure remained good as 49% of the Bluegill captured were 8 inches or longer. Bluegill size structure was similar to previous targeted surveys.  Seven consecutive year classes were represented in the sample. Of the Bluegill that were aged, 67% were age-2.  Bluegill averaged 8.1 inches by age 5, which is similar to previous surveys and well above what would be expected in similar lakes.  Growth rates appeared particularly rapid during 2016, which could be attributed to temperatures which were above average that year, resulting in a longer growing season.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish ranged from 4.0 to 8.7 inches, with a mean length of 7.4 inches, similar to that seen in 2015.  Only three Hybrid Sunfish were sampled, compared to ten in 2015.  Hybrid Sunfish ranged in length from 8.3 to 9.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 99 Black Crappie were sampled ranging in length from 5.7 to 14.5 inches, with a mean length of 10.7 inches.  The Black Crappie catch rate was 1.2/trap net and has ranged from 1.5 - 2.5/trap net in previous targeted surveys.  Size structure appeared good as 74% of the Black Crappie captured were 10 inches or longer.  Eight consecutive age classes were represented in the sample.  Of the Black Crappie that were aged, 36% were age-3; however, several other age classes were well represented in the sample.  Black Crappie attained a length of 8.3 inches at age-4, which is similar to the statewide average.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Past sampling indicated panfish populations in Dixon Lake had low to moderate population densities with quality size structure.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  The regulation was intended to maintain the high-quality fishery for sunfish, with a goal of at least 25% of sampled Bluegill exceeding 8 inches.  Targeted surveys for panfish were conducted in the spring of 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2023 and 2024 to monitor trends in the panfish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2024, a total of 100 Bluegill were sampled, ranging from 6.6 to 9.9 inches, with an average length of 8.4 inches.  The Bluegill catch rate was 4.2/trap net and has ranged from 0.4 - 3.9/trap net in previous targeted surveys.  Like past years, quality size Bluegill were present with fish approaching 10 inches in the sample.  Eighty-three percent of Bluegill exceeded 8 inches, surpassing management goals.  Ages 3 through 8 were represented, with age 4 and 5 fish making up a majority of the sample.  Bluegill averaged 7.8 inches after 4 years of growth, which is similar to previous surveys and above average compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 92 Black Crappie were sampled ranging from 8.0 to 12.2 inches, with an average length of 9.9 inches.  The Black Crappie catch rate was 3.8/trap net and has ranged from 1.5 - 2.5/trap net in previous targeted surveys. Like past assessments, size structure was good and fish larger than 12 inches were noted.  Black Crappie averaged 8.9 inches after 4 years of growth which is similar to previous surveys and average compared to similar lakes.  Future angling opportunities look promising as there are numbers of Bluegill and Black Crappie in favorable size ranges.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish ranged from 5.8 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Hybrid Sunfish ranged from 7.2 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 8.4 inches.  Other species noted in the survey included Bowfin, Bullheads, Golden Redhorse, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, Walleye, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net CPUE of 2.1 approximates Schupp's ecological lake class #32 median of 2.3.  A wide range of sizes were sampled; the length frequency distribution ranged from 7-26\".  The relatively high gill net proportional stock density (PSD) of 65 (n=23) can be attributed to the strong 1986 year class.  Walleye were sampled from all year classes from 1991 back to 1985.  Growth is good, mean back calculated length at last annulus formation is age I-5.1\" (n=2), II-10.8\" (n=1), III-12.2\" (n=7), IV-14.4\" (n=2), V-16.5\" (n=3), and age VI-18.9\" (n=6).Northern pike are abundant, evidenced by a gill net CPUE of 5.8.  This still falls within the first-third quartile range of 1.8-6.5 for lake class #32.  The length frequency distribution reveals a wide range of sizes, 13-30\", indicating good reproduction - since there has not been any northern pike stocking.  The PSD of 42 (n=67) is moderate.  Fifty-four percent of the northern pike sampled were from the 1989 year class.  Growth is good and is approximately 110-120% of the statewide average for age I-IV.Black crappie were sampled more readily in gill nets than trap nets, evidenced by CPUE's of 2.4 and 0.4 respectively.  The gill net catch falls within the lower end of the first-third quartile range of 1.5-13.3 for lake class #32.  Growth is very good.  Mean back calculated length at last annulus formation is age I-3.0\" (n=3), II-5.5\" (n=12), III-9.2\" (n=1), IV-9.9\" (n=3), and age V-10.8\" (n=2).Yellow perch are abundant, with a gill net CPUE of 33.8 which is above the first-third quartile range of 4.9-31.8.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.9\", with most in the 6-8\" range.Brown and black bullheads are abundant, with gill net CPUE's of 13.9 and 34.1 respectively.  Both species reach an acceptable size to be commercially-harvested.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dixon Lake is a moderately sized eutrophic lake in northwestern Itasca County.  Dixon has a surface area of 616 acres, a littoral area of 478 acres (78%) and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  The water is relatively hard and moderately fertile.  The Secchi disk reading in the 2009 assessment was 5.7 feet, indicating moderate water clarity. The Third River enters Dixon Lake on the northwest side of the lake, outlets on the south end, and flows about 7 miles to Lake Winnibigoshish.  Three other inlets, Otter Creek, Sioux Lake Creek and Unnamed Creek, are located on the lake. The lake management plan lists walleye and black crappie as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common species in the gill net sample and the catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes but low compared to historical catches from Dixon.  The size structure was poor, as few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Poor size structure may limit the popularity of the perch fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Dixon Lake has been influenced by immigration from Lake Winnibigoshish, frequent walleye fry stockings, and an experimental regulation requiring anglers to release all walleye from 17-26 inches in length.  Historically, a walleye run has occurred from Lake Winnibigoshish up the Third River to Dixon Lake. Walleye fishing has historically been good early in the year but drops off as the season progresses.  This has been attributed to the walleye migrating back to Winnibigoshish.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 1.8/gill net in 2009.  This catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes and near the median for Dixon Lake.  Walleye averaged 17.5 inches in the gill net and individuals exceeding 27 inches were captured in the trap net, indicated at least some opportunity for large walleye.  Growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 15 inches by age 4.  Given the favorable size structure, good angling opportunities may exist for this species.  Anglers should note that the current experimental regulation is being reviewed and may be modified in the near future.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at a rate within the expected range for the lake type.  A quality size structure was noted.  Most crappie exceeded 8 inches and the largest black crappie exceeded 13 inches.  Growth was relatively fast as individuals typically exceeded 9 inches by age-4.  Six year classes were present (age 2-7) but recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.  Only 29% of the sampled crappie were age-5 or older, suggesting high mortality of older individuals or poor recruitment of earlier year classes.  High mortality of older individuals is often a result of high angler harvest of quality-sized fish.  Given the current catch rate and size structure, good angling opportunities exist for this species. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at a rate of 1.2/trap net, a low rate compared to similar lakes.  Although abundance appears low, bluegill were generally large as most individuals exceeded 8 inches and some exceeded 10 inches.  Given the apparently low abundance, bluegill are likely caught incidentally on Dixon but the size structure suggests at least some potential for a trophy fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBrown, black, and yellow bullheads were present in moderate numbers and may provide some fisheries potential, especially for brown bullheads.  Brown bullhead were the most abundant bullhead and most individuals exceeded 11 inches.  The largest brown bullhead exceeded 13 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure of pike from Dixon Lake have typically been dominated by small individuals.  In 2009, the size structure remained poor as few individuals exceeded 21 inches.  Growth rates were relatively slow as individuals typically achieved 23 inches by age 6.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Only 15% of the sample were age-4 or older suggesting high mortality of older individuals or poor recruitment of older year classes.  Given the small average size, the popularity of the pike fishery may be limited.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included white sucker, bowfin, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special panfish assessment was conducted on Dixon Lake beginning on May 24, 2011.  Dixon Lake was being considered for a reduced bag limit regulation for sunfish and crappie and the assessment was conducted to collect baseline data for these species.   The assessment consisted of 15 trap net sets that were fished for six nights, resulting in an effort of 90 sets.  Four nets had especially low catches and were relocated resulting in a total of 19 net locations.  Scales were collected from a subset of male and female fish for age and growth determination. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 139 black crappie (1.5/trap net), 37 bluegill (0.4/trap net) and 112 pumpkinseed (1.2/trap net) were sampled.  Black crappie ranged from 6.6 to 13.1 inches with a mean length of 11.4 inches.  Ninety-nine percent of the sampled crappie exceeded the angler preferred length of 10 inches and 19 percent exceeded the memorable length of 12 inches.   Growth remained similar to the 2009 population assessment with individuals typically exceeding 9 inches by age 4.  The 2009 population assessment indicated inconsistent recruitment, as most crappie belonged to the 2004, 2005, and 2006 year classes.  These year classes were again well represented in the 2011 sample, and 46% of the sampled crappie were from the particularly strong 2005 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill ranged from 3.3 inches to 10.1 inches with a mean length of 9.0 inches.  Ninety-five percent of the sampled bluegill exceeded the angler preferred length of 8 inches and 3 percent exceeded the memorable length of 10 inches.  Growth was fast compared to similar lakes with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age 5.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent as 62% of the sampled bluegill were from the 2005 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed ranged from 6.3 inches to 8.8 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Twenty-two percent of the sampled pumpkinseed exceeded the angler preferred length of 8 inches.  Growth was relatively fast as individuals typically exceeded 8 inches by age 6.  Recruitment appeared somewhat inconsistent, as the 2006 year class comprised 58% of the sample.  The current assessment and previous assessments indicate that pumpkinseed are more abundant than bluegill and may be more important to the sunfish fishery.   Dixon Lake is known to periodically winter kill.  Pumpkinseed are more tolerant to low oxygen than bluegill, which may explain their higher relative abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 catch results were consistent with the previous summer assessments, which captured black crappie in moderate numbers and sunfish in relatively low numbers.    Some caution should be taken when interpreting these data, as water temperatures were generally cool (around 60 F) during the sampling period and the weather was unstable.  No spawning beds were observed, suggesting that spawning had not yet begun and that many panfish may have been in deeper water and not catchable in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nVery few juvenile fish were captured in the 2011 assessment.  Past assessments suggest low and inconsistent recruitment of panfish in Dixon Lake.  The lack of small fish in the 2011 assessment may suggest poor reproduction or recruitment in recent years.  Dixon Lake occasionally experiences low winter oxygen levels and partial winter kill events likely impact recruitment and subsequent year class strength.  Low oxygen levels were observed in the late winter of 2011 and some dead fish were observed after ice out.   The timing of the assessment may also influence size structure of sampled fish.  Larger mature fish may have been in shallower water preparing to spawn while juvenile fish remained off shore.  Another assessment is scheduled for the spring on 2012 and should further determine the status and population dynamics of these species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake is moderately-sized lake in the Mississippi River watershed near Squaw Lake, Minnesota.  Dixon has a surface area of 616 acres, a littoral area of 478 acres (78%) and a maximum depth of 29 feet.  The Third River enters Dixon Lake and outflows about 7 miles to Lake Winnibigoshish.  Water levels in the lake can vary by 4 feet because of the large watershed. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the lake is relatively shallow and low oxygen levels occasionally occur during severe winters.  The water is hard and very fertile.  Residential development is moderate. The lake historically supported a diverse aquatic plant community.  Dense aquatic plant growth and algae blooms can be a nuisance lake users and property owners given the lake's nutrient load and shallow mean depth. The infestation of curly-leaf pondweed in the early 2000's has impacted the aquatic plant community and if untreated, may limit aquatic recreation.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2010.  Walleye and Black Crappie were considered primary management species and Northern Pike and Bluegill were considered secondary management species.  Goals of the 2010 LMP were to maintain Northern Pike at the lake class median of 5.1/gill net and Black Crappie at the lake class median of 2.5/gill net and to provide a seasonal walleye fishery characterized by a catch of 2.0/gill net.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in July of 2015 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nResults <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake's shallow depth and tendency for winterkill favor bullhead species, and the lake has a history of producing abundant bullhead populations.  Brown Bullheads  were the most common fish in gill and trap nets in 2015.  The trap net catch of 9.1 per net was high compared to similar lakes.  Black Bullheads have occurred in moderate densities in Dixon during past surveys.  The 2015 gill net catch of 5.2 per net was comparable to similar lakes.  Gill net captured Brown Bullhead ranged from 8.5 to 14.3 inches and averaged 10.5 inches while Black Bullhead ranged from 8.2 to 13.1 inches and averaged 9.5 inches.  Although bullheads are not frequently sought by anglers in the Grand Rapids Area, Dixon Lake appears to provide good angling opportunities for these species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the second most common fish in the gill net catch.  The catch of 6.4 per net was near the lake class median, typical for Dixon Lake, and near the LMP goal.  The Dixon Lake population has a history of producing small pike.  Size structure remained poor in 2015 as the catch was dominated by fish less than 21 inches.  Lengths ranged from 15.9 to 31.8 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Northern Pike attained a length of 17.6 inches at age 4, similar to the statewide average.  Five consecutive year classes were represented in the sample (age 2-6).  However, 48% were from the 2012 year class. Poor size structure limits the popularity of pike in Dixon Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to utilize the abundant small pike while releasing pike over 22 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches were historically moderate to high on Dixon, but have declined substantially in recent assessments.  The catch of 5.2 per gill net in 2015 was the lowest on record.  Yellow Perch ranged from 4.9 to 10.4 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Although the average size is too small to interest anglers, perch are an important prey item for pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have never been sampled in high numbers from Dixon Lake, despite frequent Walleye fry stocking.  Spawning Walleye from Lake Winnibigoshish are known to migrate to Dixon Lake, providing good spring angling.  The 2015 gill net catch of 0.8 per lift was the lowest observed for Dixon Lake and below the LMP goal.  Captured Walleye ranged from 8 to 20.7 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Walleye attained a length of 13.5 inches at age 4, similar to the statewide average.  Given the habitat, it is unlikely that Dixon will ever support a large, year round population of Walleye and that the fishery will remain dependent on migration via the Third River.  Anglers are reminded that Dixon Lake is included in the Lake Winnibigoshish special Walleye regulation and that all Walleye from 18-23 inches must be immediately released.   <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake has a history of producing a crappie population characterized by moderate numbers and quality size structure.  Like many lakes in Northern Minnesota, irregular recruitment results in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structure, and inconsistent angler success.  Black Crappies were captured at a rate of 1.2/gill net and 0.9/trap net in 2015.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.3 to 12.0 inches.  Summer assessments on Dixon have generally resulted in low sample sizes of crappie.  Spring trap net assessments may provide better data on this species.  A targeted spring assessment in 2015 captured 71 Black Crappie ranging from 7.6 to 13.6 with an average of 9.3 inches.  Five year classes were present (ages 3 - 7), but recruitment appears inconsistent, as the 2012 year class comprised 71% of the sample.  Black Crappie averaged 9.6 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling has indicated relatively low sunfish densities with a size structure dominated by large sunfish.   The 2015 trap net of 1.9 Bluegill per net confirms a low density population.  Like crappie, spring trap net assessments may provide better data on the population.  The 2015 targeted sampling resulted in a length range of 7.2 to 10.1 with an average length of 8.8 inches.   Six year classes were present (ages 4 - 9), but recruitment appears inconsistent, as the 2009 year class comprised 55% of the sample.  Bluegill averaged 8.0 inches by age 5, which is similar to past assessments.  Anglers should note that Dixon Lake is managed with a 5 fish bag limit for sunfish to protect the quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nDixon Lake supports invasive curly leaf pondweed.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Past sampling has indicated panfish populations in Dixon Lake to be characterized by low to moderate population densities and quality size structure.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented on Dixon Lake in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  The lake was sampled with targeted trap nets in the spring of 2011, 2012 and 2015 to collect data on the panfish populations and provide a benchmark for future evaluations.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, a total of 114 Bluegills and 71 Black Crappies were captured in 29 trap net sets in 2015 resulting in catches of 3.9 and 2.4 per net, respectively.  Caution should be used when interpreting catch rate data, however, as targeted sampling is designed to maximize catches and provide sufficient sample sizes for length and age structure determination but does not use standardized protocols to produce reliable catch rate data.   <br> \n <br> \nPast targeted sampling indicated relatively low sunfish densities with size structure dominated by large sunfish.  The 2015 targeted sampling resulted in a similar size structure, as Bluegill ranged from 7.2 to 10.1 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Six year classes were present (ages  4 - 9), but recruitment appears inconsistent, as the 2009 year class comprised 55% of the sample. Bluegill averaged 8.0 inches by age 5, which is similar to past assessments and above the lake class average.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish can tolerate somewhat lower oxygen levels than Bluegill, which may give them an advantage in Dixon Lake, as Dixon is prone to occasional winterkill conditions.  Pumpkinseeds were captured in somewhat higher numbers than Bluegill (N=153, 5.3/trap net) in 2015.  The two species have slightly different spawning behaviors and the weather and timing of the assessment may influence the catch ratio of Bluegill to Pumpkinseed.  The lake appeared to support a quality population, as lengths ranged from 5.7 inches to 9.1 inches with a mean of 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTen Hybrid Sunfish were captured, indicating that some mixing of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed  occurs in Dixon Lake.   The presence of hybrids is not uncommon in lakes where both species occur.  Hybrid Sunfish tended to be large, ranging from 7.9 to 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Black Crappie ranged from 7.6 to 13.6 inches, with a mean of 9.3 inches.  The 2011 assessment resulted in few crappies less than 10.0 inches, as the population was dominated by fish older than age 5. Five year classes were sampled in 2015 (ages 3 - 7), but recruitment appears inconsistent, as the 2012 year class comprised 71% of the sample. Black Crappie averaged 9.6 inches at age 4, which slightly exceeds the lake class average. <br> \n</p>",
