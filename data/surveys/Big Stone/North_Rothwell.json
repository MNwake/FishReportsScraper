                "narrative": "<p>North Rothwell is a medium sized lake located between the cities of Clinton and Graceville in Big Stone County.  Above normal precipitation during the 1990's has increased the size of the lake considerably, because this is a landlocked basin.  This was an initial survey to assess the present fishery and evaluate the fishery potential.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 2000.  The gill net catch rate was within the expected range.  The majority of walleye caught ranged between 17.0 and 22.5 inches.  Two year classes of walleye were caught, suggesting natural reproduction has occurred.       Yellow perch were abundant.  The gill net catch rate was three times the expected range.  The vast majority of fish were small (less than 8.0 inches), although a number of 10.0-13.0 inch perch were also present.  Growth rates were good.  A quality perch fishery should develop over the next few years.  Yellow perch were also likely introduced by an unauthorized stocking, but natural reproduction has created the bulk of the fishery.      Black bullhead, fathead minnow and orangespotted sunfish were documented in high abundance.  Bullhead up to 12.8 inches were caught and could provide a quality fishing opportunity.       A project to reduce the current water levels of North Rothwell Lake by up to 6 feet has been proposed.  Any potential fisheries management plan will be delayed until the outcome of the proposal is known.   </p>",
