                "narrative": "<p>First Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles east of the town of Hubbard.  First Crow Wing is a shallow lake with a surface area of 526 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Much of the shoreline on First Crow Wing is DNR wildlife management land and is undeveloped.  Private homes and cabins are limited to the southern shore of the lake.  First Crow Wing has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and yellow water lilies.  Large beds of wild rice are located on the north shoreline and are an important food source for waterfowl.  The Crow Wing River flows through the southern end of the lake and access to Second Crow Wing Lake is possible by going upstream with small craft.  A DNR access with a concrete ramp is located south of the lake on the Crow Wing River.  An undeveloped access for carry-in craft and small boats is located on the northwest shore of the lake on DNR wildlife management land. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  First Crow Wing is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Portage, Shallow, Stocking, and Upper Twin. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and panfish are a popular choice for anglers year-around on First Crow Wing.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in First Crow Wing.  Northern pike abundance (7.3 pike/gillnet) was down from recent surveys, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find lots of small pike in First Crow Wing.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.9 inches.  Bluegill abundance (42.4 bluegill/trapnet) was up from past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to past surveys.  Walleye abundance (1.3 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but below the current management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Despite stocking efforts, walleye abundance has not reached the management goal in recent surveys.  First Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Predation on small walleye fingerlings by the abundant northern pike population or lack of yellow perch forage could be limiting the success of the stocking program.  Largemouth bass are present in First Crow Wing, but numbers appear low so no special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been conducted to evaluate their abundance and size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and bowfin (dogfish) and moderate numbers of shorthead redhorse, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker.  Brown bullhead, yellow perch, carp, hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles east of the town of Hubbard.  First Crow Wing is a shallow lake with a surface area of 526 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Much of the shoreline on First Crow Wing is DNR wildlife management land and is undeveloped.  Private homes and cabins are limited to the southern shore of the lake.  First Crow Wing has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and yellow water lilies.  Large beds of wild rice are located on the north shoreline and are an important food source for migrating waterfowl.  The Crow Wing River flows through the southern end of the lake and access to Second Crow Wing Lake is possible by going upstream.  A DNR boat ramp is located south of the lake on the Crow Wing River.  An undeveloped access for small boats is available on the northeast shore of the lake on DNR wildlife management land.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical and chemical characteristics.  First Crow Wing is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Fourth Crow Wing (3 miles north of First Crow Wing), Peysenski (5 miles east of Park Rapids), and Portage (2.5 miles northwest of Park Rapids).First Crow Wing Lake is noted for its panfish and northern pike fishery.  Survey gillnet catches showed northern pike were abundant (12.5/net), similar to past surveys.  Northern pike were small in size with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Larger northern pike were sampled, however, with fish measured up to 35.2 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to area lakes.Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (19.6/trapnet), similar to the 1985 and 1990 surveys. Bluegill were quality sized, with an average length of 8.0 inches and with fish measured up to 9.0 inches.  Black crappie were also sampled in moderate numbers (2.2/gillnet and 1.3/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Black crappie were also an acceptable size to anglers with fish measured up to 11.3 inches.  Black crappie growth rates were similar to other area lakes.Walleye were sampled in low numbers (1.3/gillnet), below the range typical for lake class 39.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 1.5/net (1970, 1985) to 6.3/net (1956).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 13.1 to 25.5 inches.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other area lakes.  Starting in 1995, all Crow Wing chain of lakes that receive WAE fingerling stockings (including First Crow Wing) are stocked every other year in odd calendar years.  Prior to 1995, some Crow Wing chain of lakes received WAE stockings in different years, making evaluation of stocking difficult due to migration between lakes and natural reproduction.  Natural reproduction of walleye in First Crow Wing is limited due to the lack of suitable spawning habitat.Largemouth bass were sampled in numbers typical for lake class 39 and similar to past surveys.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on First Crow Wing.  First Crow Wing has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass population.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (15.0/gillnet), within the range typical for lake class 39 and similar to past surveys.  The yellow perch population in First Crow Wing is primarily a forage base for the northern pike and walleye populations as average size was small (5.7 inches).  Yellow perch were measured up to 11.5 inches.Other fish species sampled in moderate numbers include: pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow bullhead, shorthead redhorse, bowfin (dogfish), and tullibee (cisco).  Fish species sampled in low numbers include: brown bullhead, black bullhead, carp, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in First Crow Wing Lake  and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles east of the town of Hubbard.  First Crow Wing is a shallow lake with a surface area of 526 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Much of the shoreline on First Crow Wing is DNR wildlife management land and is undeveloped.  Private homes and cabins are limited to the southern shore of the lake.  First Crow Wing has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and yellow water lilies.  Large beds of wild rice are located on the north shoreline and are an important food source for waterfowl.  The Crow Wing River flows through the southern end of the lake and access to Second Crow Wing Lake is possible by going upstream with small to medium craft.  A DNR boat ramp is located south of the lake on the Crow Wing River.  An undeveloped access for small boats or carry-in boats is located on the northeast shore of the lake on DNR wildlife management land.Northern pike and panfish are a popular choice for anglers year-around on First Crow Wing.  High numbers of northern pike are found in First Crow Wing.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged and flooded aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in First Crow Wing.    Anglers will find lots of small pike in First Crow Wing.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.6 inches and 2.2 pounds with pike measured up to 31.6 inches.  Bluegill abundance (25.6 bluegill/trapnet) was at the upper range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance (9.0 crappie/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Lots of smaller black crappie in the 6-8 inch size range were sampled, however, larger crappie are present with fish measured up to 12.8 inches.  Walleye abundance (2.6 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but below the current management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Despite aggressive and heavy stocking efforts, walleye abundance has not reached the management goal in recent surveys.  First Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  Predation on small walleye fingerlings by the abundant northern pike population could be limiting the success of the stocking program.  Largemouth bass are present in First Crow Wing but no special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been conducted to adequately evaluate their abundance and size distribution.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and white sucker and moderate numbers of brown bullhead, shorthead redhorse, and bowfin.  Black bullhead, tullibee, hybrid sunfish, and carp were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles east of the town of Hubbard.  First Crow Wing is a shallow lake with a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Much of the shoreline on First Crow Wing is DNR wildlife management area and is undeveloped.  Private homes and cabins are limited to the southern shore of the lake.  First Crow Wing has abundant stands of both emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation such as wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and yellow water lilies.  Large beds of wild rice are located on the north shoreline and are an important food source for waterfowl.   A DNR access with a concrete ramp is located south of the lake on the Crow Wing River.  An undeveloped access for carry-in craft is located on the northwest shore of the lake on a DNR Wildlife Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  First Crow Wing is in lake class 39.  Class 39 lakes are shallow lakes, with a high littoral zone (less than 15 feet in depth). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Panfish are a popular choice for anglers year-around on First Crow Wing.  Abundant Northern Pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of Northern Pike in First Crow Wing.  Northern Pike were sampled in very high numbers, well above the range typical for this lake class.  Anglers will find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" Northern Pike in First Crow Wing.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.6 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown First Crow Wing to support good Panfish populations composed of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 to 8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9 to 12 inch size range.    Largemouth Bass were sampled in low to moderate numbers when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.   A quality Largemouth Bass population is present, with good numbers of larger bass (> 15.0 inches) sampled.  Largemouth Bass up to 20.0 inches were sampled.   First Crow Wing has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for Panfish and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.6 Walleye/gill net) was within the range typical for this lake class, but below the management goal of 4.0 Walleye/gill net.  Despite stocking efforts, Walleye abundance has not reached the management goal in recent surveys.  First Crow Wing is stocked with Walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  The Yellow Perch population tends to run small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of White Sucker, and moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), and Bowfin (Dogfish).  Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and Rock Bass were sampled in low numbers.  Common Carp were not sampled in 2014, but have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.    <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware that faucet snails, and aquatic invasive species (AIS) are present in First Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 11, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and six sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at six sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 14 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eight species of fish including one species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 5, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of First Crow Wing Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  First Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First Crow Wing Lake is located seven miles east of Hubbard in southern Hubbard County.  First Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  First Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  A public access is located south of the lake on the Crow Wing River, off of County Road 109.  An undeveloped access for carry-in craft, and winter access is located on the northwest shore of the lake as part of the Crow Wing Chain Wildlife Management Area.  Boating access is also available from the Crow Wing River connecting it to Second Crow Wing Lake, although the river can be very shallow with dense stands of wild rice. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  First Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Class 39 lakes are generally shallow with a high littoral area (less than 15 feet in depth), and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hennepin, Loon, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Shallow, Upper Twin, Hungryman and Stocking. <br> \n <br> \nFirst Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Black Crappie abundance was up, but still moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  Most crappies fit in two size groups of 5 - 7 inches and 9.5 - 13 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 5.5-9 inch size range.  Spring and summer sampling show Largemouth Bass were good sized and moderate numbers. They had an average length of 13.5 inches, with fish sampled over 19 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in First Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2 pounds, with the largest measured at 28.5 inches in 2019.  Walleyes were found in low numbers, but were generally a nice size.  They had an average length of 18 inches, with fish sampled up to 27 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in low numbers.  No perch over 8.5 inches were sampled, making most fish too small for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nFirst Crow Wing Lake was listed in 2011 as infested with faucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
