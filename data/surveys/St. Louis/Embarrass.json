Northern pike, sucker, and walleye dominate the gillnet catch by weight. In the trapnet catch bluegill and white sucker are most abundant. Sucker, northern pike, and bluegill dominate the trapnet by catch weight. Walleye sizes range from 5 averaged 11 present. Of 25 walleye captured, 19 (73%) were from stock year-classes. Natural reproduction of the other more abundant species seems good. When compared to other Ely area lakes, bluegill growth is average through age 2, then becomes faster than average. Walleye growth is slower than average through age 3, then becomes average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have turbid water.  Embarrass Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is larger and has a more irregular shoreline shape.Embarrass Lake was partially stratified thermally on 08/26/2002 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) to within a foot of the bottom.  The surface temperature was 73 F and the bottom temperature was 64 F.  Embarrass Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.The Embarrass River flows through Embarrass Lake with a midsummer flow of about 75 CFS.  There is a stop log dam about 200 yds upstream of the lake that is a periodic barrier to upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft and are generally sparse.  Wild celery is the most common aquatic plant.Fish sampling in 2002 consisted of nine trapnet sets and nine gillnet sets.  Eight previous investigations dating back to 1947 consisted of 3-9 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (4-9 sets) were used during seven of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seines were used in the 1947 and 1997 investigations.  All gillnetting and trapnetting on this lake was done in August, except that trapnetting was moved to June in 1997 and 2002 in an effort to increase catches of centrarchids.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 32 fish/net (32.3 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 12.5 fish/net (13.2 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  This increase was due to higher numbers of most species caught, but especially bluegill sunfish, northern pike, rock bass, and white sucker.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 25.7 fish/net (26.7 lb/net) was at the first quartile for this lake class and was slightly higher than the median catch of 21.8 fish/net (18.8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 19 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 2002 were dominated by white sucker and northern pike, followed by rock bass, bluegill sunfish, and walleye.  Bullhead numbers were higher in 2002 than in previous investigations.  One large channel catfish (28.8\", 9.3 lb) was captured in 2002.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.  Embarrass Lake has diverse fish populations for this area; a total of 16 fish species were captured in the gillnets and trapnets in 2002.White sucker numbers in the trapnets in 2002 (7.0/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.3/net in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker numbers in the gillnets in 2002 (2.1/net) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.2/net in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2002 averaged 17.4\" (2.1 lb) in the trapnets and 16.1\" (1.8 lb) in the gillnets, which were in the third quartile for this lake class in both gear types.Northern pike numbers in the trapnets in 2002 (3.6/net) were higher than the median catch of 1.3/net in all investigations on this lake.  Pike numbers in the gillnets in 2002 (5.6/net) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of  3.4/net in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 17.5\" (1.3 lb) in the trapnets, which was smaller than the average size of 22.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 19.7\" (1.6 lb) in the gillnets, which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average length of 19.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002 was 27.2\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but most pike captured in the gillnets in 2002 appeared to be ages three and four, and pike growth appeared to normal by area standards.Rock bass numbers in the trapnets in 2002 (7.6/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 0.6/net in all investigations on this lake. The increase in rock bass numbers may be related to the earlier trapnetting dates in 1997 and 2002, as their numbers were also elevated in the 1997 trapnetting.  Rock bass numbers in the gillnets in this lake have always been low, with a median catch of 0.2/net.  Rock bass sizes in 2002 averaged 8.1\" (0.4 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.4\" in all investigations on this lake. Bluegill numbers in 2002 (6.9/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.0/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.   Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 7.9\" (0.5 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2002 was 9.8\".  All but one bluegill captured in 2002 were ages four, five, or seven.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal for this lake class.Walleye numbers in 2002 (3.4/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 3.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 13.7\" (1.1 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 11.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2002 was 24.3\".  Many year classes of walleye were captured in 2002.  Walleye growth was slower than normal for area lakes.All three species of bullhead (black, brown, and yellow) have been captured in Embarrass Lake and there has understandably been some confusion about species identification over the years.  When looking at all bullhead species combined, however, it is evident that overall bullhead numbers have increased recently.  The total catch of bullhead (all species combined) in the gillnets increased from an average of 0.2/net in all investigations from 1947 through 1990, to 2.9/net in 1997, and to 5.0/net in 2002.  The total catch of bullhead in the trapnets increased from an average of 0.3/net in all investigations from 1947 through 1997, to 2.4/net in 2002.Many of the gamefish examined in 2002 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have turbid water.  Embarrass Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class, except that it is larger and has a more irregular shoreline shape.  Embarrass Lake partially stratifies thermally in midsummer during some years, and retains good oxygen (2 ppm) to near the bottom where the temperature is in the low 60's F.  Embarrass Lake is a mesotrophic lake.The Embarrass River flows through Embarrass Lake with a midsummer flow of about 75 CFS.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly rubble and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft and are generally sparse; wild celery is the most common plant.Fish sampling in 1997 was done with shoreline seines, trapnets, and gillnets.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 (all species combined) of 16 fish/net (16 lb/net) was higher than the average catch of 10 fish/net (11 lb/net) for six previous trapnettings in Embarrass Lake dating back to 1947.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1997 of 23 fish/net (26 lb/net) was higher than the average catch of 20 fish/net (17 lb/net) in seven previous gillnettings in this lake, but was lower than normal for this lake class.  Lake Class 19 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 1997, as in most previous nettings on this lake, were dominated by northern pike, white sucker, and walleye.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (6/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the average catch of 2/gillnet for previous gillnettings in this lake.  Pike sizes averaged only 18\", which was smaller than the long term average of 20\" for this lake.  The largest pike, caught in a trapnet, was 26\".  Most of the pike caught in 1997 were ages two and three, indicating good natural reproduction in 1994 and 1995.  Pike growth (15\" at age two, 18\" at age three) was normal for the area. Walleye numbers in 1997 (5/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, and were higher than the average catch of 3/gillnet for previous gillnettings in this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 12\" in 1997, which is larger than the long term average of 11\" for this lake.  Most walleye captured in 1997 were from the 1992, 1994, and 1995 year classes.  The 1992 and 1993 year classes were very weak in most area lakes due to cold summers in those years.  Embarrass Lake was stocked with walleye fingerlings in 1992, which may have compensated for poor natural reproduction that year.  Good natural reproduction occurred in many area lakes in 1994 and 1995.  Walleye growth (8\" at age two, 10\" at age three, 15\" at age five) was somewhat slow for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (3/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class and were lower than the average catch of 7/gillnet for previous gillnettings in this lake.Average numbers of rock bass and shorthead redhorse were captured in 1997.  Other species were present in low numbers.  Some good sized crappie (over 11\") and bluegill (over 9\") were present.Many of the gamefish examined in 1997 were infected with black spot (Neascus), and some of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Black spot and yellow grub are small parasites found in or just under the skin.  They are native to the area, cannot infect humans, are usually removed by filleting, and are killed by cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have turbid water.  Embarrass Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is larger and has a more irregular shoreline shape.   <br> \n <br> \nEmbarrass Lake was not thermally stratified on 08/27/2007, with a water temperature of 67 F from the surface to the bottom.  Very good oxygen levels (over 7 ppm) were retained to the bottom.  Embarrass Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nThe Embarrass River flows through Embarrass Lake with midsummer flows of about 75 CFS.  There is a stop log dam about 200 yards upstream of the lake that is a periodic barrier to upstream fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Embarrass Lake are mostly rubble and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft and are generally sparse.  Wild celery is the most common aquatic plant. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in 2007 consisted of nine trapnet sets and nine gillnet sets.  Nine previous fisheries investigations dating back to 1947 consisted of 3-9 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (4-9 sets) were used during eight of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seines were used in the 1947 and 1997 lake surveys.  All gillnetting and trapnetting on this lake was done in August, except that trapnetting was moved to June in 1997 and 2002 in an effort to increase catches of centrarchids.  This earlier trapnetting resulted only in increased catches of rock bass and white sucker, so the trapnetting was moved back to August in 2007 to coincide with the gillnetting. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2007 of 18 fish/net (15 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 14 fish/net (14 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish and black crappie were caught in 2007 than in most previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2007 of 33 fish/net (32 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 22 fish/net (20 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More black bullhead and bluegill sunfish were caught in 2007 than in most previous investigations.  Lake Class 19 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007 were dominated by white sucker, northern pike, and walleye, followed by bullheads, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie.  Low numbers of other fish species were present.  Embarrass Lake has diverse fish populations for this area; a total of 14 fish species were captured in the gillnets and trapnets in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2007 (5.2/gillnet, 3.2/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catches of 3.6/gillnet and 2.5/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2007 averaged 16.6\" (2.1 lb) in the gillnets and 18.0\" (2.5 lb) in the trapnets, both of which were in the fourth quartile for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (5.4/gillnet) were higher than the median catch of 3.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in the gillnets in 2007 averaged 18.3\" (1.2 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 19.7\" in all investigations on this lake. The largest pike in 2007 (caught in a trapnet) was 25.9\".  Pike growth was slower than normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2007 (5.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 12.4\" (0.8 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 11.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 2007 was 22.4\".  Eight year-classes of walleye were captured in 2007.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nAll three Minnesota bullhead species are found in Embarrass Lake, but black bullhead were the most abundant in 2007.  Black bullhead numbers in 2007 (7.6/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 0.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Black bullhead sizes in 2007 averaged 9.6\" (0.5 lb), which was at the third quartile for this lake class. The largest bullhead caught in 2007, a brown bullhead, was 13.8\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2007 (7.1/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.8/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 6.9\" (0.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2007 (caught in a gillnet) was 10.3\".  Most bluegill (55 percent) were ages four and five.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the gamefish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus.  Some of the perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is located approximately 1 mile E of the city of Biwabik. This popular lake sits below Wynne Lake and above Cedar Island Lake along the Embarrass River system. There is a stop log dam about 200 yards upstream of the lake that is a periodic barrier to upstream fish movement. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Embarrass are mostly rubble and sand. Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft and are generally sparse.  <br> \n <br> \nThere are two concrete planked boat ramps located at the municipal campground on the W side of the lake for public access. A third ramp is located on the N side off Hwy 135 with an adjacent parking area. <br> \n <br> \nFourteen species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Embarrass Lake. Walleye (38%) and yellow perch (34%) were the most common species sampled in the gill nets. White sucker (44%) was the most common species sampled from the trap nets. Night electrofishing targeting bass produced only one 16.6 inch largemouth. Most remaining species were sampled in relatively low numbers. No channel catfish were sampled in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2017 (7.8/gill net) were higher than the historic average (4.3/gill net) for this lake and above average (2.6/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 12.6 inches and about 4 years old. Walleye fingerlings are stocked during even numbered years on Embarrass Lake and 41% of the walleye aged in 2017 were from years when stocking occurred. Twenty-one percent of the walleye sampled were 15 inches or larger with a maximum length of 27.1 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2017 (7.0/gill net) were above the historic average (4.7/gill net) for this lake and below average (9.3/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average perch sampled was 9.2 inches and the largest perch measured 13.1 inches which was sampled in a trap net. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (1.9/gill net) were below the historic average (3.0/gill net) for Embarrass Lake and below average (5.0/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled was only 16.9 inches and the largest pike was 24.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of bluegill and black crappie were recorded during the 2017 survey. The average bluegill sampled was 8.8 inches and the largest measured 9.7 inches. One hybrid sunfish and one burbot were sampled in 2017 marking the first time these species have been sampled in Embarrass Lake. Rusty crayfish (25.2/gill net) were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is a 463-acre lake located a mile east of Biwabik. The lake sits below Wynne Lake and above Cedar Island Lake along the Embarrass River system. There is also a railroad grade that separates the south arm of the lake from the main basin, but both fish and boats can pass through the large concrete culvert in the grade. Embarrass Lake has two public accesses. The municipal campground on the west side of the lake includes two concrete planked boat ramps and a fishing pier. There is another concrete planked boat ramp and adjacent parking area on the north side of the lake off Hwy 135. Boaters should use caution at this access as seasonal fluctuations in water levels and a sandbar near the lake inlet can result in shallow water at certain times of year.  <br> \n <br> \nEmbarrass Lake was weakly thermally stratified on August 28, 2023, with water temperatures of 69 F at the surface and 64 F near the bottom. Adequate oxygen levels for warmwater fish species were retained to a depth of at least 12 feet. Embarrass Lake has brown, bog-stained water with visibility around 5 feet. Nearshore substrates are mostly sand and rubble, and aquatic vegetation is limited. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 8.9 fish/gill net, which was above average for the lake. Walleye sampled in gill nets averaged just 11.8 inches in length, and 23% of the fish sampled were over 14 inches. Walleye were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 3.0 fish/net, which was the highest catch rate ever documented for the lake. These fish tended to be slightly larger, with a 13.9-inch average and 41% of the catch 14 inches or bigger. The largest individual sampled in this survey was 26.7 inches. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 11 with natural reproduction occurring consistently in addition to fingerling stockings in even years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 3.3 fish/trap net, which was higher than the historical average for the lake. The average size was 7.6 inches, which was slightly larger than the historical average. Roughly half of the fish sampled were 7.5 inches or larger, and the largest fish sampled was 10 inches long. Bluegill ages ranged 3 to 8 and growth rates were well above average for lakes in the Tower area. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 4.2 fish/trap net, which was the highest catch rate recorded for the lake. Black crappie averaged 8.6 inches in length, and over 70% of the catch was 9 inches or larger. The largest black crappie sampled was 13.4 inches, and ages ranged from 0 to 8. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 4.8 fish/gill net, which was higher than average for Embarrass Lake. The average length of northern pike sampled in gill nets was 19.6 inches, which was also better than average for the lake. Northern pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.6 fish/net. The largest pike sampled was 37.1 inches and was captured in a trap net.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch could provide an additional opportunity for anglers on Embarrass Lake. The largest perch sampled was 12.6 inches in length and 80% of the perch were 8 inches or larger. The catch rate was 6.6 perch/net, which was above average for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included golden shiner, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Embarrass Lake is located approximately one mile east of Biwabik. It has a surface area of 507 acres and a maximum depth of 19 feet. There are two concrete ramps for public access at the municipal campground. <br> \n <br> \nThe Embarrass River flows through a chain of lakes before it reaches the Saint Louis River.  Embarrass Lake is between Wynne and Cedar Island Lakes in this chain. There is a stop log dam about 200 yards upstream of the lake that is a periodic barrier to upstream fish movement. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Embarrass are mostly rubble and sand. Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 5 ft and are generally sparse.  <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant gamefish in the lake were walleye and northern pike.  Panfish were also present in low numbers.  The fishery is diverse and includes bluegill, channel catfish, shorthead redhorse and three species of bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2012 (4.6/gill net) were slightly higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake.  Embarrass lake is stocked with fingerlings every other year. Most walleye were from the 2010 year class but there were also many walleye from the 2009 year class indicating there is some natural reproduction. The average walleye sampled was 12.0 inches long and 3 or 4 years old. The largest walleye sampled was 16 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2012 (2.7/gill net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The pike were small on average at 16.9 inches long and about 3 years old. The largest pike sampled was 27.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were low in abundance but showed a wide range of sizes from 6 to 12 inches long. Bluegill (1.4/trap net) and black crappie (0.6/trap net) were sampled in low numbers. The largest bluegill sampled was 10.0 inches and the largest crappie was 12.6 inches. Other species sampled include rock bass, and channel catfish. Yellow, black, and brown bullhead were all sampled. Most of these other species were relatively low in abundance with the exception of white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish were found in low abundance throughout the lake for the first time in a fisheries assessment.  Rusty crayfish are an invasive species and are illegal to introduce to lakes or other waterbodies.</p>",
