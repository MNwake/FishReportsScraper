                "narrative": "<p>Big Kandiyohi is a shallow (maximum depth=15 feet) and productive lake with poor waterclarity in the summer (secchi=3.0 ft on 6/12/96). The overland ditch (outlet of Lake Wagonga)and County Ditch#58 are the two major inlets that contribute the majority of water inflow toBig Kandiyohi. There are also several small inlets/tiles/ditches that enter the lake. A sheetpiling outlet dam is located along the south shore. Sources of nutrients include municipalrunoff from Willmar (storm sewer via County Ditch 23A via Lake Wagonga) and Kandiyohi(treated sewer via County Ditch 23A), agricultural runoff from feedlots and row crops viaditches and tiles, and dysfunctional lake home septic systems. In addition, the city ofWillmar dispensed primary treated sewage into County Ditch 23A for many years prior to the1970's. Lake Wagonga water was diverted away from Big Kandiyohi via Branch #4 into JudicialDitch #1 during the early 1970's, but rerouted back into Big Kandiyohi via the overland ditchlater in the 1970's. The shallow depth and length of fetch (3.1 miles) make Big Kandiyohisusceptible to significant in-lake mixing of nutrients and sediments throughout the watercolumn due to wind/wave action. Water quality results from 6/12/96 were as follows: pH=8.94,Total Alkalinity=198 ppm, Total Dissolved Solids=518 ppm, Conductivity=740 ppm, TotalPhosphorus=0.094, Chlorophyll a=11.3 ppm. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed, water moss)is sparse throughout the lake. Nuisance blue-green algae blooms are intense and frequentduring most of the summer. Emergent vegetation stands (hardstem bulrush, cattails, reedcanary grass) are found along the northwest shore/island area and in the southwest bay area.The primary shoalwater substrates are sand, silt, gravel, muck, detritus, and clay. Somerubble is present along the south shore and boulder off the island's east point. Walleyepotential spawning sites include the island's northeast point area, and the gravel/rubblesubstrates along portions of the south shore. Northern pike spawning sites include an inletmarsh area (SW of lake) and Blomkest NPSA, the overland ditch and associated marshlands (Nof lake), and the outlet marsh (SE side of lake). Fish movement is possible between BigKandiyohi and Lillian during high to moderate water levels and the absence of temporary fishtraps. Swinging metal finger fish barriers were put in place during 1996 at the overlandditch and the Little Kandiyohi outlet in order to prevent fish migration into Wagonga fromBig Kandiyohi. Commercial fishermen occasionally operate temporary fish traps at the overlandditch inlet and the State Ditch #1 outlet for removing carp, bullhead, and suckers. Thesurrounding watershed is composed primarily of agricultural crops, livestock/pasture areas,and scattered marshlands. The shoreline characteristics of Big Kandiyohi are primarilyresidential cabins/homes, a hardwood fringe, adjacent agricultural row crops/pasture, andadjacent marshlands. There are two county parks (County Park#1 along the SW shore, CountyPark#2 along the NE shore) with camping, boat rental, and a swimming beach available forpublic use. The lake is managed for walleye and channel catfish as the primary species withblack crappie, northern pike, yellow perch as secondary species. Presently, Big Kandiyohi isscheduled to be stocked with walleye fry (about 2.6 million) every odd year.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (8.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and similar to the historicalaverage (7.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average weight of walleye captured in the gillnets (1.1lbs) was below the historical average (1.8 lbs). The 1996 average size (12.3 inches fromgillnets and trapnets) was below the historical average (16.0 inches). The largest walleyecaptured was 23.2 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 32.4 and 4.4 respectively. Growth ratesappear average for walleye in Big Kandiyohi. About 69% of the walleye trapnet catch (total=51fish) belonged to the 1995 year class. The 1995 fry stocking appeared moderately successfulduring the 1995 fall night electrofishing survey (48.0 young of year\"YOY\"/hour, averagesize=6.5 inches). However, this year class of fish appeared abundant in the 1996 summersurvey nets. Walleye natural reproduction was documented in 1996 by August shoreline seining(0.5 fish/seine haul, average size=4.8 inches). The extent of walleye natural reproductionis probably limited during most years due to poor water quality and limited gravel/rubblesubstrates. There were no walleye captured in the 1996 summer gillnets and trapnets fromnonstocked years. The total walleye catch in the 1996 summer survey was composed primarilyof the 1995 (41%) and the 1994 (43%) year classes. Growth rates appear average for walleyecompared to other area lakes.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (1.1 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.2 - 7.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and below the historicalaverage (3.5 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (20.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was slightly below the historical average (20.7 inches). The largest northern pike capturedwas 26.0 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 50.0 and 0 respectively. About 55% of the fishbelonged to the 1994 year class. Growth rates appear average for northern pike in BigKandiyohi.     Channel catfish abundance in 1996 (1.6 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average(4.4 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (24.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was abovethe historical average (17.6 inches). The largest channel catfish captured was 28.4 inches(9.5 lbs). The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 100.0 and 66.7 respectively. Channel catfish were laststocked in the fall of 1987 (21,417 yearlings). Channel catfish were first stocked in 1969(8,400 fingerlings). There were no YOY channel catfish captured during the 1996 Augustshoreline seining survey, however YOY fish have been captured in previous surveys (1989,1991, 1994).     Historically, both black and white crappie have been present within Big Kandiyohi.However, white crappie have never been abundant in previous surveys and have not beencaptured since 1984. Black crappie abundance in 1996 (0.7 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (1.0 - 12.3 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41 and below thehistorical average (12.6 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (6.0 inches from gillnets andtrapnets) was below the historical average (8.5 inches). The largest black crappie caught was9.1 inches. About 73% of the black crappie captured belonged to the 1995 year class. Growthrates appear average for black crappie in Big Kandiyohi.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (2.3 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.0 - 22.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and below the historicalaverage (11.0 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was below the historical average (8.1 inches). The largest yellow perch captured was 11.1inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 22.2 and 5.6 respectively. About 82% of the yellow perchcaptured belonged to the 1995 year class. Growth rates appear good for yellow perch in thelake. There were 9.4 YOY yellow perch/seine haul caught during the August 1996 shorelineseining survey.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (0.1 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 - 14.9 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (0.9fish/trapnet). YOY bluegill abundance was 15.0 fish/seine haul in the August 1996 shorelineseining survey.     Carp abundance in 1996 (1.8 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.7 - 5.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but below the historicalaverage (4.8 fish/gillnet). However, observations from the survey crew reported that numerouscarp were actively sounding throughout the lake on calm days during the survey in 1996. The1996 average size (26.2 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was above the historical average(22.1 inches). Commercial fishermen removed 137,600 lbs of carp in 1995; 12,253 lbs in 1994;12,000 lbs in 1993; 2,100 lbs in 1992; 112,600 lbs in 1991; 98,250 lbs in 1990; 1,500 lbs in1989, 1,500 lbs in 1988; 107,800 lbs in 1987; 80,170 lbs in 1986.      Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.3 - 78.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41 and below the historicalaverage (17.2 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead abundance in the 1990's has been low (<10fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (7.0 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was below thehistorical average (8.4 inches). The largest black bullhead captured was 12.7 inches.Commercial fishermen removed 2,000 lbs of bullhead in 1995; 650 lbs in 1994; 26,000 lbs in1992; 5,525 lbs in 1991; 14,100 lbs in 1990; 8,700 lbs in 1989; 20,000 lbs in 1988; 28,980lbs in 1987; 33,590 lbs in 1986.     It appears that the walleye population is rebounding after several years of low numbersand poor angling success in Big Kandiyohi. However, forage (yellow perch, black bullhead)abundance continues to be a limiting factor in the lake. The lack of submergent vegetationfor yellow perch spawning habitat is one possible reason that yellow perch numbers are low.Black bullhead abundance have dramatically decreased in shallow area lakes including BigKandiyohi during the 1990's. Black crappie abundance has been poor with the exception of the1979 survey. Channel catfish have become an important part of the fishery in the last tenyears. Big Kandiyohi has significant water quality problems due to past and present nutrientinflows from municipal, agricultural, and lakeshore residential areas. Furthermore, nutrientsand sediments are frequently resuspended in the water column. These resuspended nutrients areavailable for algal production due to in-lake mixing of sediments from wind/wave action, andhigh carp numbers stirring up the bottom and releasing fecal wastes during feeding. Intenseblue-green algae blooms have become more frequent and earlier in the summer (June) duringrecent years. Management goals are to encourage landowners in the watershed to implement bestmanagement practices (conservation tillage, manure/feedlot management, wetland restoration,updating dysfunctional septic systems, planting buffer strips, etc.). One proposal to reducemunicipal storm sewer runoff in the watershed is to restore a large drained wetland/lakebasin (Grass Lake) upstream of Lake Wagonga. There is strong local support for this project,however funding is presently inadequate. Unfortunately, Big Kandiyohi will continue to haveproblems with significant algae blooms even if substantial positive changes in landmanagement occur within the watershed due frequent in-lake mixing sediments/nutrients thatwere deposited into the lake during past years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Kandiyohi is a large, shallow, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common from mid June through early September each year.The shallowness, large fetch, frequent mixing by wind/wave/carp action, and high phosphoruscontent in the sediments of Big Kandiyohi are conducive for producing intense algae bloomsduring the summer months. Submergent vegetation is generally limited to small stands of watermoss and sago pondweed. The watershed is dominated by agricultural row crops. There areseveral major ditches that drain and release nutrient runoff into Big Kandiyohi. BigKandiyohi is stocked with walleye fry every odd year. The Blomkest Northern Pike SpawningArea \"NPSA\" is operated each spring for the production of northern pike fingerlings. Otherspecies that have been stocked in recent years include black crappie, bluegill, and yellowperch. Big Kandiyohi is fished primarily for walleye, channel catfish, and yellow perch.     Walleye numbers (4.14 fish/gillnet) were low in 2000 compared to the historical average(9.90 fish/gillnet). The highest walleye catch rate (33.50 fish/gillnet) was recorded in the1998 population assessment. Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye during thelast several years. The 2000 walleye average size was small (13.48 inches, gillnets andtrapnets combined). Two dominant year classes (1996, 1995) present during the 1998 surveywere substantially lower in numbers during the 2000 survey. Fair walleye natural reproductionwas documented in Big Kandiyohi during 1996 and 1998. Recently, walleye fry were stocked intoBig Kandiyohi during the spring of 1999 (2.7 million) and 1997 (3.1 million). The limitingfactor for walleye in Big Kandiyohi is an abundant and stable yellow perch forage base.     Yellow perch abundance in 2000 (3.43 fish/gillnet) was low compared to the historicalaverage (10.46 fish/gillnet). The 2000 yellow perch average size from the gillnets was large(10.16 inches and 0.62 lbs.).     Channel catfish abundance was low to moderate in 2000 (2.43 fish/gillnet) and below thehistorical average (4.35 fish/gillnet). The channel catfish average size was large (24.23inches and 5.90 lbs, gillnets). Channel catfish were last stocked into Big Kandiyohi during1986 (21,417 yearlings). Channel catfish are presently maintaining low to moderate populationnumbers in Big Kandiyohi through natural reproduction.     Northern pike numbers were low in 2000 (1.14 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pikeaverage length (22.98 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined) was moderate and above thehistorical average (20.94 inches). The largest northern pike captured in the 2000 survey netswas 37.20 inches. The Blomkest NPSA produced 29,500 northern pike fingerlings in 1999, butno fingerlings in 2000.     Carp numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (7.14 fish/gillnet) compared to thehistorical average (6.64 fish/gillnet). The 2000 carp average weight was 4.69 lbs (gillnets).     Black bullhead numbers were low in 2000 (2.13 fish/trapnet) compared to the historicalaverage (14.14 fish/trapnet). The 2000 black bullhead average length (12.27 inches, gillnetsand trapnets combined) was large compared to the historical average (8.97 inches).     Other fish species captured in the 2000 population assessment included low numbers ofblack crappie (0.4 fish/trapnet, 0.54 lbs. average weight), bluegill (0.60 fish/trapnet, 0.25lbs. average weight), and smallmouth bass (0.33 fish/trapnet, 0.46 lbs. average weight). Theblack crappie historical catch rate was 10.09 fish/trapnet, although trapnet catch rates havebeen low since 1984.     Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye during the last several years.Fishing success from May to June of 2000 was moderate for walleye. Winter angling success in2000-2001 was generally fair to poor. Yellow perch success has been generally poor fornumbers, but the average size has been large. Additional spawning habitat (brush or conifertree reefs, submergent and emergent vegetation) may increase yellow perch recruitment in BigKandiyohi. Channel catfish has been a popular fish species especially for out of stateanglers staying at the Kandiyohi County Parks. The greatest concern for Big Kandiyohi is thedeteriorating water quality. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and frequent duringthe summer hindering both fishing and recreational activities. Local landowners need topractice more best management practices (conservation tillage, planting buffer stripsadjacent to ditches and tile intakes, restoring wetlands, replacing nonconforming septicsystems, using no phosphorus lawn fertilizers, proper manure storage and application) withinthe watershed to limit incoming nutrients into Big Kandiyohi.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during late July of 2006. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,692 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkills are rare in Big Kandiyohi. A significant partial summerkill of carp, crappies, and bullheads occurred due to a suspected bacterial outbreak of columnaris during May of 2002. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events from agricultural and lake residential sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Big Kandiyohi is connected to several shallow lakes through outlet and inlet ditches. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to Lake Lillian via a ditch. There are two county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides). Big Kandiyohi is a reference lake for a DNR statewide regulations study.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2006 (8.57 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 11.49 fish/gillnet. The 2006 yellow perch average size was moderate to large (0.52 pounds and 9.87 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average size is 0.40 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (5.14 fish/gillnet) in the 2006 assessment. Yellow perch growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2006 (0.57 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.85 fish/gillnet. The 2006 northern pike average size was moderate to large (4.54 pounds and 26.58 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.31 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2006 (1.53 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the Big Kandiyohi historical average catch rate (0.97 fish/trapnet). The 2006 bluegill average size was moderate (0.29 pounds and 6.10 inches from trapnets) and similar to the historical average (0.30 pounds from trapnets). Numerous pre-spawn bluegill adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, and 2003-2004 to boost brood stock abundance. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2006 (0.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 7.86 fish/trapnet. The 2006 black crappie average size was moderate (0.49 pounds and 8.69 inches from trapnets). The black crappie historical average weight is 0.51 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2002, 2001 and 1999. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers were low in 2006 (1.00 fish/gillnet). The channel catfish historical average catch rate is 3.27 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2006 channel catfish average size was moderate (3.91 pounds and 21.93 inches from gillnets). The channel catfish historical average weight is 3.94 pounds from gillnets. Channel catfish were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings) and 2005 (13,523 fish, 165 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (12.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 10.61 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.58 pounds and 14.75 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight is 1.64 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low to moderate (3.57 fish/gillnet) in 2006. Walleye growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but near or above the normal ranges for ages 6-8. Walleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. A strong 2001 walleye year class (fry stocked year) was documented in the 2002, 2004, and 2006 summer assessments, and a 2001 fall electrofishing survey (133.50 YOY/hour). Strong year classes for 2002 (natural reproduction) and 2003 (fry stocked year) were also noted in the 2006 assessment. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2.18 million walleye fry in the spring of 2006. The 2006 fall electrofishing survey indicated high YOY walleye numbers present in Big Kandiyohi (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches average length). <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were low in 2006 (0.14 fish/gillnet). The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.21 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The smallmouth bass catch rate was also low in the trapnets (0.13 fish/trapnet) during the 2006 assessment. The smallmouth bass average weights were 1.58 and 1.28 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Smallmouth bass were first captured in Big Kandiyohi during a 1996 resurvey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low to moderate in 2006 (9.43 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 37.66 fish/gillnet in Big Kandiyohi. The 2006 black bullhead average size was large (1.00 pounds and 11.38 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.53 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2006 (12.71 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 8.31 fish/gillnet. The 2006 carp average size was moderate to small (3.46 pounds and 19.27 inches from gillnets). The carp historical average weight is 4.33 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2011 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during late July of 2004. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,692 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkills are rare in Big Kandiyohi. A significant partial summerkill of carp, crappies, and bullheads occurred due to a suspected bacterial outbreak of columnaris during May of 2002. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events from agricultural and lake residential sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Big Kandiyohi is connected to several shallow lakes through outlet and inlet ditches. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects to Lake Lillian via a ditch. Blue-green algae blooms were not as intense in 2004 compared to previous years. There are two county parks located on the lake (northeast and southwest sides). Big Kandiyohi is a reference lake for a DNR statewide regulations study. Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2004 (7.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average catch rate (11.73 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 yellow perch average size was large (0.48 pounds and 9.52 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.39 pounds from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured in the 2004 assessment was 11.26 inches. The catch rate of 8.00 inch and larger yellow perch was moderate (7.20 fish/gillnet) in the 2004 assessment. Yellow perch growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2001 yellow perch year class comprised 69% of the 2004 assessment yellow perch catch.Northern pike numbers were low in 2004 (0.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 3.04 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 northern pike average size was small (1.68 pounds and 19.17 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.12 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 assessment was 33.19 inches. Bluegill numbers were low in 2004 (1.40 fish/trapnet) compared to area largemouth bass/bluegill dominated lakes (clear, small, deep), but within the normal range for similar lakes (turbid, large, shallow). The bluegill historical catch rate is 0.92 fish/trapnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.34 pounds and 6.87 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured in the 2004 assessment was 9.17 inches. Adult pre-spawn bluegill were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, and 2003-2004 to boost brood stock numbers.Black crappie numbers were low in 2004 (0.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rate is 8.49 fish/trapnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 black crappie average size was large (0.93 pounds and 11.35 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.51 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2002, 2001 and 1999.Channel catfish numbers were low in 2004 (0.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Big Kandiyohi (0.95 - 3.46 fish/gillnet). The channel catfish historical average catch rate is 3.46 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 channel catfish average size was small (0.89 pounds and 14.08 inches) from gillnets. The channel catfish historical average weight is 3.94 pounds from gillnets. The largest channel catfish captured in the 2004 assessment was 27.20 inches. Channel catfish were last stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings). Channel catfish fingerlings are proposed to be stocked in 2005. Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (6.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (10.49 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate (1.22 pounds and 13.02 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.65 pounds from gillnets. The largest walleye captured in the 2004 assessment was 28.74 inches. The catch rate of 15.00 inch and larger walleye was low (1.40 fish/gillnet) in 2004. Walleye growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but above the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2001 walleye year class comprised 68% of the 2004 assessment walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. A strong 2001 walleye year class (1.98 million walleye fry stocked in 2001) was documented both in the 2002 and 2004 summer assessments, and a 2001 fall electrofishing survey (133.50 YOY/hour). Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2.1 million walleye fry in the spring of 2003. Smallmouth bass abundance in 2004 (0.00 fish/gillnet) was the lowest recorded value for Big Kandiyohi, and below the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.22 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. Only one smallmouth bass was captured in the trapnets (0.07 fish/trapnet, 0.10 pounds average weight) during the 2004 assessment. Smallmouth were first captured in Big Kandiyohi during a 1996 resurvey. Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2004 (59.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (40.21 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2004 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.53 pounds and 9.52 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.49 pounds from gillnets.Carp numbers were abundant in 2004 (19.40 fish/gillnet) and above the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 7.95 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2004 carp average size was small (2.45 pounds and 17.10 inches) from gillnets. The carp historical average weight is 4.40 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Big Kandiyohi Lake during September 9, 2017. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous surveys and historical data review. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2011, 2013, and 2015. Early ice out conditions occurred during 2017 for Spicer Area lakes. Approximately 1.5 million Spicer Strain fry were stocked on April 28, 2017. Walleye fry to fingerling survival is generally poor during early ice out years as was the case for many Spicer Area lakes in 2017. However, abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in Big Kandiyohi during the 2017 fall electrofishing survey (80.69 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches average). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.00 YOY/hour). These 2015 fish were small (4.78 inches). Low numbers of yearling Walleye (4.14 fish/hour, 10.00 inches average) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. In other previous fall night electrofishing surveys, high YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.84 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.09 inches), 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.76 inches) and 2013 (134.00 YOY/hour, 5.77 inches). The historical average catch rate is 86.46 YOY/hour for Big Kandiyohi. Local anglers reported good catches of adult Walleye during 2015-2017 which were likely due to the 2011 and 2013 fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years (next stocking in 2019) to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted on September 2, 2020. Shoreline seining at 8 historical sites were sampled with 50 feet long, 1/8 inch mesh and 5 feet deep bag seine. A seine haul was conducted for 100 feet at each station. The objective was to evaluate Yellow Perch spawning success and potential effects of in-lake spawning brush/tree structures placed previously in Big Kandiyohi Lake. Local residents and Big Kandiyohi Lake Association members placed anchored brush/tree structures in scattered near shore areas of Big Kandiyohi during the 2017-18 winter. <br> \n <br> \nBig Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity by the fall (> 3 feet). High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. The nutrient runoff sources are primarily from agricultural and municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda, in addition to normal lake residential (i.e. lawn runoff) sources. Commercial netters harvested Common Carp (147,500 pounds) and Bigmouth Buffalo (49,400 pounds) from Big Kandiyohi in 2016. Fluctuating water levels often occur in Big Kandiyohi due to numerous ditch and tile connections. Water levels were low in 2020. The outlet connects to Lake Lillian via a ditch. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences in Big Kandiyohi. Nutrient levels have been historically high in the past (June 2011: total phosphorus=0.152 ppm, chlorophyll-a=28.7 ppb) for Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities are relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, silt, and rubble. Big Kandiyohi is a popular early summer and winter angling lake for Walleye and Yellow Perch. There are two popular county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available recreational vehicle campsites. There were approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011. There are several non-developed areas located along the southeast shore, north portion adjacent to a large wetland area, scattered bay areas and a large island. Habitat of these undeveloped areas may consist of all or some of the following: cattails, shallow soft sediment shoalwaters, shallow rubble shoalwaters, downed hardwood trees or moderate stands of sago pondweed. Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and Yellow Perch during the 2019-20 winter. Poor ice conditions limited early ice angling pressure during the 2020-21 winter. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in the previous 2016 survey (21.25 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average catch rate (12.13 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Yellow Perch average weight and length were 0.50 pounds and 10.11 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight and length were 0.42 pounds and 9.28 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches and larger) was 14.00 fish/gillnet in 2016. Yellow perch growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2013 yellow perch year class comprised 86% of the 2016 yellow perch catch. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2018 (6,000 fish, 240 pounds), 2017 (7,084 fish, 1,012 pounds), 2016 (9,840 fish, 820 pounds) and 2015 (1,048 fish, 262 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nNo young of year \"YOY\" Yellow Perch were captured in the 2020 shoreline seining survey. Two adult Yellow Perch were captured during the 2020 survey. Abundant young of year \"YOY\" Yellow Perch (136.25 fish/seine haul) were caught in the 2018 shoreline seining targeted survey. It was the highest historical recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The historical average is 17.42 fish/seine haul. Shoreline seining surveys or Natural Reproduction Checks have been done on an irregular basis since 1949 for Big Kandiyohi. The majority of historical seining surveys were conducted during August, sampling seine lengths of 600+ feet, at 6+ stations, and using similar sized seines (i.e. 50 feet long, 5 feet deep and 1/4 inch mesh size or less). The historical data still provides adequate relative abundance estimates for YOY Yellow Perch even though not all sampling stations sampled, gear or methods were exactly the same. The 2018 YOY Yellow Perch average size was 3.30 inches, which is indicative of above average YOY growth. It appears that good Yellow Perch natural reproduction success and recruitment had occurred during 2018, but not during 2020 in Big Kandiyohi. Local residents documented with pictures of Yellow Perch egg masses attached on the installed brush/tree structures in the spring of 2018. The contribution of the installed tree/brush structures to Yellow Perch natural reproduction success is difficult to quantify, but qualitatively appears to be positive. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of YOY Bluegill were captured in both the 2020 (58.63 YOY/seine haul) and 2018 (70.50 fish/seine haul) seine hauls. Other YOY and adult fish species captured included Bigmouth Buffalo (6.13 fish/seine haul), Black Bullhead (2.63 fish/seine haul), Black Crappie (0.50 fish/seine haul), Common Carp (0.75 fish/seine haul), Fathead Minnow (59.38 fish/seine haul), Johnny Darter (8.75 fish/seine haul), Iowa Darter (0.13 fish/seine haul), Largemouth Bass (2.26 fish/seine haul), Least Darter (0.63 fish/seine haul), Orangespotted Sunfish (30.00 fish/seine haul) and Smallmouth Bass (7.63 fish/seine haul) during 2020. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, allowing commercial harvest of Common Carp, improving Yellow Perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

Shoreline seining at 8 historical sites were sampled with 50 feet long, 1/8 inch mesh and 5 feet deep bag seine. A seine haul was conducted for 100 feet at each station. The objective was to evaluate Yellow Perch spawning success and potential effects of in-lake spawning brush/tree structures placed previously in Big Kandiyohi Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity by the fall (> 3 feet). High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. The nutrient runoff sources are primarily from agricultural and municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda, in addition to normal lake residential (i.e. lawn runoff) sources. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences in Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities are relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, silt, and rubble. Big Kandiyohi is a popular early summer and winter angling lake for Walleye and Yellow Perch. There are two popular county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available recreational vehicle campsites. There were approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011. There are several non-developed areas located along the southeast shore, north portion adjacent to a large wetland area, scattered bay areas and a large island. Habitat of these undeveloped areas may consist of all or some of the following: cattails, shallow soft sediment shoalwaters, shallow rubble shoalwaters, downed hardwood trees or moderate stands of sago pondweed. Local residents and lake association members placed anchored brush/tree structures in near shore areas during the 2017-18 winter to increase or maintain Yellow Perch recruitment/reproduction in Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant in the previous 2016 survey (21.25 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 12.13 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Yellow Perch average size was large (0.50 pounds and 10.11 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight and length were 0.42 pounds and 9.28 inches from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates are above average in Big Kandiyohi. The 2013 yellow perch year class comprised 86% of the 2016 yellow perch catch. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2018 (6,000 fish, 240 pounds), 2017 (7,084 fish, 1,012 pounds), 2016 (9,840 fish, 820 pounds) and 2015 (1,048 fish, 262 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nPresently, there are adequate adult Yellow Perch numbers (based on the 2016 survey) present to produce good year classes if habitat and spawning conditions are favorable in Big Kandiyohi. Abundant young of year \"YOY\" Yellow Perch (136.25 fish/seine haul) were caught in the 2018 shoreline seining targeted survey. It was the highest historical recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The historical average is 18.45 fish/seine haul. Shoreline seining surveys or Natural Reproduction Checks have been done on an irregular basis since 1949 for Big Kandiyohi. The majority of historical seining surveys were conducted during August, sampling seine lengths of 600+ feet, at 6+ stations, and using similar sized seines (i.e. 50 feet long, 5 feet deep and 1/4 inch mesh size or less). The historical data still provides adequate relative abundance estimates for YOY Yellow Perch even though not all sampling stations sampled, gear or methods were exactly the same. The 2018 YOY Yellow Perch average size is 3.30 inches, which is indicative of above average YOY growth. It appears that good Yellow Perch natural reproduction success and recruitment is occurring in Big Kandiyohi. Local residents documented with pictures of Yellow Perch egg masses attached on the installed brush/tree structures in the spring of 2018. The contribution of the installed tree/brush structures to Yellow Perch natural reproduction success is difficult to quantify, but qualitatively appears to be positive. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of YOY Bluegill (70.50 fish/seine haul) were also captured in the 2018 seine hauls. Other YOY and adult fish species captured included moderate numbers of YOY Common Carp (13.25 fish/seine haul), Smallmouth Bass (11.13 fish/seine haul) and Spottail shiner (16.88 fish/seine haul); low numbers Fathead Minnow, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, Walleye, Black Crappie, Bigmouth Buffalo, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, and Orangespotted Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, allowing commercial harvest of Common Carp, improving Yellow Perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during mid-July of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). An Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey of nearshore fish species was conducted during late August of 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkill is not an issue for Big Kandiyohi due to its greater depth unlike other nearby shallow (10 feet or less) lakes like Elizabeth and Lake Lillian. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity by the fall (> 3 feet). Water clarity was 4.0 feet on July 19, 2021. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. The nutrient runoff sources are primarily from agricultural and municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda, in addition to normal lake residential (i.e. lawn runoff) sources. Commercial netters harvested Common Carp (147,500 pounds) and Bigmouth Buffalo (49,400 pounds) from Big Kandiyohi in 2016. Fluctuating water levels often occur in Big Kandiyohi due to numerous ditch and tile connections. Water levels were low in 2020 and 2021. The outlet connects to Lake Lillian via a ditch. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences in Big Kandiyohi. Intense blue-green algae bloom was present during the late August IBI survey. Nutrient levels have been historically high in the past (June 2011: total phosphorus=0.152 ppm, chlorophyll-a=28.7 ppb) for Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities are usually relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, coontail, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Filamentous algae densities are often at nuisance levels as was the case for 2021. Submergent vegetation species such as curly-leaf pondweed, coontail, sago pondweed and water moss were most prevalent in areas along the southwest portion of the lake. Curly-leaf pondweed was more prevalent in Big Kandiyohi during June than during the July vegetation survey. Sago pondweed was abundant throughout the lake in 2021. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, gravel, boulder, silt, and rubble. Big Kandiyohi is a popular early summer and winter angling lake for Walleye and Yellow Perch. There are two popular county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available recreational vehicle campsites. There were approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011. There are several non-developed areas located along the southeast shore, north portion adjacent to a large wetland area, scattered bay areas and a large island. Habitat of these undeveloped areas may consist of all or some of the following: cattails, shallow soft sediment shoalwaters, shallow rubble shoalwaters, downed hardwood trees or moderate stands of sago pondweed. Local residents and Big Kandiyohi Lake Association members placed anchored brush/tree structures in scattered near shore areas of Big Kandiyohi during the 2017-18 winter for Yellow Perch Spawning. Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and Yellow Perch during the 2019-20 winter. Poor ice conditions limited early ice angling pressure during the 2020-21 winter. Walleye fishing reports were good during 2021 summer and 2021-22 winter. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2021 standard survey (40.67 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (25th=5.65, 50th=8.73, 75th=21.75 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 13.92 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Yellow Perch average size was large (0.28 pounds and 8.27 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight and length were 0.41 pounds and 9.19 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.00 plus inches) was high (29.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. The Yellow Perch catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) was 0.67 fish/gillnet in 2021. Yellow perch growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2018 and 2019 yellow perch year classes each comprised 46% of the 2021 yellow perch catch. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2018 (6,000 fish, 240 pounds), 2017 (7,084 fish, 1,012 pounds), 2016 (9,840 fish, 820 pounds) and 2015 (1,048 fish, 262 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch IBI near shore seining catch was low (1.43 fish/seine haul) in 2021. Most of these Yellow Perch were less than 4 inches. No young of year \"YOY\" Yellow Perch were captured in the 2020 shoreline seining survey. Two adult Yellow Perch were captured during the 2020 survey. Abundant young of year \"YOY\" Yellow Perch (136.25 fish/seine haul) were caught in the 2018 shoreline seining targeted survey. It was the highest historical recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The historical average is 17.42 fish/seine haul. The 2018 YOY Yellow Perch average size was 3.30 inches, which is indicative of above average YOY growth. It appears that good Yellow Perch natural reproduction success and recruitment had occurred during 2018, but not during 2020 in Big Kandiyohi. Local residents documented with pictures of Yellow Perch egg masses attached on the installed brush/tree structures in the spring of 2018. Perhaps variable recruitment/reproduction success and/or brush spawning structure degradation resulted in poor results in 2020. The contribution of the installed tree/brush structures to Yellow Perch natural reproduction success is difficult to quantify, but qualitatively appears to be positive after the initial installation. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2021 (2.67 fish/gillnet) was moderate for Big Kandiyohi. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 2.70 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Northern Pike average size was large (4.91 pounds and 28.27 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.50 pounds from gillnets. The Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.00 plus inches) was moderate (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2021. Northern Pike growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2017 year class comprised 33% of the 2021 Northern Pike catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Big Kandiyohi in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 (1.60 fish/trapnet) was similar to the historical average catch rate of 1.05 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 5.63 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 plus inches) was low (0.47 fish/trapnet) in 2021. The largest Bluegill captured was 10.39 inches. Pre-spawn Bluegill adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, 2003-2004 and 2007 to boost brood stock numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2021 (2.60 fish/trapnet) was low compared the historical average catch rate of 6.92 fish/trapnet. Black Crappie abundance in the 2021 gillnets (3.67 fish/gillnet) was also below the Big Kandiyohi historical average (6.01 fish/gillnet). The 2021 Black Crappie average size was small (0.19 pounds and 6.58 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.49 pounds from trapnets. The Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) was low (0.27 fish/trapnet) in 2021. Black Crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2011, 2010, 2002, 2001 and 1999. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance in 2021 gillnets (0.67 fish/gillnet) was low for Big Kandiyohi. Channel Catfish abundance in 2021 trapnets (0.20 fish/trapnet) was also low for Big Kandiyohi. The Channel Catfish historical average catch rates are 3.21 fish/gillnet and 0.34 fish/trapnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2021 Channel Catfish average size was large (8.00 pounds and 26.89 inches) from gillnets. The Channel Catfish historical average weight is 4.28 pounds from gillnets. Channel Catfish were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings, 1,521 pounds), 2005 (13,523 fingerlings, 165 pounds) and 2008 (13,541 fingerlings, 113 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 (18.00 fish/gillnet) was high for Big Kandiyohi. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 12.48 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Walleye average size was large (2.98 pounds and 20.17 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.62 pounds from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) was high (17.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. The Walleye catch rate of preferred size (20.00 plus inches) was also high (9.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. Walleye growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2017 year class (fry stocked year) comprised 39% of the 2021 Walleye standard survey catch in Big Kandiyohi. The 2016 and 2014 year classes (non-stocked years) each comprised 19% of the 2021 Walleye standard survey catch in Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2-3 million Walleye fry (Pike River or Private strain) per year in the springs of 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Spicer strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2017 (1.4 million), 2019 (1.0 million) and 2021 (1.1 million). A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Big Kandiyohi was last conducted during 2019. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 (19.50 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.00 YOY/hour, 4.78 inches). High YOY Walleye numbers were documented in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.84 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.09 inches), 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.76 inches), 2013 (134.00 YOY/hour, 5.77 inches) and 2017 (80.69 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. The historical average YOY Walleye catch rate is 82.00 YOY/hour for Big Kandiyohi. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (5-7 inches) were sampled in near shore seines during the 2021 August IBI survey. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance was high (2.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021 standard survey. The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 0.57 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The Smallmouth Bass average size was large (2.96 pounds and 17.45 inches) from gillnets in 2021. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 17.91 inches in the 2021 standard survey. Smallmouth growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. All Smallmouth Bass captured in gillnets were from the 2016 year class. Smallmouth Bass were first captured in a Big Kandiyohi survey during 1996.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2021 (20.33 fish/gillnet) was moderate for Big Kandiyohi. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 33.63 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. Low Black Bullhead numbers (12.47 fish/trapnet, 6.69 inches and 0.23 pounds) were captured in 2021 trapnets. The 2021 Black Bullhead average size was large (0.78 pounds and 11.04 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.54 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2021 (1.87 fish/trapnet) was low for Big Kandiyohi. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 5.71 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Common Carp average size was large (9.74 pounds and 25.97 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 5.96 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured include low numbers of White Sucker (1.00 fish/gillnet) and moderate numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (3.00 fish/gillnet). The White Sucker and Bigmouth Buffalo average weights were 2.12 pounds and 2.56 pounds respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, allowing commercial harvest of Common Carp, improving Yellow Perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys may be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Big Kandiyohi Lake in mid-May of 2022 to collect additional data to determine if special regulations are warranted. Twelve standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Special regulations as part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative for several area lakes (Nest, Long, Diamond, George and Florida) currently entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Bluegill or Black Crappie. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Trapnet sampling pre-spawn Bluegill during early/mid-May or September is preferred to summer (June-August) netting for regulation evaluation. <br> \n <br> \nBig Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkill is not an issue for Big Kandiyohi due to its greater depth unlike other nearby shallow (10 feet or less) lakes like Elizabeth and Lake Lillian. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity by the fall (> 3 feet). Water levels were low in 2020-2022. Intense blue-green algae blooms were present during the 2022 summer. Submergent vegetation densities are usually relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, coontail, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Curly-leaf pondweed has been a nuisance in recent years. Filamentous algae densities were at nuisance levels for 2021. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, gravel, boulder, silt, and rubble. Local anglers and residents have expressed an interest in enacting reduced bag limits for Bluegill and Black Crappie in Big Kandiyohi Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low (0.33 fish/trapnet) in mid-May of 2022. The Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.45 pounds and 8.6 inches) from 2022 mid-May trapnets. The summer historical average weights are 0.49 pounds for trapnets. The 2022 mid-May catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) Black Crappie was low (0.17 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were good for ages 1-2 and excellent for ages 3-4. The 2020 and 2018 year classes each comprised 50% of the 2022 Black Crappie catch. Black Crappie adults were most recently stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2010 (1,444 fish, 361 pounds) and 2011(1,248 fish, 312 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (0.08 fish/trapnet) in mid-May of 2022. The summer (late June) historical average catch rate is 1.05 fish/trapnet for Big Kandiyohi Lake. The 2022 mid-May Bluegill average size was large (0.39 pounds and 7.9 inches from trapnets). The summer (mid-July) historical Bluegill average weight is 0.30 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were good for ages 1-8. The 2014 year class comprised 100% of the 2022 Bluegill catch. Bluegill were last stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2007 (1,498 fish, 111 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the 2022 mid-May trapnets included abundant numbers of Black Bullhead (76.33 fish/trapnet) and Yellow Bullhead (6.92 fish/trapnet). Moderate numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (2.42 fish/trapnet), Common Carp (2.17 fish/trapnet) and Channel Catfish (0.67 fish/trapnet) were captured in 2022 mid-May trapnets. Low numbers of Northern Pike (0.33 fish/trapnet), Smallmouth Bass (0.08 fish/trapnet) and Walleye (0.33 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2022 mid-May trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during some Walleye fry stocked years (next scheduled electrofishing survey in 2024) to assess the success or failure of the stockings. Walleye fry stocking is currently scheduled yearly for Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n</p>",

Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, gravel, boulder, silt, and rubble. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis. The Walleye population is due primarily to fry stocking. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2011, 2013, and 2015. Approximately 1.5 million Spicer Strain fry were stocked on April 28, 2017. There were about 1.0 million Spicer Strain Walleye fry stocked in 2019 and 2021. In 2022, 846,507 Walleye fry were stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (539.99 YOY/hour, 5.3 inches) were caught in the 2022 fall night electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 fall electrofishing survey (19.50 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches). However, abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in Big Kandiyohi during the 2017 fall electrofishing survey (80.69 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.00 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches). Yearling Walleye numbers (72 fish/hour, 10.0 inches) were abundant in 2022. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. In other previous fall night electrofishing surveys, high YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.1 inches), 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) and 2013 (134.00 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches). The historical average catch rate is 110.62 YOY/hour for Big Kandiyohi. Local anglers reported good catches of adult Walleye during 2015-2022 which were likely due to recent fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (18.00 fish/gillnet) was above historical average (12.48 fish/gillnet) in the most recent 2021 summer gillnet survey. The 2021 Walleye average weight and length were 2.98 pounds and 20.2 inches from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were excellent. The 2017 (fry stocked year) and 2016 (natural) Walleye year classes comprised 39% and 19% respectively of the 2021 gillnet and trapnet catch in Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2026 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during some Walleye fry stocked years (next scheduled electrofishing survey in 2024) to assess the success or failure of the stockings.

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during late July of 2011. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,692 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkills are rare in Big Kandiyohi. A significant partial summerkill of carp, crappies, and bullheads occurred due to a suspected bacterial outbreak of columnaris during May of 2002. The watershed is dominated by agricultural row crops with lesser amounts of marshland, grassland and residential areas. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events from agricultural, municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda and lake residential sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. Big Kandiyohi is connected to several shallow lakes through outlet and inlet ditches. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake. The outlet connects to Lake Lillian via a ditch. High water level conditions during the spring of 2011 resulted in significant bank erosion around the lake. Water levels were normal to low by late fall of 2011. Water clarity was poor to fair (2.0-3.5 feet) in 2011. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.152 ppm, chlorophyll-a=28.7 ppb) in June of 2011 for Big Kandiyohi. Blue-green algae blooms were uncharacteristically less intense and frequent in 2011 than in previous years for Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities were relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Shoalwater substrates were varied, but consisted mostly of sand, silt, and rubble. There are two county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available campsites. Both parks appeared near full capacity for recreational vehicles using the campsites during July of 2011. There are approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011. Big Kandiyohi was a reference lake for a DNR statewide regulations study several years ago.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate (11.40 fish/gillnet) in 2011 and within the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 11.48 fish/gillnet. The 2011 yellow perch average size was large (0.56 pounds and 9.73 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight and length were 0.41 pounds and 9.18 inches from gillnets. The catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (7.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 re-survey. Yellow perch growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2007 yellow perch year class comprised 38% of the 2011 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to low (2.20 fish/gillnet) in 2011 and within the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.80 fish/gillnet. The 2011 northern pike average size was small (1.79 pounds and 19.23 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.28 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 re-survey. Northern pike growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2010 year class comprised 56% of the 2011 northern pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low (2.47 fish/trapnet) in 2011 compared to similar lakes, but above the normal range for Big Kandiyohi. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.07 fish/trapnet. The 2011 bluegill average size was large (0.71 pounds and 8.70 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of memorable size (10.00 inches) and larger was high (0.47 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 10.24 inches in the 2011 re-survey. Bluegill growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2008 year class comprised 29% of the 2011 bluegill catch. Pre-spawn bluegill adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, 2003-2004 and 2007 to boost brood stock numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low (0.40 fish/trapnet) in 2011 compared to similar lakes, but within the normal range for Big Kandiyohi. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 7.86 fish/trapnet. Black crappie abundance was also low in the 2011 gillnets (0.20 fish/gillnet) and below the normal range for similar lakes. The 2011 black crappie average size was moderate (0.53 pounds and 9.29 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.52 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (0.40 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 re-survey. Black crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2011, 2010, 2002, 2001 and 1999. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers were moderate in 2011 gillnets (1.20 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for Big Kandiyohi. Channel catfish numbers were high in 2011 trapnets (1.07 fish/trapnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The channel catfish historical average catch rate is 3.12 fish/gillnet and 0.28 fish/trapnet for Big Kandiyohi. The 2011 channel catfish average size was large (4.30 pounds and 21.21 inches) from gillnets. The channel catfish historical average weight is 3.94 pounds from gillnets. Channel catfish were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings, 1,521 pounds), 2005 (13,523 fingerlings, 165 pounds) and 2008 (13,541 fingerlings, 113 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2011 (32.60 fish/gillnet) and above the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 12.18 fish/gillnet. The 2011 walleye size was small (0.59 pounds and 11.68 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.57 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Walleye growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2009 and 2008 walleye year classes comprised 61% and 31% respectively of the 2011 gillnet and trapnet catch in Big Kandiyohi. Walleye age 4 years and older were lacking in the 2011 re-survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Strong walleye year classes for 2001, (fry stocked year), 2002 (natural reproduction) and 2003 (fry stocked year) were also noted in the 2006 assessment. Big Kandiyohi was stocked recently with approximately 2-3 million walleye fry per year in the springs of 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2011. High YOY walleye numbers were present in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.84 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.09 inches) and 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.76 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. The 2006 year class was not observed in the 2011 re-survey catch. The historical average YOY catch rates are 82.54 and 86.34 YOY/hour for Spicer Area and Big Kandiyohi respectively. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2011 (0.80 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar 41 lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.26 fish/gillnet for Big Kandiyohi. The smallmouth bass catch rate was also low in the trapnets (0.13 fish/trapnet) during the 2011 re-survey. The smallmouth bass average weights were 0.97 and 1.19 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Smallmouth bass were first captured in Big Kandiyohi during a 1996 resurvey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2011 (5.00 fish/gillnet) and below the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 35.32 fish/gillnet in Big Kandiyohi. The 2011 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.48 pounds and 8.94 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.51 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were high in 2011 (9.33 fish/trapnet) and above the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 5.85 fish/trapnet. The 2011 carp average size was moderate to large (7.87 pounds and 25.69 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 5.59 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

THE AVERAGE WEIGHT PER GILLNET SAMPLED NOP (1.57 LBS. PER FISH) WAS ALSO THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR THIS LAKE AND THE POUNDS PER SET INDEX (2.36 LBS. PER GN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED NOP WERE FROM THE 1989 YEAR-CLASS, WERE BETWEEN 17-19 INCHES LONG, AND SHOWED AVERAGE-TO- ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  THE 1991 BLG CATCH INDEX (0.90 PER TN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41, BUT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERATE FOR BIG KANDIYOHI (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY) WHICH HAS NOP PRODUCED A LARGE ADULT POPULATION. ALL THE SAMPLED BLG WERE BETWEEN 6-7.5 INCHES AND SHOWED AVERAGE-TO-ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  THE 1991 BLC INDEX (0.50 PER TN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE 1989 INDEX (0.10 PER TN), BUT WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE 1973,1979, AND 1984 INDICES (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY) AND WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  SAMPLED BLC SHOWED ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES AND EXCELLENT SIZE (10-12) INCHES).  THE 1991 YEP CATCH INDEX (8.75 PER GN) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERATE FOR BIG KANDIYOHI (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY) AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  SAMPLED YEP SHOWED ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES WITH FISH OVER 10.0 INCHES REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE.  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (10.00 PER GN) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERATE-TO-SLIGHTLY ABOVE MODERATE FOR BIG KANDIYOHI, BUT WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OR OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THE AVERAGE SIZE PER GILLNET SAMPLED WAE (1.2 LBS. PER FISH) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR BIG KANDIYOHI, HOWEVER, THE SAMPLE CONTAINED A RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBER OF AGE 1+ WAE (THE 1990 YEAR-CLASS APPEARS STRONG AS DOES THE 1988 YEAR- CLASS).  NO WAE WERE SAMPLED THAT CAME FROM A YEAR-CLASS WHEN THERE WAS NO FRY STOCKED.  GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW AVERAGE WHICH WAS NOT EXPECTED FROM THIS HIGHLY FERTILE LAKE THAT IS KNOWN AS A GOOD INDEX (13.75 PER GN) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR BIG KANDIYOHI WITH THE AVERAGE WEIGHT PER GILLNET SAMPLED CATFISH BEING 2.72 POUNDS PER FISH (SECOND HIGHEST EVER).  THE LAST YEAR-CLASS STOCKED WAS 1986, HOWEVER, SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WERE SAMPLED THAT WOULD HAVE CAME FROM LATER YEAR- CLASSES (YOY SAMPLED IN 1989 AND 1991 SEINE HAULS).  THE 1991 BLB CATCH INDEX (5.50 PER GN) WAS BY FAR THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR BIG KANDIYOHI LAKE (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH INDEX) AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THE RANGE OF SIZES SAMPLED WAS BETWEEN 7.5 -13.9 INCHES.  THERE WERE NO OTHER APPARENT TRENDS IN THE OTHER NON-GAMEFISH SPECIES SAMPLED. THE REDUCTION OF BLBS, THE RELATIVELY LOW ABUNDANCE WITH ASSOCIATED GOOD GROWTH RATES FOR YEP, BLC, AND BLG (SIZE DISTRIBUTION ALSO SKEWED TO LARGER SIZED INDIVIDUALS), AND THE BELOW AVERAGE GROWTH RATES FOR WAE INDICATE A POSSIBLE LACK OF FORAGE FOR THE TOP-OF-THE-LINE PREDATORS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Kandiyohi is a large, shallow, productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Thereare two county parks (Kandiyohi County Park#1-SW side, and Park#2-NE side) located on thelake. Intense blue-green algae blooms are a common occurrence on Big Kandiyohi during the midsummer months. Big Kandiyohi is a popular walleye and channel catfish angling lake. Panfish(crappies, bluegill, yellow perch) have also been sought by anglers in the past. A northernpike spawning area \"Blomkest NPSA\" is operated near the southwest side of the lake forfingerling production each year. The Blomkest NPSA produced 10,368 northern pike fingerlingsin 1995, 0 in 1996, 7,536 fingerlings in 1997, and 2,096 fingerlings in 1998. Walleye naturalreproduction is rare in Big Kandiyohi. There were no young of year \"YOY\" walleye documentedduring the 1994 fall night electrofishing survey. However, there were yearling walleyedocumented in the 1997 (13.7 fish/hour, average length=10.8 inches) fall night electrofishingsurvey which indicated the occurrence of good natural walleye reproduction in 1996. Walleyefry are presently stocked every odd year. There were 3,100,062 walleye fry stocked into BigKandiyohi during the 1997 spring. Walleye fingerlings (30,504 fish, 2,331 lbs.) were stockedinto Big Kandiyohi during the 1994 fall. Channel catfish were last stocked (21,417 yearlings,1520.5 lbs.) into Big Kandiyohi in 1987.     Walleye numbers in 1998 (33.50 fish/gillnet) were above the normal range (3.22 - 15.33fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The 1998walleye average length (14.0 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historicalaverage (15.8 inches). There were two strong year classes of walleye (1996, 1995) present inthe 1998 survey nets. The 1996 walleye year class was due solely to natural reproduction. The1995 year class may be due to the fry stocking or also natural reproduction. Local anglersreported good fishing success for small (<15 inches) walleye during the 1998 summer.     Channel catfish numbers were low in 1998 (1.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (4.08 fish/gillnet). The 1998 channel catfish average length (24.3 inches, gillnetsand trapnets combined) was above the historical average (18.4 inches). Limited channelcatfish natural reproduction does occur in Big Kandiyohi.     Northern pike numbers in 1998 (5.00 fish/gillnet) were above the historical average(3.69 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average weight from the gillnets was 2.44 lbs. The largest northern pike captured in the 1998 survey was 30.3 inches.     Yellow perch abundance in 1998 (13.50 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historicalaverage (11.24 fish/gillnet). The 1998 yellow perch average length was large (9.3 inches,gillnets and trapnets combined).     Panfish numbers (black and white crappie, bluegill) were low in Big Kandiyohi during1998. Black crappie numbers were high to moderate in the 1970's and early 1980's. Blackcrappie adults were scheduled to be stocked (673 lbs.) into Big Kandiyohi during the 1999spring in order to boost numbers and natural reproduction. Historically, bluegill numbershave been less than 3.00 fish/trapnet in Big Kandiyohi. Local anglers did report some successcatching bluegill during the 1998 summer.     Low numbers of smallmouth bass (<13 inches) were caught in the Big Kandiyohi survey netsduring 1998 (0.27 fish/trapnet). Smallmouth bass were not initially stocked by the DNR intoBig Kandiyohi, thus smallmouth bass were probably stocked illegally by private individuals.There have been reports of a few large smallmouth bass being caught in Big Kandiyohi duringthe last few years. There are sufficient areas of boulder and rocky shoal water point areasfor smallmouth bass spawning, however siltation due to frequent wave action on Big Kandiyohimay prevent natural reproduction success during most years.     Black bullhead numbers were low in 1998 (4.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (38.06 fish/gillnet), but above recent surveys. The 1998 black bullhead averagelength was large (9.5 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined).     Big Kandiyohi fishing for walleye has improved during the last two years. Both walleyeand northern pike numbers have increased significantly from the previous surveys. Channelcatfish have become a popular secondary species, especially for out of state angling partiesthat camp at Kandiyohi County Park #1 or #2. Future channel catfish stockings may occurdepending upon both channel catfish and forage fish numbers present in Big Kandiyohi. Walleyeforage fish (yellow perch and black bullhead) numbers improved in 1998 compared to previoussurveys in 1996 and 1994. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor adultpopulation numbers by summer test netting every four years and walleye YOY numbers by fallelectrofishing every two years in order to evaluate the effectiveness of managementpractices. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Big Kandiyohi Lake during October 3, 2019. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous surveys. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2011, 2013, and 2015. Approximately 1.5 million Spicer Strain fry were stocked on April 28, 2017. There were about 1.0 million Spicer Strain Walleye fry stocked on May 13, 2019. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2019 fall electrofishing survey (19.50 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches). However, abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in Big Kandiyohi during the 2017 fall electrofishing survey (80.69 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches). Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.00 YOY/hour, 4.78 inches). No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. In other previous fall night electrofishing surveys, high YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.84 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.09 inches), 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.76 inches) and 2013 (134.00 YOY/hour, 5.77 inches). The historical average catch rate is 82.00 YOY/hour for Big Kandiyohi. Local anglers reported good catches of adult Walleye during 2015-2019 which were likely due to recent fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (11.25 fish/gillnet) was within the normal ranges for Big Kandiyohi and similar lakes in the most recent 2016 summer gillnet survey. The 2016 Walleye average weight and length were 0.89 pounds and 13.46 inches from gillnets. The 2013 (fry stocked year) and 2014 (natural) Walleye year classes comprised 53% and 24% respectively of the 2016 gillnet and trapnet catch in Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years (next scheduled stocking in 2021) to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted on August 25-30, 2019, by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 22 sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 23 stations. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station and backpack electrofishing at 2 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance Iowa Darter and Smallmouth Bass) and 6 that are tolerant of disturbance (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. A FIBI score of 16 was calculated which is below the impairment threshold (36). Scores above the threshold are preferred. Catches comprised of a relatively high biomass of tolerant and omnivore species and a relatively low biomass of insectivore species, all of which contributed negatively to FIBI scores. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Cisco), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Big Kandiyohi is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the South Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,692 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum), hyper-productivelake. The shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, clay, and gravel. Emergent vegetation(common cattails) is found along the northwest shore/island area and within a small bay(southwest corner). Submergent vegetation species and densities are limited. Sago pondweedand watermoss are the most commonly occurring species. Blue-green algae blooms have becomemore intense and frequent throughout the summer months in recent years. The watershed areais about 38,400 acres. There are two major inlets that drain agricultural land (OverlandDitch entering the north shore, County Ditch #58 entering the southwest shore) and a smallmarsh originated inlet (south shore). The outlet (southeast shore) flows into Lake Lillianand the South Fork of the Crow River. Nutrient loading from agricultural runoff, Willmarstorm sewer (presently occurring) and sewage treatment plant (no longer occurring) runoff(via Lake Wagonga and the overland ditch) have contributed to the high nutrient levels withinthe lake basin over the years. Surface water phosphorous levels were extremely high (0.189ppm on 6/13/94). Phosphorous is being continually resuspended from the sediments into thewater column during the summer due to wind and wave action (large fetch and shallow depth),and bottom feeding fish (carp, black bullhead) which stirs up the bottom. A study by aprivate consultant (Blue Water Science) estimated that the total phosphorous levels withinthe lake comes mostly from the bottom sediments (59%) and inputs from the watershed (37%).Significant reductions in nutrient inputs from the watershed will probably result in veryslow improvements to the present water quality due to the lake morphology (large fetch,shallow) and the high amount of phosphorous presently within the sediment. Big Kandiyohi ishighly developed with 269 homes/cottages and two county parks with camping sites. Anglersgenerally seek walleye, channel catfish, northern pike, yellow perch, or black crappie on BigKandiyohi. Big Kandiyohi has also been a popular recreational lake (swimming, skiing,boating, etc.) in the past, however, declining water quality (intense blue-green algaeblooms) has resulted in a decline of these activities. Currently, Big Kandiyohi is managedfor walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and channel catfish. A small northern pikespawning area is operated along the southwest portion of the lake. Walleye fry (2 million perstocking) have been generally stocked every other year. Channel catfish fingerlings/yearlingswere first introduced in 1969 and were subsequently stocked in 1971, 1976, 1979, 1984, and1987.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (3.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.2 - 15.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but was the lowest recorded value (historical average=7.6fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (1.7 lbs from gillnets) was below the historical average(1.9 lbs). The largest fish caught was 25.3 inches. All walleye caught in the survey gearwere probably from previous DNR fry stockings. In 1994, the stocking schedule was changed toevery odd year to correspond to the stocking of other watershed lakes. Fall electrofishingin 1994 confirmed that natural reproduction did not occur in Big Kandiyohi during 1993 or1994 (non-stocking years), unlike other area lakes with better water quality and spawninghabitat (Green, Diamond, Koronis, Rice). Thus, 2,687 lbs (35,473 fish) of walleye fingerlingswere stocked during the late fall of 1994 to supplement the lake until the 1995 spring frystocking took place. Growth rates appear good compared to other local lakes.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (2.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.2 -7.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (3.9 fish/gillnet).However, northern pike numbers were above the two previous surveys (1989=0.3 fish/gillnet,1991=1.5 fish/gillnet) when natural reproduction was limited due to drought conditions (late1980's). The largest northern pike caught was 26.4 inches. The average size in 1994 (18.6inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historical average (20.8 inches).There appears to be several moderate year classes present (1991-1993), however growth ratesappear slightly below average.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (8.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0   -22.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but was slightly below the historical average (12.2fish/gillnet). Yellow perch numbers were similar to previous surveys with the exception ofthe 1979 (30.0 fish/gillnet) and 1984 (23.3 fish/gillnet) surveys. The 1994 average size (9.0inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was above the historical average (8.3 inches).The largest yellow perch caught was 12.0 inches. Growth rates appear above average.     Channel catfish abundance in 1994 (2.9 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average(4.8 fish/gillnet). The highest recorded abundance occurred in 1991 (13.8 fish/gillnet).Channel catfish were first introduced in 1969, but have not been stocked since 1987. Channelcatfish natural reproduction has been documented in the 1994 survey (1994=1.6 fish/seinehaul, average length=1.8 inches), 1991 survey (0.25 fish/seine haul), and 1989 survey (0.8fish/seine haul). However, it appears that the contributions of natural reproduction to thechannel catfish population is relatively small. The majority of the fish captured in 1994 areprobably from 1987 and 1984 yearling stockings. There were no fish captured less than 19.0inches. The average size in 1994 (5.1 lbs, 23.0 inches from gillnets) was above thehistorical average (2.2 lbs). The largest fish caught was 28.8 inches (12.0 lbs).     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.4 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (0.8 -11.1 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (12.4 fish/gillnet).Although, 1994 catch rates were similar to previous surveys with the exception of 1979 (72.5fish/gillnet) and 1984 (11.8 fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (9.3 inches) was slightlyabove the historical average (8.8 inches).     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (2.0 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (4.6 -83.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and was the lowest recorded value (historicalaverage=48.3 fish/gillnet). Black bullhead numbers have been low the last several years inmost area lakes. The 1994 average size (9.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wasabove the historical average (8.7 inches).     Carp abundance in 1994 (8.1 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.7 - 5.1fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (5.2 fish/trapnet). Theaverage size in 1994 (6.3 lbs from trapnets) was above the historical average (5.4 lbs). Carphave negative impacts on the water clarity of Big Kandiyohi. Carp root up the bottomsediments during feeding which results in a release of phosphorous from the sediments intothe water column to be utilized by blue-green algae. In the winter of 1995, 85,600 lbs ofcarp and 1,350 lbs of buffalo fish were removed by commercial fishermen.     Improving water clarity and quality, and increasing the abundance of rooted aquaticvegetation are the most important management objectives for Big Kandiyohi. Specificpriorities include reducing incoming nutrients within the watershed (encouraging conservationtillage techniques, planting of buffer strips, and other best land management practices),reducing the number of carp present through commercial harvest, and restoring a large shallowwetland/lake basin (Grass Lake) upstream of Lake Wagonga which would filter some of theWillmar storm sewer runoff. Even with significant reductions of incoming nutrients,improvements to the water clarity/quality may not be noticeable for many years due to thelarge concentrations of phosphorous within the bottom sediments and the correspondingconditions (large fetch, shallow depth) which are conducive for mixing and releasing ofnutrients. Other management priorities include maintaining a good walleye population throughfry stocking or fingerling stocking when poor fry survival occurs, operating the northernpike spawning area, maintaining a channel catfish population through stocking when necessary,improving black crappie numbers through occasional broodstocking when populations are too lowto rebound, and monitoring of the fish populations through surveys and special assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during August of 2002. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,692 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Winterkills are rare in Big Kandiyohi. A significant partial summerkill of carp, crappie, and bullhead numbers occurred due to a suspected bacterial disease (columnaris) during May of 2002. Few walleye or northern pike died during the 2002 summerkill. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events from agricultural and lake residential sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Big Kandiyohi is connected to several shallow lakes through an outlet and inlet ditches. An outlet structure is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The outlet connects via a ditch to Lake Lillian. Water levels in the 2002 spring were below normal, but normal by late summer. Water clarity was fair to moderate during early August of 2002 in Big Kandiyohi. Residential development occurs along most of the lake with the exception of the large island, north portion, and the south shore adjacent to the outlet. There are two county parks located on the lake (northeast and southwest sides). Big Kandiyohi is a reference lake for a DNR statewide regulations study. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2002 (28.3 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (12.1 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 yellow perch average size was moderate to large (0.32 lbs. and 8.2 inches) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 11.6 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (13.2 fish/gillnet) in the 2002 assessment. Northern pike numbers were low in 2002 (1.7 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average (3.3 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The northern pike average size was small (1.97 lbs. and 20.3 inches) from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured was 28.5 inches in the 2002 assessment. Approximately 50% of the northern pike captured in the 2002 assessment were hatched in 2000. Bluegill numbers were low in 2002 (1.5 fish/trapnet), but slightly above the historical average (0.9 fish/trapnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.20 lbs. and 5.5 inches) from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 9.6 inches in the 2002 assessment. Bluegill growth rates were variable for ages 1-7 in Big Kandiyohi compared to area lakes. About 58% of the bluegill captured in the 2002 assessment were hatched in 2001. Adult pre-spawn bluegill were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001 to boost brood stock numbers.Black crappie numbers were low in 2002 (0.7 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (9.3 fish/trapnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 black crappie average size was small (0.19 lbs. and 6.8 inches) from trapnets. The largest black crappie captured was 9.1 inches in the 2002 assessment. Approximately 45% of the black crappie captured in 2002 assessment were hatched in 2001. Black crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2001 and 1999 to boost brood stock numbers.Channel catfish numbers were low in 2002 (1.5 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average (4.1 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 channel catfish average size was large (9.63 lbs. and 27.7 inches) from gillnets. The historical average length is 24.0 inches from gillnets. The largest channel catfish captured was 30.6 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of preferred size (24.0 inches) and larger channel catfish was moderate to high (1.5 fish/gillnet) in the 2002 assessment. Channel catfish were last stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings).Walleye numbers were abundant in 2002 (20.7 fish/gillnet) and the second highest recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The walleye historical catch rate is 10.9 fish/gillnet. The 2002 walleye average size was moderate (1.40 lbs. and 15.0 inches) from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 24.9 inches in the 2002 assessment. Walleye growth rates in Big Kandiyohi were generally within the normal ranges compared to area lakes. Two strong walleye year classes (2001, 2000) were present in the 2002 assessment catch. The 2001 year class (fry stocked year) comprised 52% of the catch in the 2002 assessment. Walleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. However, a strong 2000 walleye year class from natural reproduction was documented in the current 2002 assessment. Big Kandiyohi was stocked with approximately 1.98 million walleye fry in the spring of 2001. Smallmouth bass numbers were low to moderate in 2002 (2.5 fish/gillnet), but the highest recorded value for Big Kandiyohi. The historical average catch rate is 0.9 fish/gillnet. The 2002 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.63 lbs. and 13.9 inches) from gillnets. The largest smallmouth bass captured was 15.6 inches in the 2002 assessment. About 44% of the smallmouth bass captured in the 2002 assessment were hatched in 1999. Smallmouth bass growth rates were within the normal ranges in Big Kandiyohi compared to area lakes. Smallmouth were first captured in Big Kandiyohi during a 1996 resurvey. Smallmouth bass were probably introduced into Big Kandiyohi by anglers during the 1990's. Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2002 (80.8 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (38.5 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.40 lbs. and 8.5 inches) from gillnets. The largest black bullhead captured was 11.5 inches in the 2002 assessment.Carp numbers were abundant in 2002 (9.5 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (6.9 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The 2002 carp average size was small (1.88 lbs. and 13.6 inches) from gillnets. The largest carp captured was 29.5 inches in the 2002 assessment. It appears that the 2002 partial summerkill had little effect on the total biomass and numbers of carp present in the lake. Current fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2004 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey of young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on Big Kandiyohi Lake during September 8, 2015. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Big Kandiyohi was stocked recently with approximately 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.00 YOY/hour). These fish were small (4.78 inches). Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success was generally poor in most area lakes during 2015. A rapid temporary warmup (>50 F water temperature) during the spawning season probably caused poor fertilization of Walleye eggs. In addition a long term cold spell after the hatch probably reduced zooplankton production resulting in poor Walleye fry survival during 2015. Moderate numbers of small yearling Walleye, due to natural reproduction, were also captured in 2015 (16.00 fish/hour, 9.37 inches). In previous fall night electrofishing surveys, high YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2006 (177.00 YOY/hour, 5.48 inches), 2008 (135.56 YOY/hour, 4.84 inches), 2009 (60.00 YOY/hour, 5.09 inches), 2011 (272.00 YOY/hour, 5.76 inches) and 2013 (134.00 YOY/hour, 5.77 inches). The historical average catch rate is 86.91 YOY/hour for Big Kandiyohi. Local anglers reported good catches of adult Walleye during 2015 which were likely due to the 2011 and 2013 fry stockings. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during mid July of 2016. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. The nutrient runoff sources are primarily from agricultural and municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda in addition to normal lake residential (i.e. lawn runoff) sources. The Grass Lake Watershed Project was envisioned during the 1990's, but only recently has been funded by state grants and embraced by local governments in 2016. The project goals are to filter and store storm sewer runoff from the city of Willmar into a large wetland complex to reduce nutrients entering downstream into Lake Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. Fluctuating water levels often occur in Big Kandiyohi due to numerous ditch and tile connections. High water level conditions resulted in significant bank erosion around the lake during the 2011 spring. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity in the fall (> 3 feet). Water clarity was fair (5.5 feet) during the 2016 survey, but calm conditions and an intense blue-green algae bloom was present on the water surface. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences in Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities are relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, silt, and rubble. There are two popular county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available recreational vehicle campsites. There were approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2016 (21.25 fish/gillnet) compared to normal range and historical average (12.13 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch average size (0.50 pounds, 10.1 inches) was large from gillnets and these fish exhibited excellent growth rates. There were also abundant Yellow Perch numbers (14.00 fish/gillnet) greater than 10.0 inches in 2016. The 2013 yellow perch year class comprised 86% of the 2016 yellow perch survey catch. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2015 (1,048 fish, 262 pounds) and 2016 (9,840 fish, 820 pounds). There were excellent local reports of winter angling success for Yellow Perch during 2017. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2016 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (2.70 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size (3.26 pounds and 24.1 inches) was above the historical gillnet average (2.34 pounds). Northern Pike fingerlings (300-3,000 fish/year) were stocked recently from 2012 thru 2016. Northern Pike adults were last stocked in 2014 (882 fish, 490 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2016 (0.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (1.02 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill average size was small (0.06 pounds and 4.5 inches) from the 2016 trapnets. Bluegill growth potential can be over 10.0 inches as documented in the 2011 survey for Big Kandiyohi. Pre-spawn Bluegill adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, 2003-2004 and 2007 to boost brood stock numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (5.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range. The 2016 Black Crappie average size (0.44 pounds and 9.2 inches) was moderate and similar to the historical average (0.51 pounds) from trapnets. The 2014 and 2013 year classes comprised 71% and 26% respectively of the 2016 Black Crappie survey catch. Black Crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2011, 2010, 2002, 2001 and 1999. Local anglers recently reported good winter angling success for Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish numbers were abundant in the 2016 gillnets (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (3.38 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Channel Catfish average size (5.05 pounds and 22.3 inches) was large from gillnets. Channel Catfish were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings, 1,521 pounds), 2005 (13,523 fingerlings, 165 pounds) and 2008 (13,541 fingerlings, 113 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (11.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and similar to the historical average (12.12 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size (0.89 pounds and 13.5 inches) was small from gillnets. Walleye growth rates are within the Spicer Area normal range for Big Kandiyohi. The Walleye catch rate of fish 15.0 inches and larger was low (2.09 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2013 (fry stocked year) and 2014 (natural) Walleye year classes comprised 53% and 24% respectively of the 2016 gillnet and trapnet catch in Big Kandiyohi.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Big Kandiyohi was stocked recently with 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Big Kandiyohi was last conducted during 2015. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.0 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches). Yearling walleye numbers were also moderately abundant (16.0 fish/hour, 9.4 inches) in 2015. Fall electrofishing surveys indicated abundant YOY Walleye numbers in 2006 (177.0 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches), 2008 (135.6 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches), 2009 (60.0 YOY/hour, 5.1 inches), 2011 (272.0 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) and 2013 (134.0 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2016 (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (0.26 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The Smallmouth Bass average weight was large (1.94 pounds) from gillnets. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 17.1 inches. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were excellent. The 2012 and 2014 year classes comprised 41% and 35% of the 2016 Smallmouth Bass survey catch. Smallmouth Bass were first captured in a Big Kandiyohi survey during 1996.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (7.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (5.96 fish/trapnet) and normal range of similar lakes. The 2016 Common Carp average size (7.36 pounds and 24.5 inches) was large from trapnets. Commercial netters harvested Common Carp (147,500 pounds) and Bigmouth Buffalo (49,400 pounds) from Big Kandiyohi in 2016. In the past, commercial Common Carp removal has been unsuccessful at significantly reducing abundance over time on large bodies of water. Presently, the cumulative removal effect on Big Kandiyohi Common Carp long term population numbers is unknown but likely negligible due to Common Carp's amazing ability (1.0 million eggs per 10-15 lb. female) to produce large year classes by relatively few numbers of adults in connected wetland and shallow lake areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included moderate numbers of White Sucker (2.75 fish/gillnet), Bigmouth Buffalo (2.47 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (23.52 fish/gillnet, 0.68 pounds average weight). The White Sucker and Bigmouth Buffalo average weights were 2.11 pounds and 2.84 pounds respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, allowing commercial harvest of Common Carp, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",
