                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a 332 acre lake located three miles southwest of the City of Annandale. The has a maximum depth of 50 feet  and moderate water clarity. French lake has a 5,442 acre watershed primarily composed of cropland (47%), pasture (12.9%) and forest (12.8%). A public access is located on the NW side of the lake. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, but Bluegill, Black Crappie, White Crappie and Largemouth Bass are also present. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, walleye have been managed by fingerling stocking.  Since 2003, the lake has been part of a statewide walleye stocking study evaluating the effectiveness of stocking walleye fry, frylings and fingerlings. Surveys have been conducted in several years during the study, most recently in 2011. As part of the study, French Lake was stocked with frylings in four of the last ten years and Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2007. The walleye catch on French Lake has consistently been low.  The catch in 2013 (2.8/gill net) was identical to 2011. Walleye ranged in length from 18.0 to 27.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 2.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in 2013 (3.2/gill net) were higher than 2011 (2.2/gill net) and within the expected range for lakes similar to French Lake. Northern Pike ranged in length from 19.1 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 24.5 inches and 3.3 pounds. Forty seven percent were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate (3.3/gill net) declined greatly from 2011 (26.7/gill net), but was still within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.5 to 6.6 inches in length with an average length and weight of 6.0 inches and 0.1 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have declined in recent surveys. The 2013 catch (2.2/trap net) declined from the 2011 catch (7.2/trap net), which was the lowest recorded catch at the time. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.4 to 11.0 inches with an average length and weight of 7.4 inches and 0.22 pounds. The White Crappie catch (0.6/trap net) was similar to 2011 (0.8/trap net). White Crappie ranged in length from 4.6 to 12.5 inches with an average length and weight of 8.8 inches and 0.41 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate (28.9/trap net) increased from 2011 (19.4/trap net), but remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.5 inches with an average length and weight of 6.0 inches and 0.2 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are usually surveyed by electrofishing, which was not done in 2013. However, Largemouth Bass were caught in both gill nets and trap nets. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 8.2 to 18.4 inches with an average length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.3 pounds. Other species caught included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a 332 acre lake located three miles southwest of the City of Annandale.  The maximum depth of the lake is 50 feet and during mid-July adequate oxygen was present down to 15 feet.  The public access for French Lake is located on the northwest end off of a gravel road.  French Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, therefore, it receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black and White Crappie, Bluegill, Walleye and Northern Pike are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1996, a population assessment was conducted on French Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.  The Northern Pike catch rate in gill nets appeared to increase (4.5/gill net) from the last survey in 1990 (2.2/gill net).  This catch rate of Northern Pike was within the expected range for lakes that are similar to French Lake.  The average size northern caught in gill nets weighed 2.5 pounds and was 22.6 inches long.  Age 3 and 4 fish made up the majority of the gill net catch and the growth rate of Northern Pike in French Lake was average.The gill net catch rate of Yellow Perch in French Lake (6.2/gill net) significantly declined from the last survey (18.5/gill net) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size Yellow Perch caught in gill nets was 5.8 inches in length and 0.1 pounds in weight.  While this average size may seem small, Yellow Perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like Northern Pike and Walleye.The gill net catch rate of Walleye in French Lake (0.7/gill net) appeared to decline from the last survey (2.8/gill net) and fell below expected levels for this lake type.  Historically, the catch of Walleye in French Lake has been low, ranging from 0 to 2.8 per gill net.  The average size Walleye caught in gill nets was 2.1 pounds.  All the Walleye sampled came from years when fingerlings were stocked and the growth rate of Walleye was average compared to other populations in the state.The trap net catch of Bluegill in French Lake (21.3/trap net) did not appear to change significantly from the previous netting in 1990 (32.0/trap net) and remained within normal levels for this lake type.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 2.6-8.3 inches and averaged 4.8 inches in length.The catch rate of Black and White Crappie in trap nets appeared to drop from the last netting, but remained above expected values for lakes similar to French.  Changes in catch rates of panfish in trap nets are highly dependent on the weather, therefore a small change in catch rate like this may not mean a significant change in the fish population.  The catch rate of crappies in gill nets was also high, so the outlook for crappies in French Lake appears to be good.  The average size crappie sampled was over 7.0 inches and five fish over 13.0 inches were caught. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Principal fish species taken in gill nets were Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike abundance has declined significantly since 1985 and is below the range of expected values for lakes similar to French.  Age 4 fish accounted for over 50% of the total.  Growth was fast for ages 1-3 but slowed to good for ages 4-5.  Walleye abundance has increased significantly since 1985, but remains within the average range.  The average length group was 15.0-15. 9 inches.  Age 3 Walleye, representing a fry stocking in 1987, were most common.  Growth was good. Yellow Perch numbers remained stable and are abundant.  Largemouth Bass appear to be present in low numbers, with only 5 bass captured during spring trap netting.  Reproduction was documented by shoreline seining.  \n\nOther important species taken were Bluegill and both Black and White Crappie.  The Bluegill population has increased from low abundance in 1985 and is near the average value for lakes similar to French.  The predominant year class was age 3 and nearly 80% of Bluegill were 7.0-7.9 inches. Growth was fast for ages 2-3.  Numbers of White Crappie and Black Crappie have increased from average abundance in 1985 to above the range of expected values for each species.  Predominant age classes were:  age 2 for White Crappie and ages 2 and 3 for Black Crappie.  Growth of White Crappie was good and Black Crappie grew fast during their first 2 years and slowed to good for age 3.  \n\nNon-game species present in the 1990 survey included Common Carp, White Sucker, Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead.  Local residents report that carp are abundant, although this was not seen in net catches.  Black Bullhead numbers were low.  Young-of-year Black Bullhead were numerous in shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a 332 acre lake located three miles southwest of the City of Annandale.  The lake is eutrophic and has a maximum depth of 50 feet.  A public access is located on the northwest shore, off 42nd St NW.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and crappie, but bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass are also present.\n\nHistorically, walleye have been managed through fingerling stocking because fry stocking produced little success.  Since 2003, as part of a statewide stocking study, walleye frylings have been stocked 4 of the last 8 years most recently in 2010.  The walleye catch was average compared to similar lakes and higher than 2004.  Walleye ranged in length from 10 \u0013 25 inches and averaged 17.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Seventy-one percent of walleye caught were larger than 15 inches and 24% were larger than 20 inches.  The largest walleye collected was 24.4 inches and 5.1 pounds.  Walleye grew fast and reached 18 inches in 4 years.\n\nNorthern pike have never been abundant in French Lake and 2011 was no exception.  The catch was lower than previous surveys and below average compared to similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18 \u0013 37 inches and averaged 26.3 inches and 4.3 pounds.  Sixty-nine percent of the northern pike caught were larger than 24 inches and 15% were larger than 30 inches.  The largest northern pike collected was 37 inches and 8.8 pounds.  Northern pike growth was fast.  Male and female northern pike reached 24 inches by age 4 and 3, respectively.\n\nYellow perch abundance was lower than 2004, but above average compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5 \u0013 8 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  Only two year classes were collected, with age 2 fish making up 96% of the sample.  Growth was fast.  Yellow perch reached 6 inches in 2 years.\n\nThe catch of largemouth bass during day-time spring electrofishing (80.5/hr; on-time) was above the Montrose area day-time average (46.5/ hr; on time), and 2.5 times greater than the 2004 night time electrofishing (32/hr).  Largemouth bass ranged from 5 \u0013 19 inches and averaged 11.7 inches.  Forty-eight percent of the bass sampled were larger than 12 inches and 13% were larger than 15 inches.  Growth of largemouth bass was average.  Largemouth bass reached 12 inches in 4 years.\n\nFrench Lake has a reputation of being an excellent crappie lake.  Although the catch rates of both black and white crappie were lower than 2004, the catch for both species were still within the expected range compared to similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged from 4 \u0013 14.8 inches and averaged 7 inches, while white crappie ranged from 5 \u0013 11 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  The largest black crappie sampled was 14.8 inches and 1.5 pounds and the largest white crappie was 10.9 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Growth was fast for both species.  Black crappie reached 8 inches in 3 years and white crappie reached 9 inches in 4 years.\n\nBluegill abundance was similar to 2004 and within the expected range compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 \u0013 8 inches and averaged 6 inches.  The largest bluegill sampled was 8 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Bluegill growth was average.  Bluegill reached 7 inches in 4.5 years.\n\nOther species sampled during the survey included: black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on French Lake on July 27, 2016 by the Sauk Rapids DNR Fisheries office.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, excepting one site where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish, including one species that is intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Iowa Darter).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for French Lake is above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes; of note was an absence of tolerant fish species, and high number of small benthic and vegetation-dwelling fish species sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. French Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>No Walleye were netted in the 1979 survey; however, they had reportedly been caught by angling with some regularity prior to this date. The 1985 netting shows Walleye to be present at 1.3/gill net, average for this area. Walleye fingerlings stocked in 1979 are well represented in the sample. \n\nNorthern Pike have risen slightly from 3.7/gill net in 1979 to 4.5/gill net in 1985, within the local average range. Three and four year old fish represent the strongest year classes. Average size is 19-23 inches with one fish measuring 33 inches. \n\nBlack Crappie have dramatically declined since 1979 to 1985 (9.7/trap net), but are still above the local average. Younger Black Crappie are conspicuously absent; most of the population are 8-10 inches in length. White Crappies (3.7/trap net) remain present at above local average levels. \n\nBluegill (4.3/trap net) also suffered a reduction in numbers, being only one-fourth as numerous as in 1979. Six year classes are present and shoreline seining indicates good natural reproduction. \n\nPumpkinseed (0.2/trap net), and Hybrid Sunfish (0.2/trap net), Bowfin, and Yellow Bullhead are low in abundance. White Sucker and Black Bullhead numbers are average. Yellow Perch show a small decrease but are still present in numbers greater than the local average. Common Carp numbers remain high at 3.8/trap net, three times the local average. All gamefish species exhibit average growth rates.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a 332-acre lake located three miles southwest of the City of Annandale.  The maximum depth of the lake is 50 feet.  A public access is located on the northwest shore, off 42nd St NW.  French Lake receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black and white crappie, bluegill, walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are all present in the lake.  In July of 2004, a lake survey was conducted on French Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fishery.The catch rate of northern pike in 2004 was similar to 2001, and was within the range that is typical for lakes like French.  The average size of northern pike caught in gill nets (4.3 pounds) was high.  Two of the northern pike sampled were over 35 inches.  Growth rates were fast, and the high average size can likely be attributed to a high yellow perch population, which provides excellent forage for northern pike.The catch rate of walleye in French Lake (1.5/gill net) was similar to the 2001 netting (1.7/gill net) and was within the expected range for this lake type.  The average size of walleye sampled was 2.4 pounds.  Historically, the catch of walleye in French Lake has been low, ranging from 0 to 2.8 per gill net. French Lake has the reputation of being an excellent crappie lake.  Although the catch rates of black and white crappie in trap nets were lower than in 1996, the catch remained within the expected range for lakes similar to French.  Meanwhile, the average size has increased, with white and black crappies averaging 10.1 and 8.6 inches, respectively.  Bluegill numbers were similar to 1996, and within typical levels for this lake type.  Bluegill ranged in size from 3.7-8.2 inches and averaged 6.6 inches in length. Largemouth bass were sampled in spring by night electrofishing.  The catch rate was approximately half the median rate for lakes in the Montrose management area.  Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), a fourth were greater than 12 inches.  The largest bass sampled in 2004 was 15.7 inches.</p>",
