The average size of bluegills captured in the trap nets was 6.02 inches in length. Only 9.4% were larger than 7 inches long. Black crappies were sampled at their lowest level for this lake. Only 23% were larger than 8 inches. Northern pike are currently at the third highest level. The average size sampled in the gill nets was 22.5 inches and 2.6 pounds. Over 21% were larger than 25 inches in length. Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers. The gear used during this survey does not catch bass effectively. Yellow perch are currently at their lowest population level since 1975. They averaged only 6.1 inches long and 0.09 pounds. Other species present in the lake include brown bullheads, yellow bullheads, bowfin, carp, and three sunfish species, green, pumpkinseed, and hybrid. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Auburn Lake is a 261-acre lake located near the town of Victoria in Carver County.  Three Rivers Park District owns a large portion of the shoreline.  A boat access, two fishing piers, and a beach are available within the park.  As with other parks in this regional system, a fee is required to park vehicle-boat trailer combinations. <br> \nThe lake is composed of two distinct basins; the west basin reaches a maximum depth of 84 feet, and the east basin reaches a maximum depth of 34 feet.  Auburn Lake is primarily managed for its Northern Pike population, and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  The Minnesota state record Largemouth Bass was caught from Auburn Lake on October 5, 2005.  The fish measured 23.5 inches, weighed eight pounds 15 ounces, and had a girth of 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Auburn, and of quality size.  Thirty-eight percent of Northern Pike sampled with gill nets were greater than 24 inches, with the largest fish measuring 32.1 inches.  Average size of Northern Pike was 23.3 inches and 3.04 lb.   <br> \n <br> \nAuburn Lake supports an abundant Bluegill population (49.8 fish/net).  Twenty-two percent of sampled fish exceeded 7 inches, with the largest fish measuring 8.6 inches.  Average size of Bluegill was 6.0 inches and 0.17 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at an average rate (7.7 fish/net).  Individuals between 5.7 and 7.2 inches were present in the sample.  The average length was 7.2 inches and average weight was 0.20 lbs.  The largest crappie measured 9.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch between 5.5 and 6.8 inches were sampled at a rate of 4.0 fish per net.  This low catch rate is typical for Auburn.  Yellow Perch catch rates have fluctuated between 1.2 and 5.2 fish per gill net since 2000 (surveys in 2000, 2006, and 2012).   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, hybrids of sunfish species, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The new record measured 23.5 inches, weighed eight pounds 15 ounces, and had a girth of 18 inches.  Typical population assessment surveys do not adequately sample largemouth bass; as evidence, only two largemouth bass, both less than nine inches, were sampled in 2006.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch increased from three fish per gillnet in 2000 to 14.3 fish/gillnet in 2006.  The average black crappie was 2.9 years old, measured 5.95 inches, and weighed 0.1 pound.  Only 4% were over eight inches long.  Bluegill catch in gillnets increased ten-fold since 2000 and trap net catch declined by half.  Average length was 6.22 inches in gillnets and 6.45 inches in trap nets.  Twenty-four percent of bluegills were over seven inches long and the average age was 3.9 years old.  Growth was slightly below average.  Yellow perch catch was up from 3.8 fish/gillnet to 5.2 fish/gillnet.  Mean length and weight stayed the same and growth rates were below average.  The increase in forage fish should provide the predatory species of Auburn a good food base.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch dropped slightly since the 2000 survey to seven fish per gillnet.  The population has good size structure with 28% of pike over 25 inches.  The largest fish measured 33.6 inches and weighed 9.7 pounds.  The average age was 3.1 years old and growth rates were well above average.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: black bullhead, bowfin, carp, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on June 17, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with five sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 15-foot seine was used to sample six stations and four sampling stations had conditions that prevented the use of seines. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish with one tolerant fish species (Green Sunfish) and no intolerant species sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Auburn Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth bass were also abundant in the electrofishing sample and averaged 11.0\" in length, with one out of every 6 bass captured measuring 16.0 inches or longer. Yellow perch were sampled in the highest abundance for effort ever observed on this lake. Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled at above average indicies of abundance. Ten percent of the bluegill captured were 8.0 inches or more in length. Black crappie seem to be down in abundance from previous years and averaged small in size with few quality individuals captured. Three bullhead species are present in the population, with black bullhead being the most common and at levels of abundance higher than previously observed in gill nets. Bowfin are also very common in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Auburn Lake is a 261- acre lake, located near the town of Victoria in Carver County.  Three Rivers Park District owns a large portion of the shoreline.  A boat access, two fishing piers, and a beach are available within the park.  As with other parks in this system, a fee is required to park vehicle-boat trailer combinations.  The lake is composed of two distinct basins; the west basin reaches a maximum depth of 84 feet, and the east basin reaches a maximum depth of 34 feet.  Auburn Lake is primarily managed for its largemouth bass and northern pike populations.  The Minnesota state record largemouth bass was caught from Auburn Lake on October 5, 2005.  The fish measured 23.5 inches, weighed 8 pounds 15 ounces, and had a girth of 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing during the spring targeted the largemouth bass population.  While the average length of bass was only 11.7 inches, the largest bass measured 21.3 inches in length.  Twenty-one percent of bass sampled were greater than 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant during the summer population assessment.  The number per gillnet was 14.8, well above the average of 3.8 for similar lakes. Twenty-five percent of northern pike sampled with gillnets were greater than 24 inches, with the largest fish measuring 29.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe relative abundance of bluegill has increased from 53.1 fish per trap net in 2006 to 77.3 fish per trap net in 2012.  This catch rate is well above average for this type of lake.  Eighty-eight percent of trap-netted bluegill were between 6.0 and 7.0 inches, with the largest bluegill measuring 8.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught at a rate of 12.5 fish per gillnet, which is above average for this type of lake.  The fish were on the small side, with the average fish measuring 6.7 inches and weighing 0.16 lbs.  Only 9.6% of fish sampled were 8 inches or longer, with the largest crappie measuring 8.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye was sampled in a trapnet.  It measured 19.7 inches and weighed 2.89 pounds.  Planned or permitted stocking of walleye has not occurred in over 35 years; origin of this fish is unknown.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrids of sunfish species, and common carp. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE WALLEYE SAMPLED IS PROBABLY A MIGRANT FROM A WALLEYE REARING POND UPSTREAM OF AUBURN LAKE. BOWFIN, CARP, NORTHERN PIKE, BLUEGILL, AND BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED AT ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN NUMBERS. THE FACT THAT EAST AUBURN HAS A HISTORY OF WINTER KILL IS REFLECTED IN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO BASINS. THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF FISH IS LESS THAN ON WEST AUBURN.

                "narrative": "<p>Auburn is a 290-acre (158 littoral acres) lake with a maximum depth of 84 feet. Auburn is located west of Victoria, MN in northern Carver County. Auburn is primarily managed for Northern Pike, but also supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the north side of the west basin of the lake (up to 12 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Auburn Lake during the week of 6/27/2022 to assess the fishery. Auburn Lake is divided into an east and west basin, connected through a narrow cattail channel. Both basins had moderate water clarity, measured at 7 feet (west basin) and 5 feet (east basin) during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was 0 parts per million (ppm) below 52 feet (west basin) and 14 feet (east basin) during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Auburn Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (10.8/net). There were 65 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 24.1 inches and the largest measured at 31.5 inches. Size and catch data describes a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Despite high numbers, Northern Pike growth was moderate compared to similar lakes across the metro, with an average length of 18.3 inches by age 3, and 23.0 inches by age 5. Recruitment was consistent with six consecutive year classes present during sampling and age analysis. High numbers and above average sizes should provide excellent angling opportunity for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Auburn Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2022 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught one Largemouth Bass, measuring 13 inches. Future surveys will include a targeted spring boat-electrofishing component. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (46.0/net). The 2022 catch rate was the highest Bluegill catch rate on Auburn Lake in the previous 25 years. There were 414 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 5.7 inches and the largest measured at 7.9 inches. High numbers of Bluegill are likely increasing competition among other Bluegill and in-turn growth rates and sizes remain slow/small. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (10.5/net) and trap nets (3.7/net), near the expected catch rate of other metro lakes. There were 96 Black Crappie sampled during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 7.1 inches and the largest measured at 13.1 inches. Despite a small average size, with only 7% of crappie sampled greater than 9 inches, the presence of a single fish greater than 13 inches shows a lot of promise for the Black Crappie fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",
