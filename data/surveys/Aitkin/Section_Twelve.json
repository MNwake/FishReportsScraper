                "narrative": "<p>Section 12 Lake is located approximately seven miles southeast of Aitkin.  The lake is 156 acres with 57% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A public access is located on the northwest corner of the lake.  Much of the lake is developed with 24.5 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  Sand is abundant along most of the shoreline, but areas of gravel, detritus, rubble, boulders, and muck are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 36 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nSection 12 Lake has no history of walleye stocking, though a few larger fish are caught in each survey.  These walleye likely recruit from Section 10 Lake. The 2010 walleye catch of 0.5/gill net was similar to past catches on Section 12 which average 0.4/gill net.  Average length and weight were 22.0\" and 3.8 lbs.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was below average when compared to similar lakes at 4.5/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 4.3 to 7.8/gill net with an average of 5.4/gill net.  Average length and weight were 19.5\" and 1.6 lbs with 11% measuring at least 24\".  Lower pike catch rates usually indicate better potential for quality size distribution, although high angler exploitation combined with lower perch abundance likely still limit pike potential in Section 12 Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish, but are typically found in low numbers in Section 12, only ranging up to 3.5/gill net.  The 2010 catch of 0.2/gill net was the lowest to date.  The bluegill catch of 17.5/trap net is similar to recent catches and average when compared to similar lakes.  Approximately 20% of these fish measured at least 7\".  Although the black crappie catch was not as high as some past catches, they were present in average numbers in 2010 at 3.2/gill net and 0.9/trap net with 23% measuring at least 8\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 12 Lake is located approximately seven miles southeast of Aitkin. The lake is 156 acres with 57% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 40 feet. A public access is located on the northwest corner of the lake. Much of the lake is developed with 24.5 homes/cabins per shoreline mile. Sand is abundant along most of the shoreline, but areas of gravel, detritus, rubble, boulders, and muck are present as well. The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 36 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. DNR staff have observed increasing water clarity since the first survey was conducted in 1973, with each subsequent surveys showing increasingly clear water. This has likely been to the benefit of the aquatic vegetation and the fish species reliant on that vegetation. A standard survey was scheduled for the week of July 13, however due to difficulties related to Covid 19 safety protocols, only gill nets were used to assess the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are the lake's primary management species. Past catches have ranged from 5.8 to 15.5/gill net. The Black Crappie catch showed an increase from the previous survey of 3.2/gill net in 2010, to 15.5/gill net in 2020. This exceeds the management goal of 5.0/gill net by a good margin. The average length of a Crappie was 7.5 inches, with individuals measuring to 12 inches, indicating a potential for quality fish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike had showed a fairly stable abundance, but they seem to have spiked since the previous survey, going from 4.5/gill net in 2010, to 15.3/gill net in 2020. The 2020 Northern Pike catch was above the normal range for similar lake types and was the highest observed in survey history. Mean length and weight were 20.4 inches and 1.8 lbs. Most fish were below the protected slot and 15 percent of pike measured between 22 - 26 inches. Only a few individuals were longer than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs is the case with many lakes in the area, Largemouth Bass appear to be increasing over time. First sampled in 1990, they have been caught in each survey since, showing another increase from 0.7/gill net in 2010, to 2.7/gill net in 2020. Mean length was about 14 inches, with a mean weight of 1.5 lbs. The largest individual in this survey was 16.5 inches, although fish over 19 inches have been observed in past surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked in Section 12, but have been present in low numbers in previous surveys ranging from 0.3 to 0.7/gill net. For the first time in survey history no Walleyes were caught in 2020. Recruitment of Walleye had likely been from Section 10 (Wladimiraf) Lake, since suitable spawning habitat is minimal in Section 12 Lake, however, Walleye in Section 10 Lake have also declined in spite of stocking efforts and so the source for Section 12 is no longer viable. <br> \n <br> \nPast Yellow Perch catches had been continually increasing from 0.3/gill net in 1973 to a high of 3.5/gill net in 2000, but have since declined to previous levels. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 12 Lake is a 156 acre bass and panfish lake southeast of Aitkin.  The lake has a maximum depth of 40 feet and 57 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a state owned public access on the northwest corner of the lake.  Heavy mats of northern water milfoil may be found in shallow areas, especially on the south and west shorelines making boating difficult.  The fish community sampled in Section 12 Lake included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Black crappie were caught in abundance that was above normal for this lake type, however most of the fish sampled were small, 3 to 5 year old fish, with the average size just under 7.5 inches.  Black crappie fishing should be good in a couple years when these fish attain desirable size.  Anglers can expect average fishing for other panfish species with bluegills and pumpkinseed sunfish available in abundance that is normal for this type of lake.  However, bluegills tend to be slow growing and small, having an average size of less than 5.5 inches.  There is a strong year-class of largemouth bass from 1997, which should provide some fun angling opportunities as they attain lengths over 15 inches.  The presence of big largemouth bass greater than 17 inches, documented in this assessment and a previous electrofishing assessment, is a good sign and suggests low mortality.  Release of large bass will continue to maintain the health of this fishery in the future.  The northern pike fishery has remained stable in abundance within the lower end of the normal range for this lake type, which is good considering the common trend toward overabundance observed in many surrounding lakes.  The presence of several larger northern pike, greater than 27 inches, likewise indicates a more balanced, lightly exploited fishery.  Release of northern pike larger than 22 inches in favor of harvest of smaller fish will help to maintain the quality of this fishery.  In addition to northern pike, large walleye are occasionally caught.  One eighteen-year-old, 22 inch walleye was netted in the 2000 assessment.  </p>",
