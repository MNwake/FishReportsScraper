                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Rush and Julia Lakes in western Sherburne County are recreational development lakes connected by navigable channels and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. Rush and Julia are similar in size (142 acres) and maximum depth (11 and 15 feet, respectively).  Briggs Lake is the largest and deepest of the lakes (377 acres, 25 feet maximum) and tends to have the best water quality, with a mid-summer secchi reading of three feet or so.   <br> \n <br> \nWith a grant from the DNR a \"whole-lake\" treatment for curlyleaf pondweed was made on Rush and Julia Lakes, 2006-2009.  The treatment involves early season application of the aquatic herbicide Endothall.  Initially, it appears that the biomass of culyleaf pondweed has been reduced as well as turion production.  Evaluation has been via point-intercept plant surveys.  A native species that has responded is Elodea.  There may be other fisheries and aquatic changes to the ecosystem in the short term. <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is overflowed by the Elk River during periods of high water.  Because of the large agricultural drainage water quality of the lakes is affected.  Catches of riverine species such as white sucker, golden, shorthead and silver redhorse, and smallmouth bass reflect the overflow connection.  Carp are known to be common as well. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry stocking has been successful in providing a walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and will remain the management strategy. This was the first survey since 1999 and an opportunity to judge the effectiveness of fry stocking as it relates to gill net catches.  Results showed that walleye catches increased significantly for Briggs and Rush Lakes and nearly so, for Julia.   At the same time northern pike populations declined.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches for the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 8-11/gill net.  These numbers represent the historic high catch for each lake.  Small fish less than 12 inches comprised 33, 44 and 61% of the gill net catch for the three lakes. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes, and reached a length of nearly 18 inches by age three.    Continued opportunities for walleye angling will be present as these fish mature. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike declined significantly in Briggs and Julia Lakes, but not Rush Lake.   Historically, gill net catches have been highest in Julia Lake.  Briggs Lake, which had the lowest gill net catch, had the highest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 43%.  Rush Lake, with the highest gill net catch, had the lowest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 4%. Northern pike also grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and reached a length of 21 inches by age two. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch populations did not follow any pattern.  At Briggs Lake the catch was the same as that of 1999 and above the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Rush Lake showed a significant increase over 1999; and Julia showed a significant decline.  Catches of yellow perch at Rush and Julia were within the range of expected values. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were common in the Briggs Chain.  The catches for the three lakes were combined for this report.  A sample of 50 largemouth collected by electrofishing showed that 12 inch fish were common.  <br> \n <br> \nCatches of bluegill were relatively low on Briggs and Rush Lakes, though still within the range of expected values.  Bluegill were above the normal range on Julia, but of the lowest average size, 4.1 inches. Bluegill grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of eight inches in six years.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were most abundant on Briggs Lake.  Over the past five assessments at Briggs Lake the average catch of black crappie was 7.4/trap net. The average size of black crappie was small in each lake ranging from 6-8 inches.  Black crappie grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of ten inches in four years. White crappie were also sampled in each of the three lakes but in lower numbers than black crappies, with the exception of Lake Julia were they appeared more abundant. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs.  They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on the Briggs Chain of Lakes from June 17   June 24, 2015.  This assessment was conducted in order to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills.  Many times these larger individuals are not sampled during the traditional summer surveys especially during surveys conducted in July and August.  A total of 278 Bluegills were sampled on Briggs Lake during this survey.  Bluegill averaged 7.4 inches in length with the largest Bluegill measuring 9.3 inches.  The size structure of a fish population is often described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD).  For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\".  The PSD of Bluegill from Briggs was 91.  So, 90% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\".  Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Briggs Lake was 31.  Both of these indices indicate a healthy Bluegill population with excellent size structure for central Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 753 Bluegill were sampled across  the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  These Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Proportional Stoock Density (PSD) and RSD8 for Bluegill was 86 and 32 respectively.  Of the three lakes in the Briggs Chain, Rush Lake had the largest overall sample of Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years.  Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill.  Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers.  The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they limit the potential that the rest of the population can get to.  Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on the Briggs Chain of Lakes by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing largest males. <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 8 stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including 4 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter, Logperch, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and 2 that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Briggs Lake is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 20 years, most recently in 2016. Results from the 2015 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Classes 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the median value for Lake Class 24 (Briggs). These high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net. Fry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a Walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 11, 2016 found the fingerling catch rate across lakes to be 18.1 young-of-the-year (YOY) per hour. This was a decrease over the last stocking in 2014 (88.8 YOY/hr) and the lowest on record:  2014 (88.8/hr), 2012 (25.3/hr), 2010 (131.5/hr), 2008 (100.1/hr), and 2006 (58.8/hr). Individual catch rates for young of the year Walleye in fall 2016 were 6.1/hr for Briggs, 3.9/hr for Julia, and 42.0/hr for Rush. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye greater than age-1 was good as catch rates ranged from 38.9/hr in Briggs, 33.2/hr in Julia, to 36.5/hr in Rush. Otolith samples were taken from several larger walleye to verify their age. Sixty-four percent of the Walleyes sampled across the three lakes were over 11 inches in length and Walleye up to 30.0 inches in length were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush lakes are a chain of lakes that are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 22 years, most recently in 2018. Results from the 2015 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Classes 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the median value for Lake Class 24 (Briggs). These high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 16, 2018 found the fingerling catch rate across the three lakes to be 61.9 young of the year (YOY) per hour. This was an increase over the last stocking in 2016 (18.1 YOY/hour). Over the past twelve years the average fingerling catch rate across lakes has ranged from 18.1/hr in 2016 to 131.5/hr in 2010 with an average of 70.4/hr. Individual catch rates of young of the year Walleye in fall 2018 were 49.5/hr for Briggs, 66.5/hr for Julia, and 42.0/hr for Rush. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye age 1 and older was good as catch rates were 9.1/hr in Rush, 9.9/hr in Briggs, and 41.6/hr in Julia. Of the age-1 and older Walleye sampled, fish ranged in length from 12.7 to 23.5 inches and averaged 19.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. A standard survey was completed in 1988 to update fisheries data last collected in 1982. This particular report were results from 404-acre Briggs Lake.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance remained low, but growth was good.\n\nWalleye abundance had increased from 1982 with mostly age three and four fish. Several larger Walleye were sampled in the trap nets. The strong age four year class correlates with a fingerling stocking in 1984. Walleye growth was nearly fast.\n\nThe Largemouth Bass population was adequate with good natural reproduction and fast growth. Only age one Largemouth Bass were sampled during the spring seining. A total of 31 Largemouth Bass were creeled during a one-day fishing tournament in late summer. Ages two to five were caught and growth was nearly fast. \n\nBluegill abundance was higher than 1982 and was close to the statewide median. Age one and two Bluegill dominated the sample and growth was good. \n\nBlack Crappie abundance decreased from high numbers sampled in the 1982 survey. Black Crappie ages one to three were most prevalent in the sample and growth was good. White Crappie abundance was high and had increased from average levels sampled in 1982. Ages one to three were again most prevalent in the sample and growth was good.\n\nYellow Perch had decreased by a factor of ten since 1982, but natural reproduction was noted in shoreline seining. \n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and White Sucker. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. A standard survey was completed in 1993 to update data last collected in 1998. This particular report are results from 404-acre Briggs Lake.The catch rate of Walleye (0.3/gill net) decreased from 1988 (2.0/gill net). The average weight of Walleye sampled was similar to 1988 at 1.9 pounds and remained near the state average for lakes like Briggs. Only one and three year old Walleye were found and corresponded to years when fry stocking occurred. The growth rate of Walleye sampled was fast.The catch rate of Northern Pike (2.8/gill net) increased from 1988 (1.2/gill net) and was within the expected range of values for the lake class. The average weight of pike in 1993 (3.1 lbs) was similar to 1988 (2.9 lbs) and remained within expected levels. Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 18.7 - 29.8 inches and averaged 23.4 inches. The majority of pike caught were three year olds, though fish from two to four years old were sampled.  The growth rate for Northern Pike was fast for one and two year olds and average for three and four year olds.The catch rate of Yellow Perch (38.0/gill net) increased significantly from 1988 (2.3/lift).  Yellow Perch sampled ranged in length from 5.6 - 10.3 inches and averaged 7.3 inches. The majority of Yellow Perch sampled were three and four year olds and the growth rate was average.The catch rate of Bluegill (28.6/trap net) increased from 1988 (8.1/trap net). Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3.0 - 7.5 inches and averaged 5.3 inches. The majority of Bluegill sampled (55%) were one year olds and the growth rate was fast, with Bluegill reaching 6.3 inches in three years.The catch rate of Black Crappie (7.4/trap net) was similar to 1988 (6.6/trap net). Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 7.1 - 10.9 inches and averaged 8.7 inches. The majority of Black Crappie sampled were two and three year olds and the growth rate for was average.  The catch rate of White Crappie in 1993 (1.3/trap net and 1.5/gill net) significantly decreased from 1988 (13.9/trap net and 63.5/gill net). White crappie sampled in trap nets ranged in length from 4.6 - 10.9 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.The Largemouth Bass population was assessed by spring electrofishing. A total of 37 bass were sampled at a rate of 52.6 fish/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.8 - 14.7 inches and averaged 10.1 inches. The majority of Largemouth Bass sampled were one and two year olds and the growth rate was fast.White Sucker (7.8/gill net) was sampled at a rate greater than the state average.Other species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Shorthead Redhorse.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 20 years, most recently in 2014.  Results from the 2009 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 8.3 to 11.3 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Class 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the third quartile for Lake Class 24 (Briggs).  These historic high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net.  Fry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a Walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes as 77% of sampled Walleye were from the 2008 (48%) and 2006 (29%) year classes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 14, 2014 found fingerling catch rates between 76 and 104 fish per hour.  This was an increase over the last stocking event (2012) but similar to several of the previous stockings; 2012 (0-62/hr), 2010 (48-262/hr), 2008 (78-122/hr), and 2006 (38-71/hr) for the three lakes.  Individual catch rates for young of the year Walleye in fall 2014 were 103.6/hr for Briggs, 77.2/hr for Julia and 76.1/hr for Rush.   Mean fingerling length across lakes was 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye greater than age 1 were also good as catch rates ranged from 44.2/hr in Briggs, 37.2/ hr in Julia, to 16.3/hr in Rush.  Otolith samples were not taken from larger Walleye to verify their age.  However, length frequency analysis indicates at least three year classes of Walleye were sampled.  Size range for these year classes were as follows: Age 0 (5-8 inches), Age 2 (11-13 inches), Age 4 (15-19 inches). <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. Trophic State Index (TSI) values, based on the 10 year average of summer water quality samples, ranged from 63 on Julia to 69 on Rush which classify the lakes as eutrophic. Walleye are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results. A standard survey was completed in 2019 to update data last collected in 2015 and included bass electrofishing and gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 23% forest, 27% open water/wetlands, 13% hay/pasture, and 6% developed. Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water, fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes. Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead and Silver Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection. Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 2 4/gill net, which represents a decline from the catch rates observed in 2015 (5 10/gill net). Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from eight to 28 inches were recorded during the survey. Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length. Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as the   management strategy to sustain the population. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 15 inches by age three. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was lower in 2019 than 2015, but the average size was larger at 26 inches and 4.5 pounds. Fifty two percent of fish sampled were 26 inches or longer and 15% were 30 inches or longer. Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike. This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers in 2019 were similar to 2015. Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant. Quality fish up to 20 inches of both species have been documented and 39% of the Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing were 15 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie. Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results. Black Crappie were sampled at a much higher rate than in 2015 and gill net catches exceeded the expected range for lakes with similar characteristics and were similar to the record high catches of the late 1990's. Black Crappie ranged in length from three to 13 inches but 62% of the crappies caught in the survey were less than eight inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers. Bluegill catches increased from the previous survey however, the average size was under six inches and no Bluegill larger than eight inches were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Briggs Chain of Lakes is made up of Briggs, Julia and Rush lakes which are connected by a navigable channel. Walleye fry have been stocked into the chain every other year since 1992. The Briggs Chain was scheduled to have been stocked in 2020, however due to COVID-19 restrictions stocking was postponed until 2021. Stocking was again completed in 2022 to get back on an even year stocking rotation. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted during the evening of October 3, 2022. A total of 31 young of year (YOY) Walleye were collected across the three lakes in a total of 2.2 hours of electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 13.9/hr. This was a slight increase over the last stocking in 2021 (5.7/hr). Since 2006 the YOY catch rate across lakes has ranged from 5.7/hr to 131.5/hr with an average of 56.1/hr. Individual lake YOY Walleye catch rates for 2022 were 16.6/hr for Briggs, 32.8/hr for Rush, and 5.8/hr for Julia. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye age-1 and older was good. A total of 88 Walleye ? age-1 were collected across the three lakes in a total of 2.2 hours of electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 39.4/hr. Catch rates of age-1 and older Walleye was 39.8/hr for Briggs, 65.6/hr for Rush, and 31.2/hr for Julia. Age-1 or older Walleye sampled ranged in length from 10.8 to 27.0 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking continues to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain and will be stocked again in 2024 on an even year stocking rotation. <br> \n <br> \n Year   \tYOY/hr  <br> \n2006\t   58.8 <br> \n2008\t 100.1 <br> \n2010\t 131.5 <br> \n2012\t   25.3 <br> \n2014\t   88.8 <br> \n2016\t   19.4 <br> \n2018\t   61.9 <br> \n2021 5.7 <br> \n2022        13.2 <br> \nAverage   56.1</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs Lake is located in Sherburne County, five miles north of Clear Lake.  The lake is 377 acres in size, and connected to both Julia and Rush Lakes by navigable channels.  Average depth of the lake is 12 feet, with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lakeshore is mostly developed with homes and cabins, but the eastern shore has a large stretch of wooded land.  Little vegetation is present in the lake, except for curled pondweed, which is abundant in springtime but dies back during early summer.  The lake bottom is mostly sand or silt.  A new public access with a boat ramp and many parking spaces has been constructed at the south end of the lake.  An additional access is located on the northwest shore, and is suitable only for launching canoes.Based on 1999 fish surveys, walleye numbers in Briggs Lake are within the range expected for area lakes similar to Briggs.  Walleye sampled by gillnetting averaged 15 inches in length.  A large number of walleye were also caught during spring electrofishing, but these fish averaged only 10 inches in length.  Populations of walleye in the Briggs Chain of Lakes are maintained by stocking fry rather than fingerlings.  Briggs Lake has an average number of northern pike, many of which are in the 20-24 inch range.  Northern pike numbers have slowly increased in each survey since 1982.  Good numbers of yellow perch, bluegill, and black crappie are available as prey for the pike.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (less than 22 inches) to rebalance the fish community.  Few largemouth bass were captured during electrofishing surveys, and this may reflect the low amount of vegetation or other structure in the lake.  Catch rates for bass were much higher in Rush and Julia Lakes.  Bullhead, carp, white sucker, and redhorse can also be found in Briggs Lake.</p>",

Results from the 1999 lake survey showed that walleye ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range for lake classes 24 (Briggs) and 43 (Julia, Rush). Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 14 years, most recently in 2004, 2006 and 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 14, 2008 found fingerling catch rates were 78-122 fish per hour.  This was greater than 2006 (38-71 fish/hr) and 2004  (0-22 fingerling/hr) for the three lakes. Catch rates for young-of-the-year walleye in fall 2008 were 100.4/hr for Rush, 122.2/hr for Briggs, and 78.0/hr for Julia.  Mean fingerling length overall was 7.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nFry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  A survey is planned for 2009 when we will see how the electrofishing catch rates translate into gill net catches.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 18 years, most recently in 2012. Results from the 2009 lake survey showed that walleye ranged from 8.3 to 11.3 per gill net, which was above the median value for lake class 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the third quartile for lake class 24 (Briggs). These historic high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net. Fry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes as 77% of sampled walleye were from the 2008 (48%) and 2006 (29%) year classes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 1, 2012 found fingerling catch rates between 0-62 fish per hour.  This was less than each of the last four stocking events; 2010 (48-262), 2008 (78-122), and 2006 (38-71 fish/hr) for the three lakes. Individual catch rates for young of the year walleye in fall 2012 were 60.7/hr for Rush, 21.0/hr for Briggs, and 0/hr for Julia.  The average length of sampled fingerlings across lakes was 6.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of walleye greater than age 1 appear good as catch rates ranged from 48.0/ hr in Julia, 131.7/hr in Briggs, to 182.1/hr in Rush.  Otolith samples were taken from several larger walleye (10-12 inches in length) to verify their age.  In each case, these walleye were determined to be age 2.  This corresponds to the last prior fry stocking in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred strategy for walleye management in the Briggs Chain for the foreseeable future as it has proven to be effective at boosting walleye gill net catch rates. <br> \n</p>",

The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. An initial standard survey was completed in 1982. This particular report are results from 404-acre Briggs Lake.\n\nCatch rates of Northern Pike and Walleye were low, but the actual abundance may be greater based on angling fishing reports. Largemouth Bass abundance is average and natural reproduction was evident. Yellow Perch were abundant in good numbers. Bluegill numbers were low, but growth was good. White Crappie were abundant in average numbers and were growing at an average rate. White Crappie ages one and three were present as strong year classes. Black Crappie numbers were high and most fish were ages one to three. Black Crappie growth was average, but slower than White Crappie growth.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Redhorse, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with Walleye fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results.  Fish sampling in 2015 included bass electrofishing in May, a targeted Bluegill assessment in June, and a standard gill net and trap net survey in August. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer.  The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 28% forest, 18% open water, 14% hay/pasture, and 7%.  Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2015; however in 2009 11 aquatic plant species were identified growing to a maximum depth of 5.5 feet.  Curly leaf pondweed was not found in Rush Lake; however it was were observed growing in Briggs (4.6 acres) and Julia (1.2 acres) in the spring of 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes.  Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection.  Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 5 10/gill net, which represents a decline from the record high catch rates observed in 2009 (8 11/gill net).  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 7 to 26 inches were recorded in the survey.  Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length.  Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as a management strategy to sustain the population.  Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 14 inches by age two.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was higher in 2015 than 2009, but the average size was smaller at two pounds or 20 inches in length.  Only 10 percent of fish sampled were greater than 24 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike.  This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  Yellow Perch numbers in 2015 were lower than 2009.  Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  Despite declines, catches of Yellow Perch in all three lakes remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant.  Quality fish up to 19 inches of both species have been documented however; the majority of bass sampled by electrofishing were between 14 to 15 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie.  While the Bluegill average size in the August survey was only about 6 inches, the spring survey showed that quality size Bluegill up to nearly 10 inches can be found.  Seasonal differences in trap net catches for panfish related to size and abundance have to do with water temperatures and the completion of spawning.  Generally catches are not as good in late summer due to the fact that larger mature fish move into deeper, cooler water where they are not sampled as well by trap nets that are set in shallow water near the shore.  Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results.  While crappie can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, for the same reason mentioned previously for Bluegills, results from the 2015 survey suggest normal abundance for these types of lakes.  Most of the crappies caught in the summer survey however, were less than 8 inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers.</p>",
