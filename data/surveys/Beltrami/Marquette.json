                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Marquette Lake was conducted on September 7-8, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured 28 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Log Perch, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Marquette Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marquette is a 528-acre, moderately developed natural lake located in southern Beltrami County, approximately 2 miles south of Bemidji, MN. Marquette has an average water clarity of 7 feet and a maximum depth of 51 feet. Lake Marquette has an inlet via the Schoolcraft River located on the southern shore from Lake Plantagenet and an outlet located on the northern shore, connecting to Carr Lake and the Mississippi River. There is no public access on Lake Marquette. Depending on water levels, boaters can access from downstream on the Mississippi River from Lake Irving, travel up the Mississippi River 1 mile to Carr Lake, and up the Schoolcraft River for a half mile, and into Lake Marquette. Another option is located upstream of Lake Marquette, an undeveloped public access near the outlet of Lake Plantagenet provides access to the Schoolcraft River for non-motorized watercraft users. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Lake Marquette in 2022 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye lengths ranged from 7 to 23 inches and averaged around 16 inches. Walleye abundance decreased from 2012, was below the lake's historical average, but still within the typical range for lakes with similar morphological characteristics. The Walleye population is likely sustained from upstream and downstream movement of fish from connected lakes and natural reproduction. A total of 11 year classes were captured, with the 2018 year class being the most abundant. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased from recent surveys, was above average for the lake, and above the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 13 to 29 inches and averaged 20 inches. Only eighteen percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low and below the normal range for this lake type. Bluegill lengths averaged 6 inches, with a few Bluegill over 8 inches captured. Bluegill growth was fast with fish averaging 9 inches at 4 years old. It is recommended that anglers keep smaller sunfish and release the larger fish to help improve and maintain the population's size structure. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition, a few Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured, which is similar to previous surveys. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 7 to 12 inches, while Largemouth Bass ranged from 5 to 17 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) are considered important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Yellow Perch abundance was slightly below average and lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches. Tullibee (Cisco) are present in Lake Marquette and lengths averaged 14 inches. Other species sampled during the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, redhorse, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, Lake Marquette is infested with Zebra Mussels, an aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marquette Lake is a 504-acre lake with a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The lake is located one mile south of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There is no direct public access on the lake.  The closest public boat launch is on Lake Irving.  From there boaters can navigate up to Carr Lake and then into Marquette Lake via the Schoolcraft River. The entire shoreline is privately owned.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Marquette Lake is in lake class 27.  Typically lakes in this class are large, deep and regularly shaped with few bays.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Andrusia, Big, Clearwater, Kitchi, Big Turtle, Big Wolf and Grace Lakes.  Because there is no public access on Marquette Lake, no fish stocking has occurred.  Because the Schoolcraft River flows through Marquette Lake, migration of fish occurs into and out of the lake, particularly northern pike and      walleye, occurs and likely to influence the population of these species at different times of the year.  Anglers should have good luck fishing for northern pike and walleye.  Both have abundant populations which are the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye had 12 different year classes present in the sample indicating very consistent spawning success.  Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 24 inches with an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike size ranged in length from 6 to 38 inches with an average      length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.The main food for walleye and northern pike is yellow perch.  They are abundant with the most common size of 5.5 to 6 inches.  White sucker and tullibee (cisco) are also  utilized as forage especially by larger predator fish.The most abundant member of the sunfish family in Marquette Lake is pumpkinseed sunfish.  Few black crappie were sampled, however, the ones sampled were of quality size.  They ranged in length from 10.5 inches to 13.4 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches.Anglers seeking bullheads should have good luck angling.  This species is often overlooked by anglers.  Brown and yellow bullhead were moderately abundant with fish up to 16 inches sampled.Riparian development in the form of new lake homes continues to occur on Marquette Lake.  Shoreline development can negatively affect water quality and can impact aquatic habitat necessary for fish at various life stages.  Undeveloped shoreline is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  Shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Marquette Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Marquette Lake since most of the lakeshore is privately owned.  While future shoreline development may be inevitable, there are ways to minimize disturbances to sensitive aquatic habitats.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marquette is a 504-acre natural lake with a maximum depth of 51 feet located one mile south of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  The lake is part of the Schoolcraft River system and has connectivity with Lake Plantagenet upstream and the Mississippi River and associated lakes downstream.  Since there is no public water access on Lake Marquette, boaters must access the lake via Lake Irving in Bemidji, travel up the Mississippi River approximately one mile to Carr Lake, then up the Schoolcraft River a short distance to Marquette given adequate water levels.  An undeveloped public access near the outlet of Lake Plantagenet offers a shorter alternative route downstream to Lake Marquette although this is more suited to non-motorized watercraft.  Fish populations in Lake Marquette benefit from the connectivity of this open system, which allows considerable migration of fish to occur from both upstream and downstream.  No stocking of fish has occurred in Lake Marquette since the 1940's. <br> \n <br> \nLake Marquette has a diverse fish community which supports populations of most major gamefish found in the area.  A total of 16 species of fish were identified from the 2012 population assessment.  The 2012 walleye catch rate of 8.33 fish/gill net is very similar to the upper end of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length up to 23.6 inches, with an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 1.36 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Lake Marquette.  The 2012 catch rate of 11.44 fish/gill net is greater than the statewide statewide normal range for lake class.  The largest northern pike captured in 2012 was 34.8 inches in length.  The northern pike population's size structure has remained stable over time with the exception of a decline in northern pike over 30 inches in length.  Declines in the abundance of larger northern pike are often caused by excessive angler harvest.  Anglers can help reverse this trend by voluntarily releasing northern pike greater than 24 inches in length and keeping smaller pike for table fare. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations in Lake Marquette have never been particularly abundant but have produced quality-size fish.  The 2012 black crappie catch rate of 0.67 fish/trap net is within the normal range for lake class, and is similar to catch rates from previous assessments.  Consistent natural reproduction was evident with 4 consecutive year classes identified in the sample.  Black crappie ranged in length up to 12.6 inches.  Bluegill, which were absent from earlier assessments of Lake Marquette, appear to be expanding their population, with catch rates in 2012 (4.56 fish/trap net) that were similar to the lower-quartile value of 4.4 fish/trap net for lake class.  Growth rates were good for this relatively sparse population, with individuals greater than 10 inches in length present in the sample.  Muskellunge are also present in Lake Marquette.  These fish likely originated from Lake Plantagenet and/or Lake Bemidji, which are both managed for muskellunge.  Other species sampled in 2012 included pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, yellow perch, largemouth bass (in low numbers), bullhead species, redhorse species, white sucker and tullibee (cisco). <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.9 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 18.9?C (66.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across some depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 2012 indicated marginal oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
