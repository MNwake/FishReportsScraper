There are two remote campsites maintained by the U.S. Forest Service on Scarp Lake.  The shoreline is generally steep, with an escarpment of rock in the middle of the south shore, therefore the lake name.  Rainbow trout management began in 1962; Scarp Lake was added to the designated stream trout lake list in 1965 affording the lake the protections those regulations provide.  Water quality measurements indicate the lake has very soft-water with low fertility and good visibility with a Secchi disk reading of 8.5 feet on 08/08/2013. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual stocking of approximately 1,000 yearling (3/lb) rainbow trout maintains the present trout population.  The 2013 lake survey sampled 36 rainbow trout having an average length of 13.1 inches and average weight of about one pound, the largest fish was 15.4 inches (1.6 pounds).  Survival of stocked fish appears to be good with three year-classes identified in the 2013 sample.   <br> \n</p>",

In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well-oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicate summer dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures were not limiting factors in Scarp Lake in 2021.

                "narrative": "<p>Scarp Lake is a designated trout lake located about 10 miles east of Isabella that is close to 40 acres in size with a maximum depth of 15 feet. Anglers fishing from watercraft typically access the lake via a 20 rod portage trail from Hogback Lake. Shore anglers can use the hiking trails maintained by the US Forest Service that surround the lake to access shore fishing spots that include two remote campsites. The lake is managed for Rainbow Trout and the current plan calls for 1,000 catchable sized yearling fish to be stocked annually in the spring.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 fisheries survey captured 11 Rainbow Trout that ranged from 12.2 to 14.6 inches in length with an average weight of 0.90 pounds. All fish were from the 2021 spring stocking event and appeared to be in good condition at the time of the survey. The size of trout sampled indicates fish grew well after being stocked in the spring at an average weight of 0.34 pounds per fish. Although no older fish were captured, survival could not be evaluated because no fish were stocked in 2020 due to pandemic work restrictions. Historic survey data from the lake suggests enough trout survive from year to year to provide a trophy component to the fishery.  <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet and is relatively clear, with a Secchi disc visible to a depth of 12 feet. The main access to the lake is by way of a 120 yard portage from Hogback Lake to the west end of the lake. The lake is surrounded by federal land and the shoreline is undeveloped and in a wild state. There are two U.S. Forest Service remote campsites located on the lake and a maintained hiking trail around most of the lake.      <br> \n   <br> \nScarp Lake was reclaimed in 2002 and since then has been stocked with rainbow trout every year. Test nets in 2006 caught low numbers of rainbow trout.  However, trout numbers may be higher than netting results indicate due to the difficulty in capturing this species in netting gear. This has been observed in some earlier assessments on this lake where net catches were low but the lake was providing a good rainbow trout fishery at the time. The rainbow trout collected in 2006 ranged from 10.6 to 12.7 inches and fish in the 13 to 14 inch range where observed during the 2007winter creel census. There were reports of rainbow trout up to 21 inches caught by anglers in the summer of 2006.  <br> \n</p>",

Scarp Lake is stocked each fall with 6000 fingerling rainbow trout.  The only fish taken in DNR test nets in the 1999 assessment were rainbow trout, and these were sampled in very low numbers.  The two rainbow trout collected were 12.0 inches and 14.1 inches respectively.  Rainbow trout are difficult to capture in nets and therefore it is uncertain if the population is as low as netting results indicate.  However recent angler reports of poor success when fishing tend to confirm the poor netting results.  For sure the quality of the trout fishery in Scarp Lake is not as good as it was five years ago.</p>",

It appears that the Rainbow Trout are being displaced by a growing population of White Sucker and Yellow Perch. White Suckers were caught at 1.6 times the local average even though a total of 1,315 pounds were removed in 1984-85. Yellow Perch are also well established with a gillnet catch of 10/lift. No Yellow Perch were sampled in the population  assessments of 1983 and 1984.</p>",
