                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake appears to support a healthy fish population.  Walleyes were sampled in the gill nets at a rate equal to the median for similar type lakes throughout the state.  These fish had a mean length of 16.7 inches and a mean weight of 1.7 pounds.  Some walleyes were sampled from years in which no stocking took place indicating natural reproduction takes place in the lake.       Northern pike abundance appears to be above average for this lake type although the mean size is below average.       Largemouth bass abundance appears to be low.  However, largemouth bass are difficult to sample so they may be more abundant than our sampling indicates.       Past fishing reports suggest that Grave Lake has historically produced larger than average bluegills.  Trapnetting during this assessment and in past assessments indicate that bluegill abundance is below the mean for this type of lake.  However, the bluegills sampled had a mean length of 6.2 inches and appeared to have good growth rates.  If anglers voluntary release the larger bluegills they catch, Grave Lake should continue to produce quality bluegills for years to come.     Yellow perch have historically been sampled at rates above the mean for this type of lake and abundance appears to still be high.  Yellow perch sampled in 1994 had a mean length of 6.3 inches.  This high abundance of perch should provide a good supply of forage for the northern pike and walleyes in Grave Lake.     Black crappie abundance appears to be low from this and past assessments.     Overall, Grave Lake appears to support a strong gamefish population.  Proper shoreline management by lakeshore owners to protect water quality and the practice of catch and release by all anglers could ensure that Grave Lake remains a quality lake for fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is a class 25 lake located 7 miles south of Marcell.  There is a public access on the northeast part of the lake.  The lake management plan indicates walleye and bluegill are the primary species of management with northern pike and largemouth bass as secondary species.  In the spring of 2001 a conservation regulation (5 sunfish daily/possession bag limit) was established to maintain the quality bluegill population.  The evaluation schedule called for spring trap netting assessments for three consecutive years (2000 to 2002) to get a baseline of information on bluegill size and age structure, followed by samples in 2004 and 2006, and then annual sampling for the last three years of the evaluation from 2008 to 2010.  Standardized sampling included net numbers, location and timing of the special assessments.  Ten trap nets were set and lifted for two consecutive days in late May or early June.  Bluegill were measured for lengths and weights, scale samples were collected and sex was determined.  These data will be used to evaluate the success of the conservation regulation. <br> \n <br> \nSpring catch rates are typically influenced by spring weather patterns more than changes in bluegill numbers.  In 2006, the bluegill trap-net catch was 20.4 fish/net compared to 22.5, 14.0, 14.7 and 6.5 fish/net in 2004, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 sampled bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 10.2 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Bluegill size structure has varied from year to year but has exhibited signs of a high quality fishery in all assessments.  In 2006, index values were 73, 30, and 0.5 for PSD, RSD-P (8 inches), and RSD-M (10 inches), respectively compared to 96, 55, and 1 in 2004, 71, 15, and 1 in 2002, 90, 28, and 6 in 2001 and  55, 19, and 0 in 2000.  Timing of the sample, angler harvest, natural mortality and year-class strength all contribute to the variable size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNine year classes were determined from the scale samples with fish from age 2 to age 10.  There did not appear to be any dominant year classes.  After six years of the lower bag limit regulation, the population is still characterized by consistent but low recruitment with excellent growth.  Mean back-calculated lengths at age were higher (>115% of median) than those reported for class 25 lakes for all age 5 and older fish. <br> \n <br> \nIn each of the special assessments where we collected information on sex distributions, females have always been more abundant than males.  In 2006, the sex distribution was 63 percent females and 37 % males for the fish examined.  In 2002, the sex distribution was 64 percent females, 33 percent males, and 3 percent unknowns.  In the 2001 assessment, the sex distribution was 62 percent females, 33 percent males, and 5 percent unknowns.  In 2000, the sex distribution was 49 percent females, 42 percent males, and 9 percent unknowns.  It is not clear whether the sex ratio is representative of what exists in the population or if it is the result of the timing of our sampling in relation to sexual behaviors or some unknown factor. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is located south of Marcell, MN, has one public access and moderate shoreline development.  The 2015 lake management plan indicated Bluegill and Walleye as the primary management species with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as secondary species.  A targeted survey using 9 gill net sets was conducted in 2021 to determine the status of select gamefish populations and evaluate Walleye fry stocking.  An additional targeted survey was conducted in June to evaluate the Bluegill population.  That survey continued to describe a quality fishery that included opportunities for large sunfish.  Data from that survey can be found in a separate report.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Grave Lake Walleye fishery is primarily maintained with annual fry stocking.  Lakes with similar habitats typically produce modest Walleye populations.  The 2021 catch was below average for Grave Lake.  Although the catch remained within the typical range for similar lakes, it failed to meet the management objectives.  In 2021, the sampled fish ranged from 15 to 25.7 inches and had a mean length of 18.6 inches.  It appears modest angling opportunities continue to exist, though numbers may have declined in recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have fluctuated but have occasionally been high compared to similar lakes.  High pike numbers are undesirable and often result in poor size quality and slow growth.   The 2021 catch rate was typical compared to similar lakes but size quality remained poor.  The sampled fish ranged from 14.1 to 33.6 inches and had a mean length of 19.7 inches.  Only 6% of sampled pike exceeded 28 inches.  Grave Lake is in the North-central zone regulation for Northern Pike.  Anglers may keep up to 10 pike but all fish from 22-26 inches must be released and only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be possessed.    Anglers can help improve the size quality on Grave Lake by keeping more pike under 22 inches and releasing pike over 26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important prey species on Grave Lake.  Perch catches have varied but have occasionally been high compared to similar lakes.  The 2021 survey resulted in sufficient perch numbers to maintain the current pike and Walleye management.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers as sampled fish ranged from 4.8 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are another important prey species but have declined across much of Minnesota.  Lakes with similar habitats rarely produce large Tullibee populations.  Though the 2021 catch was low, it was near the long-term average for Grave and typical for lakes with similar habitats.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.2 to 19.2 inches, suggesting that multiple year classes are present.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are difficult to sample using standard summer netting methods because they tend to avoid the nets.  Although night electrofishing is a more effective sampling tool for Largemouth Bass it was not conducted in 2021 because the population does not warrant the additional effort on a regular basis.  Only two fish were sampled in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nLike many northern Minnesota lakes, Black Crappie catches on Grave have varied due to inconsistent year class production and angler harvest.  Black Crappie were sampled in gill nets at a rate comparable to lakes with similar habitats, but above average for Grave Lake.  Lengths from the gill net sample ranged from 5.4 to 12.3 inches and 55% exceeded 10 inches.  The catch and size distribution suggests moderate opportunities exist for catching nice crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the gill-net only targeted survey assessment included Bluegill, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is a class 25 lake located 7 miles south of Marcell.  There is a public access on the northeast part of the lake.  The lake management plan indicates walleye and bluegill are the primary species of management with northern pike and largemouth bass as secondary species.  In the spring of 2001 a conservation regulation (5 sunfish daily/possession bag limit) was established to maintain the quality bluegill population.  The evaluation schedule called for spring trap netting assessments for three consecutive years (2000 to 2002) to get a baseline of information on bluegill size and age structure, followed by samples in 2004 and 2006, 2007, 2008, and the last year of the evaluation in 2010.  Standardized sampling included net numbers, location and timing of the special assessments.  Ten trap nets were set and lifted for two consecutive days in late May or early June.  Bluegill were measured for lengths and weights, scale samples were collected and sex was determined.  These data will be used to evaluate the success of the conservation regulation. <br> \n <br> \nSpring catch rates are typically influenced by spring weather patterns more than changes in bluegill numbers.  However, there does appear to be an increasing trend in catch rates since special sampling targeting bluegill began in 2000.  In 2008, the bluegill trap-net catch was 34.6 fish/net compared to 43.1, 20.4, 22.5, 14.0, 14.7 and 6.5 fish/net in 2007, 2006, 2004, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 sampled bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 10.1 inches with a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Bluegill size structure has varied from year to year but has exhibited signs of a high quality population in all assessments.  In 2008, index values were 91, 36, and <1 for PSD, RSD-P (8 inches), and RSD-M (10 inches), respectively compared to 77, 28, and 0 in 2007, 73, 30, 0.5 in 2006, 96, 55, and 1 in 2004, 71, 15, and 1 in 2002, 90, 28, and 6 in 2001 and  55, 19, and 0 in 2000.  Timing of the sample, angler harvest, natural mortality and year-class strength all contribute to the variable size structure. <br> \n <br> \nEight year classes were determined from the scale samples with fish from age 3 to age 10 present.  The largest year class sampled was from 2002, representing 41% of the sample.  The 2007 assessment also found the 2002 year class was the strongest sampled and it may be partially responsible for the increasing trend in catch rates.  However, after eight years of the lower bag limit, the population could still be characterized by consistent but low recruitment with good growth.  Mean back-calculated lengths at ages were higher (>115% of median) than those reported for class 25 lakes for all age 6 and older fish. <br> \n <br> \nIn each of the special assessments where we collected information on sex distributions, females have always been more abundant than males.  The sex distribution in 2008 was more like the years prior to 2007 with females representing 59% of the sample and males 41%.  The 2007 sample was strongly skewed toward females with 81% females and 19% males.  In 2006, the sex distribution was 63% females and 37% males for the fish examined.  In 2002, the sex distribution was 64% females, 33% males, and 3% unknowns.  In the 2001 assessment, the sex distribution was 62% females, 33% males, and 5% unknowns.  In 2000, the sex distribution was 49% females, 42% males, and 9% unknowns.  It is not clear whether the sex ratio is representative of what exists in the population or if it is the result of the timing of our sampling in relation to sexual behaviors or some unknown factor.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is primarily managed for bluegill, walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass.  Management of Grave Lake includes an experimental bluegill regulation and walleye fry stocking on an every other year schedule beginning in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nA five sunfish possession limit was implemented in 2001as an experimental regulation.  The intent was to protect the quality bluegill fishery.  Bluegill were the second most abundant fish sampled in gill nets, which was relatively high when compared to the previous assessment.  Trap netting tends to more accurately sample the preferred shallow water area.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was near the lower end of the expected range for lakes similar to Grave.  Previous assessments had trap net catch rates similar to the 2007 assessments.  Gill net sampled fish ranged from 3.8-9.6 inches with an average of 7.1 inches.  The population size structure has a good proportion of fish exceeding eight inches with the potential of individuals to exceed ten inches.  Bluegill size structure is density dependent, and anglers can help by releasing large fish.  By removing large individuals, the likelihood of increasing the number of smaller individuals increases substantially. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  The catch rate was consistent with the previous assessment, which was the second highest recorded rate on Grave Lake.  The longest fish sampled was 26.7 inches and the average length was 16.8 inches.  Stocking and limited natural reproduction has provided a reasonable fishery with a good distribution of sizes.  Age classes were identified through scale and bone analysis, with fish up to age   present.   Growth was near the statewide average for all ages.  Age analysis also indicated that 85% of the sampled fish were from stocked year classes suggesting that fry stocking may be supplementing the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nGill net captured northern pike were sampled at a rate near the upper end of the expected range.  The 2007 catch rate is slightly higher then the previous assessment yet below the lake average.  Lengths ranged from 15.4-29.7 inches with an average of 20.4 inches.  The size structure is relatively poor with few individuals exceeding 28 inches.   Seven age classes were identified through scale and bone analysis, with fish up to age 7 present.  Growth was near the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears tend to inaccurately sample bass populations.  Gill nets sampled two largemouth bass, and trap nets captured one largemouth.  Previous assessments using electrofishing had sampled largemouth bass at relatively low abundance with a few quality fish present.  Electrofishing was not conducted as part of the 2007 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at the highest recorded rate of any assessment on Grave Lake almost double the expected range.  Size structure was poor with almost 100% of the fish less than eight inches.  Six age classes were identified through scale analysis, with fish up to age 7 present.   Growth was near the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 assessment shows a noticeable increase in black crappie abundance when compared to previous assessments.  Trap net captured fish were within the expected range while gill net sampled fish exceeded the expected range.  Caution should be exercised however, because crappie catch rates tend to be variable and the observed increase may not be sustainable. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is located about seven miles south of Marcell, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Bigfork River Watershed.  The 538 acre lake has 304 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 39 feet, and about 8 miles of shoreline.  There is a state administered access on the northeast part of the lake with parking available for five rigs.  A conservation regulation for a five sunfish possession limit was implemented in 2001 to maintain the quality Bluegill population.  Three special spring assessments were conducted (2000-2002) to establish baseline information.  Since then, six special spring assessments were conducted from 2004-2014.  Catch rates from spring assessments tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and should be viewed cautiously.  However, size structure and growth statistics collected during spring assessments are valuable data. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets targeting panfish moving into shallow water sampled Bluegill at a rate of 16.9/net (10 nets X 3 days) in 2014.  The catch rate in 2009 was 50.2/STN (9 nets X 2 days), while the mean catch rate of nine spring special assessments was 24.8/STN.  A slight increasing trend was observed in the first eight assessments and it is unclear if the relatively lower 2014 catch was likely a function of spring fish movements. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sampled in 2014 ranged from 3.3 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  Size structure was favorable (PSD-6=89, RSD-8=73, RSD-10=1, n=506) and similar to the 2009 assessment (PSD-6=90, RSD-8=36, RSD-10=1, n=904).  Size structure indices have ranged from 55-96 (PSD-6), 15-73 (RSD-8), 0-6 (RSD-10) since 2000, respectively.  The RSD-8 value observed in 2014 was the highest observed in spring assessments.  Variability in size structure can be associated with year-class strength, angler harvest, and assessment timing. <br> \n <br> \nScale analysis identified ages 2 to 11 present in the sample, indicating relatively consistent recruitment.  However, ages 7 and 8 were dominant, comprising 22% and 43% of the expanded age distribution, respectively.  Age-7 fish had a mean length of 8.0 inches while age-8 fish had a mean length of almost nine inches.  Sex and maturity was determined from 499 Bluegill in which 173 males were sampled with a mean length of 8.0 inches, while 326 females were sampled with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  The similar male and female mean lengths suggest similar growth between the sexes and there appeared to be an even distribution of ages between both sexes.  This indicates a satisfactory population density with sufficient growth.  Back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to Ecological Lake Class 25 average but accelerated by age 6 in males and 7 in females.  Both males and females exceeded eight inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 0.9/STN, down from the previous assessment of 3.2/STN.  Lengths ranged from 6.1-11.6 inches with a mean length of 9.3 inches.  Length frequency indicated a quality size structure, PSD-8=88, RSD-10=19, RSD-12=0.  Scale analysis identified ages 2-4 and 6 present in the sample.  Age 4 was a dominant age class, comprising 76% of the sample and suggesting inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages with fish averaging almost 10 inches by age 4. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Grave Lake was conducted on July 11-13, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 10 stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Bowfin catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with 18% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Grave Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Grave Lake is an exceptional lake. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIBI Program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on May 26, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 62 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 88.1 (+/- 1.8) out of 100 possible. Approximately 30 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 79.0 (+/- 4.5), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.1 (+/- 1.3). <br> \n</p>",

The lake management plan indicates walleye and bluegill are the primary species of management with northern pike and largemouth bass as secondary species.  In the spring of 2001 a conservation regulation (5 sunfish daily/possession bag limit) was established to maintain the quality bluegill population.  The evaluation schedule called for spring trap netting assessments for three consecutive years (2000 to 2002) to get a baseline of information on bluegill size and age structure, followed by samples in 2004 and 2006, 2007, 2008, and the last year of the evaluation in 2010.  Standardized sampling included net numbers, location and timing of the special assessments.  Ten trap nets were set and lifted for two consecutive days in late May or early June.  Bluegill were measured for lengths and weights, scale samples were collected and sex was determined.  These data will be used to evaluate the success of the conservation regulation.\n\nSpring catch rates are typically influenced by spring weather patterns more than changes in bluegill numbers.  In 2007, the bluegill trap-net catch was 43.1 fish/net compared to 20.4, 22.5, 14.0, 14.7 and 6.5 fish/net in 2006, 2004, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  \n\nThe 2007 sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.8 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Bluegill size structure has varied from year to year but has exhibited signs of a high quality population in all assessments.  In 2007, index values were 77, 28, and 0 for PSD, RSD-P (8 inches), and RSD-M (10 inches), respectively compared to 73, 30, 0.5 in 2006; 96, 55, and 1 in 2004; 71, 15, and 1 in 2002; 90, 28, and 6 in 2001 and  55, 19, and 0 in 2000.  Timing of the sample, angler harvest, natural mortality and year-class strength all contribute to the variable size structure.\n\nTen year classes were determined from the scale samples with fish from age 2 to age 11.  The largest year class sampled was from 2002, representing 37% of the sample.  After seven years of the lower bag limit regulation, the population is still characterized by consistent but low recruitment with good growth.  Mean back-calculated lengths at age were higher (>115% of median) than those reported for class 25 lakes for all age 6 and older fish.\n\nIn each of the special assessments where we collected information on sex distributions, females have always been more abundant than males.  The 2007 sample was strongly skewed toward females (81%) compared to males (19%).  In 2006, the sex distribution was 63 percent females and 37 % males for the fish examined.  In 2002, the sex distribution was 64 percent females, 33 percent males, and 3 percent unknowns.  In the 2001 assessment, the sex distribution was 62 percent females, 33 percent males, and 5 percent unknowns.  In 2000, the sex distribution was 49 percent females, 42 percent males, and 9 percent unknowns.  It is not clear whether the sex ratio is representative of what exists in the population or if it is the result of the timing of our sampling in relation to sexual behaviors or some unknown factor.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is located about seven miles south of Marcell, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Bigfork River Watershed.  The 538 acre lake has 304 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 39 feet, and about 8 miles of shoreline.  There is a state administered access on the northeast part of the lake with parking available for five rigs. <br> \n <br> \nGrave Lake is actively managed for Walleye and Bluegill and has a history of producing a Bluegill fishery with moderate numbers and exceptional size quality.  A reduced bag limit of five sunfish was implemented in 2001 to maintain the quality Bluegill population.  The regulation goals include maintaining a fishery with 60% of the catch exceeding 6 inches and 25% exceeding 8 inches.  Several special spring surveys were conducted since 2000 to establish baseline information and evaluate the regulation.  Catch rates from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and should be viewed cautiously as they may not correspond to actual changes in abundance.  However, spring catches are typically higher than the summer so better information on size structure and growth statistics can be obtained.  A survey using 20 trap net sets targeting sunfish was conducted in May of 2021.  Data for other species was not collected during the survey, although Black Crappie were counted.  A separate report has information from a targeted survey in August to monitor the other species. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets once again sampled a population with moderate numbers and exceptional size quality.  The 233 Bluegill ranged from 2.3 to 9.7 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches.  Size structure remained favorable and exceeded management goals, as 80% of the fish exceeded 6 inches, nearly 40% exceeded 8 inches and fish over 9 inches were present.  It appears that the reduced bag limit continues to contribute to good angling opportunities for quality sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is a class 25 lake located south of Marcell, MN.  The lake has one public access and moderate shoreline development.  The 2008 lake management plan indicates Bluegill and Walleye as the primary species of management with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as secondary species.  There is a special five fish sunfish limit on Grave Lake that has been in place since 2001.  The goal of the regulation was to protect a quality Bluegill fishery.  Data from special sampling that targets Bluegill in the spring can be found in the special assessment reports. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rates have ranged from a low of 3.2 fish/trap net in 1994 to a high of 10.3 fish/trap net in 2014.  Although the catch was high for Grave Lake it was well below the lake class median of 17.3 fish/net.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 4.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment but was during spring special assessment.  Ten age classes from age 2 to 11 were sampled during the spring.  The 2006 and 2007 year-classes represented 65% of the sample.  Growth was similar to or faster than other class 25 lakes.  Fish averaged nearly 9.0 inches after eight years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch rate of 4.7 fish/net was the same as the last two assessments.  The catch approached the aggressive management goal of 5.0 fish/net, which is the highest catch ever for Grave Lake.  In 2014, the sampled fish ranged from 9.5 to 23.4 inches and had a mean length of 15.7 inches.  Size structure had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 55, 15, and 0, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked annually but at a lower rate since 2005 (1,000 fry/littoral acre).  Walleye age and growth information was determined from scale, opercle and otolith analysis.  Eight year-classes were identified with fish from one to eight years old present.  The 2006, 2011, and 2012 year-classes were the most notable year-classes, representing over 80% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Age-4 fish averaged 15.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are difficult to sample using standard summer netting methods because they tend to avoid the nets.  Although night electrofishing is a more effective sampling tool for Largemouth Bass it was not conducted in 2014 because the population does not warrant the additional effort on a regular basis.  Only one fish was sampled in our gill nets and trap nets and it was 18.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have fluctuated from 5.0 in 1974 to 12.4 fish/gill net in 1988.  In 2014, the catch of 9.8 fish/net was above the lake class 3rd quartile value of 8.5 fish/gill net and management goal of 6.0 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.4 to 35.0 inches and had a mean length of 20.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie had never been sampled above the respective 1st quartile values for gill nets and trap nets until the last two assessments.  In 2014, the gill-net catch was 3.4/net and the trap-net catch was 0.4 fish/net.  The gill-net catch was again above the 3rd quartile value of 2.7 fish/net while the trap-net catch was below the 1st quartile value of 0.7 fish/net.  The gill-net sampled fish ranged from 4.3 to 12.1 inches and had a mean length of 6.3.  Scale analysis indicated four age-classes were present with fish from age 2 to 5.  Growth was similar to other class 25 lakes for the first three years but faster for age-4 and age-5 fish.  Black Crappie averaged 9.7 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to the 2014 assessment, Yellow Perch gill-net catch rates had fluctuated from a low of 16.7 fish/net in 1969 to a high of 46.0 fish/net in 2007.  In 2014, the catch was the lowest on record at 14.6 fish/gill net but remained above the lake class median of 9.0/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.4 to 9.5 inches and had a mean length of 6.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as a prey species than a species of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Grave Lake was conducted on July 11-14, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Bowfin catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes and the average length was 6.4 inches, with 21% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Grave Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is a 500 acre lake that is managed primarily for bluegill, walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass.  There is currently an experimental regulation that sets the possession limit on bluegill at 5 fish.  This regulation is attempting to maintain the quality size structure of the bluegill population.  Walleye are stocked to provide a modest walleye fishery.Bluegill were sampled at a rate within their expected range.  Generally, with bluegill, low abundance is good, as it usually equates to larger average sizes.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged from 3.4 to 9.6 inches long and had a mean length of 5.0 inches.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets were all less than 5 years old.  However, trap nets do not typically sample older, larger bluegill well when assessments are conducted in August.  Trapnetting in the spring did sample several older fish.  Growth of bluegill in Grave Lake appears to be above average.Walleye were sampled at a rate within the expected range for similar type lakes and at the second highest abundance that has been observed on Grave Lake.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 15.0 to 24.4 inches long and had a mean length of 18.0 inches.  Growth appears to be good for walleye.  Walleye up to 13 years old were sampled in this assessment.Northern pike were sampled in the gill nets at a rate within the expected range, but a little higher than is preferred.  As is the case with bluegill, high northern pike abundance usually means the average size will be small.  The northern pike sampled in the gill nets only had a mean weight of 1.29 pounds.Electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass, but the technique is fairly new so it is difficult to draw any conclusions about abundance.  Bass sampled while electrofishing ranged from 3.2 to 17.7 inches long and had a mean length of 10.2 inches. Yellow perch are an important food for walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch were sampled in the gill nets at a rate that exceeds the expected range.  Perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.3 to 10.6 inches long and the mean length was 7.3 inches.Only two black crappie were sampled in this assessment.  Other species sampled include; bowfin (dogfish), brown and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco) and white sucker.\t\t\tAnglers can promote a healthy fishery by releasing larger fish and only keeping what you need for a meal.  This is especially true with bluegill and northern pike, where the number of larger individuals in a population can control their abundance and therefore the average size of the fish in the lake.Also, lakeshore residents can often have the greatest impact on water quality in the lake and usually have the most to gain by protecting the lakes water quality.  Poor water quality can affect the fishery as well as other recreational uses.  Preventing nutrients from reaching the lake, avoiding erosion and sedimentation and preserving fish habitat should be goals of all lake users.  Things that can be done to acheive these goals include; maintaining buffers of natural vegetation along the lake to prevent erosion and to filter out nutrients in run-off, leaving as much aquatic vegetation undisturbed as possible to further filter nutrients and provide fish habitat, preventing lawn clippings or leaves from entering lakes, avoid using fertilizers on lawns or use phosphorus-free fertilizers, and by maintaining a properly functioning septic system.   Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake is a class 25 lake located 7 miles south of Marcell.  There is a public access on the northeast part of the lake.  The lake management plan indicates walleye and bluegill are the primary species of management with northern pike and largemouth bass as secondary species.  In the spring of 2001 a conservation regulation (5 sunfish daily/possession bag limit) was established to maintain the quality bluegill population.  The evaluation schedule called for spring trap netting assessments for three consecutive years (2000 to 2002) to get a baseline of information on bluegill size and age structure, followed by samples in 2004 and 2006, 2007, 2008, and the last year of the evaluation in 2009.  Standardized sampling included net numbers, location and timing of the special assessments.  Ten trap nets were set and lifted for two consecutive days in late May or early June.  Bluegill were measured for lengths and weights, scale samples were collected and sex was determined.  These data will be used to evaluate the success of the conservation regulation. <br> \n <br> \nSpring catch rates are typically influenced by spring weather patterns more than changes in bluegill numbers.  However, there does appear to be an increasing trend in catch rates since special sampling targeting bluegill began in 2000.  In 2009, the bluegill trap-net catch was 50.2 fish/net compared to 6.5 fish/net in 2000.  Many lakes in the area have also experienced an increasing trend in bluegill numbers. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 sampled bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Bluegill size structure has varied from year to year but has exhibited signs of a high quality population in all assessments.  In 2009, index values were 90, 36, and 1 for PSD, RSD-P (8 inches), and RSD-M (10 inches), respectively.  Since 2000, the PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values have ranged from 55-96, 15-36, and 0-6, respectively.  Timing of the sample, angler harvest, natural mortality and year-class strength all contribute to the variable size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNine year classes were determined from the scale samples with fish from age 3 to age 11 present.  The largest year class sampled was from 2003, representing 47% of the sample.  In the two previous assessments, the 2002 year class was the strongest sampled and it remained the second strongest year class in 2009.  These two strong year classes are partially responsible for the increasing trend in catch rates.  However, after nine years of the lower bag limit, the population could still be characterized by consistent but low to moderate recruitment with good growth.  Mean back-calculated lengths at age were higher (>115% of median) than those reported for class 25 lakes for all age 6 and older fish.  Six year old fish averaged just under 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn each of the special assessments where we collected information on sex distributions, females have always been more abundant than males.  The year with the highest proportion of females was 2007 when 81% of the sample were females.  In 2009, the sex distribution was 69% female and 31% male.  It is not clear whether the sex ratio is representative of what exists in the population or if it is the result of the timing of our sampling in relation to sexual behaviors or some unknown factor.</p>",
