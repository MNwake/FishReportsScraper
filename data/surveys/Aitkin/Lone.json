Fingerlings will be stocked at a rate of 1 lb/LA (148 lbs) in 2019, and 2022. Night electrofishing in the fall will be used in 2 of the 4 fry stocked years to assess the survival of YOY walleye. Sampling was conducted on 9/12/2017. The total sample time was 1 hour resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 1/hour (rate reported as run time). A total of 5 walleye were caught, 1 YOY, 4 juveniles and no adults were sampled. Walleye ranged in length from 6.2 - 10.5 inches. Standard assessments beginning in 2019, and an additional gill net only targeted assessment in 2022, will assist in evaluating the new program.  Prior to this change the lake was stocked with 2 lbs fgl/LA (296 lbs) in alternate years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake contains large  populations of small, slow-growing northern pike and sunfish and a small population of walleyes. Anglers should be able to catch plenty of fish, however the average size of the fish may be quite small. The northern pike averaged only 16.6 inches and were caught at above normal rates in the survey gill nets for this type of lake. The pike may attain large sizes however; the largest fish in the gill nets was 31.6 inches long. Northern pike growth continues to be slow and natural recruitment high for northern pike, indicating a stable population.  Sunfish are also stable and will probably continue to provide higher catch rates of small fish.  The mean length of bluegills in the trap nets in this survey was only 6.2 inches and the average 6 inch bluegill is already at least six years old in Lone Lake.  Enough larger sunfish were caught to indicate that reasonable fishing for sunfish can occur in the lake, if the smaller sunfish can be avoided.  Walleyes were caught at lower than normal rates for this type of lake. They averaged 17.0 inches in the survey gill nets and ranged up to 23.3 inches in this survey. The walleyes decreased in abundance since 1990, so catch rates may be lower than normal. The size structure will probably change as the strength of the stocked year classes changes. Currently the abundance is down and the mean size is up for Lone Lake.  Very few black crappies were caught in this survey and they were all from the same year class. Sporadic black crappie catches have been the trend in previous surveys as well.  The abundant sunfish population may support a moderate largemouth bass population, however the standard survey nets do not adequately sample largemouth bass. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is located in southern Aitkin County approximately 7 miles south of the city of Aitkin. The lake is 448 acres with a maximum depth of 60 feet and excellent water clarity making it desirable for residents and recreational users. The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants, as well as coarse woody habitat, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and to provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish and yellow perch. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n <br> \nLone Lake has a long history of walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1949. The frequency of stocking has varied over the years with the current strategy being 2 pounds per littoral acre stocked in alternate years. The walleye catch rate decreased from 2.7/gill net in 2010 to 1.0/gill net in 2015. Past catches have averaged 2.1/gill net. Average length and weight were 18.8\" and 2.4 lbs.Walleye anglers will likely find their best success during low light periods or even at night due to the high water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike continue to be abundant at 7.8/gill net. Past catches have ranged from 3.7 to 24.7/gill net with an average of 12.3/gill net. Average length and weight were 18.9\" and 1.9 lbs with 17% measuring at least 24\". Age 2 and 3 fish (2012 and 2013) were most abundant, accounting for 50% of all northern pike sampled. Large northern pike are known to prey upon small abundant northern pike in some systems and can have positive impacts on the size structure of the population and the fish community. Therefore, catch and release of larger pike is strongly encouraged. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 bluegill catch rate of 13.2/trap net is normal for the lake class with past catches ranging from 3.2 to 43.9/trap net. The growth rate of bluegill is slower than normal when compared to that of other lakes in the county, however some fish are able to grow to quality sizes. In 2015, 30% of bluegill sampled were longer than 7\".  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates were relatively high for Lone Lake, with 2015 catch rates of 0.9/gill net and 1.9/trap net, respectively. Black crappie growth was relatively fast compared to other area lakes, with fish reaching 9\" at age 4. In 2015, the average size of black crappie caught was 8.4\", and fish over 11\" were observed. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for walleye and northern pike in Lone Lake, and are found in average densities for this lake class. The 2015 yellow perch catch rate of 2.7/gill net is typical of past catches, which average 3.0/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch rates were normal in 2015, at 0.8/gill net. Past catches have ranged from 0.3 to 1.1/gill net. Growth was slow (under 10\" at age 4), but more than half (50%) of all largemouth bass sampled measured at least 12\", exceeding the management goal of 25%. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is located in southern Aitkin County approximately 7 miles south of the city of Aitkin.  The lake is 448 acres with a maximum depth of 60 feet and excellent water clarity making it desirable for residents and recreational users.  The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Anglers will likely find their best success during low light periods or even at night due to the high water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nLone Lake has a long history of walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1949.  The frequency of stocking has varied over the years with the current strategy being 2 pounds per littoral acre stocked in alternate years.  The walleye catch increased from 1.7/gill net in 2005 to 2.7/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have averaged 2.0/gill net.  Average length and weight were 18.5\" and 2.5 lbs in 2010, compared to 18.1\" and 2.0 lbs in 2005.  A trophy walleye measuring 31 inches was sampled in the 2010 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike continue to be very abundant at 11.2/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 3.7 to 24.7/gill net with an average of 13.1/gill net.  Average length and weight were 15.4\" and 0.9 lbs with only 6% measuring at least 24\".  Age 1 and 3 fish (2007 and 2009 year classes) were most abundant, accounting for 60% of all northern pike sampled.  Large northern pike are known to prey upon small abundant northern pike in some systems and can possibly have positive impacts on the size structure of the population. Therefore, catch and release of pike measuring 24 inches and larger is strongly encouraged. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 bluegill catch of 13.0/trap net is normal for the lake class with past catches ranging from 3.2 to 43.9/trap net.  The growth rate of bluegill is slower than normal when compared to that of other lakes in the county, however some fish are able to grow to quality sizes.  In 2010 24% of bluegill sampled were longer than 7 inches. Black crappie catches have ranged from 0 to 0.9/gill net and from 0 to 1.3/trap net with 2010 catches of 0.9 and 1.1/net, respectively.  Black crappie growth is classified as normal compared to other area lakes, and some quality individuals can be found.  In 2010, the average size of black crappie caught was 11.8 inches. Yellow perch are also present in the lake and are an important forage species for the lake's game fish.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for walleye and northern pike in Lone Lake, and are found in average densities for this lake class. The 2010 yellow perch catch of 2.9/gill net is typical of past catches, which average 3.1/gill net.    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught in their highest numbers to date in 2010, at 2.3/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 0.3 to 1.1/gill net.  Growth was slow, but half (50%) of all largemouth bass sampled measured at least 12\", exceeding the management goal of 25%.  <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard survey conducted the week of June 15, 2015. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but one site was sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 3 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including mimic shiner, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, banded killifish, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nLone lake falls within lake class 23 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 2 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 45 (90% CI 36-54) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 64. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 survey, calculated from this survey was 57.3, which is well above the impairment threshold, indicating good overall health of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is located in southern Aitkin County approximately 7 miles south of the city of Aitkin. The lake is 448 acres with a maximum depth of 60 feet and excellent water clarity making it desirable for residents and recreational users. The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants, as well as coarse woody habitat, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and to provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish and Yellow Perch. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n <br> \nLone Lake has a long history of Walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1949. The frequency has varied over the years with fingerlings being the main life stage used. Though the lake is known to produce some nice Walleyes, fingerling stocking was seldom able to get the population to its management goal of 3-5/gill net. Therefore, an experimental Walleye fry stocking plan was developed beginning in 2017. Fall electrofishing was conducted in 2017 to document fry survival and only 1 YOY Walleye was caught in an hour of effort. Walleye gill net catches during the previous nettings have ranged from 0.3 to 4.4/gill net with mean and median values of 1.9 and 1.7/gill net, respectively. The Walleye catch remained low in 2019 at 1.33/gill net, and is below the management goal of 3-5/gill net. Average length and weight were 15.3\" and 1.2 lbs. Walleye anglers will likely find their best success during low light periods or even at night due to the high water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to be abundant at 9.9/gill net. Past catches have ranged from 3.7 to 24.7/gill net with an average of 12.0/gill net. Average length and weight were 20.9\" and 2.5 lbs with 28% measuring at least 24\". Large Northern Pike are known to prey upon small abundant Northern Pike in some systems and can have positive impacts on the size structure of the population and the fish community. The size structure has shown nice improvements over the last two surveys, therefore, catch and release of larger pike is strongly encouraged. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Bluegill catch rate of 17.8/trap net is normal for the lake class with past catches ranging from 3.2 to 43.9/trap net. The growth rate of Bluegill is slower than normal when compared to that of other lakes in the county, however, some fish are able to grow to quality sizes. In 2019, 34% of Bluegill sampled were longer than 7\". Hybrid Sunfish are also present in decent numbers and typically grow larger than Bluegill which can add a quality component to the panfish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were as high as we have observed for Lone Lake, with a 2019 catch rate of 2.0/gill net. This doesn't indicate an overly abundant population but the size structure is good. Growth was good compared to other area lakes, with fish reaching 8.5\" at age 4. In 2019, the average size of Black Crappie caught was 10.3\", and fish approaching 13\" were observed. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage fish for Walleye and Northern Pike in Lone Lake, and are found in average densities for this lake class. The 2019 Yellow Perch catch rate of 1.8/gill net is typical of past catches, which average 2.9/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gill net catch rates increased slightly to 1.7/gill net in 2019 and are in the normal range for similar lake types. Growth was relatively slow (10.2\" at age 4), but more than half (53%) of all Largemouth Bass sampled in gill nets measured at least 12\", exceeding the management goal for the lake. Spring night time electrofishing was also done in 2019 and 147 were caught for a catch rate of 84/hr, indicating a fairly high abundance for this area. From the electrofishing sample 56 percent were larger than 12 inches with a maximum length of 16.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The gill net indices for white sucker and yellow perch were below the lake class 23 first quartiles. The trap net indices for bowfin, green sunfish and largemouth bass were below the lake class 23 first quartiles. The trap net indices for yellow bull- head and pumpkinseed were above the lake class 23 third quartiles. Northern pike sampled ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1987. The growth rates for the fifth sixth, seventh and eighth increments were slower than normal. Bluegill sampled ranged from four to seven years of age with strong year classes in 1985 and 1986. Growth rates were normal for all increments. Black crappie sampled ranged from three to eight years of age with a strong year class in 1987. Growth rates for the third, fourth and fifth increments were faster than normal. Yellow perch sampled ranged from two to six years of age. Growth rates were normal. Walleye sampled ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1988 and 1986. The strong 1988 year class indicates that there was some successful natural reproduction taking place in lone lake. The 1986 year class does correspond to a stocking of 2,000 fingerlings. Growth rates were normal. Yellow perch showed a significant decline in abundance from the 1985 assessment. Walleye showed a significant increase in abundance since the 1985 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lone Lake is located approximately seven miles south of the city of Aitkin. The lake is 448 acres and has a maximum depth of 60 feet.  Lone Lake has excellent water clarity making it desirable for residents and recreational users. The lake supports a large population of small, slow-growing northern pike, sunfish and a small, but viable, walleye population. Black crappies are present, but not very abundant.Northern pike are over abundant in Lone Lake and were caught at a rate of 12.5 fish per gillnet in 2005 which is considered high for this lake type. Consequently, the pike in the lake grow slowly and do not get very large. The mean length for northern pike was a mere 16.6 inches and only five of 88 fish sampled were longer than 25 inches with a maximum length of 29 inches. Anglers are encouraged to release pike over 22 inches and to keep the smaller ones to achieve a better size distribution.Bluegill abundance is average and has fluctuated over time. Numbers seem to have decreased since the record catches of the late 1980's and early 1990's.  The mean length of bluegills in this survey was nearly 7 inches and fish up to 9.5 inches were sampled. There is an apparent lack of recruitment of young bluegill to the fishery over the last several years as the majority of fish sampled were over 7 years old. The last strong year class of bluegills was produced in 1998.  Enough larger sunfish were caught to expect reasonable angler satisfaction. Some decent pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish were also sampled with the pure strain bluegills.Walleye catches were slightly lower than normal for this type of lake at 1.7 per gill net lift. They averaged 18 inches and ranged up to 23.5 inches in this survey. The size structure of the walleye population will change as the strength of the stocked year classes changes through time. Over half of the walleye sampled in this survey were from the 2001 year class. The lake has a long history of walleye stocking and the population will continue to be maintained by stocking in the future.  Black crappie catch rates were indicative of what can be expected from this lake type at 1 fish per trap net and .86 per gill net. The mean size for crappie was about 9.5 inches.  One individual sampled was nearly 15 inches long.  Black crappie were not abundant in this survey but quality size fish are present. Sporadic black crappie catches have been the norm in previous surveys as well. The abundant sunfish population may support a moderate largemouth bass population, however the standard survey nets do not adequately sample largemouth bass. </p>",
