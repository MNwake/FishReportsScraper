                "narrative": "<p>East Chain is located south of the City of East Chain.  East Chain is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch, black crappie or white crappie.During the drought of the late eighties and early nineties, northern pike access to quality spawning habitat was limited.  The northern pike population has improved with higher water levels in the last few years.  Northern pike numbers appeared to be moderate compared to lakes similar to East Chain.  Northern pike ranged from 18 to 32 inches and averaged 23.5 inches.  The northern pike population should continue to do well if water levels remain normal or high.Although black crappie are not real abundant their numbers have improved since 1992.  What the black crappie population lacks in numbers, is compensated for by large fish.  Black crappie ranged from 6.5 to 17.1 inches, with an average of 9.5 inches.  The largest black crappie sampled was 17.1 inches and weighed more than three pounds.  Most black crappies averaged nine inches in just three growing seasons, which is excellent growth.  If you are looking for a wall hanger, East Chain may be the lake for you.East Chain is one of many lakes in the area that has both crappie species.  Since 1992, white crappie numbers have increased and now are more abundant than 75% of the lakes similar to East Chain.  White crappie sampled in 1997 ranged from 7.6 to 17.0 inches, with an average of 9.3 inches.  The largest white crappie was 17.0 inches and weighed more than three pounds.  After only three years of growth, white crappie averaged 10 inches.  Not only does East Chain have the potential to produce trophy white crappie, but the big fish sampled in 1997 was approaching the current state record.  Give East Chain a try next summer if you want a chance at a trophy black or white crappie. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of East Chain through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chain Lake is a 485 acre lake with two district basins (north and south) that has a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The lake is adjacent to the city of East Chain in Martin County.  Only 3 fish population assessments or surveys have been completed prior to 2013 with an initial assessment in 1992 followed by follow-up surveys in 1997 and 2001.  East Chain Lake is susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter due to shallow water and abundant aquatic vegetation leading to frequent fish winterkills.  It seems that fish kills occur approximately once every 8 to 9 years at varying levels of severity.  Recently, winterkills in the winters of 2000-2001 and 2008-2009 were not severe and resulted in minor partial fish kills.  A fish population assessment was conducted from 8-11 of July 2013 with 12 trap nets and no gill nets due to shallow water and abundant aquatic vegetation.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike in East Chain was 1.4 fish per trap net in 2013 which was below the long-term catch rate of 1.8 and less than the previous two surveys.  Northern pike in the sample ranged in length from 8.4 to 29.5 inches with an average length of 23.6 inches and an average weight of 2.5 pounds.  The overall health of the fish in the sample was good.  The size structure the fish in the trap net sample indicates a population that is composed of larger fish.  Habitat abundance and quality are favorable to northern pike spawning in the lake and the sample indicated decent natural reproduction in East Chain in 2013.  Northern pike are hardy fish and can survive low oxygen levels, this is true in East Chain Lake as the population appears relatively stable from year-to-year.  Currently, the good size structure metrics and good health of northern pike in East Chain Lake along with evidence of natural reproduction indicates that the population is doing well.  Fishing for northern pike in East Chain Lake should be the main attraction for anglers over the next year or two and large fish could be caught from the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were collected in the trap net sample in 2013.  In previous years the trap net catch rate ranged from 0.4 fish per trap net to 2.5 fish per trap net with a long-term average of 1 fish per trap net.  There may be yellow perch present in East Chain Lake, but trap nets may have missed them in July given the conditions in the lake at the time.  Yellow perch will be stocked in the spring of 2014 in East Chain Lake.  This will help to boost the population and provide a more abundant forage base for northern pike and an additional fishing opportunity for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in 2013 was low with only 2 fish caught in the entire trap net sample.  The expected catch rate range for East Chain Lake is between 1.2 and 20.5.  The long-term catch rate is 2 fish per trap net.  Black crappie has never been a dominant species in East Chain Lake, except during the 1997 survey when the catch rate was 5.2 fish per trap net.  While the catch rate has been below 2.0 fish per net for several surveys in the past, the white crappie catch rate has been more encouraging.  Historically, white crappie have been more abundant than black crappie.  It may be more appropriate to view black and white crappie as one species in East Chain Lake as they do hybridize quite frequently.  When they are combined the crappie population looks more stable.  The white crappie catch rate in 2013 was just below 0.7 fish per trap net.  The expected catch rate range for East Chain Lake is between 0.2 and 6.0 indicating the white crappie catch rate is within the expected range.  The long-term catch rate is nearly 4 fish per trap net so the current catch rate is below the average, but the size of the fish in the sample was very good.  White crappie in the sample ranged in length from 9.0 to 11.0 inches with an average length of 10 inches.  The overall health of the fish in the sample was excellent and indicated that the fish were foraging successfully.  When viewed together with black crappie, the catch rate is nearly 1 fish per trap net and closer to or within the expected range for each species.  Crappie abundance is cyclic in nature, and the populations appear to be in a down cycle, but the fish that are present are large and healthy.  Crappie anglers may have a hard time finding the schools of fish in East Chain Lake, but when they do, they will be happy with the size of the fish.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in 2013 in the trap net sample were bigmouth buffalo (n=1; 0.1 per net), black bullhead (n=44; 3.7 per net), common carp (n=83; 6.9 per net), freshwater drum (n=11; 0.9 per net), golden shiner (n=3; 0.3 per net), orangespotted sunfish (n=1; 0.1 per net), walleye (n=5; 0.4 per net), and white sucker (n=1; 0.1 per net).  Bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, walleye, and white sucker all had catch rates less than their expected catch range.  Freshwater drum and golden shiner had catch rates within their expected catch range.  Common carp was the only species with a catch rate that exceeded its expected catch range.  Orangespotted sunfish do not have an established expected catch range so a determination could not be made.  Sizes of the fish were good and they appeared healthy.  Walleye anglers may find some decent sized fish in East Chain Lake over the next year or two. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chain is a 485 acre lake with a maximum depth of six feet.  The lake is located in the town of East Chain in Martin County.  East Chain is managed for northern pike primarily while yellow perch, black crappie, and white crappie are managed secondarily.  East Chain suffered a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.The northern pike population is abundant compared to lakes similar to East Chain.  Several northern pike which hatched in the Spring of 2001 were sampled during our assessment on 07/02/2001.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 7.1 inches to 31.5 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.  The small average size is due to all the 7 to 10 inch northern pike sampled.The crappie population is average to good for lakes like East Chain.  There were fair numbers of crappie in the 8 to 9 inch range and they should provide fishing opportunities during the 2002 fishing season.For people who like to fish bullheads, the bullhead population is doing very good.  Many bullheads were sampled in the 8 to 11 inch range.Bow fishing for common carp has become more popular than in the past.  East Chain would be an excellent choice for people who enjoy this sport.  Many carp in the 20 to 30 inch range were sampled during the 2001 assessment.Other gamefish sampled during the assessment which could provide some angling opportunities include walleye, yellow perch, and channel catfish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Chain Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chain Lake is a 485-acre lake with two distinct basins (north and south) that has a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The lake is adjacent to the City of East Chain in Martin County.  East Chain Lake is susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter due to shallow water and in some years abundant aquatic vegetation leading to frequent winterkills.  Winterkills have been documented during the winters of 2000-2001, 2008-2009, and 2013-2014. East Chain Lake is part of system of wetland complexes in both downstream and upstream directions.  Many times East Chain Lake has fish immigrating into the lake from downstream.  East Chain Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike with Yellow Perch as the secondary management species.  A targeted survey was conducted the week of May 29, 2019, earlier than historical standard surveys, to better assess primary management species and to avoid dense vegetation later in the summer. Eight trap nets were used to assess the fish community in East Chain Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have varied from 0.5 per trap net in 1992 to 3.3 per trap net in 2001 and have averaged 1.8 per trap net since 1992.  In 2019, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.4 per trap net, which is the same catch rate that was recorded in the last survey in 2013.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 22.0 to 35.4 inches and averaged 28.7 inches.  East Chain Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations.  A limit of 2 pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2019 was 0.4 per trap net, below the long term average of 0.8 per trap net and near the lower end of expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.9 to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  The Yellow Perch trap net catch rate has been less than 2.0 per trap net for two successive surveys so pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch should be stocked to boost the population.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have varied from 0.2 per trap net in 2013 to 5.3 per trap net in 2019, averaging 2.6 per trap net since 1992. The 2019 catch rate is the highest ever recorded in East Chain Lake.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 6.6 to 12.1 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  Black Crappie are not stocked in East Chain Lake suggesting that the population is sustained through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2019, the highest catch rate on East Chain Lake was 26.8 per trap net in 1992.  In 2019, the Black Bullhead catch rate was 168.9 per trap net, exceeding the long-term average of 49.2 per trap net, and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per tap net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Other species sampled included Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

GILLNET CATCH INDICES WERE BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 INDICATING A LOW POPULATION.  SINCE THE PIKE POPULATION APPEARS TO BE LOW, PIKE REMOVAL FOR BROODSTOCK OR FOR STOCKING OTHER LAKES SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNLESS THE FISH ARE RETURNED AFTER SPAWNING.  REMOVAL FOR BROOD STOCK SHOULD ALSO BE QUESTIONED ON THE BASIS OF LEAVING ENOUGH ADULT FISH TO SUSTAIN THE POPULATIONS IN EAST CHAIN LAKE.  SCALES WERE COLLECTED FROM SEVERAL PIKE, BUT INTERPRETATION WAS QUESTIONABLE DUE TO POOR ANNULUS FORMATION, SO AGE AND GROWTH ESTIMATES WERE NOT OBTAINED. MARSHES IN THE INLET AND OTHER LAKES UPSTREAM PROVIDE EXCELLENT SPAWNING HABITAT FOR NOP.  BOTH BLC AND WHC WERE FOUND IN EAST CHAIN LAKE.  WHC GREW FASTER THAN BLACKS (9.8 AND INCHES, RESPECTIVELY, AT SECOND ANNULUS), BUT ARE MUCH LESS ABUNDANT.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLC AND WHC FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  BOTH BLC AND WHC DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO GROW TO LARGER THAN 12 INCHES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN EXCELLENT CRAPPIE FISHERY IF DENSITIES CAN INCREASE.  ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE LOW NUMBERS IS THE FREQUENCY OF LOW OXYGEN IN WINTER.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR YEP FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION. GROWTH OF PERCH IS GOOD, REACHING AN AVERAGE OF 7.3 INCHES BY THE END OF THEIR THIRD YEAR.  THE ABUNDANCE OF PERCH MAY PROVIDE A GOOD SOURCE OF FOOD FOR PREDATORS, BUT WINTERKILL FREQUENCY MAY PREVENT PERCH FROM BECOMING LARGE ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH A GOOD FISHERY.  TRAP AND GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF BLB WAS ABOUT 7.5 INCHES. SHORELINE SEINING INDICATED BLC, YEP, QBS, AND YEB REPRODUCED NATURALLY.  WAE WERE NOT CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY, HOWEVER COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN CAPTURED AND RELEASED THREE WAE 2-5 LBS DURING THE WINTER OF 1993.</p>",
