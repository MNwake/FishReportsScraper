FOUR OTHER YEAR-CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED BY SMALL NUMBERS OF FISH.  GROWTH OF WAE IS GOOD.  NOP CPUE WAS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN IN 1990.  HOWEVER, THE POPULATION APPEARED TO BE COMPOSED OF YOUNG FISH (AGES I-IV) AND HAS A RELATIVELY LOW PSD (26%).

                "narrative": "<p>Marion Lake is a 163 acre lake located approximately eight miles west of Crane Lake.  It has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and substantial weed growth throughout.  Access is via a carrydown located on the west side of the lake at the end of a trail currently being constructed by the US Forest Service.  Two Forest Service gates block public motor vehicle traffic prior to reaching the access.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate was 1.25/set, slightly low when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 20.6 to 24.6 with a mean of 22.2 inches.  Growth rates appeared very good when compared to other lakes in the International Fall Management Area (IFMA).  Mean weight was 3.96 lbs, but not surprising due to the lack of small fish in the catch.  Three age classes were represented with ages ranging from 11 to 16 years.  Marion has had a fair amount of walleye stocking, but all of the aged fish in this investigation date back to non-stocked year classes, indicating that natural reproduction seems to be occurring.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 10.25/set which is very good when compared to similar lakes.  The catch rate has remained near this level, never under 10.33/set, over the past four surveys dating back to 1995.  Lengths ranged from 8.8 to 31.3 with a mean of 20.8 inches.  Mean weight was 2.12 lbs but growth was slightly slow when compared to other lakes in the IFMA.  Eight age classes were represented with ages ranging from 2 to 9 years.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in gill-nets for the first time on Marion.  Two fish were captured for a catch rate of 0.50/set.  Lengths were 14.5 and 16.3 inches with a mean weight of 2.48 lbs.  The smaller bass was age-4 and the larger age-7. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 9.11/set which is very good when compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.2 with a mean of 5.6 inches.  Mean weight was 0.15 lbs and growth was slightly below the area average.  Seven year classes were present with ages ranging from 2 to 8 years, however 38% of the total catch came from the 2006 year class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 9.25/set.  Mean weight was 0.09 lbs and lengths ranged from 5.2 to 7.6 with a mean of 5.9 inches.  Growth appeared to be below the area average.  Four year classes were present with fish ranging from 4 to 7 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe only additional species sampled were golden shiner. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The largest northern pike sampled was 40.4\" long, and weighed 13.9 pounds.  Yellow perch abundance was high, and fish up to 13.0\" long were sampled.  Bluegill have not been sampled previously in Marion Lake, but were present during this investigation.  Bluegill up to 9.1\" long were sampled, and large numbers of young bluegill in seining catches indicates natural reproduction has occurred.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion Lake is a 163 acre, class 19 lake, located approximately eight miles west of Crane Lake.  Marion Lake is shallow and the entire lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The access located on the east side of the lake was used during the population assessment.  Healthy populations of several fish species were present in 2000.        Bluegill abundance was above average for similar lakes (class 19).  The fish were young and generally small.  Age in trap nets ranged from 2-4, with age-2 composing 69% of the sample.  Total length (TL) ranged from 3.2-6.8 inches in trap traps and was similar for gill nets.  However, one fish over 10.0 inches was captured in a gill net.      Northern pike abundance was more than twice the average for similar lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and TL ranged from 10.5-32.1 inches.  The mean weight was average for this lake type.      Walleye populations have greatly exceeded the expectations for this lake type during investigations conducted in the two previous decades.  Walleye gill net abundance in 2000 was 17.00 fish/set, which was over six times greater than average for similar lakes.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Total length ranged from 9.0-27.9 inches and the mean was 17.7.  Growth was exceptional and mean TL at age-4 was much greater than the area and statewide averages.  Mean weight of walleyes captured in gill nets was above average.      Yellow perch gill net abundance was over four times greater than the average class 19 lake.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  Total length ranged from 5.0-11.5 inches and the mean was 8.0.  Mean TL at age-4 was higher than the area and statewide averages.   </p>",

The access located on the east side of the lake was used during the population assessment.          Bluegill abundance in gill nets was 3.50 fish/set.  Age ranged from 2-8 years.  Total length ranged from 3.5-8.9 inches and the mean was 6.3.      Northern pike gill net abundance was 11.25 fish/set, which was well above what is found in most class-19 lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  Total length ranged from 10.6-34.2 inches.  Growth was below the statewide and area means.        For two decades, the walleye population in Marion Lake has greatly exceeded what is found in most class-19 lakes.  Walleye gill net abundance in 2005 was 8.75 fish/set, which again was much greater than most class-19 lakes.  However, abundance has drastically decreased since the previous investigation in 2000.  In 2005, 11 year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-14 years.  Total length ranged from 10.7-27.0 inches and the mean was 18.6.  Growth was slightly greater than the area and statewide averages.      Yellow perch gill net abundance was similar to what is found in most class 19 lakes.  Three year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-6 years.  Total length ranged from 5.2-8.3 inches and the mean was 5.8.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide averages. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion is a small lake located approximately 8 miles west of the community of Crane Lake, Minnesota. Marion is 183 acres and has a maximum depth of 13 feet. The bog-stained brown waters have fairly good clarity, and the majority of the lake is heavily vegetated. The only public access as of the 2018 survey is a carry-in access on the west side of the lake. Marion was surveyed in 2018 as part of a regular rotation of lake survey in the International Falls Management Area <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are plentiful in Marion. The type of sampling gears used during the 2018 survey do not typically catch many Bluegill, but they were still caught in high numbers during this survey. The 2018 catch rate was greater than the long term average for Marion, and the size averaged 5.5 inches. Aging showed that some Bluegill up to 12 years old exist in Marion Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are also not typically sampled well in the gear used during the 2018 survey, but several were still caught. Largemouth were first sampled in survey gear during the 2012 assessment, and there appears to be a healthy population established now.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also plentiful, and were at record high catch rates in 2018. Typically lakes with high densities of Northern Pike tend to have stunted populations. However, Northern Pike up to nearly 36 inches were sampled during the survey. Pike averaged 2.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite several years of recent Walleye fry stocking, the 2018 Walleye catch rate was the lowest since the initial survey in 1972. Two Walleye from the 2009 year class (9 years old) were the only Walleye caught during this survey. They measured 22.4 and 26.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were also sampled at a historic low catch rate for Marion Lake. The 2018 catch rate was a fraction of the long term average for this lake. Perch averaged 6.6 inches during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled during this survey include Golden Shiner.  <br> \n</p>",
