                "narrative": "<p>Lake Nokomis is a 201-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet.  All land surrounding Lake Nokomis is owned by the city of Minneapolis, and Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board maintains the property.  There is a boat access on the northern shore of the lake, as well as two fishing piers and two swimming beaches on the lake.  Gas motors are prohibited on Nokomis, and the lake is popular among canoers and kayakers. Nokomis is primarily managed for Walleye and Tiger Muskellunge; each is stocked on an every-other-year basis.  Lake Nokomis is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, Walleye were abundant, and of good-quality size.  Fish ranged in length from 14.8-26.2 inches, with an average size of 18.9 inches and 2.56 pounds.  There aren't many Northern Pike in the lake, but they tend to be large.  The average pike was 27.3 inches and 4.45 pounds.  In 2018,  a new Northern Pike regulation took effect; as part of the North-Central management zone, anglers are allowed to harvest up to ten Northern Pike smaller than 22 inches in Long, and one over 26 inches, while respecting a 22-26 inch protected slot.  Due to the larger size of Lake Nokomis pike, anglers won't have a great opportunity for harvesting ten fish; however 50% of the sampled fish exceeded 26 inches, so harvesting a larger fish is possible. Consistently low Northern Pike abundances have allowed for establishment and continuation of Tiger Muskellunge management. <br> \n <br> \nTiger Muskellunge and Largemouth bass are both present in Lake Nokomis. However, targeted sampling was not made in 2018 for lack of time and staff.  Four bass were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets, ranging in size from 5.9 to 13.4 inches, and two Tiger Muskies were captured in the gill nets, measuring 23.2 and 23.5 inches.  Gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample these species, so these samples do not accurately reflect the size structure of the fish in the lake, and only document their presence.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of panfish were sampled in 2018, and plenty of harvestable-size Bluegill were present.  Thirty-six percent of the Bluegill sample exceeded 6 inches, and the average size of fish was 5.8 inches and 0.15 pounds.  The largest Bluegill was 7.8 inches.  Black Crappie were modestly sized, but they were plentiful.  Yellow Perch were highly abundant, but also not of desirable size.  These smaller-sized Yellow Perch do support the predator fishes of Walleye, Tiger Muskie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike populations.   <br> \n</p>",

THE MAJORITY OF THE WAE SAMPLED WERE FROM THE 1986 YEAR CLASS. AVERAGE SIZE OF SAMPLED WAE WAS 14.5 INCHES AND 1.6 POUNDS.  THE RSD=12.8% FOR WAE SAMPLED IN BOTH GEAR TYPES.  WAE GROWTH WAS FOUND TO BE AVERAGE FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES.  SURVIVAL OF FINGERLINGS STOCKED IN 1991 APPEARS TO BE GOOD AS THEY MADE UP 31.6% OF THE OVER ALL WAE SAMPLE. YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED WELL ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET.  THE AVERAGE YEP SAMPLED WAS 5.94 PER POUNDS.  BLC AND BLG WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES.  BLC WERE SAMPLED WELL IN EXCESS OF MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH GEAR TYPES, WHILE BLG GREATLY EXCEEDED MEDIANS FOR TRAP NETS ONLY.  BLC EXHIBITED A PSD<1.0% AND AVERAGED 5.9 FISH/LB. GROWTH RATE WAS NOT EXAMINED BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE SLOW.  THE BLG TRAPNET PSD=3.0% WITH THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL BEING 5.15'L AND 8.67 FISH/LB.  BLG AND BLC WERE BOTH SAMPLED IN RECORD NUMBERS.  THREE TME WERE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NET SAMPLE AND 1 WAS RELEASED ALIVE.  ALL 3 FISH WERE FROM THE 1991 STOCKING OF YEARLINGS (1990 YEAR CLASS) RECEIVED FROM PRIVATE AUACULTURE OPERATIONS.  THE BELOW AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF THESE 3 FISH REFLECT THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE WHEN RECEIVED FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS A DIRECT RESULT OF FORAGE ABUNDANCE NOT BEING ADEQUATE FOR MAXIMUM GROWTH DUE TO ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS.  RATE OF GROWTH FOR TME SAMPLED IN 1990 FROM THE 1984 YEAR CLASS WAS AVERAGE FOR LOCAL LAKES.  BACK-CALCULATED LENGTH AT SECOND ANNULUS FORMATION WAS OVER 3 INCHES LONGER (20.8 THE 1990.  LMB WERE SAMPLED BY SEINING AND GROWTH RATE TO AGE II+ IS AVERAGE.  ONE YOY SMB WAS ALSO CAPTURED IN THE SHORELINE SEINE SAMPLE.  THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIES VERIFIES THE ANGLER REPORTS RECEIVED THE LAST TWO YEARS AT THE AREA OFFICE.  CARP WERE SAMPLED BELOW ALL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH GILL AND TRAP NETS.  GOS AND WTS WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS, BUT ABOVE MEDIANS FOR TRAP NETS.  THE AVERAGE WTS SAMPLED WAS 14.3 INCHES AND 1.3 POUNDS.  THE AVERAGE GOS CAPTURED WAS 5.34 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH AND 14.5 FISH PER POUND.  BLB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH GEAR TYPES.  PMK WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS ONLY, BUT ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBERS AND POUNDS PER SET. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED DURING THE SURVEY INCLUDE YEB AND GSF.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Nokomis is a 201-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet, located in southeast Minneapolis.  Lake Nokomis provides ample recreational opportunities.  Fishing and sailing are very popular.  No gas-powered outboard motors can be used on Lake Nokomis.  Electric motors are allowed.  Ice augers are legal to use; holes are limited to 10 inches in diameter.  Beaches provide swimming opportunities.  Water quality in Lake Nokomis is poor compared to other West Metro lakes. Despite degraded water quality, a thriving fish community exists.  Fishing in water deeper than 13 feet in mid-to-late summer could yield very few fish, based on oxygen levels measured at the time of this survey. Keep in mind most regional lakes mix twice yearly (spring and fall), and oxygen and temperatures levels adjust according to weather and season.  Boaters should also keep in mind all rules related to preventing spread of invasive aquatic organisms.  <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Lake Nokomis is maintained through stocking.  Both walleye and hybrid (tiger) muskellunge are stocked.  Walleye average length was 18.6 inches, average weight was 2.82 pounds.  Abundance was above average, weight was also above average for this type of lake.  The largest walleye sampled was 27.6 inches in length.  Six hybrid (tiger) muskellunge were sampled.  Average length was 26.6 inches.  One individual exceeded 40 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers are very low in Lake Nokomis.  Only one northern pike was sampled.  This is an improvement compared to the past three surveys.  In the 2010 population assessment largemouth bass abundance was low.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nSix species of panfish are present in Lake Nokomis.  Yellow perch abundance in Lake Nokomis decreased to the lowest value ever recorded.  Mean weight of yellow perch was below average.  Average length was 5.8 inches.   Pumpkinseed were sampled at a below average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.  Black crappie abundance is average.  Few large fish were sampled.  Average black crappie length was 6.6 inches.  White crappie are also present.  Bluegill abundance increased compared to the 2007 survey.  The 2010 abundance was a new all time high.  Average weight decreased slightly to a below average value.  Only 21.7% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Most panfish species displayed stunted growth.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the Metro area, stunting in size is likely due to overpopulation and size selective harvest by anglers.  Overpopulation reduces the amount of food available to all fish, reducing growth rates.  Harvest of larger (keeper size) fish by anglers reduces the number of quality fish in a lake.  Harvesting large fish also removes the spawning stock and reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish are present in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large which promotes big fish genetics.      <br> \n  <br> \nRough fish are present in low numbers.   Common carp abundance decreased slightly since the 2007 survey.  Black bullhead were also sampled at low levels.  White sucker abundance was low and the fish sampled were large.  Golden shiner abundance is high.  Average weight was also above average.    <br> \n <br> \nNearshore seining and backpack electrofishing found both Iowa and Johnny darters.  Darters are intolerant of very poor water quality.  Their presence in a Minneapolis lake is a positive sign.  Spotfin shiner and bluntnose minnows were other species captured during nearshore sampling.  Overall, Lake Nokomis contains a fair forage base.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net catch in Lake Nokomis during this survey (5 fish per net) was similar to the 2001 survey (5.3 fish per net).  Size was also similar, with walleyes sampled during this survey averaging 20 inches and 3.5 lbs.  Several year classes were found, with growth being average until age 5 when growth becomes above average.  Eleven walleyes less than 8 inches (2 years old) were also caught in trap nets, suggesting the stocking conducted in 2003 had some success.  Only two tiger muskies were sampled in gill nets during this survey compared to four tiger muskies sampled in gill nets in 2001.  Another tiger muskie was  sampled in trap nets.  All three of these fish were around 30 inches long, 7 lbs. in weight, and from the 2002 year class (3 years old).  Growth during ages 1 and 2 was slower than average, but back-calculated growth at age 3 was above average.Black bullhead number per gill net in 2005 (130 per net) is 22 times greater than the 2001 survey (6 per net).  The population is dominated by fish that are 7.5-8.5 inches long with a  mean weight of 0.3 lb.  Black crappie abundance has declined dramatically compared to previous surveys.  Black crappie number per trap net has declined from 293 in 1996 to 23 in 2001 to only 3 in 2005.  Size has not increased, however.  Mean weight was only 0.2 lb. and no crappies over 8 inches long were sampled.  Growth was average.Unlike the black crappie population, the bluegill population appears unchanged from the 2001 survey.  Number per trap net in 2001 was 54 compared to 46 per net surveyed in 2005.  Mean weight was 0.11 lb. with mean length only 5.4 inches.  Most fish were two and three years old with above average growth.The number of yellow perch per gill net in 2005 (92 per net) was below what was observed in 2001 (157 per net).  The perch sampled in 2005 are primarily small, averaging 0.1 lb. in weight and 6 inches long.  Age 3 fish dominated the population with growth being near average.Other species sampled in minimal amounts during the survey include brown bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>While black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill were the most abundant species sampled, good populations of walleye and Hybrid Muskellunge were also observed. Walleye were netted above median levels for abundance while approximately 70 percent of the sample measured 20 inches or more in length. The largest walleye captured measured 28.2 inches and weighed approximately 8.0 pounds. The majority of the Hybrid Muskies sampled were yearling fish that had been stocked in Fall 1995. However, three fish over 40 inches were collected and used in the growth rate analysis, with the largest Hybrid Muskie being 42.7 inches and 23.8 pounds. Northern Pike were also observed in the sample for the first time since 1987. Over 60 percent of the pike netted were over 25.0 inches long, with the largest individual being 30.0 inches. Growth rates for all three primary predator species was found to be above average. Yellow perch were sampled in the highest abundance observed since 1972 but averaged only 6.0 inches in length. Black crappie was the most abundant species collected during this assessment, but averaged small in size. The average black crappie observed was 6.0 inches and one-tenth of a pound. A few white crappies were sampled for the first time, and they averaged 7.5 inches and two-tenths of a pound. Bluegill were sampled in above normal abundance and averaged only 5.1 inches in length and one-tenth of a pound. Growth rates for these species was found to be average. White sucker, black bullhead and golden shiner are also present in good numbers and contribute to the overall forage base and good growth potential for the existing predator population observed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nokomis Lake is a 204-acre, class 24 lake located in the city of Minneapolis.  A public boat launch is located on the west shore and the use of gas-powered motors is prohibited.  Nearly all of the 2.8 miles of shoreline is accessible for shore fishing.  Nokomis is primarily managed for walleye and hybrid muskellunge and is scheduled be stocked with walleye fingerlings (1 pound per littoral acre) in odd numbered years and hybrid muskellunge (3 fingerling per littoral acre) in even numbered years.  \n\nWalleyes were sampled at a gill net catch rate of 5.2 per net, which exceeds the long-range management goal of 4 walleyes per gill net.  Walleye gill net catch rates have met or exceeded this goal during every survey since 1982, indicating stocking efforts have been relatively successful over the years.  The second portion of the walleye goal is to maintain a size structure with at least 25 percent of the fish larger than 20 inches.  This goal was easily met, as 84 percent were larger than 20 inches and 26 percent were larger than 25 inches, indicating that the population is dominated by large individuals.  Walleyes ranged in size from 17.5 to 27.8 inches and averaged 22.7 inches and 4.2 pounds.  Six year classes were present ranging between 4 and 14 and represented every stocking event during the last 10 years except for 1998 (only 46 individuals were stocked) and 2005.  \n\nSeven hybrid muskellunge were sampled during this survey ranging in size from 17.5 up to 37.4 inches.  Three year classes were represented in this sample including the 2006, 2002, and 2000 year classes.  The long-range goal for hybrid muskellunge is to have 30 percent of the population longer than 40 inches.  No individuals over 40 inches were sampled, however, hybrid muskellunge are not sampled effectively with the assessment gears used in this survey.\n\nBluegill was the most abundant fish species (183.1 per trap net) and was sampled at approximately three times above the third quartile (62.5 per net).  The average bluegill was 5.8 inches and 0.1 pounds and 22 percent are longer than 6 inches, but no bluegills larger than 8 inches were sampled.  \n\nBlack crappie gillnet catch (28.3 per gill net) indicates a moderate density of smaller (0.2 pounds per fish) than average fish.  Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 8.6 inches averaging 6.9 inches.  Five age class from 2 through 6 were present however, the 2004 year class (age 3) made up 83 percent of the sample\n\nYellow perch were sampled at 46.5 per gill net, which is much lower than the long term average (140 per net) for Nokomis Lake but still higher than average for similar lakes.  Yellow perch are small in Nokomis Lake, averaging 6.4 inches and 0.1 pounds, and likely serve as an important prey fish for walleye and hybrid muskellunge. \n\nOther fish species sampled in Nokomis include pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, black bullhead bowfin, common carp, golden shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Nokomis is a 201-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet.  All land surrounding Lake Nokomis is owned by the city of Minneapolis, and Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board maintains the property.  There is a boat access on the northern shore of the lake, as well as two fishing piers and two swimming beaches on the lake.  Gas motors are prohibited on Nokomis, and the lake is popular among canoers and kayakers. Nokomis is primarily managed for Walleye and Tiger Muskellunge; each is stocked on an every-other-year basis.  Lake Nokomis is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, Walleye were abundant, and of good-quality size.  Fish ranged in length from 12.8 - 24.6 inches, with an average size of 18.2 inches and 2.16 pounds.  There aren't many Northern Pike in Nokomis, but they tend to be large.  The average pike was 27.4 inches and 4.86 pounds, and the largest was 35.2 inches long.  Consistently low Northern Pike abundances have allowed for establishment and continuation of Tiger Muskellunge management. <br> \n <br> \nTiger Muskellunge and Largemouth Bass are both present in Lake Nokomis. However, targeted sampling was not attempted in 2023.  One bass was sampled in the gill net, and it was 3.4 inches.  Three Tiger  Muskies were captured in the gill nets and trap nets, measuring 24.4, 36.3, and 31.8 inches.  Gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample bass or muskies, so these samples do not accurately reflect the size structure of these populations, and only document their presence.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of panfish were sampled in 2023, and plenty of harvestable-size fish were observed.  Forty-two percent of the Bluegill sample exceeded 6 inches, and the average size was 6.0 inches and 0.17 pounds.  The largest Bluegill was 8.1 inches.  Black Crappie were abundant, and good sized fish were sampled.  Eleven percent of the catch exceeded 9 inches, and the largest crappie was 10.4 inches.  Yellow Perch were highly abundant, and 13% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A decent population of walleye exists in Lake Nokomis with a mean length and weight of 20.6 inches and 3.4 pounds.  There is a range of sizes including fish up to 26-inches.  Hybrid or tiger muskies averaged 31.4 inches and 9.1 pounds.  The largest individual was almost 39.7 inches and 16.1 pounds.  No northern pike were caught in this survey.Lake Nokomis is an average panfishery at this time.  The black crappie population is improving.  Although the abundance decreased from the high levels in 1996, the average size increased to 7.1 inches, however, few fish were over 8 inches.  Bluegills are abundant averaging 6 inches, with 9% over 7 inches.  Yellow perch are very abundant but only average 6.8 inches.  Growth rates are about average for panfish species.No carp were captured.  The decrease in abundance may be due to commercial removal of about 5,000 pounds of carp in January 2001.  Carp removal was called for by the lake management plan and supported by the 1998 Blue Water Commission report with the stated goal of improving water quality.  Carp averaging 6 inches were captured in seine hauls.Overall, fish were larger than in the last survey.  This appears to be attributable to a lower rate of mortality because growth rates appear to be similar or slower from 1996 to 2001.  The older age composition reflects a positive trend in the health of the fishery.</p>",
