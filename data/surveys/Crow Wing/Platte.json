                "narrative": "<p>Platte Lake has a reputation for providing a good winter bluegill fishery and\"hammerhandle\" northern pike.  The lake experienced a partial winterkill in thewinter of 1995/96.  A winterkill can occur when snow and ice depth inhibit lightpenetration enough to stop photosynthesis or the production of oxygen by plants. The last significant winterkill in the lake was in the late 70's.  The lake hassince been repopulated by the surviving fish, immigration from nearby Sullivan Lakevia the Platte River, and stocking by the area fisheries office.  The lake has seenan increase in the northern pike and bullhead population, species which toleratelow oxygen levels.  An experimental regulation was implemented in 1991 increasingthe limit for northern pike to six fish with a protected slot from 24 to 30 inches,and one fish allowed over 30 inches.  The average length for the northern pikecontinues to be about eighteen inches.  However, several pike exceeding thirtyinches have been netted, suggesting the lake has the potential to produce somelarge fish.  Platte Lake has been stocked almost annually with walleye fry since1978 with limited success.  Even with annual stocking, gillnet catch rates continueto indicate low numbers of walleye in the lake.  Average length of the walleyesampled during the summer survey was seventeen inches.  Panfish species in the lakeinclude bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, and hybrid sunfish.  Some qualitybluegills over six inches in length and up to nine inches were netted.  Blackcrappies up to eleven inches were measured, however, the average length was sixinches.  Large panfish typically are not sampled in the standard lake survey gearduring summer assessments.  Largemouth bass are another species difficult toevaluate with lake survey gear.  Spring electrofishing or ice-out nettings are moreeffective methods for assessing largemouth bass and the larger fish present in thefish community.  Catches of bluegill and largemouth bass indicate the winterkillreduced populations, but with the recent recruitment of largemouth bass andbluegill the populations will rebound.  Platte Lake's roughfish community includessuch species as white suckers, carp, black bullheads, yellow bullheads, and brownbullheads.  Net catches have shown an increase in the bullhead populations, whichmay be a response to the partial winterkill.  Most of the bullheads measured wereless than eight inches in length.  Carp numbers do not appear to be at a leveldetrimental to the lake.    Platte Lake's abundant and diverse vegetation community is important tomaintaining fish and wildlife populations.  Adherence to the vegetation managementplan will help to ensure adequate protection of the lake's important habitatfeatures.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Platte Lake (DOW# 18-0088-00; Lake Class 41) is a 1,663 acre lake located near Sullivan, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west Shore. Platte Lake has 13.14 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. Platte Lake is in Lake Class 41; lakes in this class are generally very large, shallow, have a very high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have very hard water, turbid, and are an irregular shape.  In the spring of 2016 a reduced bag limit of 10 fish was implemented for sunfish on Platte Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Bluegill and Black Crappie was completed. Abundance of Bluegill and Black Crappie was similar or slightly higher compared to previous surveys. Size structure of both populations was similar to previous surveys with Bluegill up to 8.5 inches and Black Crappie up to 11 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Platte Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A spring panfish assessment was conducted in mid-June to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in Platte Lake.  This was the first assessment targeting panfish for the lake.  Several  ice-out assessments had been conducted, mostly in the 1990's, to evaluate changes in the Northern Pike  population due to a special regulation.  Some of those early spring assessments were more effective at sampling Black Crappie than Bluegill.  Platte Lake is one of six lakes considered for a special regulation which would reduce the Bluegill bag limit to ten fish.  The lake has been known to produce quality size fish and it is hoped that the bag limit reduction will allow more of the fast growing fish to attain a larger size. <br> \n       Eight standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 16 sets.  The majority of fish caught were measured and scales were taken from both Bluegill and Black Crappie for age and growth data analysis.  A summer survey was also conducted later to evaluate the game fish populations with gill nets.   Near shore sampling with a backpack electrofisher and seine was completed for assessing types and abundance of minnow species and young of year fish species.  The three assessments together were used to obtain an Index of Biotic Integrity for Platte Lake. <br> \n       Although the Bluegill sample size in the 2014 panfish assessment was lower than anticipated (n=236), the catch was higher than in any of the ice-out assessments.  The fish measured from 3.2 to 9 inches in length with a mean length of 6.3 inches and modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches.  Bluegill that exceeded seven inches comprised 41% (n=97) of the catch with 12% (n=29) more than eight inches in length. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the 2014 Bluegill sample which suggested consistent recruitment.  Three year classes from 2011, 2010, and 2008 accounted for 22%, 21%, and 19% of the sample, respectively.  All age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       The highest Bluegill ice-out catch was 186 fish in 2000 with 54 caught in 1998, 64 in 1994, and 118 in 1993.  All the ice-out assessments sampled Bluegill over nine inches in length with two assessments catching fish that were close to ten inches.   Fish that exceeded seven inches also comprised a significant portion of the ice-out catches, 41% in 2000, 83% in 1998, 100% in 1994, and 35% in 1993. <br> \n       The 2014 summer gill nets provided an additional 44 Bluegill between 4.1 and 9.2 inches in length.  Size structure of the sample was comparable to that displayed in the spring panfish assessment.  Mean length for the sample was 6.8 inches and modal length 6.5 - 7 inches.  Fish more than seven inches in length comprised 39% (n=17) of the catch with 16% (n=7) that exceeded eight inches. <br> \n       When comparing Black Crappie catches, all the ice-out assessments caught more Black Crappie than the 2014 panfish assessment.   A total of 54 Black Crappie were caught in the 2014 spring panfish assessment compared to 236 crappie in the 2000 ice-out assessment, 133 in 1998, 66 in 1994, and 106 in 1993.  The 2014 summer gill nets also sampled more crappie than the spring panfish trap nets, catching 78 crappie (6.5/GN) which was within the lake class 41 interquartiles of 0.8 - 11.1/GN. <br> \n        Crappie in the 2014 panfish assessment ranged from 4.8 to 13.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.5 inches.  There were two modal length groups for the sample, 8 - 8.5 inches and 8.5 \u0013 9 inches.  Crappie more than nine inches accounted for 30% (n=16) of the sample with 5% (n=8) more than 10 inches in length.  Four (7%) of the fish exceeded 11 inches and one (2%) exceeded 12 inches in length.   <br> \n       Ages 2 through 7 and 9 were represented in the 2014 crappie catch.  A dominant year class from 2010 comprised 40% of the sample and was responsible for the mean length as well as the modal lengths.   The single age 9 crappie showed fast growth while the remaining age groups displayed normal growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Sample size structures varied between the ice-out assessments crappie catches.  The most desirable size structure was exhibited in the 1994 ice-out assessment where all of the crappie caught (n=66) were over nine inches in length with 64% (n=42) more than 10 inches.  Fish up to 13.7 inches were measured with 24% (n=16) that exceeded 11 inches.   <br> \nThe least desirable sample size structure was in 1998 when only 13% (n=18) of the 133 crappie caught exceeded nine inches in length.   The longest fish caught was 11.4 inches and only 5% (n=7) were more than 10 inches in length. <br> \n       The 2014 summer gill net catch was dominated by smaller Black Crappie which in most lakes is typical for this gear type.  The fish ranged from 5.5 to 12.4 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches and modal length of 5.5 - 6 inches.  Crappie that exceeded nine inches comprised 16% (n=12) of the sample with 12% (n=9) more than 10 inches.  Eight percent (n=6) of the fish were over 11 inches and 3% (n=2) exceeded 12 inches. <br> \nThere were three additional panfish species sampled during the 2014 panfish assessment, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.   Pumpkinseed was the most abundant of the three species with 56 fish caught.  Although most of the Pumpkinseed were less than 7.5 inches in length, there was a 9.2-inch individual caught, indicating potential to produce quality size fish. <br> \n       All three species of bullhead were sampled in the spring assessment.  Yellow Bullhead was the most abundant of the species and the second most abundant fish species in the assessment after Bluegill.  A total of 235 Yellow Bullhead were netted ranging from 9 to 13.9 inches in length with a mean length of 11.7 inches.  Almost a third of the Yellow Bullhead were from 12 to 13 inches in length.   <br> \n       Additional fish species sampled in the 2014 panfish assessment were 40 Bowfin, two Common Carp, one Largemouth Bass, and four Yellow Perch. <br> \n       There had been rumors that Platte Lake had a partial winterkill in 2013 \u0013 2014, however, no carcasses were found after ice-out and no dead fish were reported by the public.  Platte Lake does have a broad connection with Sullivan Lake and fish are known to migrate between the lakes.  </p>",

Abundance remained high and average size small despite the experimentalregulation currently in place.  If this trend continues, adverse impacts to therest of the fish community may occur, including:  degradation of the existingquality bluegill population, depression of the yellow perch population, and failureof walleye fry stockings.  Walleye abundance has remained stable but low despiteannual fry stocking since 1978.  Platte Lake produces quality bluegill fishing yearround.  Bluegill numbers continued to increase in this assessment and should bemonitored closely.  If numbers continue to increase, growth may slow and qualitymay decline.  Large size crappies are occasionally caught with individuals to 2pounds reported.  Platte Lake has a reputation for producing trophy size largemouthbass and is a popular lake for tournaments.  Angler reports of largemouth over 6pounds were recently documented.  1993 spring-out netting also showed the presenceof larger bass, 10 bass of the 25 sampled were over 17\".  Shoreline development hasnot increased substantially on Platte Lake.  The shallow nature (98% littoral) andpresence of wild rice on the lake provide conditions highly desirable forwaterfowl.</p>",

Gillnet catches plunged from 7.1 numbers and 4.85 lbs./net in 1980 to 2.6 number and 3.74 lbs./net in 1985.  This is due to the highly successful large fry stockings of 1978 and 1979 (1.5 and 1.1 million).  Climatic conditions may also have played a part in lower catch rates.  Better catches were all related to the deeper net sets.  Fewer NORTHERN PIKE with a larger average size were taken in this survey.  The catch may have been lower due to climatic conditions but is still high.  BULLHEAD catches remain low.  BLUEGILL and  BLACK CRAPPIE catches were up and looked good in N.R.C.\"s . LARGEMOUTH BASS and YELLOW PERCH looked good in small sizes in 400' N.R.C. but did not show well in passive gear.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>        Platte Lake is a large, shallow lake in the NE corner of Morrison County on the Crow Wing County line.  The lake has a broad connection to Sullivan Lake which allows both boaters and fish to move between the two lakes.  Platte Lake has extensive beds of both submergent and emergent vegetation.  Coontail and flatstem pondweed were the most abundant submergent species and grew to a depth of 10.5 feet.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are located around the lake and the lake association has placed marker buoys around some of the stands to discourage boaters from fragmenting them.  Bulrush is not only an important fish habitat, the species also helps to minimize shoreline erosion by absorbing wave energy.  Wild rice was common in the shallow bays on the west and north sides of the lake.   Sand was the most common shallow water substrate.   Lake characteristics such as shallowness of the basin, presence of abundant vegetation, and infrequent low oxygen periods makes the lake better suited to support a fish community dominated by bullheads, crappies, and northern pike.\n        Platte Lake has a reputation as having an abundance of small northern pike.  While most of the pike captured in the summer survey were between 18 and 21 inches, fish over 35 inches or 10 pounds have been documented in spring assessments as well as harvested by spearers.  Though not known as a walleye lake, there appears to be a variety of sizes available to anglers.  Average size in the survey was 22 inches or 4 pounds, and anglers also have the opportunity to catch trophy size fish over 28 inches. Occasional fry stocking, natural reproduction and immigration from Sullivan Lake sustains the population.  Platte Lake has excellent largemouth bass habitat as evidenced by the high electrofishing catch.  Although, the average size was about 11 inches, some trophy size bass up to 20 inches have been observed.  Yellow perch abundance was normal when compared to similar type lakes and a variety of sizes were present in the survey.  While most anglers feel perch can be a nuisance when fishing, they can be a principal prey species for northern pike and walleye. \n        Bluegill abundance showed a significant drop since the last survey while black crappie numbers increased.  Most of the fish of both species were small, although, there were some bluegill over 7 inches and black crappie over 9 inches.  There were also rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish caught in the summer survey.  Some of the pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also over 7 inches in length.  \n        All three species of bullhead, black, brown, and yellow, are present in Platte Lake.  Yellow bullhead was the most numerous and showed an increase in abundance along with the brown bullhead.  Yellow bullhead can be an indicator species of good water quality as they are less tolerant of turbid water than black bullhead.  Black bullhead numbers were down significantly since the last survey.  Average size for all three species was over 10 inches with some individuals over 12 inches.  Bowfin or dogfish abundance was normal when compared to similar type lakes.  Catching one can provide an exciting fishing experience.  \n        While some of the submergent vegetation beds can be a nuisance for boaters, they provide important fish habitat, filter nutrients from the water, and help to protect the shorelines from erosion.  Maintaining healthy vegetation stands of native species helps prevent the establishment and spread of less desirable species. \n   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fall night electrofishing was conducted on both Platte and Sullivan Lakes following spring walleye fry stocking.  Walleye are considered a secondary management species for Platte Lake.  The lake management plan for Platte Lake includes fry stocking in the odd-numbered years same as Sullivan Lake.  The 2011 walleye fry were marked with Oxytetracycline to evaluate the relative contribution of fry stocking and natural reproduction in Platte and Sullivan Lakes.   <br> \n     The walleye population in Platte Lake appears to be sustained by occasional fry stocking, natural reproduction, and immigration from Sullivan Lake.  However, despite a history of annual fry stocking from 1978 to 1993, and 1995 to 1997 after winterkills, and 2002, 2004, and 2007, walleye gill nets catch rates have been disappointing.  The survey in 1980 recorded the highest gill net catch, 7.1/GN, for Platte Lake.  The majority of walleye (~92%) were age 3 and younger, suggesting that spring conditions were good for survival of one to two year classes of fry.  The other gill net catches in the time frame of annual stocking averaged 2.3/GN.  Since the 1997 survey, walleye gill net catches have been less than or equal to 1.8/GN.  The 1.8/GN catch rate (2004) was below the 25% quartile of 3.2/GN for lake class 41, but met the management goal of having a walleye catch from 1 - 4 per gill net.   <br> \n      Only one young of year walleye was netted in the 2011 electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 2.7/hour.   One electrofishing run was conducted around the island and the young of year netted on the west side.  Walleye fry stocking has rarely been evaluated in Platte Lake other than in 1996 and by summer gill net catches.  No young of year were netted or observed in the 1996 fall electrofishing.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Platte Lake has a reputation for providing a good winter bluegill fishery and \"hammerhandle\" northern pike.  Maximum depth of the lake is only about 23 feet and extensive vegetation beds, both emergent and submergent, can be found around the lake.  Much of the north shore is charaterized by floating bog and shrub/sedge swamps. The lake characteristics such as shallowness of the basin, presence of abundant vegetation, and infrequent low oxygen periods makes the lake better suited to support a fish community dominated by bullheads, crappies, and northern pike.  Platte Lake shares a wide connection to Sullivan Lake under County Road 51.  Boat traffic between the lakes is dictated by water levels and clearance under the road bridge.    While northern pike abundance did show a decline from the last survey, numbers continue to be high.  And despite a slight improvement in length and weight from the last survey, the pike are still small by anglers standards averaging 19 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Bluegills showed an increase in abundance with an average size of 5.5 inches.  A few larger bluegills up to 8 inches were observed but would be probably be a rare catch.  Two other panfish species in Platte Lake are black crappies and pumpkinseeds.  Crappie abundance appears normal for the lake type while pumpkinseed numbers were high.  Average size of the crappies was about 8 inches while the pumpkinseeds averaged only about 5 inches in length.  Crappies up to 11 inches have been documented in past surveys.  The black crappie catches were much higher in the 1997 and 1993 surveys suggesting that the population may be cyclic in abundance.     Finding a walleye in Platte Lake could be a challenge, but may be worth the effort as the average size seen in the survey was an impressive 22 inches.  Walleye numbers did show an improvement from the last survey but continue to be low for the lake type.  Despite almost annual walleye stocking in previous years until 1997, net catches have always been low.  The current walleye population is sustained through natural reproduction in the lake, immigration from Sullivan Lake, and an occasional spring fry stocking.  Largemouth bass are another gamefish species which could provide a memorable fishing trip.  While the average size appears to be around 12 inches, trophy size bass up to 20 inches have been observed in previous surveys and reported by anglers.  All three species of bullheads were sampled in the survey with the black bullhead being the most common.  Despite the abundance of black bullhead, their numbers remain within the normal range when compared to similar lake types.  Brown bullhead numbers were also within their normal range while yellow bullheads were high.  Average size of the bullheads was between 9 and 10 inches although some larger bullheads up to 12 were observed.      Other species of the fish community include yellow perch and bowfin or dogfish.  Yellow perch numbers were down from the last survey and are low for the lake type which may be the result of high pike numbers.  An abundant perch population is desirable to maintain good growth in the gamefish populations and they have also been found to help maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The NORTHERN PIKE population consists of very high numbers of small individuals for this lake class.  Gillnet catches were significantly higher (up 105%) than the previous assessment. Growth rates, however, are normal for northern pike and the low average size is due to a large number of young individuals in our samples.  More than half of the pike sampled were age II or younger.Gillnet catches of WALLEYE continue to be low for this lake class and have decreased by 38% since the previous assessment.  This decrease is statistically significant, but the low sample size prevents assessing the biological importance of this change.  Six year classes were presented in our samples with no particularly dominant year classes.  Natural reproduction has not been identified by shoreline seining and annual fry stocking since  1978 prevents evaluation of natural reproduction by age analysis.The BLACK CRAPPIE catch, size and growth is average for this lake class.  The age distribution of black crappie, however, appears poor.  Only three year classes were collected in July and the 1987 year class comprised 81% of the catch.  Crappie young-of-the-year were well represented during shoreline seining, however, in numbers similar to the 1985 assessment.The BLUEGILL population consists of high numbers of small individuals for this lake class.  Five year classes were represented in the catch, but the 1987 year class comprised 54% of the catch.  Growth was normal for all year classes except for the 1987 year class which was poor.YELLOW PERCH catch rate is low and size average for this lake.  The gillnet catch is down 57% from the last assessment.  This decrease is statistically significant, but the low sample size prevents assessing the biological importance of this change. Seven year classes were represented during this survey.LARGEMOUTH BASS are present, but electrofishing needs to be conducted to evaluate the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Platte Lake is a large, relatively shallow lake on the Morrison/Crow Wing County line.  The lake supports extensive vegetation beds that provide habitat for a diverse fish community.   A broad channel connects Platte Lake with Sullivan Lake and navigation was improved when a new highway bridge was raised to accommodate boat traffic.  The new bridge was also designed to accommodate shore fishing.  Platte Lake has experienced partial winterkills in recent years which affect some fish species more than others.  Most species recover on their own after any winterkill, fish also migrate in from Sullivan Lake.  The Platte Lake Association monitors oxygen levels and has a permit to operate a bubbler system which keeps an area ice free, allowing oxygen to enter the water column during harsh winters.  <br> \n     Platte Lake is best known for its year-round Bluegill fishery.  Anglers report that six to seven inch Bluegill are common and sampling results from both spring and summer assessments documented the presence of fish nine inches and larger.   Assessments also documented the presence of nicer Black Crappie up to 13 inches, but most anglers will have a tough time finding fish exceeding nine inches.  Platte Lake is well suited to producing an abundance of small Northern Pike with its dense vegetation beds and periodic low oxygen levels.   Most of the pike observed in the summer survey were from 18 to 23 inches in length.  Walleye fry are stocked in odd-numbered years and Walleye numbers appear to have improved since the last survey in 2009.  It was also reported that 2014 was a good year for catching the state fish.  Another game fish anglers can find in Platte Lake is Largemouth Bass.  Although not abundant, sampling has shown a decent population size structure where bass over 13 inches comprise a significant portion of the population and trophy size fish over 18 inches are present.   Yellow Perch numbers continue to be low which could affect growth rates in game fish.  While many anglers consider perch a nuisance while fishing, the species can be an important food fish for Northern Pike and Walleye.   Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced Bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.   For any angler seeking bullheads, Platte Lake is a good lake to start.  All three species, Black, Brown, and Yellow, are present.  Brown Bullhead was the most abundant in the summer survey and Yellow Bullhead in the spring assessment.  Quality size fish over 13 inches of all three species were observed.  While Common Carp are present, abundance does not appear to be at a level detrimental to the lake.  Bowfishing for carp has been an increasingly popular sport.  White Sucker and Bowfin (Dogfish) were two additional fish species found in the lake. <br> \n      While aquatic vegetation beds can be a nuisance for boaters, they provide important fish habitat, filter nutrients from the water, and help to protect the shorelines from erosion. Maintaining healthy vegetation stands of native species helps prevent the establishment and spread of less desirable species.  The Platte Lake Association recognizes the value of the bulrush beds and has placed marker buoys around some of the stands to discourage boaters from degrading the stands. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Platte Lake was surveyed using 12 gill nets on July 6-10, 2020. Species targeted were Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. Additionally, Bluegill were targeted in June using electrofishing rather than trap nets (standard protocol) due to Covid-19 work precautions.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike fishery can be described as one that has increased to a population density above desired levels. Gill net captures in 2020 were at their highest since 1997. There has however been a consistent presence of occasional large pike. Management goals are to maintain a pike population that doesn't get too abundant as this can be problematic to the entire fish community. Platte Lake has the potential to produce large (greater than 34 inches) pike but at this time, the proportion of large fish is lower than we'd like to see. Anglers choosing to release the largest pike they catch can help contribute to improving the future quality of the pike fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are sustained in Platte Lake through a combination of stocking and natural reproduction. Abundance has been fairly consistent since 2003, perhaps slightly increasing. At this time, numbers are within management goals but slightly below average compared to other lakes similar to Platte. The most notable aspect of the 2020 survey data pertaining to Walleyes was the proportion of large fish caught (25 inches and larger). This went from zero in 2014 to 19%. In other words, there should be some very large Walleyes available to catch in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, a primary prey species for pike and Walleye, have declined over the last 20 years in our gill nets and are currently at an all-time low. As often is the case, we see this trend when there is an increase in predator abundance, especially Northern Pike. Pike (especially smaller ones) can out-compete Walleye and are less selective in their prey preference. Large pike however, may not compete as directly with Walleye which is why management objectives strive for low-density pike populations comprised of more large fish than small ones.  <br> \n <br> \nPlatte Lake supports a Bluegill population with good potential to become a high-quality fishery. As such, a special 10-fish bag limit for Bluegill was put into place in 2016. Since then, trap netting and electrofishing have been used to evaluate population size structure. Harvest regulations often take 10 years to achieve intended gains in average Bluegill sizes. At this time, measurable changes are not evident as the proportion of fish over 8 inches remains at about 5%. Evaluations will continue in the future. While fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of the large individuals, especially the males. Large males exhibit the best growth characteristics and also discourage the behavior of smaller, slower growing males from spawning. Studies show that it's important for sunfish to use their energy for body growth rather than gonadal development at a young age and small size. Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their more pronounced coloration and darker orange breast. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed June 5-7 to provide data on the Bluegill size structure and evaluate effects of a 10 fish bag limit on sunfish which was implemented on March 1, 2016. This assessment was also used to examine the impacts of winterkill which occurred during the winter of 2022-23.  Spring trap netting in 2023 captured only 56 Bluegill all of which were measured. Spring sample sizes in the past ranged from 236-305 fish. The low catch in 2023 likely indicates a population decline induced by winterkill conditions. The small sample size makes it inappropriate to compare size structure data to past spring trap net assessments or to assess progress towards management goals. Bluegill in 2023 ranged from 4.4 to 8.7 inches and mean length was 6.7 inches.  Several sizes of Bluegill were present including spawning size adults. The broad connection with Sullivan Lake also allows easy immigration suggesting the Bluegill population has the strong likelihood of a rapid rebound. The remaining Bluegill may also display improved growth rates due to less competition. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and may not reflect actual changes in abundance. Spring trap net catches in the lake have ranged from 27 to 54 fish. A total of 27 crappies were captured in 2023 ranging in size from 5.4 to 12.2 inches, mean length was 8.2 inches.  Crappie are not as sensitive to winterkill events and were probably less impacted than Bluegill. Aging from otoliths in 2023 showed that crappie growth was slow compared to most area lakes with Age 5 fish averaging less than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also fairly resistant to winterkill and 47 pike were captured in the 2023 trap nets. Pike ranged from 9.8 to 26 inches long with 26% within the 22-26 inch slot range. Three adult Walleye were observed, however whether they survived the winterkill or migrated from Sullivan Lake is unknown.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2023 to aid in the recovery of the Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",
