Sunset park encompases the entire lake and has amenities such as a playground, picnic shelters, and a walking path around the entire lake.  The south end of the basin is quite shallow, although fishing in front of the storm culverts is common.  The north end of the lake reaches a depth of 11 feet.  Bluegill were the most common species sampled in 2002.  The majority of bluegill sampled were between 5.0 and 6.0 inches.  Northern pike (NOP) were sampled in higher than average numbers.  Sizes of NOP ranged from 16.6 inches to 25.7 inches, with approximately 50% between 20 and 24 inches.  Largemouth bass were present, but small.  Average size for largemouth bass sampled was 6.5 inches.  Other fish sampled included hybrid sunfish, green sunfish and black crappie.  The Fishing in the Neighborhood Program has proposed to stock Sunset Pond with bluegill and crappie in the spring of 2003.</p>",

Two water control structures and a lakeside gazebo also offer places to fish.  Because the lake is very shallow, vegetation can make shorefishing difficult, especially by mid-summer.  The shallow, heavily vegetated nature of the lake also makes it subject to winterkill.  The lake is re-stocked after severe winterkills, and fish also re-colonize from upstream lakes.  No motors, including electric, are allowed on the lake, and no boating is allowed in the south half of the lake to protect waterfowl. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in moderate to high numbers during this assessment.  Average bluegill length was just under 6 inches.  Black crappies were found in low numbers and were less than 8 inches.  Northern pike were moderately abundant.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 14 to 27 inches, with a 23-inch average.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers and were small: up to 10 inches.  Bullheads are also present in moderate numbers. <br> \n</p>",
