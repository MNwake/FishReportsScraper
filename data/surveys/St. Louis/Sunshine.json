NOP SIZE STRUCTURE IS EXCELLENT WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 24.1 INCHES AND 41% OF THE FISH IN OUR SAMPLE LONGER THAN 28.0 INCHES.  NOP GROWTH RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN THE AREA MEANS FOR ALL ANNULI, WITH FISH REACHING 25.0 INCHES IN LENGTH BY AGE III. ALTHOUGH LMB SIZE STRUCTURE FROM THE GILLNET SAMPLE WAS RELATIVELY POOR, REPORTS FROM RESIDENT ANGLERS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF BASS LARGER THAN THREE POUNDS.  LMB GROWTH RATES WERE SLOW, WITH FISH REACHING 12.0 INCHES IN LENGTH AT AGE VIII. YEP GILLNET CATCH RATES WERE THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE MEDIAN FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND SIZE STRUCTURE WAS GOOD WITH MEAN LENGTH OF 8.8 INCHES AND 29% OF THE SAMPLED FISH LONGER THAN 10.0 INCHES.  YEP EXHIBITED SLOW GROWTH, NOT REACHING 8.0 INCHES UNTIL AGE VII.  BLG AND HSF CATCH RATES WERE BOTH WELL ABOVE MEDIAN FOR THIS LAKE CLASS. SIZE STRUCTURE FOR BLG SAMPLED IN BOTH GILL AND TRAPNETS WAS GOOD WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 6.9 INCHES AND 82% OF THE FISH SAMPLED LONGER THAN 6.0 INCHES.  HSF SIZE STRUCTURE WAS ALSO GOOD WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 6.9 INCHES AND 88% OF THE FISH SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS LONGER THAN 6.0 INCHES. GROWTH RATES FOR BOTH BLG AND HSF WERE VERY SLOW. BLG DID NOT EXCEED 6.0 INCHES IN LENGTH UNTIL AGE IX, WHILE HSF EXCEEDED 6.0 INCHES DURING THEIR EIGHTH YEAR OF GROWTH.</p>",
