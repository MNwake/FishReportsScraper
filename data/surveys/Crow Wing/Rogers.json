                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is a 219 acre lake located six miles south of Emily in Crow Wing County.  Rogers reaches depths of 64 feet, with 38% of the lake 15 feet or shallower.   Water quality was good with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet.   A DNR public access is located on the west end of the lake.  The 2013 survey found 45 homes/cabins along 2.5 miles of shoreline.  An aquatic vegetation survey found 30 species of submerged and emergent vegetation.    Robbins pondweed, water celery, and large-leaf pondweed were the most commonly found species.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality and vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nRogers Lake is one of four lakes in the Brainerd area that have special regulations on crappies and sunfish.  On these lakes anglers may keep five daily of each species.  This regulation was implemented in 2005 and is intended to provide a quality fishery for crappies and sunfish.  Black crappies were caught in average numbers at 1.0/gillnet and 1.4/trapnet.   Fish eight inches and over accounted for 79% of the catch.  Bluegills were caught in average numbers at 31.0/trapnet.  Average size was nice at 7.2 inches, with 62% over 7 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nThe northern pike catch was average at 6.8/gillnet.  Past catches have ranged from 5.0 to 8.7/gillnet.  Average size was 21.3 inches and 2.9 lbs, which was up from the 2008 survey's average of 18.9 inches and 1.8 lbs.  Seven year classes were present with two and three year old fish making up 63% of the catch.  There were several nice northern pike sampled including fish up to 38.3 inches.  Fish 24 inches and larger made up 40% of the catch.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help keep a balanced northern population.   <br> \n</p>",

On these lakes anglers may keep five fish daily of each of those species.  This regulation was implemented in 2005 and is intended to provide a quality fishery for crappies and sunfish.  Black crappies were caught in average numbers (1.7/trap net) in 2019 when compared to similar lakes.   Average size was 9.7\" and all of the fish were 8\" or larger.  Fish up to 12.8\" were captured.  Bluegills were caught in average numbers as well at 17.9/trap net.  Average size was nice at 7.2\", with 66% measuring 7\" or larger.  One 8.6\" bluegill that was aged was 11 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was average at 7.3/gill net.  Average length was 20.5\" and fish above the 22\"-26\" protected slot accounted for 21% of the catch.  There were several nice northern pike sampled including fish up to 36.3 inches.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass electrofishing was not completed in 2019, but gill net numbers were above average for this type of lake (2.0/net) and trap net numbers were average (1.1/net).  Size was small, with fish ranging from 6.0\" to 13.3\". <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, walleye, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Mean length was 7.5\", with 71% measuring 7\" or larger.  This also met our goal of 25% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch was a little above our goal (2.2/trap net) at 4.1/trap net and up from the 2010 special assessment (3.4/trap net).  Mean length was 10.3\", with 68% of the fish measuring 9\" or larger and 9% measuring 12\" or larger.  This met our goal of 25% measuring at least 9\" and 5% at least 12\". <br> \n <br> \nNo aging structures were taken from either crappies or bluegills until the summer survey in July. <br> \n</p>",

The primary interest in this sampling is length frequency and though catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is reported, comparisons across years should be made cautiously due to the variability inherent in spring sampling.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 bluegill catch of 25.8/trap net was up from the previous netting in 2013 (17.3/trap net).  Average length was 7.0\", with 54% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger.  This number was 71% in the previous survey.  Fish ranged in size from 3.7\" to 8.7\". <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch of 2.1/trap net was down from the 2013 survey (4.1/trap net).  Average length was 10.0\", with 91% of the fish measuring 9\" or larger and 7% measuring 12\" or larger.  Fish ranged in size from 5.0\" to 13.2\". <br> \n <br> \nGrowth data from previous surveys indicate that 8\" bluegills are, at least, 8 years old and it takes roughly 6 years to grow a 10\" crappie.  Conservative harvest of these larger panfish will help maintain quality panfish angling opportunities.</p>",

The average size of the northerns sampled was small, although some fish were sampled up to 34.9 inches long. Growth is slow for Rogers Lake.  The bluegill population is smaller than in 1984, but larger than in 1980. The size structure is relatively good with 70 of the 291 fish sampled greater than 7.0 inches. Growth is slow. The bluegill population in Rogers Lake consists of a large number of old, slow-growing fish. The yellow perch population has declined significantly since adults were stocked in 1982 and 1983. The gillnet CPUE in 1984 was 7.7, while declining to 0.5 in 1987.  Only one walleye was sampled during the survey. The yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and black crappie populations are average for the lake group, while the bowfin and brown bullhead populations are low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is 219 acres and is located about six miles southeast of Emily in Crow Wing County.  Maximum depth is 64' and 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand with areas of gravel and rock-rubble present as well.  A relatively diverse aquatic plant community is present.  Aquatic plants are essential to maintain a clean and healthy natural ecosystem and support a diverse and balanced fish community.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes were stocked sporadically, as fry and fingerlings, in the mid-1960's and mid-1980's.  Rogers Lake is currently part of a statewide MN DNR walleye research study designed to evaluate different stocking methods and was stocked in 2001 with 83lbs (1,577 fish) of walleye fingerlings.  The 2001 walleye catch of 0.3/gill net is below average when compared to similar lakes, but similar to past catches for this lake.  Average length and weight were 24.9\" and 4.8lbs, respectively.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers at 5.8/gill net.  Previous catches have ranged from 6.2 to 8.6/gill net.  Fish were generally small with an average length and weight of 16.9\" and 1.2lbs, respectively.Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers at 1.2/trap net.  Past catches have ranged from 0 to 3.2/trap net.  About 21% of all largemouth bass measured were 12\" or larger, compared to 13% in 1987.Black crappie abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes.  About 60% of all crappies measured were 8\" or larger, compared to 81% in 1987.  The bluegill catch of 3.7/trap net was below average.  Past catches have ranged from 11.7 to 136.0/trap net.  Average weight was 0.23lbs and 27% of trap netted bluegills were 7\" or larger, which is similar to 1987.Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch abundance was below average for the second consecutive netting at 0.2/gill net.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 7.7/gill net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is a 219 acre lake located about six miles southeast of Emily in Crow Wing County.  The lake is moderately developed. The maximum depth is 64' and 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand with areas of gravel and rock-rubble present as well. A relatively diverse aquatic plant community is present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are common along portions of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Walleyes have been stocked sporadically as fry and fingerlings in the mid 1960's and mid 1980's.  Rogers Lake is currently part of a statewide MN DNR walleye research study designed evaluate different stocking methods and was stocked in 2001 with 83lbs (1,577 fish) of walleye fingerlings and in 2003 with 106,450 fry.  Past catches have been low and no walleyes were sampled in 2004.Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2004 at 5.2/gill net.  Previous catches ranged from 5.8 to 8.7/gill net. Average length and weight increased slightly from 16.9\" and 1.2 lbs in 2001 to 18.6\" and 1.7 lbs in 2004.  Growth was average with 13% of these fish measuring at least 24\". Largemouth bass were sampled in above average numbers at 4.0/trap net and 3.2/gill net.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 36.9/hr.  Average length of these fish was 12.1\" with 66% measuring at least 12\".The 2004 bluegill catch of 19.8/trap net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Growth was slow.  Black crappie abundance was typical for this lake with average growth.  Yellow perch are important as forage for the lake's game fish.  Past catches tend to be below average.  No fish were sampled in 2004.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is a 219 acre lake located about six miles southeast of Emily in Crow Wing County.  The lake is moderately developed. The maximum depth is 64' and 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand with areas of gravel and rock-rubble present as well. A relatively diverse aquatic plant community is present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are common along portions of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked sporadically as fry and fingerlings in the mid 1960's and mid 1980's.  Rogers Lake is currently part of a statewide MN DNR walleye research study designed to evaluate different stocking methods.  Rogers was stocked in 2001 with 83 lbs (1,577 fish) of walleye fingerlings, in 2003 with 106,450 fry, and in 2005 with 42l bs (538 fish).  Past catches have been low and only 2 walleyes were sampled in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers in 2008 at 6.8/gill net.  Previous catches ranged from 5.0 to 8.7/gill net. Average length and weight decreased from 21.8\" and 3.0 lbs in 2006 to 18.9\" and 1.8 lbs in 2008 with 24% measuring 24\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in average numbers at 1.3/trap net and 1.5/gill net.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 80/hr in 2008 compared to 37/hr in 2004.  Average length of these fish was 10.4\" with 25% measuring at least 12\". <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 bluegill catch of 24.1/trap net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Black crappie abundance was typical for this lake.  No yellow perch were caught in 2008, which is typical of recent surveys.   <br> \n</p>",

The regulations call for a possession limit of 5 on both crappie and sunfish.  Trap netting is done every third spring on Rogers in order to monitor the effects of the regulations. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 bluegill catch of 21.6/trap net was down from the previous netting in 2016 (25.8/trap net).
