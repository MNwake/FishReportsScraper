                "narrative": "<p>Jay Gould Lake is a 426-acre lake located 2 miles south of Cohasset, MN.  The lake is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 33 ft and a littoral area of 292 acres.  Jay Gould Lake is part of a chain of lakes including Little Jay Gould, Pokegama Lake and the Mississippi River.  Navigation by boat is possible between all lakes.  The lake has a public access on the south shore.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net catch was high at 11.2/net and was similar to the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments were lower and varied from 4.1 to 9.8/net.  Although size structure was generally poor, a few fish up to 35 inches were sampled.  An increase in northern pike abundance is a concern on Jay Gould Lake, since increasing abundance generally leads to a decrease in size structure.  The trend is likely a reflection of overharvest of larger fish.  Larger northern pike help to control the abundance of smaller northern pike through predation, which results in faster growth rates and better size structure.  Anglers can help to improve size structure by harvesting fish less than 24 inches and releasing larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch was 3.3/net and was similar to the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill net catch rates have historically been moderate and have varied from 3.0 to 4.6/net in the last three assessments.  Size structure was excellent with fish up to 28 inches sampled.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked in 2004 and 2006.  Walleye were present from ages one to seven with no differences in stocked vs non stocked years.  Six of the 30 walleye sampled were ages 11 to 13 indicating a long-lived population.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 18 inches by age five.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 13.0/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Historical catch rates have varied between 20.0 and 31.4/gill net in the last three assessments.  Size structure was poor with only one fish exceeding 9 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish reaching 7.7 inches at age 6, compared to 9.3 inches for the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by nighttime electrofishing in May of 2007.  The catch rate was 32.5/hour, indicating a moderately abundant population compared to area lakes.  Electrofishing conducted in 1997 sampled 9.1/fish/hr.  Size structure was good with fish up to 17 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 15.6 inches in seven years.  In addition to largemouth, two smallmouth bass between 15 and 16 inches were sampled by spring electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in low numbers with a gill net catch rate of 1.1/net and a trap net catch rate of 0.2/net.  Historically, catch rates have also been low, only reaching the lower end of the expected range of 1.0/gill net, once before. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Jay Gould is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pokegama, Little Jay Gould, Blackwater Lake and the Mississippi River.  Water levels are controlled by the Pokegama Dam on the Mississippi River.  Aquatic vegetation is abundant and provides good habitat for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish.  Past surveys have documented some quality size Bluegill, but overall numbers have been low.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring panfish surveys are conducted to document and monitor size quality.  The spring 2019 targeted survey was conducted to obtain better information on the status of Bluegill in the lake and was the second spring survey on Jay Gould.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 399 Bluegill were captured.  The DNR panfish technical committee has defined exceptional size quality as having at least 10% of sampled Bluegill exceeding 8 inches with 9 inch or larger fish present.  The previous spring survey of Jay Gould indicated exceptional size quality.  Size structure remained exceptional in 2019 as 37% exceeded 8 inches and fish over 10 inches were present.  Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 10.9 inches with an average length of 7.7 inches.  Ages 3 through 12 were represented, indicating frequent year class production.  A majority of the sample was age 5 or older, which may suggest low adult mortality or limited recruitment in recent years.  Growth was near the lake class average, with fish averaging 7.3 inches after 7 years. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed are another common sunfish but are less popular with anglers because they generally do not grow as large as Bluegill.  Pumpkinseed Sunfish were captured in lower numbers than Bluegill.  Size structure was favorable, with fish ranging from 3.5 to 8.7 inches and an average length of 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nJay Gould appears to provide good angling opportunities for sunfish, given the quality size structure and age distribution.  The high proportion of older individuals suggests that low adult mortality contributes to better numbers of large fish.  High quality Bluegill populations risk size quality decline due to angler harvest of large sunfish.  Anglers should be encouraged to limit harvest of larger sunfish to maintain fishing quality.  The DNR panfish technical committee recommends using reduced bag limits to help maintain size quality on lakes with biological potential for large sunfish and documented public support.  Jay Gould Lake was included in a proposal for a 5 sunfish bag limit in 2011, but there was insufficient public support to implement a regulation change at that time.  Since then, public support for sunfish regulations has increased and Jay Gould Lake is once again being considered for a reduced bag limit. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet.  Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 19 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 18.1?C (64.6?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1974-2015 indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1990. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jay Gould Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  Walleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate that was higher than in past assessments and above the expected range for this type of lake.  They had a mean length of 15.9 inches and a mean weight of 1.6 pounds.  Growth rates appear to be above average for younger fish and near average for fish over three years old.  Most of the fish sampled were from non-stocked years suggesting that natural reproduction, not stocking, has been providing most of the walleye in the lake.     Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate that was higher than in past assessments but within the expected range for this type of lake.  Northern pike had a mean length of 16.9 inches and a mean weight of 1.1 pounds.     Largemouth bass from 4.5 to 19.6 inches were sampled.  The trap net catch rate was within the expected range for this type of lake.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets within the expected range.  Lengths of these bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 9.1 inches, with a mean of 6.1 inches.  Some larger bluegill were also collected in gill nets.  These bluegill ranged from 3.9 to 9.3 inches, with an average of 8.0 inches.    Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets above the expected  range.  The length of these fish ranged from 4.9 to 12.2 inches.  The high abundance of yellow perch may be partly responsible for the abundance of walleye as they are an important component in the walleye diet.     Jay Gould Lake is unique in that fish from the Mississippi River have access to it.  Because of this, the lake is home to many species.  Other species caught in 1997 include: banded killifish, black crappie, bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, emerald shiner, Johnny darter, log perch, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom, tullibee, and white sucker.     Water quality analyses indicate that Jay Gould Lake has a higher than expected phosphorus level.  Lakeshore owners can do their part to improve water quality and maintain the diversity of species in the lake by reducing lawn fertilization and protecting shoreline vegetation that is important for water quality and as fish and wildlife habitat.</p>",

Water levels are controlled by the Pokegama Dam on the Mississippi River.  Jay Gould supports a variety of species of aquatic vegetation with good habitat for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish.  Due to its connection to the Mississippi River and other lakes in the chain, a number of other fish species are also found in Jay Gould.  The 2008 lake management plan listed Walleye and Yellow Perch as primary management species, with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in August 2015 to assess the status of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class but lower than previous surveys.  Annual fingerling stocking for the past nine years did not appear to appreciably increase the Walleye population.  Past surveys documented higher Walleye catch rates, attributed to natural reproduction, migration and fry stocking.  Walleye sampled in 2015 ranged from 8.7 to 24.8 inches with an average length of 16.6 inches and an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  Eight year classes between age 1 and 11 were represented in the sample.  Average length of 18.0 inches at age 5 was similar to the statewide average (17.3). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in numbers above the typical range for this lake class.  A few large perch over 9 inches were sampled but overall size structure was poor.  Sampled fish varied from 5.2 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  The lack of larger perch could be the result of angler harvest.  Jay Gould has historically been a popular site for winter anglers targeting Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nJay Gould supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population.  Spring night electrofishing collected moderate numbers of bass averaging 13.8 inches and 1.8 pounds, with fish over 17 inches in the sample.  A balanced age distribution indicated consistent recruitment.  Mean length of 14.4 inches at age 6 was similar to the statewide average (15.1). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled below the typical range for this lake class.  Size structure was poor; pike averaged 19.6 inches with only nine percent of the sample exceeding 24 inches.  Recruitment of Northern Pike appeared consistent with ages 1-5 represented in the sample.  An average length of 20.6 inches at age 4 was similar to the statewide average (20.5).  The lack of pike over 24 inches and older than age 5 may be due to angler harvest.  Anglers can help improve the quality of the Northern Pike population by practicing selective harvest of smaller fish, while releasing medium to large fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain a more balanced fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class and higher than the previous survey.  Size structure was favorable for anglers as the majority of fish exceeded 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in numbers below the typical range for this lake class.  Size structure was fairly poor; Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches with only two Bluegill over 8 inches.  A couple of larger Bluegill were captured in the gill nets.  Recruitment appeared consistent with ages 1-7 represented in the sample.  An average length of 6.2 inches at age 5 exceeded the lake class average (5.0). <br> \n <br> \nCurly leaf pondweed, an aquatic invasive species, is found in the connecting waters of Blackwater Lake.  Boaters can prevent the spread of invasive species by removing all vegetation from their boat and trailer before moving from one waterbody to another. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jay Gould is a shallow, productive lake located near Cohasset, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Jay Gould is part of a chain of lakes including Pokegama, Little Jay Gould, Blackwater Lake and the Mississippi River.  Navigation by boat is possible among all the lakes in the chain.  The Pokegama Dam on the Mississippi River controls the water level for the chain. <br> \n <br> \nJay Gould supports a variety of species of aquatic vegetation with good habitat for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish.  Due to its connection to the Mississippi River and other lakes in the chain, a number of other fish species are found in Jay Gould.  Jay Gould is managed with a 5-sunfish bag limit implemented in 2021.  The 2016 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike as a primary management species, with Largemouth Bass and Walleye as secondary management species.  The goals were to have a gill-net catch less than 7.0 Northern Pike/net with 30 and 5 percent of the sample longer than 22 and 28 inches; a Walleye gill-net catch exceeding 3.0/net; and Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch higher than 20/hour.  A standard survey was conducted in August 2022 to assess the status of the fishery.  Bass electrofishing was not conducted due to the late spring and staff shortages. <br> \n <br> \nJay Gould is known for having a high Northern Pike population dominated by small fish.  These population attributes are not desirable because they also result in slow growth.  The 2022 catch of 6.3/gill net was higher than in 2015 but met the management goals.  Sampled pike ranged from 11.6 to 35.1 inches and averaged 20.5 inches.  Though the pike size distribution was the best ever observed and the goals were achieved, the population remains characterized by higher numbers of smaller fish.  Pike recruitment is generally consistent due to the abundance of spawning and nursery habitat.  Fish from age 1 to 9 were estimated from the sample.  Fish required four years of growth to average 22.0 inches.  The growth was similar to the statewide average (20.5).  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to not harvest fish over 26 inches to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch of 3.1/net achieved the management plan goal.  The catch was about average for Jay Gould and relatively high compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled Walleye varied from 10.3 to 24.1 inches and averaged 15.9 inches.  Nine ages were estimated with fish from age 1 and 11 represented.  Growth rates were good compared to the statewide average.  Fish averaged 17.2 inches after four years of growth.  The Walleye population likely provides a modest fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill-net catch of 49.5/net was the second highest catch ever recorded for Jay Gould.  A high proportion of the sample were less than 8 inches and only 4% were over 9 inches.  Sampled fish varied from 4.6 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  The lack of larger perch could be the result of angler harvest directed towards this species.  Jay Gould has historically been a popular site for winter anglers targeting Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches were low compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The nine crappie sampled ranged from 7.2 to 12.7 inches and averaged 9.5 inches.  Sample size was too low to make meaningful observations about size structure.  Fish ranging from age 2 to 6 were sampled.  Growth was relatively fast with fish averaging 9.5 inches after four years of growth.  Black Crappie likely provide modest fishing opportunities if anglers can locate them. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were lower (7.4/trap net) compared to other lakes similar to Jay Gould.  Size structure from the trap nets was poor, as only 5% of the Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Sampled fish ranged from 2.9 to 9.0 inches and averaged 4.9 inches.  Mid-summer trap netting often does not represent the Bluegill numbers or size very well.  Larger Bluegill were sampled in the gill nets with 32% exceeding 8 inches.  Regular recruitment was observed since ages 1 through 7 were represented in the sample.  Age-2 fish represented 55% of the summer sample.  Fish averaged 7.5 inches at age 5, which was faster than the lake class average (5.0).  Jay Gould can occasionally provide quality Bluegill fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurly leaf pondweed, an aquatic invasive species, is present in the connecting waters of Blackwater Lake.  Boaters can prevent the spread of invasive species by removing all vegetation from their boat and trailer before moving from one waterbody to another.</p>",
