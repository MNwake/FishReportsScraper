This small (16 acre) lake is undeveloped and surrounded by a densely forested shoreline of mixed coniferous and deciduous tree species. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a carry-down access located off CR 110 where a small boat or similar watercraft can be launched. The nearby parking area has space for several vehicles. No overnight campsites are present. <br> \n <br> \nFour species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey of Bird Lake. Black bullhead and black crappie dominated the catch. Low numbers of white sucker and one 20 inch walleye were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in 2018 were above average when compared to other similar lakes in the area where bullheads are present. Bullhead sizes were small and averaged approximately 6 inches long. The 2018 sample of black bullhead was the first time this species has been identified in Bird Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2018 (31.5/trap net) were above the long term average for Bird Lake (7.3/trap net) and above average (1.4/trap net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area where crappies are found. Crappie sizes averaged only 6.8 inches and the largest crappie sampled in 2018 measured 9.1 inches long.</p>",
