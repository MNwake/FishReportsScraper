Present fish population status:  Rough fish population remains below average in abundance except that Yellow Bullhead are at or above average in abundance.  Northern Pike abundance average and appears unchanged since 1971.  Six age classes were sampled with ages 4 and 6 most abundant.  Growth rate-good.  Walleye stocking in 1950, 1952, 1978, 1979. Only fish stocked in 1978 showed up in 1981 netting.  Other 3 age classes found resulted from natural reproduction, including the dominant yearling class.  Abundance-below average and growth appears good.  Yellow Perch abundance average and may have increased since 1971. No Yellow Perch sampled in shoreline seining  in 1980 or 1981-caught in 1971.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Camp Lake is located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake. It has a surface area of 108 acres and a maximum depth of 52 feet. A public access is located on the north end of the lake. Camp Lake is part of a statewide study of largemouth bass length limits and has been surveyed for bass by electrofishing every fall since 1996. The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and northern pike. The last full lake survey was in 1992 and a resurvey was conducted in summer 2002 to update information on the fishery. Largemouth bass are abundant in the lake. During fall electrofishing 132 bass were captured in 64 minutes, a catch rate well above average for the Montrose management area. Most adults were between 12 and 15 inches long; the largest bass was 19.5 inches and weighed 4.4 pounds. Northern pike numbers have increased since the last survey and their catch rate was above the normal range for this lake type. The average length (23 inches) and weight (3 pounds) were also desirable. Yellow perch are a favorite prey of northern pike and perch numbers have decreased, probably as a result of an increasing pike population. Perch size was in the expected range; average length was 7.1 inches and the largest perch was 10.2 inches.Black crappie numbers and size were below the expected range for lakes similar to Camp. The catch rate was low in both 1992 and 2002, but the average weight was higher in 1992. Mean length in 2002 was 7.3 inches and the largest individual was 9.7 inches.  Black crappie growth was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes. Fewer bluegill were caught than in 1992, but the catch rate was still within the expected range in 2002. The average length for bluegill was 5.7 inches and the largest fish was 7.6 inches.Camp Lake is not well suited for walleye and none have been stocked in the last twenty years. However, one walleye (24.8 inches) was caught in 2002. Other species captured during the survey included yellow bullhead, carp, golden shiner, green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Northern Pike catch of 0.7/gill net appears reduced significantly from the 1981 catch of 3.2/gill net. Only three fish were taken. Fish sampled were ages 3 and 4, in good condition, and displayed rapid growth. The Yellow Perch catch of 12.5/gill net is similar to the 10.0/gill net catch in 1981. Fish ranged in length from 5.5 - 9.4 inches, with a median length group of 7.0 - 7.4 inches. Catch of Walleye (1.7/lift) was similar to 1981 (2.2/lift). Abundance is average with reference to local netting median and age class distribution indicates limited natural reproduction. Fingerling stockings in 1978 and 1979 were not evident in the catch. Growth at ages 1 - 3 appears to be somewhat slow, but increases at age 4 and thereafter. Individuals examined appeared to be in good condition. There appears to be a significant decrease in Bluegill abundance as the catch has declined from 86.5/pot in 1981 to 21.2/pot in 1987. However, age data shows representation of years 1 - 6, with age 5 dominating. Growth rates are below average for years 1 - 3, but increase to an average rate from age 5 on. The median length group is 6.0 - 6.4 inches. Black crappie abundance (0.2/trap net) is similar to the 1981 catch, and is below the area median (lower quartile). Growth rates were average. Spring seining on Camp Lake yielded a catch of 83 Largemouth Bass in three hauls, (27.7fish/haul). Ages 2 and 3 fish were most abundant, with average corresponding lengths of 5.8 and 8.2 inches, respectively. Modal length group was 12.0 - 12.9 inches. A 20 inch plus Largemouth Bass was taken (estimated weight in excess of five pounds). Growth of Largemouth Bass was average but condition appeared to be excellent. Bullhead populations appear to be at low levels (Yellow Bullhead catch was 1.3/trap net). One large carp (estimated weight of 25 pounds) was taken during seining operations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Camp Lake is a 108 acre lake located southwest of Maple Lake in Wright County. There is a public access located on the northwest side of the lake. The lake has poor water quality and water clarity in August 2018 was three feet. Adequate dissolved oxygen was found to a depth of 12 feet during the week of the survey. Camp Lake has a small watershed that is predominantly agricultural. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation covered 11% of the lake and 86% of the shoreline during the summer survey dominated by cattail, white waterlily and yellow waterlily. Camp Lake is managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. A lake survey was conducted in 2018 to update fisheries information last collected in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye exist in low numbers due to private stocking that took place in 2013 and 2014. Walleye stocking was discontinued by DNR in 1979 due to low return in test sampling.  Fifteen Walleye were sampled in 2018 and ranged in length from 20 to 24 inches and averaged 22 inches and 3.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was lower than 2012, but within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Camp Lake. The average size of Northern Pike was above average and pike up to 40 inches were captured. The average length and weight was 27.4 inches and 5.1 pounds. Ninety percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and thirty percent were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing in mid-May. A total of 175 Largemouth Bass were captured in 0.8 hours of sampling effort. The catch in 2018 (216.4/hour) was more than five times greater than the area daytime average, but within the historical range for Camp Lake. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 19 inches with an average length of 12 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill abundance was the highest on record for Camp Lake and above the expected range. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3 to 9 with an average length just over five inches. The gill net and trap net catches of Black Crappie in 2018 were higher than 2012 above average for the lake. Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 6 to 14 inches with an average length of eight inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the surveys included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Camp Lake is located in Wright County, southwest of Maple Lake. The lake has a surface area of 123 acres and a maximum depth of 52 feet. The watershed is small and primarily agriculture, pasture, and wetland/lake. A public access with limited parking is located on the north end of the lake. Water quality was poor and algae limited water clarity to three feet. A total of 15 aquatic plant species were identified, including the invasive species Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed. Submergent plants grew to a depth of 10 feet. The last survey was in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were lower than in 2002, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Average length and weight were 24 inches and three pounds; the largest caught was 31 inches. Fifty-three percent of northern pike were longer than 24 inches. Most northern pike were three to five years old and growth was fast, reaching 25 inches in four years. Yellow perch are a favorite food for northern pike and were caught in higher numbers than previous surveys. Average length of yellow perch was 8 inches and the largest individual was over ten inches. It is unusual to find abundant yellow perch with good size structure in a lake where northern pike are relatively numerous and this likely accounts for fast northern pike growth. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were surveyed annually from 1996 to 2006 by night electrofishing in the fall as part of a research study. Daytime electrofishing was conducted in May 2012 and largemouth bass were more numerous than the average for other Montrose area lakes and the average for the research study. Average length in 2012 was 13 inches and the largest bass was 19 inches. Overall, largemouth bass in 2012 were larger and more numerous than during the 11 years of the research study. Anglers can help sustain the quality bass fishery by keeping smaller bass for a meal and releasing larger ones (>15 inches). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches have always been low in Camp Lake; the 2012 catch was no exception, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Average length was six inches and the largest individual was nine inches. Growth was fast, reaching six inches in the second year of growth <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes, but higher than in 2002. Mean length (five inches) and weight (0.1 lbs) were lower than previous surveys. The largest individual was eight inches. Growth was fast; bluegill reached five inches at age two and 91% of the fish aged were two years old. Other species captured included: common carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

Carp (0.33/set) were caught for the first time during this survey.  Catch rates of yeb and gos have remained relatively constant since the previous surveys, while blg catch, which was outside the third quartile in 1981 (86.50/set), was just above the first quartile (19.50/set) in 1992.  Blg catch rate and mean weight (0.19 lbs.) fell within expected levels for lake class 24. Growth rate for blg was also average, and five year classes of fish were captured during sampling (age ii-vi).  Yeb catch rate and mean weight (1.04 lbs.) fell above expected values for lake class 24.  Yeb ranged in length from 6 to 14 inches with most fish captured in the 13 inch length group.  Principal species captured in gill nets included: yeb (29.50/set), blg (18.75/set), wae (1.00/set), nop (0.75/set) and yep (14.80set). Catch rates for yeb, blg, wae, and yep have remained relatively constant over time, however, blc catch, usually close to the third quartile value of 13.25/set, was below the first quartile, at 1.30/set, during the 1992 survey.  The nop catch of 0.75/set was low for lakes class 24. Catch rates have historically not been greater than 3.25/set, and there was no significant change in catch rate from the previous assessment. Mean weight (3.50 lbs.) was high for lake class 24.  Only three year classes were caught (age I, ii, and vi) and fish ranged in size from 17 to 32 inches.  Growth rate for nop was average with fish reaching 30 inches or length in six years.  Wae catch, while low, fell within expected values for lake class 24.  Wae catch historically has remained below 2.25 fish per set.  The mean weight of wae was high (4.60 lbs.), and fish ranged in length from 22.0 to 26.0 inches. Growth rate was fast, up until age iii, then became average.  All six wae sampled were age ix or x.  Wae stocking has not been carried out since 1979, so apparently some natural reproduction is, or at least was, occuring.  Yep catch rate was average for lake class 24, however, the mean weight of fish caught was high (0.21 lbs.)  yep ranged in length from 6.0 to 9.0 inches with most fish caught averaging 7.0 inches in length.  Growth rate for yep was average and lengths of 8.5 inches were reached in five years.  Four lmb, with lengths from 5.0 to 13.0 inches, were captured during the 1992 assessment.  Catch per set and mean weight were average for lake class 24, and growth rate was similar to statewide averages. Intensive spring seining in 1987 resulted in 65 lmb from 5.9 to 20.2 inches long; and summer seines in 1981 revealed 8 yoy lmb.  Angler reports indicate a substantial lmb fishery with many sizes of fish present.Principal species sampled in trap nets included: blg (19.50/set), yeb (6.30/set) and gos (1.70/set).
