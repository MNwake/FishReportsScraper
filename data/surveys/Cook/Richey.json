Fry stocked into the lake would grow throughout the summer and be harvested in the fall as fingerling sized fish to be stocked into other area lakes to enhance recreational fishing opportunities. Occasionally some fish would survive over winter and continue to grow in subsequent years. If these fish survived for multiple seasons they would occasionally grow to a size of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nA survey was completed in August of 2023 to determine if any successful Walleye reproduction had occurred since the lake was last used as a rearing pond. No Walleye were captured suggesting no reproduction has occurred recently. There may still be a few larger Walleye in the lake from the last fry stocking, but none were sampled in 2023. Currently the lake provides limited fisheries opportunities for anglers. Managers will need to decide how to manage the lake into the future.  </p>",
