This repeat IBI used trap nets, backpack electrofishing, and seining.  Overall, the species sampled in this assessment were the same as those sampled earlier in the year. <br> \n <br> \nWe used 1/4\"-mesh trap nets to sample ten stations throughout the lake.  These trap nets sampled the highest species richness of the three gears including six species: blacknose shiner, golden shiner, northern pike, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow perch.  The most abundant species was yellow perch, followed by pumpkinseed, and golden shiner.  The same species were sampled in the trap nets used in the earlier IBI assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWe used backpack electrofishing to sample ten stations throughout the lake and sampled four species: Iowa darter, central mudminnow, pumpkinseed, and one unidentifiable species.  The unidentifiable species was a young-of-the-year minnow, possibly blacknose shiner. The most abundant species sampled by electrofishing was pumpkinseed, followed by the unidentified species.  Backpack electrofishing sampled one species that was not sampled with any other gear (central mudminnow).  The August IBI electrofishing did not sample white suckers which had been sampled with backpack electrofishing in the earlier IBI. <br> \n <br> \nWe used a 15', 1/4\"-mesh seine at five locations and sampled five species: Iowa darter, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, young-of-the-year white sucker, and yellow perch.  The most abundant species in the seining samples was golden shiner.  These August seine hauls failed to sample blacknose shiners, which were sampled in seine hauls of the earlier IBI assessment. <br> \n <br> \nVouchered specimens were sent to MNDNR Ecological and Water Resources for identification.  On 02/01/2013, the identification results were not available and not used in this report. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey using nine trap nets was performed in the spring of 2017 to collect information on the Bluegill population in East Chub Lake.  This was the first investigation since stocking adult Bluegill in spring of 2015.  Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were sampled with the nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that may have an occasional strong year class.  The spawning habitat in East Chub Lake for Bluegill appears to be good, but the cool climate of the northeastern Minnesota may be a limiting factor in successful reproduction.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of seven Bluegill were captured during the survey.  Size ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 inches with an average weight of 0.06 pounds.  All the fish were aged to 2 years and from natural reproduction in the lake.  Although relatively few Bluegill were caught, these results are promising because they indicate the fish stocked in spring of 2015 were able to spawn successfully that summer.  Continued monitoring will determine the long term success of the Bluegill population in the lake.    <br> \n</p>",

Returned to the high levels maintained prior to 1988.  The 1988 gillnet catch declined to 3.8/lift, however the 1991 catch of 9/lift is equal to the catches in 1982 and 1985.  Average size of Northern Pike is slightly larger than the preceeding period. Walleye numbers are decreasing as less of the fish from stocked years of 1983 and 1984 are available.

Trap nets are the standard gear normally used for sampling bluegill; however, this equipment is not as effective in sampling some of the other species of fish in the lake such as northern pike, yellow perch and largemouth bass.  For that reason these species will not be addressed in any depth in this discussion, other than to say that the northern pike sampled in the trap nets averaged about 2.1 pounds, with the largest weighing 3.7 pounds.  These species will be evaluated using different gear in an assessment planned for 2006.Test nets in this assessment indicate the bluegill population is high at this time; however, the fish were small, averaging 5.8 inches.  A few quality size individuals, ranging between 8.5 inches and 9.8 inches, were sampled ; however, fish of that size were not common.  The majority (93%) of the bluegill sampled were smaller than 7.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, largemouth bass, walleye, rock bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker and minnows were collected in DNR test nets in the 2000 survey.Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers with fish ranging from 17.2 inches to 31.4 inches.  Fish up to 7.0 pounds were collected but the average size was about 3.0 pounds.Bluegill were sampled in above average numbers with fish up to 8.7 inches taken.  Most bluegill were less than 6.0 inches but approximately 10% were larger than 7.0 inches.Largemouth bass were sampled for the first time in 2000.  The size of the population is uncertain as the gear used to sample fish populations is not very effective at sampling largemouth bass.  A few largemouth bass were collected with one 15 inch individual observed.  These fish may have been offspring of largemouth bass stocked as an introduction in 1993.Walleye were present but in below-average numbers.  Walleye are not stocked, but a small population is maintained through natural reproduction.  Only two walleye were sampled in the survey but they were above-average size, weighing 3.0 pounds and 3.5 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers but most of the fish were less than 7.0 inches and too small to interest anglers.  A few yellow perch between 9 inches and 10 inches were captured.East Chub Lake is easily accessible for small boats and probably receives only moderate fishing pressure at best.  Most angling that occurs is for northern pike.  Although some fairly decent-size bluegill are present there does not appear to be a lot of angling for them.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chub Lake is easily accessible off of Highway 1, just northeast of Isabella, MN, and has a gravel back-down access that can accommodate boat trailers.  The lake is 62 acres and has a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Sand and gravel shoreline around the lake provide room for shore-fishing, especially during low water levels.  With the exception of a small piece of privately owned land containing cabins, the shoreline is mostly public land.   <br> \n <br> \nEast Chub's game fish community is composed of northern pike and yellow perch, as well as small (less than 4 inches) pumpkinseed.  Also present are white suckers and some minnow species.  The lake has a soft bottom, clear water (a Secchi disc is visible to the bottom), and a moderate amount of aquatic vegetation.  Several boulders surround the East Chub's small island, located on the western side of the lake; some boulders are near enough to the water surface to present a hazard for boat motors.  East Chub Lake is connected to West Chub Lake by a small channel that cuts through the bog on the northwestern shoreline; the lake has no outlets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike sampled in 2012 averaged 21.3 inches and 2.0 pounds; the largest pike sampled was 26.9 inches (3.5 pounds).  Catch rates of northern pike were above average for similar lakes in the area, northern pike 20-24 inches are fairly abundant in East Chub Lake.  Compared to the 2006 assessment, the northern pike population has improved and now has more fish that are slightly larger on average. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch sampled were smaller than average in 2012, measuring 6.7 inches and 0.14 pounds, on average.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 9.1 inches (0.3 pounds); about 18% of the yellow perch sampled were over 8 inches.  Catch rates of yellow perch were higher than average compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow perch appear to have strong year classes every 3-5 years in East Chub, and high abundances of these strong year classes may result in slow growth (and smaller size) of perch.  <br> \n <br> \nEast Chub's only sunfish species, pumpkinseed, are very small and average 3.5 inches.  The largest pumpkinseed captured during the 2012 survey was only 3.7 inches; the pumpkinseed in East Chub Lake may provide forage for northern pike, but are most likely too small to attract angling pressure. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, the East Chub Lake fish community also included walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass, and rock bass. However, a partial winterkill in 2003/2004 removed these species from the fish community.  Periodic winterkill conditions still occasionally affect the lake, limiting the potential for reintroductions of these species.  Northern pike are now the top game fish in the lake and the high abundance of medium-sized pike provides good angling opportunities. <br> \n</p>",

There is a public boat access with an earthen ramp on the east shore of the lake along Hwy 1 where parking is available for about three vehicle and trailer rigs. Bluegill fishing opportunities are limited in the Finland Area so adult Bluegill from Cedar Lake near Aurora were stocked in 2015 and 2017 in an attempt to establish a self-sustaining population. The purpose of this spring trap net survey was to check the status of Bluegill and look for evidence of natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nSixty Bluegill were sampled and ranged from 3-10 inches long. Age analysis determined that two naturally reproduced year classes from 2018 and 2020 were sampled. The 2020-year class, which averaged 3.6 inches long represented 51% of the catch; this bodes well for Bluegill fishing in 2 or 3 years. The two age-4 fish averaged 8.2 inches long. Bluegill greater than 9.2 inches long were presumed to be stocked fish from Cedar Lake as they exhibited slower growth than the fish produced from natural reproduction in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill populations in the Finland Area generally have sporadic reproduction and are supported by occasional strong year classes. For this reason, it is recommended to show a little restraint when the fishing is good. Taking some home for a fresh fish dinner is great. However, going back day after day when the bite is hot can do damage on a 60 acre lake, especially in its current state of reestablishing a population that is mainly sustained by one year class within the last five. Future spring trap netting surveys will be used to monitor the Bluegill population to determine what kind of angling opportunities the lake can support. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chub Lake is located approximately 13 miles northwest of Isabella in the Superior National Forest. It has a maximum depth of 9 feet and is relatively clear with a Secchi disc visible on the bottom in 7.5 feet of water. There is a gravel back-down access on the east shore of the lake. Most of the lake is surrounded by public land, is undeveloped and in a wild state.   <br> \n <br> \nDNR test nets in 2006 collected northern pike, yellow perch, white suckers and bluegills. <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this class. The mean weight was 1.4 pounds, which was smaller than in the previous assessment but still considered normal for the lake class. Northern pike up to 27.9 inches were collected but there were few fish collected longer than 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in above average numbers.  Most fish were too small to interest anglers, though there were a few 9-10 inch fish sampled.       <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in very low numbers; it appears the fishery for this species has declined substantially due to the partial winterkill during the winter of 2003/04. Prior to the winterkill, bluegills were present in relatively high numbers that included fair numbers of fish larger than 8 inches. It remains to be seen if the population can recover on its own and return to former levels. <br> \n</p>",

After the winter of 2003-2004 it was suspected that the lake might have experienced a winterkill.  A special assessment was conducted in 2004 and netting results indicate that the bluegill and largemouth bass, species that do not tolerate low oxygen levels, probably sustained significant losses as neither of these species were sampled in this assessment.  Northern pike were collected in this assessment and indications are that they did not sustain similar loses.  Northern pike were collected in numbers similar to the 2003 assessment and ranged from 9.2 inches to 26.1 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Chub Lake is located 4 miles north and 12 miles west of Isabella and has an area of 62 acres with a maximum depth of nine feet. There is a public boat access with an earthen ramp on the east shore of the lake along State Highway 1 where parking is available for about three vehicle and trailer rigs. The convenient location and room to shore fish or picnic make the access a popular spot. After a suspected winterkill impacted the fish community in the lake, adult Bluegill were stocked in 2015 and 2017 in an attempt to reestablish a self-sustaining population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the primary management species in East Chub Lake and the 2022 gill net catch of 12.7 per lift was higher than average compared to similar lakes. The average weight was 1.1 pounds, which is below normal range compared to similar lakes statewide. The average length was 16.8 inches with the largest fish measuring 25.8 inches long. Growth is average compared to similar lakes. The current population can provide more of a quantity over quality fishery, with good action on smaller fish with limited chances for quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Bluegill trap net catch of 4.7 per lift was average compared to similar lakes, but the average size was just 3.9 inches long and weight was just 0.05 pounds. The small size was due to the high number of age-2 fish that had been naturally reproduced in the lake. Growth is average compared to similar lakes. The strong 2020 year class bodes well for the Bluegill population in the near future. Pumpkinseed sunfish up to 7.5 inches long were also sampled in average numbers. While they are not often targeted by anglers, some may be caught and harvested by Bluegill anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch of 18.3/lift is average compared to other similar lakes. Average length was about 7 inches with less than 9% greater than nine inches long. These results suggest the lake currently supports an abundant population of small perch with limited opportunities for angler harvest. Growth is average compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther important forage species sampled were White Sucker and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill populations in the Finland Area generally have sporadic reproduction and are maintained by occasional strong year classes. Results of this survey support this concept as only one year class in the last five years was sampled. Because the goal is to reestablish a self-sustaining Bluegill population, anglers are encouraged to show a little restraint when the fishing is good as angler harvest may impact the population on this small lake. Future surveys will be used to monitor the Bluegill population to determine what kind of angling opportunities the lake can support. <br> \n</p>",
