NETTING CONSISTED OF 6 GILLNET AND 4 TRAPNET SETS AND SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE EFFORTS, THE STATUS OF THE FISH POPULATION COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND TO LAKES OF THE SAME CLASS- IFICATION STATEWIDE ARE AS FOLLOWS:  THE WAE (7.00/SET) NET CATCH HAS SHOWN A REAL INCREASE FROM THE NET CATCH OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1985 (2.50/SET).  THIS INCREASE PLACES THE WAE ABUNDANCE ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH (3.00/ SET) AND JUST BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE (7.43/SET). THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 7.5- 22.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 18.0- 18.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.24 POUNDS. AGE CLASSES I-VIII WERE REPRESENTED BY THE SAMPLE TAKEN FROM NET CATCHES.  ANALYSIS OF BACK- CALCULATED LENGTHS SHOW THAT WAES IN THIS LAKE GROW AT RATES SIMILAR TO STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATES. THE WAE POPULATION IS LARGELY COMPOSED OF STOCKED FISH, HOWEVER, NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN 1985 AS WITNESSED BY THE 8 WAES AGED FROM THE 1985 YEAR-CLASS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN 1985 THE LAKE LEVEL WAS EXTREMELY HIGH WHICH MAY HAVE CREATED SUITABLE SPAWNING HABITAT FOR WAES.  SINCE 1986, THE LAKE HAS RECEDED TO NORMAL LEVELS.  THE NOP (1.83/SET) NET CATCH HAS ALSO SHOWN A REAL INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY (0.83/SET) BUT REMAINS BOTH BELOW THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN AND FIRST QUARTILE, 4.00/SET AND 2.29/SET, RESPECTIVELY.  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 18.0-30.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 26.0-26.9 INCHES.  MEAN WEIGHT WAS 4.26 POUNDS.  AGE CLASSES III-VI WERE REPRESENTED BY THE SAMPLE TAKEN FROM NET CATCHES.  ANALYSIS OF BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS SHOW THAT NOP IN THIS LAKE GROW AT RATES SIMILAR TO STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATES.  NOP FINGERLINGS HAVE BEEN STOCKED IN THE PAST BUT HISTORICAL AGE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION WITHIN THE WATERSHED WAS THE PRIMARY SOURCE THAT MADE UP THE ESTABLISHED NOP POPULATION.  THE BLG (169.50/ SET) NET CATCH INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE 1985 NET CATCH (11.25/SET) AND WAS WELL ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN (19.73/SET) AND THE THIRD QUARTILE (51.42/SET).  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 3.0-7.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.0- 5.4 INCHES.  MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.12 POUNDS.  GROWTH RATES WERE NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES.  IN 1990, BOTH THE TRAPNET AND GILLNET CATCHES RECORDED ALL-TIME HIGHS FOR SURVEYS DATING BACK TO 1956.  THE BLC (21.00/SET) CATCH ALSO INCREASED FROM THE 1985 NET CATCH (1.25/SET) AND WAS ABOVE THE STATESIDE MEDIAN (8.60/SET) BUT REMAINS BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE (34.25/SET).  THE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 3.0-9.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5-6.9 INCHES.  MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.20 POUNDS.  GROWTH RATES WERE NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES.  LMB WERE NOT CAPTURED IN TRAPNETS, ALTHOUGH, THE GILLNET CATCH (0.83/SET) WAS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN (0.50/ SET) BUT SLIGHTLY BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE (1.00/ SET).  SHORELINE SEINING EFFORT RECORDED 71 YOUNG- OF-YEAR IN A 0.34 ACRE AREA.  THE YEP (22.17/SET) NET CATCH WAS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN (10.50/ SET) BUT REMAINS BELOW THE THIRD QUARTILE (32.00/ SET).  SINCE 1979, YEP HAVE MAINTAINED POPULATIONS SIMILAR TO THE 1990 NET CATCH.  BLB, YEB, BRBS WERE ALWAYS PRESENT IN SURVEY NET CATCHES DATING BACK TO THE FIRST SURVEY.  THEIR ABUNDANCE WAS USUALLY LOW RELATIVE TO STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCHES, BUT THE AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS GENERALLY JUST OVER 1 POUND PER FISH.  SMALLER BULLHEADS WERE SELDOM TAKEN IN SURVEY NET CATCHES.  FIVE (5) OTHER SPECIES WERE RECORDED IN THE GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCHES (BOF, GOS, WTS, HSF, AND PMK SUNFISH). BOF AND PMK SUNFISH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THEIR QUARTILE CATCHES WHILE THE REMAINING 3 SPECIES HAD CATCH TYPICAL OF THEIR STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCHES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake and Chisago Lake are broadly connected, and show similar trends in fish numbers in survey work done over the last forty years.  They are managed together, with walleye and northern pike as primary species, and largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as secondary species.  These lakes have a long stocking history, with mainly walleyes and northerns stocked after 1945.       Walleye stocking was changed from an annual to alternate year stocking in 1994 for cost effectiveness, and to allow for better evaluation of the contribution of stocked walleyes to the population.  Walleye numbers were above average for the lake type in this survey, and normal in average weight.       Northern stocking has been somewhat more erratic than walleye stocking.  Results of this survey suggest that most northerns currently in South Lindstrom Lake are the product of natural reproduction.  The 1992 year class was especially large in South Lindstrom Lake, and in other area lakes.  Northern numbers were normal for the lake type.  Northerns have typically been above average in weight for the lake type.  In this survey, they were somewhat below average, but this was probably partly because northerns belonging to the large 1992 year class were still fairly small.     Bluegills were normal for the lake type in both numbers and average size in this survey, with a large group in the 6.0 to 7.5 inch range.  Black crappies were normal in number but low in average weight, with a large group in the 3.5 to 4.0 inch range.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing, and showed good numbers.  Their length distribution peaked in the 12.0 to 13.0 inch range.  Chisago/South Lindstrom was chosen as a site for a Silverado catch and release bass fishing tournament in 1995.     Seining conducted as part of this survey showed successful largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch reproduction in 1995.     -Steve Morse     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake is a moderately fertile 499 acre lake. It is located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City. The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel. The connection between the two lakes facilitates fish movement and the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Either lake can be accessed via a concrete public boat ramp located in the channel between lakes. The primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. The Walleye population is maintained by stocking 900 lbs. of fingerlings in even numbered years. There is currently a special regulation on Largemouth Bass limiting harvest to fish less than 12 inches in length. A survey consisting of 6 gill net and 9 trap net sets was conducted in July 2018 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 8.5 fish per net. This is high but fairly typical for the lake relative to historical catches. Mean weight was also typical of previous surveys at 2.4 lbs. and is higher than average compared to similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 16 to 26.5 inches and averaged 18.9. Otolith aging assigned 77% of Walleyes to the 2014 year class which would indicate excellent growth.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Northern Pike at a rate of 4.1 fish per net, typical for the lake but higher than average for similar lakes. Fish ranged from 17 to 27 inches in length and averaged 21.5 inches. Year classes from 2015 to 2011 were well represented and growth appeared to be somewhat variable.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 38.6 fish per trap net which is typical. Size was slightly smaller than average with a mean weight of 0.16 lbs., a decrease from the last couple of surveys. Fish averaged 5.5 inches in length and none were bigger than 8.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled more effectively by gill nets than by trap nets with a catch rate of 11.1 versus 2.3 fish per net. Trap nets may not accurately sample the crappie population in this lake. Fish were well distributed in size from about 5 to 10 inches with the largest individual measuring 11.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers remained low with 2.8 fish sampled per gill net. Average size was small at 6.7 inches and no individuals over 9 inches were sampled. Golden Shiners are believed to supplement the forage base in these lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was conducted in early June to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Fish were sampled at a rate of 158 per hour which is a decrease from the previous survey but still high. Most fish were 14 to 15 inches long. Largemouth averaged 11.9 inches but the largest sampled was only 17 inches. Smaller sizes of fish were well represented.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County within the cities of Lindstrom and Chisago City, is a moderately fertile lake just less than 500 acres in size.  The shoreline is predominately sand and water clarity is good.  The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having less shallow water habitat.  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary species. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted during the week of July 26, 2010, to evaluate the current fishery and the management goals for South Lindstrom Lake.  Walleye abundance was good while average size, 19.4 inches and 2.6 pounds, was higher than in most lakes of this type.  Walleye numbers have remained fairly consistent since 1990.  Since natural reproduction is limited, the walleye population is maintained primarily through stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing found an extremely high abundance of largemouth bass.  Lengths extended from 5.6 to 18.3 inches.  Along with Chisago Lake, South Lindstrom was selected for an experimental, 12 inch maximum largemouth bass regulation in 1997.  A high bass population, consistent reproduction, and heavy fishing pressure were deciding factors.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the proportion of bass greater than 13 inches.  Prior to the regulation, only 14% of the sampled bass exceeded this mark.  Post regulation sampling has shown an increase in larger bass with 28% of the 2010 catch over 13 inches in length.  Night electrofishing is scheduled biennially to evaluate the bass population. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike abundance fell in the normal range for the lake class with an average size, 3.4 pounds, higher than in most similar lakes.  Measured northern ranged from 12.5 to 34.8 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie were present in normal and high abundance levels respectively.  Average size of both species set historic highs for South Lindstrom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nDuring a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter good numbers of nice sized walleye, larger northern pike, and an abundance of various sized largemouth bass.  Good numbers of average sized bluegill and black crappie should keep panfish anglers interested.  The current management goals set for South Lindstrom are to develop and maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with a 13-15 inch length frequency mode, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish per lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish per lift with a mean weight near 3.0 pounds.  With the exception of the largemouth bass modal length, all management goals were met in 2010.  The catch rate for largemouth bass was 168 per hour with a mode of 8.5 inches.  The walleye catch rate was 3.3 with an average weight of 2.6 pounds.  And, the northern pike catch rate was 5.3 with a 3.4 pound mean. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should remember that the harvest of largemouth bass 12 inches or larger from South Lindstrom Lake is prohibited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake is a moderately hard water and moderately fertile 499 acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City. The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel. The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of littoral (less than 15 feet depth) acreage (42%) than Chisago (80%). The channel allows fish to migrate freely between the two lakes. Because past surveys and assessments dating back to 1956 indicate similar fish composition and abundance, the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Currently, the primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Chisago chain of lakes, which also includes Chisago, North Lindstrom, North Center, and South Center, has a history of extreme water level fluctuations. These fluctuations, up to 7 vertical feet, are believed to be due to a net loss of water to groundwater in the system, making the lakes dependent on long term cycles in precipitation.  The water levels in 2009 were the lowest they have been in 40 years.     <br> \n <br> \nChisago-South Lindstrom Lake was selected for a special Largemouth Bass regulation due to a 1995 survey that found a high abundance of small bass in both basins. A 12-inch maximum size limit for Largemouth Bass was implemented in March 1997 and was based on the premise that angler harvest was limiting the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. Post regulation surveys have indicated that the overall population size structure of Largemouth Bass has improved. Nighttime spring electrofishing was conducted on May 27, 2014 to assess the current Largemouth Bass population. A catch rate of 244 fish per hour was the highest catch rate observed in South Lindstrom Lake. The modal length group of Largemouth Bass observed in the electrofishing assessment was 13 inches, and lengths ranged from 7.3 to 17.8 inches. Currently, the Largemouth Bass population is meeting the objectives of the special regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were above average at 7.0 fish per net, which is similar to levels observed in the 2000 and 2005 assessments. Mean weight of Walleye was similar to the past two surveys at almost 2.4 pounds. Walleye lengths ranged from 12.8 to 25.6 inches with a mean length of 18.5 inches. Otolith data sorted the thirty aged Walleye into seven year classes, with all but one fish corresponding to years with fall fingerling stockings. The 2009 year class (stocked) accounted for 53% of the catch. The Walleye catch rate of 7 per net is within the long range goal of 3 to 8 per net. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 4.8 per net was above average when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike catch rates have been similar in all surveys since 1995, when catch rates peaked at just over 6 fish per net. Previous to the 1995 assessment, catch rates were less than 2 per net. Mean weight was similar to the last assessment at 3.1 pounds and remained above average. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 12.8 to 30.2 inches with a mean length of 23.9 inches. The oldest Northern Pike sampled was age-8 and 7 year-classes were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at above average rates. The mean weight, 0.22 pounds, was also above average.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.1 inches with a 6.4 inch mean length.  Bluegill 7 inches and greater represented 44% of the catch, a good ratio for the Chisago Lakes Area. However, not many Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net catch rates declined to 8.0 per net and the trap net catch rates also declined to below average. Mean weight, based on the trap net catch declined to well below average, while the mean weight of Black Crappie caught in the gill nets also declined but remained above average. Sampled Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.3 to 10.5 inches and had a mean length of 7.0 inches, however only a few fish over 8 inches were observed. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow Perch numbers continue to decline and catch rates are at the lowest levels ever observed.  Now at 1.3 per gill net, they are well below average when compared to similar lakes. White Sucker catch rates are also at the lowest point ever observed and no Golden Shiners were caught during the assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for most species in South Lindstrom Lake. At times fishing pressure can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of South Lindstrom Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages releasing larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. The current Largemouth Bass regulation is a great example of this. This regulation protects larger fish, which has created excellent catch-and-release angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass larger than 12 inches, while still allowing for harvest of the smaller fish. <br> \n <br> \nNon-native invasive species of vegetation are present in South Lindstrom Lake.  Eurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in South Lindstrom Lake in the fall of 2009 and Curlyleaf Pondweed has been present since at least 1969. Anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nSome shorelines of South Lindstrom Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of South Lindstrom Lake. Water level fluctuations in the Chisago chain of lakes can leave exposed sediments and if left alone, these areas will naturally vegetate and stabilize the shorelines on their own. Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County within the cities of Lindstrom and Chisago City, is a moderately fertile lake just under 500 acres in size.  The lake is largely connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different in abundance of water depths at fifteen feet and less with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of shallow water acreage (61%) than Chisago Lake (80%).  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary management species followed by northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.A fish population assessment was conducted during the week of July 17, 2000, to evaluate the current status of the fishery in South Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  Walleye numbers and average size, at 3.0 pounds, were both above normal for this lake type.  Abundance has remained fairly consistent since 1990, but the average size was at a record high.  Lengths of sampled walleye ranged from 8.7 to 27.6 inches with an average length of 19.7 inches.  After determining ages for 48 walleye, all year classes represented coinside with years when walleye stocking took place.  Since natural reproduction has been limited, the walleye population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Spring night electrofishing found an excellent abundance of largemouth bass that had a small average size of 0.7 pounds with lengths extending from 4.1 to 15.2 inches.  Since small largemouth with declining numbers of larger fish were characteristic of the largemouth population, South Linstrom and Chisago Lakes were selected for an experimental regulation as part of a statewide experimental regulations research project.  In 1997, a 12 inch maximum size limit for largemouth was implemented and will continue until 2008 when a final analysis will determine if the regulation should be continued, discontinued or modified.  The abundance of northern pike and the average size, at 3.2 pounds, both were within a normal range.  When compared with 1995 data, northern pike numbers were down slightly, but the average size was up from 2.1 pounds.  Measured northern ranged from 16.3 to 32.2 inches.  Normal growth at all ages were determined for walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Bluegill sunfish were found at a normal abundance level while black crappie numbers were well above normal for lakes of this type.  The average size was determined to be small for bluegill and normal for crappie.  Both bluegill and crappie numbers have increased since 1995.  Their lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.2 inches and 4.5 to 10.5 inches, respectively.  Yellow perch, a valuable food source for northern pike and walleye, were found at a normal abundance level in 2000.  According to previous surveys, perch numbers in the late seventies, eighties, and early ninties were almost three times higher than what was found in the 2000 survey.  However, since 1995abundance has doubled while northern pike and walleye numbers have decreased.  When yellow perch numbers dropped considerably in 1995, northern pike and walleye numbers were at an all time high.  Shoreline seining efforts found excellent natural reproductive success for bluegill sunfish and good success for largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The fish population was also made up of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dog fish), common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  When compared to similar lake types, black and brown bullhead, and common carp were present in below normal numbers while dog fish, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and white sucker were typical of normal in abundance.During a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter an abundance of nice sized walleye, a good number of larger northern pike, or an abundance of largemouth bass with an increasing liklihood of catching quality sized bass.  Currently, a good number of smaller bluegill sunfish and larger black crappie should keep panfish anglers entertained.  The current management goals set for South Lindstrom and Chisago Lakes combined are to develope and maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with the highest number of fish in the 13-15 inch range, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish/lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish/lift with an average size near 3.0 pounds.  The 2000 assessment reports largemouth bass numbers (78.6 fish/hour) a bit below the future goal, but the highest number of largemouth in any length group were from 13.0 to 13.9 inches followed by the 14.0 to 14.9 inch length group.  Both walleye and northern pike catch rates and average weights found in 2000 completely satisfy the above stated goals.  Fishing enthusiasts should remember that harvest of largemouth bass at 12 inches or larger is prohibited and are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience the excitement of hooking a quality sized fish.  Since South Lindstrom Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, and some agricultural crop land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Since nutrient input can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient loading may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Land users within the watershed can prevent or maintain the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plants, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake, which is located in southern Chisago County within the cities of Lindstrom and Chisago City, is a moderately fertile lake just under 500 acres in size.  The shoreline is predominately sand with good water clarity given the area.  The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having less shallow water habitat.  However, the fish species composition and abundance are very similar.  The current management plan treats both lakes as one for management purposes with walleye and largemouth bass as the primary management.A lake survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2005, to evaluate the current fishery and the management goals for South Lindstrom Lake.  Walleye abundance was high while average size, 17.8 inches and 2.3 pounds, were both above normal for this lake type.  Walleye numbers have remained fairly consistent since 1990.  Since natural reproduction has been limited, the walleye population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Spring night electrofishing found an excellent abundance of quality sized largemouth bass.  Lengths extended from 6 to 18 inches.  Along with Chisago Lake, South Lindstrom was selected for an experimental, 12 inch maximum largemouth bass regulation in 1997.  A high bass population, consistent reproduction, and heavy fishing pressure were deciding factors.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the proportion of bass greater than 13 inches.  Prior to the regulation, only 14% of the sampled bass exceeded this mark.  Post regulation sampling has shown a stepped increase in larger bass with 38% of the 2005 catch over 13 inches.  Night electrofishing is scheduled biennially to evaluate the bass population.  The abundance of northern pike fell in the normal range for the lake class but the average size, at 4.4 pounds, was higher than in most similar lakes.  Measured northern ranged from 17.2 to 40.6 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie were found at a normal abundance levels with a slight increase in size since 2000.  Yellow perch, a valuable food source for northern pike and walleye, were found at a normal abundance in 2005 and appear to be on the increase.During a fishing outing, anglers are likely to encounter an abundance of nice sized walleye, a good number of larger northern pike, or an abundance of quality sized largemouth bass.  Good numbers of average sized bluegill and black crappie should keep panfish anglers interested.  The current management goals set for South Lindstrom and Chisago Lakes combined are to develope and maintain a largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 110 fish/hour with the highest number of fish in the 13-15 inch range, a walleye gill net catch rate from 3-8 fish/lift with an average size near 2.0 pounds, and a northern pike gill net catch rate of 4.0 fish/lift with an average size near 3.0 pounds.  With the exception of northern abundance, all management goals were met in 2005.  The combined catch rate for largemouth bass was 123 per hour with a mode between 14 and 16 inches.  The combined catch rate for walleye was 4.4/set with an average weight of 2.7 pounds.  Northern pike abundance, 3.7/gillnet, fell just short of the goal but mean weight reached 4.7 pounds.  Fishing enthusiasts should remember that harvest of largemouth bass at 12 inches or larger is prohibited and are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience the excitement of hooking a quality sized fish.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lindstrom Lake is a moderately fertile 499-acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering the city of Lindstrom. The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel. The connection between the two lakes facilitates fish movement and the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Either lake can be accessed via a concrete public boat ramp located in the channel between lakes. The primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. The Walleye population is maintained by stocking 900 lbs. of fingerlings in even numbered years. There is currently a special regulation on Largemouth Bass limiting harvest to fish less than 12 inches in length. A survey consisting of 6 gill net (July) and 9 trap net (May) sets was conducted in 2022 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 6 fish per net, typical for the lake relative to historical catches. The 2.1-pound average was also similar to previous surveys and is higher than in many similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 24.8 inches and averaged 17.4.  Otolith aging assigned all year classes except 2021 to stocking years. While these yearlings may have been naturally reproduced, 600,000 Walleye fry were stocked in the connected North Center Lake in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Norther Pike catch, 5.3 per gill net, remained similar to the previous 6 assessments.   As with the Walleye catch, pike were a little more abundant than in many similar lakes.  Fish ranged from 19 to 39 inches in length with over half the catch exceeding 26 inches.  Despite the size quality, half the pike catch was less than 5 years of age. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 46.6 fish per trap net which was also similar to the past 6 catches.  Size showed an uptick to a quarter pound average with more than half the catch over 7 inches.  Despite the abundance of harvestable sized fish, few (<1%) exceeded 8 inches, likely a function of angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \nLikewise, the Black Crappie catch rate remained consistent to the catches dating back to 1995.  Trap netting was done in May to hopefully sample a more representative size of crappie.  Seventy percent of this catch was longer than 8 inches.  Although fish better than 10 inches were present only 16% made the 9-inch mark.   <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was conducted in mid-June to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Fish were sampled at a rate of 62 per hour which is a decrease from the previous survey and the lowest rate to date.  Most adult bass were more than 12 inches long but like in the 2018 sample, fish over 17 inches were absent. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers visiting can expect quality sized Walleye, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.  Plenty of harvestable crappie and sunfish are also present.  At times fishing pressure can be high but the public access is large.  Non-native invasive vegetation is present in South Lindstrom Lake.  Eurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in the fall of 2009 and Curlyleaf Pondweed has been present since at least 1969. Anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
