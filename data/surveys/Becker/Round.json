Growth rates, however, appear acceptable for the time being.  Concurrently, the yellow perch population has decreased significantly to an all-time low 8.25 per gillnet set.  Walleye numbers appear to be rebounding to pre-seventies levels with good growth rates.  There is strong correlation between largest walleye year-classes and years of fingerling stocking, indicating that stocking may play an important part in maintaining Round Lake walleye populations.  Bluegill and yellow bullhead numbers have also increased significantly; test net catches for each species were highest ever and several times classification and local medians.  Largemouth bass and black crappies are present.  Erratic tullibee net catches were much higher in the eighties than the present 1.25 per gillnet set.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Like many area lakes, Round Lake has a relatively diverse fish community that ranges from species that require cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that do well in warmer, more turbid water (bullhead).  With a well-oxygenated thermocline and tullibee population, it has the potential to produce large northern pike and walleye although few make it past anglers to reach large sizes.The northern pike population continued to be quite abundant and young with the strongest year class from 2002.  The average pike length did, however, increase to 20 inches in 2005.  Before 1980, northern pike numbers appeared stable and within the normal range compared to ecologically similar lakes.  Even though pike have not been stocked for 20 years, stocking of winter \"rescue\" northern pike in 1978 and 1981 seemed to have upset the balance of the Round Lake fish community.When pike abundance increased, yellow perch declined.  Yellow perch were the primary forage for northern pike and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  The decline of yellow perch was followed by a rapid increase in bluegill numbers.  These events illustrate the need for caution in stocking, especially northern pike stocking.  Increased bluegill numbers resulted in decreased growth rates.  While bluegill test net catches returned to more normal levels in the 2000 and 2005 surveys, pike abundance remained high and perch abundance remained low.  A return to more balanced populations may take several years.There are still some large fish in Round Lake.  With the exception of bluegills, which were slow growing in recent studies, growth rates for most species are normal and those that can survive long enough grow to good sizes.  The walleye population remains quite stable with the help of biennial fingerling or yearling stocking.  Although there is some walleye natural reproduction occurring in Round Lake, the strongest year classes have come from stocked years in most recent studies.  The walleye stocking rate was doubled in 2002 and has not resulted in increased catch rates of walleye.  Walleyes sampled in 2005 averaged 1.6 pounds.  It is very important that lakeshore owners use best shoreland management practices to minimize nutrient input.  These practices include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, and ensuring compliance of septic systems.  The DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" has advice for riparian owners interested in restoring and maintaining natural shorelines and protecting water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,094-acre lake located in northeastern Becker County within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  A portion of the southwest shore is located in the Tamarack National Wildlife Refuge.  The recreational fishery in Round Lake today can be described as predominantly Northern Pike, Walleye, and panfish.  The MN DNR Detroit Lakes Fisheries staff and the White Earth Natural Resources Department (WENRD) staff work in partnership to stock Walleye fingerlings biennially. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have remained relatively high in Round Lake since the 1980s'.  About 19 pike were caught per net in 2020, above the lake's historical average of 12 pike per net.  Sampled pike measured between 10.8 and 26.7 inches long, with an average length of 18.5 inches.  Pike between 17 and 20 inches in length dominated catch, accounting for approximately 45.6% of sampled pike.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in Round Lake have fluctuated between four and ten fish per net since the 1972 survey.  About 10 Walleye were caught per net in 2020, almost double the catch rate observed in the last three surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 9.8 to 28.0 inches, averaging 15.7 inches long.  Walleye belonging to the 2016 year-class dominated catch, accounting for 56.3% of aged fish.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates peaked in the 1981 survey and have declined in surveys since.  In 2020, one perch was caught per net on average.  Sampled perch ranged in length from 6.2 to 11.5 inches, averaging 8.9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have fluctuated considerably in Round Lake over time.  In 2020, 17 Bluegill were caught per net on average.  Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 8.9 inches, averaging 4.9 inches long.  No Bluegill over nine inches were sampled and it requires at least nine years for Bluegill to reach eight inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have been sampled in relatively low numbers in Round Lake across survey years.  A total of six crappie were collected in 2020.  Sampled crappie ranged in length from 3.6 to 12.9 inches.  Similar to crappie, Largemouth Bass catch rates in Round Lake are historically low.  In 2020, a total of 23 Largemouth Bass were collected in gill nets and four in trap nets.  Sampled bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 15.3 inches, averaging 13.3 inches long.    <br> \n <br> \nIn cooperation with the MN DNR and United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Lake Sturgeon have been stocked into Round Lake by the WENRD.  A total of 117 sturgeon were caught in nets in 2020.  Sampled sturgeon ranged in length from 8.0 to 39.4 inches, averaging 19.1 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in this survey included Bullhead (Black, Brown, and Yellow), Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Cisco, Common Shiner, Muskellunge, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,087-acre, class 27 lake located in northeastern Becker County.  Unlike many area lakes, shoreline development has not increased substantially since the original lake survey in 1957, when there were two resorts and 86 cottages reported.  One resort and 92 homes or cabins were counted in 2000.  Due to extensive areas of offshore shoals, the lake still contains large stands of bulrush.  Round Lake is mesotrophic, with a mean Carlson's trophic state index in the mid-forties.  It lies within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Its primary inlet, the Otter Tail River, was used by the White Earth Biology Department as a Walleye spawn taking site for a couple of years in the late 1980s. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, the average Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 15.7 per set almost doubled the 2010 catch rate and was above the lake's historical average Northern Pike catch rate of 11.5 per gill net.  The average length and weight of sampled Northern Pike was 20.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Four-year-old Northern Pike had an average length of 24.0 inches.  Nearly 89% of sampled Northern Pike were age three or younger.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Walleye gill net catch was very similar to the previous two surveys at 5.0 Walleyes per gill net.  The 2015 catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes in the state, but less than the lake's historical average of 6.7 per gill net.  Eight different ages of Walleye were found in the 2015 sample. The average size of sampled Walleyes was 15.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleye growth rates were considered slightly below normal in Round Lake compared to statewide and historic lake growth rates.  Average Walleye length at four years of age was 14.7 inches.  Unfortunately, increased Walleye stocking rates since 2002 have failed to significantly increase Walleye catch rates in the three surveys following the change. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 catch rate of 40.5 Bluegills per trap net greatly exceeded the historic low observed in the previous 2010 survey, and was also larger than the historic average of 27.0 Bluegills per trap net.  The average Bluegill length was 5.9 inches and ranged from 3.5 to 8.9 inches.  The average Bluegill growth rate was similar to historic lake rates, but slower than the statewide average.  Four-year-old Bluegill had an average length of 4.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, very few, if any, Black Crappie have been sampled in Round Lake.  Only five Black Crappie were sampled in total in 2015.  Modest numbers of Largemouth Bass were sampled in gill nets, along with a few bass in trap nets.  Average lengths of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were relatively large at 11.4 and 13.4 inches, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nAnnual tribal stocking of Lake Sturgeon over the past decade has been extremely successful at providing a population in Round Lake.  In the year 2000, no sturgeon were caught in test nets.  In 2005, the gill net catch rate was 1.6 per net and in 2010 the catch rate jumped to a remarkable 16.1 sturgeon per gill net.  The 2015 catch rate was 5.2 per gill net.  Those fish averaged 2.7 pounds and 24.5 inches, but lengths of sampled sturgeon ranged from 8.4 to 34.0 inches.  Most sturgeon were seven or eight years old. <br> \n <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this diverse, productive, and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Like many area lakes, Round Lake has a relatively diverse fish community that ranges from species that require cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that do well in warmer, more turbid water (bullhead).  With a well-oxygenated thermocline and tullibee population, it has the potential to produce large northern pike and walleye although few make it past anglers to reach large sizes. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population continued to be relatively abundant and young with ages two and three fish most common in the sample.  The average pike length did, however, increase to 21 inches in 2010.  This was the largest average pike length of any assessment report since 1957.  Before 1980, northern pike numbers appeared stable and within the normal range compared to ecologically similar lakes.  Even though pike have not been stocked for 20 years, stocking of winter \"rescue\" northern pike in 1978 and 1981 seemed to have upset the balance of the Round Lake fish community. <br> \n <br> \nWhen pike abundance increased, yellow perch declined.  Yellow perch were the primary forage for northern pike and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  The decline of yellow perch was followed by a rapid increase in bluegill numbers.  These events illustrate the need for caution in stocking, especially northern pike stocking.  Increased bluegill numbers resulted in decreased growth rates.  While bluegill test net catches returned to more normal levels in the past three surveys, pike abundance remained high and perch abundance remained low, though the recent catches may indicate a partial return to more balanced populations. <br> \n <br> \nThere are still some large fish in Round Lake.  With the exception of bluegills, which were slow growing in recent studies, growth rates for most species are normal and those that can survive long enough grow to good sizes.  The walleye population remains quite stable with the help of biennial fingerling or yearling stocking.  Although there is some walleye natural reproduction occurring in Round Lake, the strongest year classes have come from stocked years in most recent studies.  The walleye stocking rate was doubled in 2002 and has not resulted in increased catch rates of walleye.  Walleyes sampled in 2010 averaged 0.9 pounds.  A relatively strong group of two-year-old walleyes is now present and should provide a productive fishery in the near future.  It is very important that lakeshore owners use best shoreland management practices to minimize nutrient input.  These practices include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, and ensuring compliance of septic systems.  The DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" has advice for riparian owners interested in restoring and maintaining natural shorelines and protecting water quality. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is known as a good walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish angling lake.  It produces some large walleye and pike each year.  Lakes with good oxygen in the lower, cooler portions of their thermoclines have the best potential to produce large pike.  Round Lake, as evidenced by its tullibee population, is such a lake.The northern pike population is currently very abundant due to strong natural reproduction in 1992 and 1993.  Before 1980, northern pike numbers appeared stable and within the normal range for ecologically similar lakes.  Even though pike have not been stocked for fifteen years, stocking of winter \"rescue\" northern pike in 1978 and 1981 seems to have upset the balance of the Round Lake fish community.When pike abundance increased, the perch population crashed.  Yellow perch are the primary forage for both northern pike and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  The yellow perch decrease, in turn, resulted in a rapid increase in bluegill numbers.  This is a perfect example of the notion that more is not always better.  Increased bluegill numbers meant more competition for available food and space, resulting in decreased growth rates.  It is likely that pike, perch, and bluegill numbers will return to more normal levels eventually.  That may, however, be several years down the road.The good news is that there are some large fish remaining in Round Lake.  Also, the walleye population is relatively stable and within the normal range for similar lakes.  The average sampled walleye weighed 1.4 pounds and was 15.1 inches long.  Although there is some natural reproduction of walleye in Round Lake, the population appears to be maintained by biennial fingerling stocking.  Anglers can help to sustain fish populations by releasing medium to large fish, which usually don't taste as good as the smaller ones, anyway.  Shoreline owners can help by not fertilizing lawns, by not mowing right up to the water's edge, by updating septic systems or using dry composting toilets, and by protecting aquatic vegetation, especially emergent plants like bulrush and cattail.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Like many area lakes, Round Lake has a relatively diverse fish community that ranges from species that prefer cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that prefer warmer, more turbid water (bullhead).  With a well-oxygenated thermocline and tullibee population, it has the potential to produce large northern pike and walleye although few make it past anglers to reach large sizes.The northern pike population continued to be quite abundant and young (small) with strong year classes from 1997 and 1998.  Before 1980, northern pike numbers appeared stable and within the normal range compared to ecologically similar lakes.  Even though pike have not been stocked for 20 years, stocking of winter \"rescue\" northern pike in 1978 and 1981 seemed to have upset the balance of the Round Lake fish community.When pike abundance increased, the perch population crashed.  Yellow perch were the primary forage for both northern pike and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  The yellow perch decrease was followed by a rapid increase in bluegill numbers.  This is a good example of the need for caution in stocking, especially northern pike stocking.  Increased bluegill numbers meant more competition for available food and space, resulting in decreased growth rates.  While bluegill test net catches returned to more normal levels in the 2000 survey, pike abundance remained high and perch abundance remained low.  A return to more balanced populations may take several years.The good news is that there are still some large fish remaining in Round Lake.  Growth rates for most species are normal and those that can survive long enough will grow to good sizes.  The walleye population remains quite stable with the help of biennial fingerling or yearling stocking.  Although there is some walleye natural reproduction occurring in Round Lake, the strongest year classes have come from stocked years in the most recent studies.  As in the 1995 study, sampled walleyes in 2000 averaged 1.4 pounds.  Anglers can help to sustain fish populations and to provide some larger, trophy fish by releasing medium to large ones back into the lake.  Shoreline owners can continue to help by not fertilizing lawns, by not mowing right up to the water's edge, by updating septic systems or using dry composting toilets, and by protecting aquatic vegetation, especially emergent plants like bulrush and cattail.</p>",
