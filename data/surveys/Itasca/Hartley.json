                "narrative": "<p>Hartley Lake is a class 23 lake located 15 miles northwest of Nashwauk, Minnesota and within the Mississippi River Watershed.  A county owned public access is located on the northeast shore at the lake outlet. Hartley Lake has a surface area of 281 acres, a littoral area of 98 acres (35%), and a maximum depth of 49 feet.  Secchi disk transparency has ranged from 6.0 feet in 1989 to 11.2 feet in 1977.  The 2015 Secchi disk reading was 9.0 ft.  Hartley Lake has two inlets: the west fork of the Prairie River, which enters Hartley Lake on the north central shore and bog drainage from a bay on the southwest shore.  The lake outlets to the Prairie Riveron the northeast shore.  A  concrete dam controls the outlet.  The outlet dam was modified in 2011 to include a series of rock weirs which would facilitate fish passage from the Prairie River.  One of the project goals was to improve the Walleye population.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass as primary species of management with Black Crappie and Walleye as secondary species.  A targeted survey was conducted in June of 2015 to determine the status of the Walleye population using 6 gill nets.  A standard survey is scheduled for 2019, and the LMP will be updated at that time. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleye were sampled for a gill-net catch rate of 0.3 per net, which is below the expected range for the lake class.  One Walleye was 16.5 inches and the other was 18.4 inches.  Both walleye were age 5, and growth was similar to the statewide average.  Walleye have only been sampled in three of the past eight assessments. One Walleye was sampled in 1970 and two were sampled in 2003. Walleye stocking was discontinued in 2011 as repeated attempts had failed to establish a population in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have shown an increasing trend since the initial survey in 1954.  The 2015 catch of 6.8 per net was the highest on record, but remains within the expected range for the lake class.  Northern Pike ranged in length 12.9 to 34.3 inches, with a mean length of 22.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill-net catch rate increased from 1.8 per net in 2011 to 3.0 per net in 2015, which is slightly below the lake class median.  Tullibee ranged in length from 8.4 to 18.6 inches with a mean length of 13.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOne Yellow Perch was sampled for a gill-net catch rate of 0.2 per net, which is the lowest on record. Yellow Perch gill-net catch rates have shown a steady decline from 76.2 per net in 1989 and 34.3 in 2003, which was well above the lake class expected range. Yellow Perch are an important prey species and their decrease in abundance corresponds with the increase in Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hartley Lake is a moderately sized lake of 281 acres located in the northeast part of Itasca County, 15 miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN.  Thirty-five percent of the surface area is littoral  (? 15 feet), the maximum depth is 49 feet, and the lake contains moderately hard water, which has relatively good clarity (Secchi disk=10 ft).  The watershed topography consists of gently rolling sand hills of mixed hardwoods and pines on the uplands and woodland bogs in the lowlands. There are approximately 4 miles of shoreline and most of the suitable shoreline is developed as 70 homes or seasonal cabins were counted during this survey.  The headwaters of the Prairie River, which flows through this lake, is a minor watershed to the Mississippi River watershed. A dam, installed in 1938 at the outlet, has provided stable water levels for lakeshore residents but prohibits fish migration from the Prairie River into this lake and beyond.  A state owned public access, with a concrete boat ramp, is located by the outlet dam.        Temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements over the deepest part of the lake (49 feet) revealed that the lake was thermally stratified.  The warm water layer, where temperatures remained in the 70?F range, extended down to 10 feet, while the thermocline started at 11 feet and continued down to 21 feet where water temperatures cooled rapidly to the upper 40? F range.  Dissolved oxygen levels were adequate for fish to survive (2.0 ppm) from the surface down to the bottom of the thermocline layer (21 ft).  Dissolved oxygen levels below the thermocline were less than 1.0 ppm, due to bacteria decomposition on the bottom, which creates a zone from 22 feet to the bottom that was unsuitable for fish during the summer months.  This situation would continue until fall turnover.  The water clarity in this lake allows enough sunlight for aquatic plants to take root and grow on lake bottom soils down to 14 feet.  Since 35% of the lake is ?15 feet deep (littoral) almost one third of the soils on the lake bottom have enough light for plant growth.  From observations made along 20 vegetation transects and habitat mapping, it appears that a great variety of plant species utilized most of the suitable bottom soils for plant growth.  Seventy-five species of wetland or aquatic plants were noted growing in or around the shoreline including 56 species of emergent or floating-leaf species and 19 species of submerged plants.The northern pike gill-net catch of 4.7 fish/net was within the expected range for similar lakes, but higher than previous catch rates of 1.2 to 3.4 fish/gill net from past assessments.  Mean length of northern pike was 24.3 inches and almost 50% of the fish were age-6.  Only 4% of the catch exceeded 28 inches and no fish over 30 inches were sampled.  Growth rates were within normal ranges for all age groups and northern pike attained 24 inches near the end of their fifth growing season.Two large walleye were sampled in gill nets, which were determined to be age-8 and age-11 fish.  Walleyes have not been sampled in the previous three assessments (1989, 1982, and 1977).Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 73.8 fish/trap net, which far exceeded the expected range for similar lakes and was also the highest catch rate for any previous assessments.  Size structure was poor with lengths varying from 3.7 to 7.9 inches and only 16 % exceeded 6 inches.  Age-4 and 5 fish dominated the sample and the mean back-calculated lengths for each age indicated that growth was within a normal range for similar lakes.  Bluegill attained 6 inches near the end of their fifth growing season.Black crappie, although caught in both gear types, were more frequent in gill nets with a catch rate of 6.2 fish/net.  This catch rate was much higher than the expected range for similar lakes, but was within the range of catch rates, 1.8 to 13.4 fish/net, from previous assessments.  Small sized black crappies dominated both the gill net and trap net catches.  The mean length for gill nets was 6.4 inches and 6.6 inches for trap nets with no fish greater than 10 inches in either catch. Ages 2,4,or 6 were most prevalent in the catch and correspond to the 2001, 1999, or the 1997 year classes.  Black crappies grew slow in this lake as the average fish has to survive for six years to grow to 8 inches while on average they attain 8 inches at 4 years of age.    The yellow perch gill-net catch (34.3 fish/net) also exceeded the expected range of similar lakes, but also was within the range of catch rates (5.0 to 76.2 fish/net) from previous assessments.  The catch consisted of small fish, less than 6.5 inches, and contained fish from three age groups, ages 3, 4 and 5.  Growth was also below state averages as yellow perch require at least 5 years to attain 6 inches compared to three years statewide.       Tullibee were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 2.2 fish/net and had a mean length of 16.6 inches.  Tullibee were first sampled in the previous assessment (1989). White sucker were also caught in low abundance (1.2 fish/net) and individual fish were large sized, as the average length was 17.5 inches.Night electrofishing was conducted to sample largemouth and smallmouth bass and assess their populations.  A total of 63 largemouth bass and 5 smallmouth bass were captured for a catch rate of 51.1 and 4.1 fish per hour, respectively.  Size structure for largemouth bass was good with 28% of all fish over 8 inches also exceeded a preferred length of 15 inches.  Smallmouth bass size structure was also good with several fish over 14 inches.  Age structure for largemouth bass included fish from ages 2 to 9 with age-2 fish most prevalent (38%).  Age structure for smallmouth bass from electrofishing and gill nets (n=7) included fish from ages 5 to 7 with age-5 fish most prevalent.  Largemouth bass reached 12 inches during their fourth growing season, while smallmouth bass reached 11 inches during their third growing season.  Three seine hauls were conducted later in the summer to sample the extent of natural reproduction for game fish species. Young of year fish from the catch included 22 largemouth, which averaged 1.95 inches, 1 smallmouth bass, 16 sunfish that averaged 1.3 inches, 1 black crappie, 1 rock bass, and 1 yellow perch. Examinations for external and internal parasites indicated that Neascus was commonly found on northern pike, bluegills, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass, while yellow grub was prevalent in yellow perch.  Also thirteen tullibees were internally examined for Triaenophorus but none were infected.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hartley Lake is a 281-acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN.  The west fork of the Prairie River flows through the lake and water levels are controlled by a small low-head dam.  Hartley Lake has a maximum depth of 49 ft and moderate water clarity with a Secchi disk reading of 6 ft.  A public access is located on the east shore by the outlet.  Primary fish species include northern pike, panfish and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate was 5.7/net and was higher than any previous assessment and within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.2 to 4.7/net.  Catch rates appear to be increasing as the two highest catch rates were also the two most recent assessments.  Size structure was generally poor with few fish greater than 24 inches and only one fish greater than 30 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 25 inches at age five.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked in 2005, 2007, and 2009 at a higher than standard rate to improve the walleye population.  Despite recent stocking, no walleye were sampled in this assessment and past assessments have sampled few or no walleye.  Anglers report catching walleye, however the gill net catch indicates the population is low.  In the spring of 2011, the outlet dam was modified with a series of rock weirs to allow fish from the Prairie River to migrate into Hartley Lake and other lakes upstream.  It is hoped that this project will improve walleye and other fish populations in the watershed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was 13.0/trap net and was the lowest recorded catch rate, but was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 13.3 to 73.8/net.  Size structure was generally poor with some fish exceeding 7 inches, however no fish greater than 8 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for black crappie were 7.3/gill net and 1.2/trap net.  The catch rate in gill nets was much higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates have been highly variable from 0 to 13.4/ for gill nets and 1.4 to 9.5 for trap nets.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 9 inches and no fish larger than 10 inches.  Although scales were not collected for age and growth in this assessment, previous surveys have documented slow growth and poor size structure dating back to the first survey in 1954.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 10.2/gill net and was towards the upper end of the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable varying from 5.0 to 185.2/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 7 inches.  Yellow perch size structure has consistently been poor in past assessments and yellow perch are more important as prey than a species of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are difficult to sample in gill nets and trap nets and few fish were sampled in this assessment.  Although few fish were sampled, size structure was good with fish up to 19 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled by gill nets and trap nets include brown bullhead, golden shiner, tullibee, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Additional nearshore sampling using backpack electrofishing and seining sampled Johnny darter, Iowa darter, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, mottled sculpin, blackchin shiner and other young-of-the-year gamefish species previously sampled in gill nets and trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting fewer smaller fish and releasing medium and larger fish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hartley Lake is a 281-acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN.  A county owned cement access is located off Hartley Lake Road (off 53) on the west-central shore with parking for four rigs.  Hartley Lake has a maximum depth of 49 feet and 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has moderately soft water and fertility.  The water color is light green, resulting in visibility to 13 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was between 15 and 18 ft. in the summer of 2019.  Hartley Lake has two inlets and one outlet.  One small inlet that drains a wetland on the southwest shore and one larger inlet on the north-central shore that is the West Fork of the Prairie River.  The West Fork of the Prairie River is the outlet and is located on the east-central shore.   The water control structure (i.e. dam), was modified in 2011 by adding a series of seven rock weirs and by cutting notches in the existing metal sheet piling, allowing fish movement upstream and downstream.  Other similar area lakes include Bello, Loon, Ruby, Three Island, and Thistledew.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 survey was the ninth survey of the fish community since 1954.  Surveys occur to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.  Gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  No special regulations are present.  The 2012 management plan indicated Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were primary management species, while Black Crappie and Walleye were secondary management species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had a high catch rate, above average size distribution, and average growth.  The gill net catch in 2019 was the highest observed.  Higher catches are undesirable, as they typically indicate higher density populations with poor size structure and slow growth.  Lengths of pike ranged from 14 to 34 inches, with an average of 21 inches.  Size structure was above average, as 42% of pike exceeded 21 inches and 9% exceeded 28 inches. Pike were aged from 2 to 11 years old.  Growth was average, resulting in pike taking five years to exceed 21 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release pike exceeding 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had an above average catch rate, with average size distribution and growth in the 2003 electrofishing survey.  Only seven Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2019, and ranged from 7 to 15 inches.  Electrofishing did not occur in 2019 due to staff reductions and weather; however, the 2003 electrofishing catch rate was nearly twice the long-term average of Grand Rapids Area electrofishing surveys.  Lengths in 2003 ranged from 6 to 19 inches, with an average of 12 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had above average catch rates and size distribution, and below average growth.  The trap net catch in 2019 was higher than the lake average, while the gill net catch was similar.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches, with average lengths of 8.4 and 9.2 inches in the gill nets and trap nets.  Size structure was above average, as 77% of crappie exceeded 8 inches and 42% exceeded 10 inches.  Typical of most crappie populations, there were two primary year classes in each of the past two surveys.  Age 8 fish were most common in 2019.  Growth was below average, resulting in crappie taking seven years to exceed 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population had a low catch rate, above average size distribution, and average growth.  The gill net catch in 2019 was the highest observed.  Ten Walleye were sampled in 2019, which is more than the total number of Walleye sampled in all previous surveys of six.  Despite stocking Walleye 21 times from the 1940s through the 2010s, gill net catch rates have never exceeded 0.3/net.  Stocking was discontinued after 2011.  Statewide Walleye stocking guidelines recommend discontinuing stocking if stocking fails to produce a viable fishery supporting a catch rate of 2.0/gill net.  The dam removal in 2011 had a greater positive influence on the Walleye population than 65 years of stocking, likely due to better access to suitable spawning locations and river connectivity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had an average catch rate, size distribution and growth.  The trap net catch in 2019 was similar to the lake average.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches, with an average of 6.6 inches.  Size structure was average, as 71% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 6 inches and 13% exceeded 8 inches.  Growth was only evaluated in 2004, and was similar to the statewide average at that time.  Recruitment appeared to be consistent.  Bluegill took six years to exceed 6 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Bluegill exceeding 8 inches to help maintain or improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass population had a low catch rate, average size distribution, and below average growth in the 2003 electrofishing survey.  Only two Smallmouth Bass were sampled in 2019, while only eight have ever been sampled with nets.  Five were sampled electrofishing in 2003.  The 2003 catch rate was one quarter the average catch rate for Grand Rapids area lakes.  A 13 and 17-inch fish were sampled in 2019, while lengths ranged from 14 to 16 inches in the 2003 electrofishing survey.  Electrofishing was not conducted in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly three Yellow Perch and no Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in 2019 indicating a low number of prey are available to support gamefish populations.  The number of perch sampled the past two surveys were by far the lowest number sampled in all surveys.  Although higher Walleye numbers resulting from dam modification are viewed by anglers as a positive, prey consumption rates are also likely higher.  Tullibee were sampled in seven of nine surveys.  Other species sampled included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse,  White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n</p>",
