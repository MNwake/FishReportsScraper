                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a small, late-mesotrophic lake in Steele County.  Beaver Lake was surveyed in mid-July of 2007 to monitor the fish community and describe the lake's characteristics.  \n\nAquatic and Nearshore Habitat\nThe water quality of Beaver Lake is better than average for the area.  Clarity is fair with a 4.8 foot Secchi disk reading.  The water tends to be green in color due to algae.  The water quality is likely influenced by agricultural and municipal/residential inputs, increasing nutrient loads and decreasing water clarity.  Good water quality is a major attribute in keeping a desirable fish community in Beaver Lake.\n\nBeaver Lake provides spawning habitat for a variety of fishes.  Good spawning habitat exists for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch and largemouth bass as wind protected areas, shallow vegetation, and firm substrates are common throughout the lake's littoral zone.  Northern pike maintain a small, self-sufficient population but reproduction may be limited due to a lack of access to wetland areas.  Although some spawning habitat for lithophilic species such as walleye and sucker exists in shoalwater areas, the walleye population is maintained by fingerling stocking.\n\nMuch of the shoreline and riparian zone of Beaver Lake has been disturbed and modified for residential development.  Development adversely impacts fish habitat by reducing aquatic vegetation, removing woody debris, and destabilizing lakeshores.  Housing density is high around most of the lake, and numerous small cabins exist in close proximity to each other.  The number of homes/cabins increased slightly since 2002.  In 2006, 95 dwellings were counted resulting in a density of 51 per shoreline mile.  Despite this heavy development, most of the shoreline is stable, either being natural sand or cobble, and observations at vegetation transect sites indicate that less than 10% of the shoreline has been stabilized with rock riprap.  Turf grass lawns maintained to the waters edge were fairly common, occurring in 40% of the vegetation transects.  Turf grass lawns often facilitate runoff and shoreline erosion.  Coarse woody debris was limited and did not occur in any vegetation transect.  Coarse woody debris is known to provide valuable fish habitat and contributes to the food chain by providing substrate for invertebrate production.  Dock densities were high and may provide cover for some fish given the absence of coarse woody debris.\n\nBeaver Lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community at this time, providing valuable cover and spawning habitat for a variety of fish species.  Vegetation transect sampling indicated a similar plant community as found in previous surveys.  Plant growth occurred to over 9 feet in depth.  Sago and bushy pondweeds were the most commonly occurring plants in the vegetation transects.  Curly-leaf pondweed may be seasonally abundant as well but had largely senesced prior to the survey.  Floating leaf and emergent vegetations occurred in 20% of the vegetation transects and were primarily found on the lake\u0019s western end.  Floating leaf and emergent vegetation provide important over-head cover for fish and enhance spawning habitat for several species.  The diverse plant community is a major attribute in maintaining a desirable fish community in Beaver Lake.\n\nFishery\nWalleye were caught at a high rate compared to similar lakes, and the gill net catch of 12/ gill net was a record for Beaver Lake.  Most walleye were 13 to 18 inches.  Bluegills were abundant. The size distribution included good numbers of larger fish as 13% exceeded 8 inches in length and fish exceeding 9 inches were sampled.  Black crappie were captured at a relatively high rate compared to similar lakes.  Most crappie were relatively small with a mean size of 6.4 inches.  Common carp, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch were also present at low densities.  Given the catch rate and desirable size structures of walleye and bluegill, excellent angling opportunity exists in Beaver Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 94-acre lake located in Steele County near the Town of Ellendale. Residential development has disturbed and altered much of Beaver Lake's shoreline, as the density of houses around the lake is high. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge. Despite extensive shoreline modifications, Beaver Lake maintains above average water quality for this area of Minnesota. Beaver Lake is rare in that it supports a diverse and abundant aquatic vegetation community which provides valuable cover and spawning habitat for several fish species. A county owned boat access is located on the east side of the lake. Beaver Lakes sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass, white crappie and yellow perch. The walleye population is maintained through stocking, as walleye frylings are stocked annually at a rate of 21,000/year. A lake population assessment was conducted the week of 7-9-2012 to monitor the fish community of Beaver Lake using 2 gill nets and 8 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality indicators were collected on 7-9-2012. Beaver Lake water was relatively clear for this area and this time of year with a secchi depth reading of 5.0 ft. The lake is situated in a watershed with abundant agricultural fields; therefore it tends to be highly productive. The water appeared green and was likely a result of an algae bloom. A temperature and dissolved oxygen profile was taken. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 8.4 ppm at the water's surface to 0.0 ppm at 20.0 ft.  Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 13 and 14 ft of depth as evidenced by a drop in temperature from 77.5 to 75.0 degrees Fahrenheit. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and black crappies are the primary management species at Beaver Lake. Black crappie catch rates have steadily declined over the last two decades from 19.7, 13.7, 8.3, and 3.0/ trap net in 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012, respectively.  The observed catch rate of 3.0/trap net in 2012 was about average for similarly classified lakes. Five year classes of black crappie were sampled in Beaver Lake (2007 - 2011).  Twenty-eight percent of black crappies were from the 2009 year class (age-3), 39% were from the 2008 year class (age-4), and 22% were from the 2007 year class (age-5). Black crappies tended to be small as lengths ranged from 3.2 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.2 inches. Black crappie growth rates were average when compared to other lakes in the area. Age-1, age-2, age-3, age-4, and age-5 black crappies averaged 3.2, 6.0, 6.8, 7.5, and 9.1 inches in length, respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates in Beaver Lake have historically been very high; greatly exceeding what would be expected in similar lakes. Since 1997, catch rates of bluegills in trap nets have been at or above 84.1/ trap net. High catch rates continued in 2012, as bluegills were captured at a rate of 94.5/ trap net, which is high when compared to similar lakes. The bluegill population is relatively young as age-2 (2010 year class) and age-3 (2011 year class) bluegills made up nearly two-thirds of the of the catch. Age-4, age-5, and age-6 bluegills comprised 11%, 14%, and 10% of the catch. The oldest bluegills captured were estimated to be age-7 (2005 year class). Age-0 and age-1 bluegills were not sampled, likely because they were too small to be sampled by the gears used. Although the bluegill population is young, the size structure was fair as 44% of the bluegills captured were over 6.0 inches long. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.4 inches and averaged 5.8 inches. Growth of bluegills in Beaver Lake appears to be average, when compared to other area lakes. Bluegills averaged 4.1 inches at age-2, 5.0 inches at age-3, 6.5 inches at age-4, 7.1 inches at age-5, 8.0 inches at age-6, and 8.3 inches at age-7.   <br> \n <br> \nSecondary management species in Beaver Lake include walleye and largemouth bass. Largemouth bass are not effectively sampled using gill nets and trap nets, so the numbers given do not accurately represent the largemouth bass population. Four largemouth bass were captured in gill nets and trap nets, ranging from 5.4 to 16.7 inches in length, and represented 3 year classes (2007, 2008, and 2011; age-5, age-4, and age-1).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management in Beaver Lake is primarily accomplished through annual fryling stocking at a rate of 21,000/year. Walleye frylings are around 1 to 1.5 inches in length as opposed to walleye fry which are around 0.25 inches long. In the 2012 population assessment, walleyes were captured at a rate of 7.5/ gill net, which is higher than lakes similar to Beaver. The 2012 catch rate of 7.5/ gill net was down from 12.0/ gill net in the 2007 survey. Annual fryling stocking appears to be successful, as 7 year classes were sampled (2005 - 2011). Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 7 years old with age-6 walleyes (2006 year class) representing one-third of the walleyes sampled.  Walleyes sampled ranged from 8.5 to 24.2 inches in length and averaged 16.9 inches. Mean length at age estimates indicated good growth of walleye in Beaver Lake with average lengths being 8.7 inches at age-1, 12.5 inches at age-2, 14.2 inches at age-3, 16.5 inches at age-4, 18.1 inches at age-5, 19.4 inches at age-6, and 21.8 inches at age-7.  <br> \n <br> \nOne 16.5 inch channel catfish was captured during the population assessment. This is the first time that a channel catfish has been captured in a Beaver Lake assessment. Common carp catch rates have historically been low and the trend continued in 2012 as no common carp were captured. One age-4 northern pike was sampled, which is consistent with past surveys. Nine white crappies ranging in length from 7.5 to 9.2 inches were captured. This is the first time that white crappies have been sampled in an assessment. Black and white crappies can be distinguished based on the number of spines on their dorsal fin (back). Black crappies will have 7-8 dorsal spines, and white crappies will have 5-6 dorsal spines. Hybrid sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed were present but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Beaver Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 94-acre lake located approximately 5 miles northwest of the town of Ellendale in Steele County. Beaver Lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet with approximately 45% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the overall condition of Beaver Lake as, \"suitable for swimming and wading, with good clarity and low algae levels throughout the open water season.\" Much of the shoreline has been developed by private homeowners and the lake experiences heavy boat traffic during much of summer. A county park on the east side of the lake includes a concrete boat ramp as well as fishing pier and swimming beach. Beaver Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed the week of 10 July 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 3 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 68 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 12 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net. The Black Crappie catch rate in 2023 was the lowest since 1997 and continued a general declining trend. Black Crappie were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 4.3/gill net. Black Crappie gill net catches mirror the decline seen in trap nets. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 7.1 to 8.6 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. Black Crappie were age 3-5. Growth was greater than statewide average for age 1 and 2 fish but slowed after age 3. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant fish sampled in 2023 with a total of 142 sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 15.8/net. Bluegill catch rates have been declining since a peak of 198.7/net in 2002. However, 15.8/net would still be considered \"typical\" and is not cause for concern. Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.7 to 8.9 inches with an average of 5.4 inches. The percentage of Bluegills greater than 8 inches was the second most since 1992. Bluegill were aged using scales and otoliths. Bluegills from 9 year classes (age 1-8 and 10) were sampled indicating consistent recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 65 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 56.7/hour which was a decrease from 2017 (153.0/hour) but was similar to the only other sample taken in 2007 of 49.4/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.1 to 20.6 inches with an average of 11.5 inches. The abundance of smaller Largemouth Bass in the past two surveys was seen as a positive influence on the Bluegill population and may have been responsible for the decrease in Bluegill catch rate. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 31 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 10.3/net. The high Walleye catch rate in 2023 stopped a trend of decreasing catch rates since 2007. Walleye ranged from 7.6 to 21.0 inches with an average of 14.1 inches. An additional 12 Walleyes ranging from 6.9 to 26.1 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears were aged using otoliths and ranged from age-1 to age-9 with 4 year classes present. Approximately 71% of aged fish were age-4. Fingerling stocking was resumed in 2018. Frylings had been stocked since 2008 with limited success. The age-4 fish sampled in 2023 can be traced back to fingerling stocking in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common fish sampled with gill nets in 2017 but, only 3 were sampled in 2023 (1.0/gill net). Three yellow perch were also sampled with trap nets (0.33/trap net). Yellow Perch in both gears ranged from 7.2 inches to 8.9 inches. The decline in Yellow Perch numbers may be due to the increase in Walleye numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are rare in Beaver Lake and for the first time no Northern Pike were sampled with any gears in 2023. Northern Pike have averaged 0.9/gill net since 1997 and have never exceeded 2.0/gill net. Northern Pike are not stocked in Beaver Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. They ranged from 76.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.7 ppm at the surface to 52.0 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.1 ppm at 23 feet. A thermocline was detected between 14 and 17 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 17 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike also remain low in abundance but similar to  previous netting results.  The average fish is 26 inches and around 4.5 pounds.  Bluegill abundance is extremely high for this lake type and the highest recorded level since surveys began in 1947.  Two strong age-classes of 5 and 6 year old fish dominate this population.  Bluegill range between 6 - 8 inches with an average weight of 0.2 pounds.  Black crappie were caught in numbers similar to previous surveys.  The average fish is around 7 inches and 0.2 pounds, which is similar to bluegill.  The crappie population is also dominated by two age-classes of fish 5 and 6 years old.  Yellow perch, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead were also sampled during the survey.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 94 acre lake located approximately 5 miles northwest of the town of Ellendale in Steele County. It has a maximum depth of 27 feet with approximately 45% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Located at the top of the watershed, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the overall condition of the lake as, \"suitable for swimming and wading, with good clarity and low algae levels throughout the open water season.\" Much of the shoreline has been developed by private homeowners and the lake experiences heavy boat traffic during much of the summer. A county park on the east side of the lake includes a concrete boat ramp as well as fishing pier and swimming beach. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Walleye. Since 2008, Walleye frylings have been stocked annually (except for 2009) at rate of 500/littoral acre.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 3 gill nets, 10 trap nets, and 60 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 69 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 6.9/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. This was an increase over the 2012 catch rate of 3.0/net which was the lowest since 1997. Despite the 2012 dip, Black Crappie numbers have been strong over the past 20 years with a mean of 10.3/net. Lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.3 inches with an average of 7.8 inches. Only 5% of the population was larger than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant fish sampled in 2017 with a total of 571 sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 57.1/net, which indicated high numbers were present. The 2017 catch rate was the lowest recorded at Beaver Lake since 1997. From 1997 to 2012, catch rates ranged from 84.2/net to 198.7/net with an average of 106.6/net. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 9.2 inches with an average of 5.4 inches. Only 5% of the population exceeded 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 153 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 153.0/hour which was an increase over the only other sample taken in 2007 of 49.4/hour. Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 19.9 inches with an average of 7.9 inches. Approximately 14% of the population exceeded 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the most commonly sampled predator species in the gill nets in 2017. A total of 16 were sampled for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which indicated high numbers were present. Despite the high catch rate relative to similar lakes, catch rates have declined from 12.0/net in 2007 to 7.5/net in 2012 to 5.3/net in 2017. Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 24.0 inches with an average of 17.1 inches. Approximately 80% of the catchable population was larger than 15 inches. An additional 8 Walleye ranging from 13.6 to 27.8 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 64% were 3 years old. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most commonly sampled fish with gill nets in 2017. A total of 39 ranging from 6.0 to 8.4 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 13.0/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. This was the highest catch on record since 1997 and represents a huge increase over the 2007 (1.5/net) and 2012 (1.0/net) catch rates. A vast majority of the fish were less than 8 inches in length. The low Northern Pike abundance and declining Walleye abundance may have allowed the Yellow Perch population to rebound a bit. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remained rare in 2017 with just 4 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which indicated low numbers were present. This was similar to the 1997-2017 average catch rate of 1.1/net and only the second time the catch rate has exceeded 1.2/net. Lengths were small ranging from 18.5 to 20.2 inches and an average of 19.4 inches. An additional two fish were sampled with trap nets with the largest measuring 30.3 inches. Overall, a low abundance Northern Pike population was self-sustaining in Beaver Lake and provided an additional, but rare fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nA single 16.5 inch Common Carp was sampled with gill nets in 2017. In five samples since 1997, only once in 2007 (5.0/net) has the catch rate exceeded 0.5/net. Although absence was preferred, their low numbers meant they had a negligible impact on the lake and fish community. <br> \n <br> \nA small number of bullheads were sampled in 2017. Three Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net and five Yellow Bullheads were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.5/net, both indicating low numbers were present. Black and Yellow Bullheads have been sampled in low numbers since 1997, with never more than 1 per gill or trap net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. They ranged from 77.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.2 ppm at the surface to 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 27 feet. A thermocline was detected between 15 and 17 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 19 feet. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Beaver Lake is a popular waterski and jet-ski lake, which can make angling difficult at times.  A fishery survey was conducted on Beaver Lake in mid-July 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Walleye abundance was at an all time high for this lake, with a catch of 11.5 per gill net.  Most walleye were between 17 and 22 inches.  Bluegill are abundant, although most fish are 5 inches in length with a few fish up to 8 inches.  Black crappie are also common with most fish around 7 to 9 inches.  A few northern pike are present.  Largemouth bass probably provide good angling opportunities.  Boaters should lake care to not harm the waterlilies found on the south shore in the western portion of the lake.  Waterlilies and other aquatic plants are important habitat for fish.  </p>",
