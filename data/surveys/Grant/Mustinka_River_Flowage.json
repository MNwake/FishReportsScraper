                "narrative": "<p>Mustinka Lake is a small man-made impoundment created in the late 1930's by constructing a dam on the Mustinka River in Grant County.  Sediment deposition has reduced the maximum depth of the reservoir from approximately 18 feet to 8 feet.  Water quality, clarity, and aquatic habitat are considered poor.  Periodic winterkill also limits the fish community in Mustinka Lake.  Pine Ridge County Park is located on the northwestern shore of the lake.  The park provides a small boat access and shoreline fishing opportunities along the dam.  Some anglers fish below the dam in the pool created by the outflow.Small walleye and northern pike are currently abundant in Mustinka Lake.  Walleye catches averaged 10.5 fish per gill net.  Most of the fish were age-2 that averaged about 13 inches in length in June of 2003.  Walleye fry were stocked in three of the last five years, however this year class corresponds to a year of no stocking in 2001.   Northern pike catches averaged 15.5 fish per net.  Fish ranged from 17 to 25 inches in length and averaged about 1.8 pounds.  Black crappie may also provide some angling opportunities in the near future.  Most of the fish captured in 2003 were two year old fish that averaged about 7 inches in length.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mustinka Lake is a small man-made impoundment created in the late 1930's by constructing a dam on theMustinka River.  Extreme sedimentation has reduced the maximum depth of the reservoir fromapproximately 18 to 8 feet since the dam was built.  Hypereutrophic conditions and periodic winterkillhas limited the fish community in Mustinka Lake.Northern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 13.0 fish/net in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged3.5 fish/net in 1984 and 4.5 fish/net in 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 2.7 pounds. Approximately 60% of the fish were 21 inches in total length or greater.  Northern pike sub-adults(mean weight of 0.4 pounds) and northern pike fry were stocked in 1994 following a suspectedwinterkill.  However, the age class structure of fish captured in gillnets indicates that many northernpike survived the winterkill or migrated into Mustinka Lake.  Yellow perch catches averaged 13.0fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.0 fish/net in 1984 and 1.0 fish/net in 1979.  Many of thefish captured in 1995 would be desirable to anglers.  Forty percent of the yellow perch captured ingillnets were 10 inches in total length or greater.  Walleye catches averaged 0.5 fish/gillnet and 1.0fish/trapnet.  Eight of the eleven walleye captured were cohorts of the 1994 year class (age-1) whichcorresponds to a fry stocking in 1994 following a suspected winterkill.  Walleye may also migratedownstream from Lightning Lake.  Black bullhead catches averaged 16.5 fish/gillnet and 22.6fish/trapnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 31.0 and 6.0 fish/gillnet in 1984 and 1979, respectively. Trapnet catches ranged from 19.3 - 110.6 fish/net in previous surveys.  The black bullhead populationis currently comprised of small individuals.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Whitesucker, white crappie, and common carp were also sampled in survey gear.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mustinka Lake is located four miles north of Herman in Grant County.  The lake is a small man-made impoundment of the Mustinka River. The dam was constructed in the late 30's.  Sediment deposition has reduced maximum depth of the reservoir from approximately 18 feet to 8 feet.  Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity. Secchi disk measurements generally do not exceed 2.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are limited by poor water clarity and thus sunfish densities are low.  Mustinka Lake is prone to occasional winterkill.  A county owned park (Pine Ridge Park) and public launch are located on the northwest side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant.  Mean weight was 2.2 lbs.  Northern pike as large as 29.0 inches were captured. Walleye are stocked and present in  moderate density.Most captured walleye were 12.0 to 14.0 inches in length at the time of the survey. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mustinka currently supports a tremendous number of black crappie. Trap net catches exceeded 20.0 fish per net. Average size was small due to the young fish making up the population.  No black crappie exceeded 9.5 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were black bullhead, common carp, bluegill, largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mustinka Lake is a shallow impoundment created by a WPA dam built in the late 1930's.  Mustinka Lake was lowered in the fall of 1967, to remove rough fish and facilitate improvements to the swimming beach.  The lake was refilled during the spring of 1968.  The dam prevents fish immigration from downstream sources; however, fish can enter the lake from upstream sources, such as Lightning Lake.  Due to low water, gillnets were not utilized during the 1990 assessment.  Black Bullhead were the most frequently captured species represented in the survey.  Of the 354 fish captured in trapnets, 287 (81%) were Black Bullheads.  Mean weight of the Black Bullhead was 0.21 lbs.  The bullhead population did not appear to have sufficient numbers of large individuals to constitute commercial or sport values.  Small Black Bullhead were abundant in 1979 and 1984 surveys.  Black Crappie abundance and size structure has been highly variable.  The 1979 assessment had net catches of 26.5 Black Crappie/trapnet with a PSD of 65.0%.  CPUE and PSD values dropped to 3.5 fish/trapnet and 39.0%, respectively in 1984.  The present survey had an average catch of 3.88 fish/trapnet.  PSD was calculated at 8.0%. All crappie netted were age 1 and 2.  If age 2 crappie survive the winter of 1990-91, they should contribute to the angler's creel in the summer of 1991.  Black Crappie averaged 6.2 inches at age 2.  One White Crappie was taken in the trapnets (0.13 White Crappie/trapnet).  No White Crappies were taken in 1979 but 20 were netted in the 1984 survey (2.50 White Crappie/trapnet).  The Black Crappie/White Crappie ratio is probably dependent on water clarity/vegetation and winter oxygen levels. Average Northern Pike trapnet catches have declined from 3.75 fish/trapnet in 1979 to 1.38 fish/trapnet in 1990.  PSD has increased correspondingly from 18.0% to 45.0%.  Mean weight of the Northern Pike sampled was 2.11lbs with one 33.0 data suggest Northern Pike have adequate natural recruitment with age 1, 2, and 3 year old fish well represented. Mustinka Lake has not been stocked with Northern Pike since 1986.  Growth is considered fair with age 3 fish averaging 21.4 inches.  Due to the shallowness if Mustinka Lake, thermal stress undoubtedly affects growth and survival. Five Walleye were captured in the 1990 trapnet survey. Four fish were captured in 1984.  Mustinka Lake has not been stocked with Walleye since 1978.  It is conceivable that Mustinka Lake has a viable Walleye population; however, Walleye fry, fingerlings, or adults may have moved downstream from Lightning Lake.  Mean weight of captured Walleye was 2.92 lbs.  Although the fish were not aged they appear as if they could have been cohorts of the same year class.  Other species of fish netted during the survey, include Carp, White Sucker, Hybrid Sunfish, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  Approximately 4,500 Bluegill were stocked into Mustinka Lake in 1981.  Only 3 Bluegills were sampled in the 1984 assessment. Survival and natural recruitment are very poor. Carp may be sufficiently abundant to be detrimental to the aquatic environment and sportfish populations.  Control or removal options are limited to a draw down, but benefits would be very short-lived.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Mustinka River Flowage is a 91-acre, man-made impoundment of the Mustinka River.  The dam was constructed in the late 1930s.  With age of the reservoir and sediment deposits, maximum depth has decreased from 18.0 feet to approximately 10.0 feet.  Average depth is 4.0 feet.   This shallow, productive reservoir is located four miles north of Herman in Grant County. The inlet of upper Mustinka River is on the east shoreline.   A gravel boat launch is located on the northwest side of the reservoir within the Pine Ridge Park.  Park amenities include the boat launch, primitive camping, picnic facilities, and a swimming beach.  The park entrance is located off of Grant County Road 34.  Water quality is poor during summer months due to excessive nutrient loading and suspension of bottom sediments. <br> \n   <br> \nA standard lake survey was completed in 2018 to assess the fish community of the Mustinka River Flowage and assess success of Walleye stockings.  Walleyes proved to be abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 36.5 fish/net.  Capture lengths ranged from 7.1 to 21.6 inches and averaged 13.7 inches.  Most of the Walleye catch was comprised of two- and three-year old fish.  Age distribution of the catch extended only to age 5.  Approximately 20% of the Walleye catch measured 15.0 inches or larger. The largest Walleye captured measured 21.6 inches. Five year classes were present but majority of the fish were from the 2016 year class, suggesting fry stocking worked well.  Age distribution of the catch also included good numbers of three-year-old Walleyes.  No stocking occurred in 2015, thus these fish are likely natural recruits. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant.  Size distribution of pike catch was exceptional.  Approximately 80% of Northern Pike captures exceeded 21.0 inches in length.  Average length was 26.5 inches.  The largest pike capture was a memorable-size fish measuring 36.0 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nCatches of other gamefishes were very limited.  No Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch were caught. Only two Bluegills were captured.  The largest measured 8.5 inches.  Black Crappie were modest in comparison to high catch rates recorded during the 2008 survey.  At least two age groups of crappie were reflected in length-frequency distribution of the catch, but annual recruitment appeared to be very limited in recent years.  This is typical of Black Crappie populations which can undergo boom and bust fisheries as a strong year class moves through the system. Bluegill catch rates have typically been low, likely due to lack of aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in this survey included Black Bullheads, Common Carp, and White Suckers.  Catches and abundance of these habitat tolerant fishes tend to be elevated when habitat conditions tend to stress gamefish populations and limit community diversity. <br> \n <br> \nIn sustained absence of winterkill, survey catch statistics suggest the Mustinka River Flowage will support good Walleye and Northern Pike fishing for several years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Mustinka River Flowage is not currently a designated infested water. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> \n</p>",

This decline may be due in part to the appearance of White Crappie and/or to the increase in numbers of Black Bullheads. Black Bullheads are the predominant specie. They are small averaging 6/lb. The White Crappie average 1.37 lbs and at present could provide a trophy fishery. Northern Pike are also of abundant in the age and length frequencies and exhibit rapid growth. A natural run or natural reproduction (unlikely) contribute to the Walleye population. Walleyes grow extremely fast.</p>",
