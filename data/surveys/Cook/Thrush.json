Thrush Lake is a Designated Stream Trout Lake     having experimental regulations.  Daily and possession limit is one brook trout, minimum length is 18 inches, gear is restricted to artificial     lures and flies with single hooks (no treble hooks), and there is no winter season.          The average size of brook trout has decreased since angling reopened in May 1992.  Brook trout grow more slowly now compared to years when     minnows were abundant (1988-1991), and so are less likely to exceed 18 inches in length.          Thrush Lake has provided excellent catch-and-release fishing for brook trout 12 and 13 inches long, and offered a reasonable chance of     catching brook trout over 14 inches long.  Some angling parties have been very successful by fly fishing in early spring.</p>",

Brook trout seldom exceed 18 inches, but the lake provides good catch-and-release fishing for brook trout 12 to 17 inches long.Thrush Lake is the highest-elevation lake in Minnesota managed for fishing.  It is inherently unproductive, with only a small minnow population, and can support only a small brook trout population.  Because of the low productivity and the special regulations that restrict harvest by anglers, fewer brook trout are stocked in Thrush Lake in recent years than in most other lakes of similar size.  The result of all these conditions is that brook trout are not abundant in Thrush Lake, but they grow faster and reach a larger size than before the stocking rate was reduced and when compared to brook trout in most other lakes.</p>",

The use of bait is prohibited, and anglers are limited to the use of artficial lures and flies only, with a single hook.  The current (2008) lake management plan established a long range goal for brook trout in this lake of a minimum fall trap net catch of 3.5 age-1 or older fish/set, with 10% or more of fish larger than 12 inches also exceeding 16 inches in length.  Because of the deterioration of the access trails, transport of trap nets to this lake has not been possible since 2008; assessments have instead been done using open-water angling. <br> \n <br> \nIn this special assessment, DNR angling crews caught (and released alive) 18 brook trout over three days.  Brook trout collected ranged in length from 15.0 to 19.7 inches, with 89% of fish taken exceeding 16 inches.  No scale samples were collected, but based on past assessments of this lake, fish taken in 2014 were probably three or four years old.

                "narrative": "<p>Thrush Lake is a designated stream trout lake, managed exclusively for brook trout since 1980.  It is one of the Grand Marais area's \"trophy trout\" lakes, and as such is closed to winter fishing, with only catch and release fishing allowed during the open water season.  The use of bait is prohibited, and anglers are limited to the use of artficial lures and flies only, with a single hook.  The long range goal for brook trout established in the current (2018) lake management plan (LMP) was to maintain a population with two catchable-sized (over 10 inch) year classes, with 10% or more of fish over 12 inches exceeding 16 inches in length.  This was the first of three targeted surveys using short-term gill net sets scheduled in the 2018 LMP to determine whether goals for this lake could be met after the stocking frequency was reduced to every odd-numbered year (started in 2021).   <br> \n <br> \nThrush Lake supported a high-quality brook trout population in 2021.  In this targeted survey, 18 brook trout were captured in 12 short-term gill net sets made over a single day of sampling.  All but one were released alive.  Fish taken in 2021 ranged in length from 12.4 to 18.7 inches.  Results indicated that management goals for the lake had been met in 2021.  Although no fish were aged, it was clear from the length frequency distribution that  at least two year classes had contributed to the catch, both of catchable sizes.  Twenty-eight percent of the 12-inch or larger fish taken exceeded 16 inches in length.  Only fish from the 2019, 2018, and 2015 fingerling stockings (fish 2, 3, or 6 years of age) were likely to have been present during this survey.  All three may have contributed to the catch.  <br> \n</p>",

Older brook trout grew more slowly, compared to growth in years whenh minnows were abundant (1988-1991), and were less likely to exceed 18 inches in length.  Illegal harvest of brook trout under 18 inches long probably further reduces the number reaching this length.Thrush Lake has provided excellent catch-and-release fishing for brook trout over 12 and 13 inches long, and offered a reasonable chance of catching brook trout over 15 inches long.  Some angling parties have been very successful by fly-fishing in early spring.</p>",
