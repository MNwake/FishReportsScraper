                "narrative": "<p>The primary gamefish sampled in Rush Lake included northern pike (5.7/gill net) and walleye (3.0/gill net), black crappie (7.7/gill net), bluegill (7.3/trap net) and white crappie (1.5/trap net).  The catch rate of these species were within the expected range for lake class 43.     The northern pike catch rate has increased significantly from the 1988 survey.  The average weight of northern pike captured in gill nets was 1.8 pounds which was within the expected range.  In previous surveys (1982 and 1988) northern pike longer than 25 inches were caught, but during the 1993 survey northern pike ranged from 9.7 to 23.5 inches and averaged 20.1 inches.     The walleye population in Rush Lake appears to be maintained with fry stocking.  The catch rate was similar to the 1988 survey (8.33/lift).  Walleye sampled in gill nets averaged 1.8 pounds and 16.5 inches.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.7 to 24.1 inches.  Of the nine walleye caught in gill nets, 3 (33%) were longer than 20 inches.     The black crappie catch rate appeared to decrease during each of the last three surveys, 1982 (92.67), 1988 (25.67), and 1993 (7.7), but remains within the expected range.  The average black crappie caught in gill nets weighed 0.2 pounds and was 6.0 inches in length.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.2 to 9.9 inches with only 1 of 21 fish longer than 9.0 inches.       The bluegill catch rate remained similar to the 1988 survey.  The average bluegill weighed only 0.1 pounds which was lower than expected for lake class 43.  The average bluegill was 5.7 inches long and ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches.  Of the 44 bluegill caught in trap nets, six (14%) were longer than 7 inches.     The catch rate of white crappie was substantially lower during the 1988 survey, but remained within the expected range.  During the 1988 survey two strong year classes were sampled (1986 and 1987).  Based on aging and length frequency data from 1993, it appeared a strong year class has not developed since 1987.  The average white crappie sampled in trap nets weighted 0.4 pounds (within the expected range) and was 9.9 inches long.  White crappie sampled during 1993 ranged in length from 9.2 to 12.2 inches which was similar to the range of fish sampled during 1988.       Several largemouth bass were sampled during the summer survey, but in low numbers.  The largest largemouth bass caught was 17.5 inches.  The nongamefish catch rates were all within the expected range for lake class 43 or below lower than expected as in the case of black bullheads.  The catch rate of common carp appeared to decrease in both gill nets and trap nets over the last three surveys.  During the 1993 survey only one carp was caught.       During the spring largemouth bass were assessed with boat electrofishing.  The Briggs chain (Rush, Julia, Briggs) were assessed on one night and considered one lake for analysis.  Thirty seven largemouth bass were caught at a rate of 17.1/hour of sampling or 52.6/hour of on-time.  The bass ranged in length from 6.8 to 14.7 inches and averaged 12.5 inches.  The average bass weighed 0.6 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush, Briggs, and Julia Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. River fish species are present because of connections to the Elk River. An initial standard survey was completed in 1982 to collect fisheries data. This particular report is from 161-acre Rush Lake.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance was low. Four age classes were sampled and growth was above average. Young of the year Northern Pike were also present.\n\nWalleye abundance was about average as well as growth. Four age classes were sampled.\n\nLargemouth Bass were sampled only in the shoreline seining and were all young of the year fish. \n\nBluegill abundance was average and was significantly higher than in Briggs or Julia. Age one, three, and five were most abundant of the seven age classes sampled with average growth.\n\nBlack Crappie abundance was high with many smaller sized fish.\n\nWhite Crappie abundance was average along with fish size.\n\nWalleye abundance was low, while the average weight was higher than expected.\n\nYellow Perch abundance was about average for the lake class.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.\n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 22 native species of fish including several species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Smallmouth Bass) and some species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, and Common Carp).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in August 2015 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Rush Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Saint Cloud watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush lakes are a chain of lakes that are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 22 years, most recently in 2018. Results from the 2015 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Classes 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the median value for Lake Class 24 (Briggs). These high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 16, 2018 found the fingerling catch rate across the three lakes to be 61.9 young of the year (YOY) per hour. This was an increase over the last stocking in 2016 (18.1 YOY/hour). Over the past twelve years the average fingerling catch rate across lakes has ranged from 18.1/hr in 2016 to 131.5/hr in 2010 with an average of 70.4/hr. Individual catch rates of young of the year Walleye in fall 2018 were 49.5/hr for Briggs, 66.5/hr for Julia, and 42.0/hr for Rush. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye age 1 and older was good as catch rates were 9.1/hr in Rush, 9.9/hr in Briggs, and 41.6/hr in Julia. Of the age-1 and older Walleye sampled, fish ranged in length from 12.7 to 23.5 inches and averaged 19.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. Trophic State Index (TSI) values, based on the 10 year average of summer water quality samples, ranged from 63 on Julia to 69 on Rush which classify the lakes as eutrophic. Walleye are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results. A standard survey was completed in 2019 to update data last collected in 2015 and included bass electrofishing and gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 23% forest, 27% open water/wetlands, 13% hay/pasture, and 6% developed. Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water, fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes. Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead and Silver Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection. Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 2 4/gill net, which represents a decline from the catch rates observed in 2015 (5 10/gill net). Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from eight to 28 inches were recorded during the survey. Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length. Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as the   management strategy to sustain the population. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 15 inches by age three. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was lower in 2019 than 2015, but the average size was larger at 26 inches and 4.5 pounds. Fifty two percent of fish sampled were 26 inches or longer and 15% were 30 inches or longer. Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike. This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers in 2019 were similar to 2015. Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant. Quality fish up to 20 inches of both species have been documented and 39% of the Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing were 15 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie. Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results. Black Crappie were sampled at a much higher rate than in 2015 and gill net catches exceeded the expected range for lakes with similar characteristics and were similar to the record high catches of the late 1990's. Black Crappie ranged in length from three to 13 inches but 62% of the crappies caught in the survey were less than eight inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers. Bluegill catches increased from the previous survey however, the average size was under six inches and no Bluegill larger than eight inches were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Rush and Julia Lakes in western Sherburne County are recreational development lakes connected by navigable channels and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. Rush and Julia are similar in size (142 acres) and maximum depth (11 and 15 feet, respectively).  Briggs Lake is the largest and deepest of the lakes (377 acres, 25 feet maximum) and tends to have the best water quality, with a mid-summer secchi reading of three feet or so.   <br> \n <br> \nWith a grant from the DNR a \"whole-lake\" treatment for curlyleaf pondweed was made on Rush and Julia Lakes, 2006-2009.  The treatment involves early season application of the aquatic herbicide Endothall.  Initially, it appears that the biomass of culyleaf pondweed has been reduced as well as turion production.  Evaluation has been via point-intercept plant surveys.  A native species that has responded is Elodea.  There may be other fisheries and aquatic changes to the ecosystem in the short term. <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is overflowed by the Elk River during periods of high water.  Because of the large agricultural drainage water quality of the lakes is affected.  Catches of riverine species such as white sucker, golden, shorthead and silver redhorse, and smallmouth bass reflect the overflow connection.  Carp are known to be common as well. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry stocking has been successful in providing a walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and will remain the management strategy. This was the first survey since 1999 and an opportunity to judge the effectiveness of fry stocking as it relates to gill net catches.  Results showed that walleye catches increased significantly for Briggs and Rush Lakes and nearly so, for Julia.   At the same time northern pike populations declined.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches for the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 8-11/gill net.  These numbers represent the historic high catch for each lake.  Small fish less than 12 inches comprised 33, 44 and 61% of the gill net catch for the three lakes. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes, and reached a length of nearly 18 inches by age three.    Continued opportunities for walleye angling will be present as these fish mature. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike declined significantly in Briggs and Julia Lakes, but not Rush Lake.   Historically, gill net catches have been highest in Julia Lake.  Briggs Lake, which had the lowest gill net catch, had the highest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 43%.  Rush Lake, with the highest gill net catch, had the lowest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 4%. Northern pike also grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and reached a length of 21 inches by age two. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch populations did not follow any pattern.  At Briggs Lake the catch was the same as that of 1999 and above the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Rush Lake showed a significant increase over 1999; and Julia showed a significant decline.  Catches of yellow perch at Rush and Julia were within the range of expected values. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were common in the Briggs Chain.  The catches for the three lakes were combined for this report.  A sample of 50 largemouth collected by electrofishing showed that 12 inch fish were common.  <br> \n <br> \nCatches of bluegill were relatively low on Briggs and Rush Lakes, though still within the range of expected values.  Bluegill were above the normal range on Julia, but of the lowest average size, 4.1 inches. Bluegill grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of eight inches in six years.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were most abundant on Briggs Lake.  Over the past five assessments at Briggs Lake the average catch of black crappie was 7.4/trap net. The average size of black crappie was small in each lake ranging from 6-8 inches.  Black crappie grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of ten inches in four years. White crappie were also sampled in each of the three lakes but in lower numbers than black crappies, with the exception of Lake Julia were they appeared more abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Lake is located in Sherburne County, five miles north of Clear Lake.  Rush Lake is small (142 acres), but is connected to Briggs and Julia Lakes by navigable channels.  The lake is shallow, with a maximum depth of only 11 feet and an average depth of 7 feet.  The lake bottom is mostly muck, mixed with sand and silt.  Several aquatic plant species are found in Rush Lake, but curled pondweed becomes dominant in the spring and can be a nuisance for boat travel.  As the plants die off and decay in the summer, the added nutrients can cause blooms of algae.  The majority of the lakeshore is developed.  A public access with a boat ramp and parking for several vehicles is located on the south side of the lake.Based on surveys in 1999, the walleye population of Rush Lake did not change from the 1993 survey and was similar to other lakes in the area.  Average size of the walleye was 15.5 inches, but fish up to 27 inches were seen.  The lake has been stocked with walleye fry rather than fingerlings since 1983, and it has proved to be a less costly means of maintaining walleye in the lake.  Northern pike are fairly abundant but small in Rush Lake, mostly in the range of 15-22 inches.  Like many other lakes with large numbers of small northern pike, there are also large numbers of small bluegill and black crappie in Rush Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (less than 22 inches) to rebalance the fish community.  Yellow perch and largemouth bass numbers are average, but bass as large as 20 inches can be found.  Rush Lake also has populations of bullhead, carp, and white sucker.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 20 years, most recently in 2014.  Results from the 2009 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 8.3 to 11.3 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Class 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the third quartile for Lake Class 24 (Briggs).  These historic high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net.  Fry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a Walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes as 77% of sampled Walleye were from the 2008 (48%) and 2006 (29%) year classes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 14, 2014 found fingerling catch rates between 76 and 104 fish per hour.  This was an increase over the last stocking event (2012) but similar to several of the previous stockings; 2012 (0-62/hr), 2010 (48-262/hr), 2008 (78-122/hr), and 2006 (38-71/hr) for the three lakes.  Individual catch rates for young of the year Walleye in fall 2014 were 103.6/hr for Briggs, 77.2/hr for Julia and 76.1/hr for Rush.   Mean fingerling length across lakes was 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye greater than age 1 were also good as catch rates ranged from 44.2/hr in Briggs, 37.2/ hr in Julia, to 16.3/hr in Rush.  Otolith samples were not taken from larger Walleye to verify their age.  However, length frequency analysis indicates at least three year classes of Walleye were sampled.  Size range for these year classes were as follows: Age 0 (5-8 inches), Age 2 (11-13 inches), Age 4 (15-19 inches). <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches.</p>",

The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs.  They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on the Briggs Chain of Lakes from June 17   June 24, 2015.  This assessment was conducted in order to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills.  Many times these larger individuals are not sampled during the traditional summer surveys especially during surveys conducted in July and August.  A total of 410 Bluegills were sampled on Rush Lake during this survey.  Bluegill averaged 7.2 inches in length with the largest Bluegill measuring 9.8 inches.  The size structure of a fish population is often described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD).  For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\".  The PSD of Bluegill from Rush Lake was 86.  So, 86% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\".  Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\".  The RSD8 on Rush Lake was 27.  Both of these indices indicate a healthy Bluegill population with excellent size structure for central Minnesota.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 753 Bluegill were sampled across the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  These Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Proportional Stoock Density (PSD) and RSD8 for Bluegill was 86 and 32 respectively.  Of the three lakes in the Briggs Chain, Rush Lake had the largest overall sample of Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years.  Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill.  Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers.  The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they limit the potential that the rest of the population can get to.  Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on the Briggs Chain of Lakes by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing largest males.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year since 1992.The Briggs Chain was scheduled to have been stocked in 2020, however due to COVID-19 restrictions there was no statewide egg take and therefore no fry were available so stocking was postponed until 2021. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted during the evening of September 27, 2021 and sampled 12 young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye across the three lakes in 2.1 hours of electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 5.7 YOY/hr.  This was lower than the last stocking in 2018 (61.9 YOY/hour). Since 2006 the YOY catch rate across lakes has ranged from 5.7/hr to 131.5/hr with an average of 60.6/hr. Individual lake YOY Walleye catch rates 2021 were 10.0/hr for Briggs, 8.8/hr for Rush, and 0/hr for Julia. The average fingerling length across lakes was 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the overall catch rate of YOY was down in 2021, survival of Walleye age-1 and older was good. Catch rates of age-1 and older walleye was 61.5/hr in Rush, 52.2/hr in Julia, and 51.9/hr in Briggs. Age-1 or older Walleye sampled ranged in length from 9.3 to 25.9 inches and averaged 14.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2019 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 per gill net, which was below the average value for similar lakes. These lower catch rates were a marked decrease over the 2015 catch rates that ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 per gill net. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking continues to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain and fry will be stocked again in 2022 to get back on an even year stocking rotation. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with Walleye fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results.  Fish sampling in 2015 included bass electrofishing in May, a targeted Bluegill assessment in June, and a standard gill net and trap net survey in August. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer.  The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 28% forest, 18% open water, 14% hay/pasture, and 7%.  Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2015; however in 2009 11 aquatic plant species were identified growing to a maximum depth of 5.5 feet.  Curly leaf pondweed was not found in Rush Lake; however it was were observed growing in Briggs (4.6 acres) and Julia (1.2 acres) in the spring of 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes.  Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection.  Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 5 10/gill net, which represents a decline from the record high catch rates observed in 2009 (8 11/gill net).  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 7 to 26 inches were recorded in the survey.  Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length.  Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as a management strategy to sustain the population.  Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 14 inches by age two.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was higher in 2015 than 2009, but the average size was smaller at two pounds or 20 inches in length.  Only 10 percent of fish sampled were greater than 24 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike.  This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  Yellow Perch numbers in 2015 were lower than 2009.  Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  Despite declines, catches of Yellow Perch in all three lakes remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant.  Quality fish up to 19 inches of both species have been documented however; the majority of bass sampled by electrofishing were between 14 to 15 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie.  While the Bluegill average size in the August survey was only about 6 inches, the spring survey showed that quality size Bluegill up to nearly 10 inches can be found.  Seasonal differences in trap net catches for panfish related to size and abundance have to do with water temperatures and the completion of spawning.  Generally catches are not as good in late summer due to the fact that larger mature fish move into deeper, cooler water where they are not sampled as well by trap nets that are set in shallow water near the shore.  Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results.  While crappie can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, for the same reason mentioned previously for Bluegills, results from the 2015 survey suggest normal abundance for these types of lakes.  Most of the crappies caught in the summer survey however, were less than 8 inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked every other year over the past 20 years, most recently in 2016. Results from the 2015 lake survey showed that Walleye ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 per gill net, which was above the median value for Lake Classes 43 (Julia, Rush) and above the median value for Lake Class 24 (Briggs). These high catch rates were a marked improvement over the 1999 catch rates that ranged from 1.7 to 4.3 per gill net. Fry to fingerling survival appears to be successful in maintaining a Walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing during the evening of October 11, 2016 found the fingerling catch rate across lakes to be 18.1 young-of-the-year (YOY) per hour. This was a decrease over the last stocking in 2014 (88.8 YOY/hr) and the lowest on record:  2014 (88.8/hr), 2012 (25.3/hr), 2010 (131.5/hr), 2008 (100.1/hr), and 2006 (58.8/hr). Individual catch rates for young of the year Walleye in fall 2016 were 6.1/hr for Briggs, 3.9/hr for Julia, and 42.0/hr for Rush. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye greater than age-1 was good as catch rates ranged from 38.9/hr in Briggs, 33.2/hr in Julia, to 36.5/hr in Rush. Otolith samples were taken from several larger walleye to verify their age. Sixty-four percent of the Walleyes sampled across the three lakes were over 11 inches in length and Walleye up to 30.0 inches in length were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain as it has proven to be effective at boosting Walleye gill net catches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush, Briggs, and Julia Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. A standard survey was completed in 1988 to update fisheries data last collected in 1982. This particular report is from 161-acre Rush Lake.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance in 1988 (1.3/gill net) was similar to 1982 (2.0/gill net) and was within the expected range of values for the lake class. \n\nWalleye abundance in 1988 (8.3/gill net) increased from 1982 (1.3/gill net) and was more than twice the statewide median. Walleye ages three to six were sampled and 80% were age four, corresponding to a fry stocking in 1984. Walleye growth was fast in ages one and two and nearly fast in others. \n\nThe Largemouth Bass population was adequate with good reproduction. A total of 31 Largemouth Bass were creeled on the Briggs Chain of Lakes during a one-day tournament in August 1988. Largemouth Bass ages two to five were caught and growth was nearly fast. \n\nBluegill abundance in 1988 (10.2/trap net) had declined from 1982 (20.0/trap net) and was at the statewide median. Ages one and two were predominant and growth was good. \n\nBlack Crappie abundance in 1988 (25.7/gill net and 15.8/trap net) decreased from 1982 (92.7/gill net and 49.6/trap net) and were about average for the area. Black Crappie ages one to four were sampled and growth was good. \n\nWhite Crappie abundance in 1988 (265.3/gill net and 73.8/trap net) significantly increased from 1982 (10.7/gill net and 4.2/trap net). Ages one and two were dominant accounting for 91% of the White Crappie catch and growth was good.\n\nYellow Perch abundance in 1988 (5.7/gill net) decreased from 1982 (11.3/gill net) and was near the local median. \n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.</p>",
