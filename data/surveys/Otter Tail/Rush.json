                "narrative": "<p>     Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2007 lake survey was 4.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1998 lake survey referenced 284 homes/cottages and 14 resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in Rush Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.3 to 25.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 0.9 pound.  The 2005 and 2006 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently maintain the walleye population at or above DNR management goals.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.1 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the northern pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike exhibit moderate growth with an average length of 21.5 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has historically remained stable.  Size structure has improved over the recent series of surveys.  Sixty percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 6.6 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass or black crappie abundance and size structure; however, angler reports on these species have been positive. <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Rush Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Twenty-four fish species were sampled including young of the year game fish species such as Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill. Non-game species sampled included Mottled Sculpin, Shorthead Redhorse, Logperch, Blackside Darter, and Spottail Shiner.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2013 lake survey was 4.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1998 lake survey referenced 284 homes/cottages and 14 resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Rush Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.7 to 26.2 inches with an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.0 pound.  The 2009 and 2010 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently maintain the walleye population at or above DNR management goals.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.9 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the northern pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 15.4 to 29.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Pike exhibit moderate growth with an average length of 22.1 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated due to inconsistent reproduction.  Bluegill abundance in this survey was within the normal range for this lake type and size structure was good.  Forty-six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.4 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass or black crappie abundance and size structure; however, angler reports on these species have been positive. <br> \n Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 lake survey was 8.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.8 to 23.6 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The 2018 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.8 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the Northern Pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 28.2 inches with an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance was within the normal range for this lake type and size structure was excellent.  Sixty-one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 30% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.7 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n     The 2016 year class of Black Crappies is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Thirty percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Rush Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Rush Lake is 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 lake survey was 5.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 8.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose a majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has been at a lower level in recent surveys compared to historical abundance.  Walleyes ranged in length from 4.5 to 18.7 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the Northern Pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 18.6 inches at three years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is at a moderate density with a quality size structure. Thirty-nine percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 22% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 8.2 inches at seven years of age.  <br> \n     Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 13.2 inches.  The 2018 and 2021 year classes of Black Crappies are strong and should provide consistently good crappie angling for several years.  Fifty-two percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Rush Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 6.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.  Rush Lake is included in class 27 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.       A majority of the shoreline on Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1998 lake survey report referenced 284 homes/cottages and 14 resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Rush Lake.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Rush Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 0.8 pound.  The 2001 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently maintain the walleye population at or above DNR management goals.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.5 inches at four years of age.      Northern pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the northern pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 14.7 inches to 24.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Pike also exhibit slow growth with an average length of 20.7 inches at five years of age.      The bluegill test-net catch rate has historically remained within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Fourteen percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.6 inches at six years of age.      Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass or black crappie abundance and size structure; however, angler reports on these species have been positive.     The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Rush Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

Historically, northern pike abundance has been low.  <br> \n     Abundance of the various bullhead species also remains low and is consistent with previous surveys.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance decreased from 24.3 per trap net lift in 1985 to 11.8 per net, which is below the area median.  Average weight of bluegill was 0.2 lbs. and growth rates appear to be excellent.  Forty-three percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches, indicating a high quality population.  <br> \n     Black crappie and largemouth bass reproduction appears good as multiple age classes were represented for both species.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was 11.1 per gill net lift, similar to 13.0 per net in 1985 and 8.1 per net in 1981.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 6.7 per gill net lift in 1985 to 10.6 per net, which is nearly twice the area median.  Age data indicates significant natural reproduction of walleye.  Using expanded age data, approximately 40% of the walleyes in the sample were ages II+ and III+, which correspond to years of no stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshland.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.  Rush Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.       A majority of the shoreline on Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1998 lake survey referenced 284 homes/cottages and 14 resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Rush Lake.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Rush Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.8 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently maintain the walleye population at or above DNR management goals.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.8 inches at four years of age.      The bluegill test-net catch rate has historically remained within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Eleven percent of the bluegill were seven inches or greater in length.  Bluegill exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.2 inches at five years of age.      Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass or black crappie abundance and size structure; however, angler reports on these species have been positive.     The DNR does not stock any species of fish in Rush Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2016 lake survey was 4.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Rush Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.9 to 25.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  The 2013 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the Northern Pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 16.1 to 27.8 inches with an average length and weight of 21.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure have historically fluctuated due to inconsistent reproduction.  Bluegill abundance in this survey was within the normal range for this lake type and size structure was good.  Sixty percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     The 2013 year class of Black Crappies is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Forty-four percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 16 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 6 sites due to soft sediments and deep water along a fringe of emergent vegetation. Nearshore sampling captured a diverse suite of species, including 23 total species of fish surveyed. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Rush Lake is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Rush Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Rush Lake is located in central Otter Tail County two miles north of Ottertail, MN.  Rush Lake is a 5,337-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots and marshes.  The maximum depth is 68 feet; however, 62% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 4.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Rush Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1998 lake survey referenced 284 homes/cottages and 14 resorts.  DNR owned public water accesses are located along the northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are located along various shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Rush Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Rush Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Rush Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.4 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The 2006, 2007, and 2008 year classesr classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently maintain the walleye population at or above DNR management goals.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has historically remained at a low to moderate density.  The size structure of the northern pike population has consistently been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 12.7 to 29.2 inches with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike exhibit moderate growth with an average length of 22.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has historically remained stable.  Size structure has improved over the recent series of surveys.  Thirty-three percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n     Summer test-net indices are not reliable indicators of largemouth bass or black crappie abundance and size structure; however, angler reports on these species have been positive. <br> \n Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Rush Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",
