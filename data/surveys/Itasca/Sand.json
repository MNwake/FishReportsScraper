                "narrative": "<p>The 1997 Coon-Sandwick Lake management plan lists northern pike and walleye as the primary species for management with centrarchids as secondary species.Northern pike catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 5.2 to 11.8 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 7.6 per gill net was typical of the lake, as was the mean weight of 1.7 pounds.  Size structure was poor, with a PSD (21 inches) of 25 and RSD-P (28 inches) of 7.  Growth rates were >15% below the statewide average for age 1 and were similar to statewide averages for ages 2-7, suggesting a bottleneck at age 1.  The largest individual was 33.5 inches and 9 years old.Walleye catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 0.9 to 10.1 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 0.9 per gill net was the lowest on record, while the mean weight of 3.1 pounds was the highest on record.  Walleye have been stocked in 7 of 15 years since 1986; walleye stocking began in 1943.  Of the 11 walleye aged, 64% were from stocked years.  Size structure was very good, with a PSD (15 inches) of 100 and a RSD-P (20 inches) of 18.  Growth rates were above statewide averages for ages 1-4 (>15% above for ages 2 and 3).  The largest individual was 27.8 inches and 14 years old.Largemouth bass catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 0 to 0.8 per gill net and from 0.1 to 1.6 per trap net.  The 2000 catch rates of 0.8 per gill net and 1.6 per trap net were both the highest on record.  Size structure was fairly good, with a PSD (12 inches) of 38 and a RSD-P (15 inches) of 19.  Growth rates were above statewide averages for ages 1-4 (>15% above for age 3).  The largest individual was 17.1 inches and 7 years old.Black crappie catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 per gill net and from 0.4 to 3.0 per trap net.  The 2000 catch rates were higher than average for this lake, at 1.5 per gill net and 2.2 per trap net.  Size structure was fairly good, with a PSD (8 inches) of 71 and a RSD-P (10 inches) of 12.Bluegill catch rates during historical assessment have ranged from 4.2 to 42.6 per trap net, and those for pumpkinseed have ranged from 0.9 to 17.3 per trap net.  The 2000 bluegill catch rate was 30.4 per trap net, and the 2000 pumpkinseed catch rate was 6.4 per trap net.  Bluegill size structure was fairly good, with a PSD (6 inches) of 54 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 17.  Pumpkinseed size structure was poor, with a PSD (6 inches) of 36 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 2.  Bluegill growth rates were below the lake class average for age 1 but above for ages 2-8 (>15% above for ages 3 and 4).  The oldest bluegill was 8.1 inches and 15 years old.Shoreline owners can directly help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by following lakeshore development best management practices, such as maintaining or upgrading septic systems, minimizing nutrient inputs from fertilizer use, and leaving aquatic vegetation and terrestrial vegetation within at least 50 feet of the shoreline intact or restoring such vegetation to its native state.  Poorly-maintained septic systems and fertilizers contribute excess nutrients and bacteria to the lake, and removal of upland and aquatic vegetation can cause additional ecological problems.  Symptoms of impaired water quality can include increases in winter kills, summer kills, algae, aquatic plants, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Conversely, a naturally vegetated shoreline (not mowed grass) provides cover for young and adult fish, filters nutrients before they reach the lake, reduces erosion, and provides food and habitat for invertebrates and wildlife.

                "narrative": "<p>Coon-Sandwick Lake is a 627-acre lake located six miles southeast of Bigfork, MN and within Scenic State Park.  The lake has moderately soft water and is classified in ecological lake class 35.  Coon-Sandwick Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet and moderately stained water (9 ft Secchi depth).  Coon-Sandwick Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, walleye and panfish.Coon-Sandwick Lake has been used as an experimental lake for studying slot length limits for northern pike.  Beginning in 1991, northern pike between 20 and 30 inches were protected from harvest.  The northern pike gill-net catch rate increased to 12.0/net in 2005.  This catch rate is above the lake class normal range and higher than any previous assessment.  Northern pike size structure also improved over previous assessments.  Gill-net sampled pike in 2005 varied from 9.3 to 36.1 inches with an average length of 22.4 inches.  Northern pike from the 2000 assessment had an average length of 18.7 inches.  Growth rates in 2005 were similar to the statewide average for all ages.Gill-net catches for walleye have historically been low in Coon-Sandwick Lake.  The 2005 catch of 1.0/net was similar to the 2000 catch of 0.9/net, despite walleye fingerling stocking in 4 of the previous 5 years.  Size structure was good in 2005; fish in the sample varied from 13.7 to 21.8 inches with an average length of 18.8 inches.  Ages 3-5, 7, 9 and 12 were represented in the sample, with 92% of the fish attributed to stocked years.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill (38.0/net) was above the lake class normal range, but similar to the previous assessment.  Historical catch rates have varied from 4.2 to 42.6/net.  Size structure was poor; fish in the sample varied from 3.3 to 7.6 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches.    Gill-net and trap-net catches for black crappie were near their respective first quartiles and similar to previous assessments.  Trap-net sampled black crappie ranged from 5.8 to 10.5 inches and had an average length of 7.3 inches.Catch rates for largemouth bass have ranged from 0.0 to 0.8/gill net and from 0.1 to 1.6/trap net.  Because standard test-nets typically do not sample bass effectively, a spring electrofishing assessment was conducted in 2005.  The elecrofishing assessment yielded a relatively low catch rate of 15.7 fish/hour of on-time.  Size structure was moderate; fish in the sample ranged from 4.7 to 17.4 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches.  The yellow perch gill-net catch in 2005 (15.2/net) was near the lake class average and similar to previous assessments.  Gill-net sampled perch ranged from 4.8 to 9.9 inches, with an average length of 6.2 inches.Other species sampled in test nets included: brown bullhead, golden shiner and pumpkinseed sunfish.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon-Sandwick Lake is a 627-acre lake located six miles southeast of Bigfork in north-central Itasca County.  The lake is located entirely within Scenic State Park and there is no residential development on the lakeshore, other than the State Park campgrounds.  Two boat accesses and a fishing pier are located within the park, which also offer boat and canoe rentals.   State Park workers indicated that fishing is popular with park guests and most anglers target panfish and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake consists of a north basin (Coon) that has a maximum depth of 36 feet, and a south basin (Sandwick) with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The two basins are broadly connected and have been managed as a single water body.  The principal difference between the two basins is a more irregularly shaped shoreline in Sandwick than in Coon.  Most of the water is shallow (540 littoral acres) and fewer than 200 acres exceed a depth of 10 feet.  The lake has clear water, as Secchi disc readings have ranged from 11 to 15 feet.  The lake has moderately soft water and is mesotrophic with moderate fertility.  There are no defined inlets or outlets.  Coon-Sandwick supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provides valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick has a history of poor Northern Pike size structure.  Special regulations have been in place since the early 1990s to improve the pike size structure and provide better angling for larger pike.  Most recently, a 24-to-36-inch protected slot has been in place since 2007.  The Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2014.  The goal of the LMP was to reduce the Northern Pike gill-net catch to 6.8/net (lake class average) with the proportion of fish exceeding 21 and 28 inches exceeding 50 and 25, with fish over 34 inches present.  A standard lake survey was completed in 2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of the special Pike regulation and determine the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets compared to previous surveys which have used as many as 12 gill nets.  The number of gill nets was reduced from 12 to 6 due to high pike catches and a concern for mortality of quality sized pike, and due to limited water >9 feet deep for setting gill nets.  Catch rate data should be interpreted cautiously, given this reduction in gill net effort. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 11.8 per gill net was lower than the previous survey but was still high compared to similar lakes and above average for Coon-Sandwick.  When Northern Pike occur at high densities, average size is typically small, and growth is often poor.  Pike from Coon-Sandwick contradict this general trend, however, as size structure was favorable and length indices improved substantially compared to pre-regulation sampling.  Pike ranged from 11.2 to 31.4 inches and averaged 23.2 inches in 2022.  Seventy-six percent of the sampled pike exceeded 21 inches and 13% exceeded 28 inches.  Over fifty percent of the sampled pike exceeded 24 inches and 4.2% exceeded 30 inches.  Ages 1 through 9 were represented in the sample and growth was considered average.  Pike averaged 23.8 inches after 5 years of growth.  It appears that the special regulation has continued to contribute to exceptional angling opportunities for catching quality-sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common fish in the gill net catch.  Coon-Sandwick has a history of moderate perch catches with a population dominated by small, slowing growing fish.  The catch of 13 per gill net was typical compared to similar lakes and average for Coon-Sandwick.  Size structure was poor as perch ranged from 5.5 to 7.8 inches.  Although perch from Coon-Sandwick are too small to interest most anglers, they provide an important prey item for predators such as Northern Pike and Walleye.  Given the relatively good catch rate compared to past sampling, Yellow Perch appear to be sustaining themselves despite high Northern Pike abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick has a history of poor Walleye catches, despite frequent DNR stocking.  It should be noted that lakes with habitats like Coon-Sandwick typically do not produce large Walleye populations.  The catch in 2022 (1.5/net) was typical for similar lakes and average for Coon-Sandwick.  Too few Walleye were captured to accurately assess age and size structure, but at least some quality fish were present, as Walleye up to 25.7 inches were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish present in the trap net and the catch of 15.1 per net was typical compared to similar lakes and for Coon-Sandwick.  Lakes with similar habitats typically produce slow growing Bluegill with limited growth potential and poor size structures.  Size structure in Coon-Sandwick has historically been poor and remained so in 2022.  Trap net caught Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.3 inches with a mean of 5.7 inches.  Only 1% of Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  The popularity of the Bluegill fishery is likely limited by poor growth rates and size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have been captured in moderate numbers in past assessments and size structure has been described as poor.  Crappie were captured in average numbers in 2022, as both gill net and trap net catches resembled those from lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure remained generally poor; gill-net sampled crappie ranged from 4.8 to 9.9 inches with an average of around 7 inches.  Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Ages 2 through 5 were represented in the sample and growth was considered average.  Crappie averaged 7.1 inches after 4 years of growth.  Coon-Sandwick likely has the potential to sporadically produce a quality crappie fishery, but high angler harvest and inconsistent recruitment may limit the number of quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured in relatively high numbers from trap nets (1/net) compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was good as bass ranged from 6.7 to 19.1 inches with a mean of 12.7 inches.  Largemouth Bass are difficult to sample with standard netting and the presence of bass in the trap nets suggest that bass are likely an important component of the fishery.  The habitat and Bluegill prey base suggest good conditions for Largemouth Bass and favorable angling opportunities likely exist. <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick is infested with Eurasian Water Milfoil.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed, and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick Lake is a 627 acre lake located six miles southeast of Bigfork, Minnesota in north-central Itasca County.  The lake is located entirely within Scenic State Park and there is no residential development on the lakeshore, other than the State Park campgrounds.  Two accesses and a fishing pier are located within the Park, which also offers boat and canoe rentals.   State park workers indicated that fishing is popular with park guests and that most anglers target panfish and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake consists of a north basin (Coon) that has a maximum depth of 36 feet, and a south basin (Sandwick) with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The two basins are broadly connected, and have been managed as a single water body.  The principal difference between the two basins is a more irregularly shaped shoreline in Sandwick than in Coon.  The lake has clear water, as Secchi disc readings have ranged from 11 to 15 feet.  The lake has moderately soft water and is mesotrophic.  There are no defined inlets or outlets.  Coon-Sandwick supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provides valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick had a history of poor northern pike size structure.  Special regulations have been in place since the early 1990s to improve the pike size structure and provide better angling for larger pike.  Most recently, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot has been in place since 2007.  A population assessment was completed in 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the special pike regulation and determine the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  The number of gill nets was reduced from 12 to 6 due to high pike catches and a concern for mortality of quality sized pike.  Catch rate data should be interpreted cautiously, given this reduction in gill net effort. <br> \n <br> \nResults <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most common fish in the gill net catch.  The catch rate was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and was the highest on record for Coon-Sandwick.  When northern pike occur at high densities, average size is typically small and growth is often poor.  Pike from Coon-Sandwick contradict this general trend, however, as size structure was favorable, improving substantially compared to past sampling.  Pike ranged from 14.6 to 34.5 inches and averaged 25.1 inches in 2013.  Over sixty percent of the sampled pike exceeded 24 inches and 14.5% exceeded 30 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified nine year classes and recruitment was consistent.  Northern pike populations often display a predominance of fish from ages 2 to 5.  The age structure from Coon-Sandwick was more diverse, however, as 59% of the sampled pike were age 5 or older, indicating good adult survival.  Growth was near the statewide average, as pike typically exceeded 21 inches by age 4 and 28 inches by age 7.  It should be noted that the sex ratio from the gill nets was skewed, as females comprised 82% of the sample.  It is possible that the slower growing males remain below the protected slot size for a longer time period, making them more susceptible to harvest.  A skewed sex ratio in Coon-Sandwick may be beneficial, as high pike densities are generally undesirable and reduced recruitment may help further improve the size structure and regulate population dynamics.  It appears that the special regulation has resulted in both an increase in pike abundance and average size, currently resulting in exceptional angling opportunities for catching quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the second most common fish in the gill net catch.  Coon-Sandwick has a history of moderate perch catches with a population dominated by small, slowing growing fish.  The 2013 catch was typical for similar lakes, but was the highest observed for Coon-Sandwick.  Size structure was poor, as perch ranged from 5.2 to 8.8 inches.  Although perch from Coon-Sandwick are too small to interest most anglers, they provide an important prey item for predators such as northern pike and walleye.  Given the relatively good catch rate compared to past sampling, yellow perch appear to be sustaining themselves despite high northern pike abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick has a history of poor walleye catches, despite frequent DNR stocking.  It should be noted that lakes with habitats similar to Coon-Sandwick typically do not produce large walleye populations.  The catch in 2013 was low compared to similar lakes and below average for Coon-Sandwick.  Too few walleye were captured to accurately gage age and size structure, but at least some quality fish were present, as walleye up to 22.6 inches were captured.  The size distribution also indicates that multiple year classes are present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish present in the trap net and the catch was typical compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill catches from Coon-Sandwick have varied tremendously among assessments, with no apparent trend.  Lakes with similar habitat characteristics typical produce slow growing bluegill with limited growth potential and poor size structures.  Size structure in Coon-Sandwick has historically been poor, and remained so in 2013 as no bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Trap net caught bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches with a mean of 5.7 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified eight year classes (ages 2-9).  Growth was near the lake class average with bluegill attaining 6 inches by age 7.  The age structure was diverse and bluegill averaged 5.4 years of age, suggesting low angler exploitation and good adult survival.  The popularity of the bluegill fishery is likely limited by poor growth rates and size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies have been captured in moderate numbers in past assessments and size structure has been described as poor.  Crappie were captured in average numbers in 2013.  Size structure remained generally poor, as crappie ranged from 3.5 to 10.7 inches with a mean of 7.3 inches.  Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Recruitment was inconsistent in Coon-Sandwick in the 2013 sample, as only five year classes were present (ages 1-5) and 45% of the catch was from the 2010 year class.  No crappie older than age 6 were captured, suggesting high adult mortality and\\or poor past recruitment.  Growth was somewhat slow, as crappie exceeded 8 inches by age 5.  Coon-Sandwick likely has the potential to sporadically produce a quality crappie fishery, but high angler harvest and inconsistent recruitment may limit the number of quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured in relatively high numbers from trap nets, as the catch of 2.0/trap net exceeded the third quartile value for the lake class.  Size structure was moderate as bass ranged from 5.2 to 17.2 inches with a mean of 10.5 inches.  Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard netting and the presence of bass in the trap nets suggest that bass are likely an important component of the fishery.  The habitat and bluegill prey base suggest good conditions for largemouth bass and favorable angling opportunities likely exist. <br> \n <br> \nCoon-Sandwick is infested with Eurasian water milfoil.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boater are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
