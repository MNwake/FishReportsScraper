                "narrative": "<p>Eagle is a moderate size lake (824 acres) with a maximum depth 67 feet. About 33% of thelake is less than 15 feet deep. Submergent vegetation is generally sparse and locatedprimarily along the southeast corner (chara) and northeast shore line areas (sago pondweed,norther watermilfoil). Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush) is almost non-existent.Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, clay, and silt. Although nutrient levels are moderatein Eagle Lake, excessive algae blooms and poor water clarity are major problems. Waterclarity becomes poor during early to mid summer due to frequently intense algae blooms.Filamentous algae also becomes quite abundant during certain years. Copper sulfate treatmentswere a common practice to temporarily reduce algae blooms on Eagle Lake prior to the 1990's.The outlet is located along the southwest corner and is the beginning of Hawk Creek. Aswinging fish barrier prevents fish from entering Eagle via Hawk Creek. There are about ninesmall intermittent inlets/tiles which enter Eagle and two large inlets on the northeast(Halvorson Impoundment) and southeast shores (Lawler NPSA inlet). The southeast inlet drainsthrough several cattail wetland areas. Several watershed projects and studies have beenconducted on Eagle Lake and its associated inlets by the University of Minnesota-Morris andvarious government agencies. In 1970, three earthen dams were constructed by the SoilConservation Service above the northeast inlet along several feeder inlets. The purpose ofthese impoundments were to temporarily store runoff waters and allow the filtering ofnutrients to occur. In 1991, an earthen dam with a concrete sill (Halvorson Dam) wasinstalled by the Soil Conservation Service about 100 yards upstream of the lake. In 1974, asanitary sewer line was installed around the lake and individual septic systems were filledor discontinued. A noticeable shift to bluegreen-algae blooms occurred during the late 1960's- early 1970's and has persisted into the 1990's. The Spicer Fisheries Office has managedEagle primarily for walleye and northern pike. Walleye fingerlings are currently scheduledto be stocked on a as needed basis. The Lawler inlet is managed as a natural run northernpike spawning area with supplemented stocking when fish are available. Eagle is also stockedwith winter rescue adult northern pike on a as needed basis. In the past, the HalvorsonImpoundment has also been used as a northern pike spawning area, however no production hasbeen documented. Other management activities have included hardstem bulrush transplanting in1994 and 1995, conducting lake survey/population assessments every two-three years, naturalreproduction assessment of walleye every fall since 1993, and a creel survey conducted in1983. A carp trap has been operated near the outlet during various times by both the privateparties (currently) and the state (no longer), however, the total pounds of carp removed havebeen limited from the 1960's to the present (40,000 lbs total).     Walleye abundance in 1995 (25.5 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (3.3 - 8.8fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value for Eagle Lake (historicalaverage=12.5 fish/gillnet). The 1995 catch rate of preferred size walleye (3.2 fish > 20inches/gillnet) was also the highest recorded value for Eagle (historical average=1.8 fish> 20 inches/gillnet). The 1995 average size (1.3 lbs) of walleye caught in the summer surveywas slightly below the historical average (1.5 lbs). The average length of walleye caught in1995 was 15.0 inches. The largest walleye caught was 28.2 inches. Growth rates appear goodto excellent. There appears to be several strong year classes (1994 and 1993) of walleyepresent according to the age distribution caught in the summer survey nets. Limited walleyenatural reproduction was documented (13.2 YOY/hour) in 1995. In September of 1994, about18,000 (3 lbs/littoral acre) fin clipped fingerlings were stocked into Eagle. These finclipped fingerlings accounted for 19.4% of the YOY caught (natural reproduction and stockedfingerlings) during the October 1994 electrofishing survey. The average size of walleye YOYand yearlings was 7.8 and 14.6 inches respectively from the 1995 fall electrofishing survey.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (2.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.8 -9.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (2.4 fish/gillnet). The1995 catch rate of quality size fish (3.0 fish >15 inches/gillnet) was the highest recordedvalue for Eagle (average=1.5 fish >21 inches/gillnet). The 1995 average size (22.5 inches)was the same as the historical average. The largest fish caught was 28.5 inches. Growth ratesappear good. Most northern pike captured were from the 1994 or 1993 year classes. These fishmay be from natural reproduction (Lawler, Halvorson NPSA's) or from a 1995 stocking of adultwinter rescue northern pike (1577 fish, average size=0.35 lbs). Natural reproduction has beendifficult to document in Lawler and Halvorson NPSA's during recent years due to constant highflows over the dam boards put in place during the spring.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (37.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (7.0 -46.3 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (67.1 fish/gillnet).The 1995 average size (5.6 inches) was below the historical average (6.7 inches). The largestfish caught was 9.7 inches. Growth rates appear good. About 50% of the yellow perch capturedin the survey nets were from the 1992 year class.     Black crappie were not present in the gillnets and only one (0.1 fish/trapnet) wascaptured from the trapnets. The normal catch rate range for similar lakes is 0.4 - 2.3fish/trapnet. The historical average catch rate for Eagle is low (0.5 fish/trapnet). Suitableblack crappie habitat (hardstem bulrush, abundant submergent vegetation) is lacking in Eagle.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (0.6 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (4.4 - 49.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (44.5 fish/trapnet). The1995 average size (5.4 inches) was slightly above the historical average (5.1 inches). Thelargest bluegill caught was 7.3 inches. Growth rates appear slow. Stocking bluegill is notan option to increase numbers because the average sizes and growth rates have been fair topoor in the past which indicates that conditions are not favorable for abundant quality size(> 6 inches) bluegill to occur in the future. Presently, poor water clarity and the lack ofsuitable habitat (moderate stands of submergent vegetation and hardstem bulrush) probablyprecludes good bluegill survival and growth.     Freshwater drum abundance in 1995 (24.2 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (2.0 - 9.4 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value (historical average=3.8fish/gillnet). Freshwater drum were first caught in the survey nets in 1990. Freshwater drumprobably entered into Eagle via the outlet during high water. The 1995 average size (9.5inches) was below the historical average (12.5 inches).     Common carp abundance in 1995 (1.5 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (0.2 - 1.0fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (0.9 fish/gillnet). The1995 average size (26.4 inches) was above the historical average (19.7 inches).      Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (0.2 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (0.6 -6.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (6.6 fish/gillnet). Theblack bullhead average size in 1995 (8.1 inches) was slightly below the historical average(8.5 inches). There were no yellow or brown bullheads caught during the 1995 survey. Thehistorical averages for yellow and brown bullhead are 4.2 fish/gillnet and 0.2 fish/gillnetrespectively.     Degraded water quality and loss of habitat (aquatic vegetation) are two major concernsfor Eagle Lake. Poor water clarity resulting from intense blue-green algae blooms during thesummer limits recreational activities (boating, fishing, etc.) on Eagle. The frequent use ofcopper sulfate to control algae blooms (residue in the sediments) probably has damaged thelong term health of the lake by inhibiting emergent (bulrush) and submergent plant growthwhich is critical habitat for species such as black crappie, bluegill, and many others.Hardstem bulrush transplanting during the last two summers has resulted in minimal successof re-establishing viable stands. Further study is needed to identify where high inputs ofnutrients are entering the lake in order to implement and encourage best management practiceswithin the watershed. Water quality improvements within the lake may take a long time evenwith a significant reduction of nutrients entering the lake due to the high amounts depositedduring earlier years that are being recycled during turnover events. The present fishery haspositive (i.e. high walleye numbers, moderate northern pike numbers) and negative (highfreshwater drum numbers, low bluegill/ crappie, numbers) aspects. One positive aspect hasbeen that anglers had good success catching walleye on Eagle Lake in recent years. Thepresent 1995 walleye population of total numbers and abundance of fish >20 inches is the bestof all previous surveys. There appears to be two good year classes (1994, 1993) presentwithin the lake. Walleye management priorities include maintaining good numbers (>10.0fish/gillnet) and sizes (average= 16 inches). One negative aspect of the fishery is theincreasing numbers of less desirable fish (i.e. freshwater drum, carp) present in the lake.This increase of less desirable fish is likely the result of declining water quality whichfavors these species. The most disturbing trend is the shift to a dominance by species suchas carp which tends to increase turbidity due to their feeding activity. Commercial fishermenwill be encouraged to remove these fish during the next few winters. Other managementactivities that will continue on the lake include periodic lake survey/population assessmentsand annual fall electrofishing surveys for walleye natural reproduction. Fall electrofishingsurveys will add insight on walleye natural reproduction and the effects of fingerlingstocking in Eagle. Northern pike numbers will be maintained by enhancing natural reproduction(stocking brood stock into Lawler NPSA when available) and supplemental stocking of winterrescue as needed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle is a moderate sized, deep, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Thewater clarity reading on July 20, 1998 was only 3.0 feet. Submergent vegetation densitieswere generally low to moderate throughout most of the lake. The most frequently occurringshoal water substrates were sand, silt, and gravel. Eagle is a popular walleye and northernpike fishing lake. Walleye fishing has been good in recent years. Eagle Lake has poor walleyenatural reproduction success. Presently, Eagle is stocked every even year with walleyefingerlings. Eagle was stocked with 5,117 (274 lbs.) walleye fingerlings in 1992, 18,058fingerlings (836 lbs.) in 1994, and 36,274 fingerlings (1,741 lbs.) in 1996. The Lawlernorthern pike spawning area \"NPSA\" has been operated in the past for the production ofnorthern pike fingerlings. In the 1998 spring, there were only 317 northern pike fingerlingsobserved leaving the Lawler NPSA for Eagle Lake. In 1994, DNR Spicer Fisheries personnelstocked 1,577 small adult northern pike (549 lbs.).     The 1998 walleye catch rate (16.25 fish/gillnet) was the third highest recorded valuefor Eagle (12.87 fish/gillnet historical average). The 1998 walleye average weight and lengthwas 1.13 lbs. and 14.9 inches respectively. The 1996 year class accounted for 84% of the 1998walleye catch. The 1996 Eagle Lake walleye year class was due primarily to a 1996 fingerlingstocking. High fishing pressure probably resulted in the decline of the previously abundant1993 and 1994 walleye year classes. Poor walleye natural reproduction success (3.6 Young ofYear \"YOY\"/hour, 8.0 inches average length) was documented in Eagle during the 1998 fallnight electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction was also poor in other local lakesduring 1998 (6.1 fish/hour, local average). DNR Spicer Fisheries personnel stocked 30,789walleye fingerlings (1,182 lbs.) during the 1998 fall in response to the low YOY walleyenumbers present in Eagle.     Low numbers of small adult northern pike (0.25 fish/gillnet), small adult bluegill (3.25fish/trapnet, 4.8 inches average size), and moderate sized adult yellow perch (8.25fish/gillnet, 6.0 inches average size) were captured in the 1998 summer survey nets. Therewere moderate numbers of small black crappie present (0.92 fish/trapnet, 5.6 inches averagesize) in 1998. Abundant numbers of adult black bullhead (73.0 fish/gillnet, 8.6 inchesaverage length), YOY black bullhead (263.9 YOY/seine haul), and YOY yellow perch (125.1YOY/seine haul) were captured in the 1998 summer survey.  Although adult yellow perch numbersare presently low, abundant black bullhead numbers will provide an important alternativeforage base for walleye in Eagle.      The Eagle Lake fishery will be monitored by fall night electrofishing surveys annuallyand summer test netting surveys every four years in order to evaluate the effectiveness ofcurrent fish management practices. The DNR Spicer Fisheries office will continue to work withlocal residents regarding the implementation of watershed and lake habitat projects that willimprove the water quality of Eagle Lake.</p>",

Eagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake had been due primarily to fingerling stockings in the past, but limited Walleye natural reproduction and a 2011 fry stocking have also contributed to Walleye catch rates as documented by past surveys and analysis. Eagle Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2008 (46,610 fingerlings, 1,098 pounds, 2010 (17,562 fingerlings, 1,104 pounds), 2011 (1,000,481 fry), 2012 (1,365 fingerlings, 100 pounds; 2,890 yearlings, 859 pounds), 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds), 2016 (822,491 Pike River strain fry; 15,888 Spicer strain fingerlings, 1,145 pounds) and 2018 (955,220 Pike River strain fry). The present management plan is to stock Walleye fry every other year and stock fingerlings the same year if the fry stocking is unsuccessful (<30 YOY/hour) based on fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of YOY Walleye (135.00 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches) were documented in the 2018 (fry stocked year) fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) were caught (fry stocked year) in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2016 or 2018. A fall electrofishing survey was also conducted in 2014 (non-fry stocked year) prior to fingerling stocking, but no YOY Walleye were captured thus indicating no apparent natural reproduction. Fall electrofishing surveys were conducted during the early 1990's, but YOY Walleye catch rates were low (0.00-15.00 YOY/hour) due to natural reproduction. We observed abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch, YOY Bluegill, shiners, Northern Pike and moderate numbers of adult Bluegill in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 Walleye year class (1.0 million fry stocked in 2011 and 2,890 yearlings stocked in 2012) comprised 65% of the most recent 2014 summer standard survey Walleye catch (21.25 fish/gillnet, 0.90 pounds and 13.6 inches average). Local residents reported catching small (about 8 inches) Walleye, probably from the 2011 fry stocking, during the 2012 summer. Walleye yearlings (2011 year class) were not stocked until the 2012 fall. Other recent fingerling stocked year classes (2012, 2010, and 2008) each comprised between 6-8% of the Walleye summer survey catch in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Eagle Lake during October 5, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Four historical stations were sampled for a total of 40 minutes in 2022. The water temperature was 58 F. during the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation (northern milfoil, coontail, sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed and chara) was moderately dense at most stations in 2022. Water levels were low. Water clarity was moderate. We observed abundant to moderate numbers of small Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Shiners and small Yellow Perch in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nEagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. Emergent vegetation (cattails) is sparse in Eagle Lake. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking, but limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers were moderate (22.50 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches) for Eagle in the 2022 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers were low (10.50 YOY/hour, 6.7 inches) in the 2021 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (135.00 YOY/hour, 6.3 inches) in the 2018 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (4.50 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches) were captured during a 2016 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2014 (no fry stocking), but zero YOY Walleye were captured indicating poor natural reproduction. The YOY Walleye average catch rate is 19.38 YOY/hour for Eagle. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (29.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Eagle Lake and similar lakes in the most recent 2020 standard summer survey. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 13.78 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2020 Walleye average size was small (0.86 pounds and 13.6 inches) from gillnets. The 2018 year class (fry stocked) comprised 77% of the 2020 Walleye survey catch. Eagle Lake was stocked with walleye in 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds), 2016 (822,491 fry; 14,934 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds; 935 yearlings, 284.5 pounds; 24 adults, 30 pounds), 2018 (955,220 fry), 2021 (548,317 fry) and 2022 (567,731 fry). Local residents have reported catching numerous small walleye (12-14\") in Eagle during 2020. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The current Walleye management stocking strategy entails stocking fry three out of four years with supplemental fingerling stockings during years of poor fry success starting in 2023. Walleye fry are currently scheduled for stocking in 2024 and fingerlings in 2025. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 fall for YOY Walleye by electrofishing and the 2025 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Eagle Lake was conducted in July of 2004. Eagle is a moderate sized (824 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northeast portion of the lake. Numerous pelicans and cormorants were observed on Eagle Lake during the 2004 assessment. Highway drainage into the lake occurs along the west side. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles from east and south locations along the lake. A large gravel pit is located in close proximity to the north side of the lake. The outlet (southwest corner) outflows into several shallow lakes and eventually drains into Hawk Creek downstream of Foot Lake. A public access is located along the southeast corner of the lake. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is sparse in Eagle Lake. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are variable with high densities of sago pondweed, northern milfoil, musk grass, and filamentous algae possible during some years. Water clarity (secchi=8.5 feet) was good in 2004. Intense algae blooms can occur in Eagle during the late summer months, but were minimal during the 2004 summer. Eagle is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Eagle. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2004 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 1.11 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2004 black crappie average size was small (0.04 pounds and 4.35 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from gillnets.Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2004 (5.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.39 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (3.35 pounds and 24.05 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.79 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Eagle were above Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The northern pike 2003 and 2002 year classes each comprised 32% and 35% respectively of the 2004 assessment northern pike catch in Eagle Lake. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2004 (46.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 55.99 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2004 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.59 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds. The 2002 yellow perch year class comprised 67% of the yellow perch captured in the Eagle Lake 2004 assessment.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2004 (6.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the walleye historical catch rate (11.56 fish/gillnet) for Eagle. The 2000 survey walleye catch rate was 4.83 fish/gillnet. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.54 pounds and 17.44 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.50 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking. Limited walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past fall electrofishing surveys and summer surveys. Eagle Lake was recently stocked with walleye in 2002 (26,631 yearlings, 1,132 pounds; 1,562 adults, 142 pounds) and 2004 (17,369 fingerlings, 597 pounds; 1,194 yearlings, 199 pounds; 379 adults, 311 pounds). The 2001 walleye year class (stocked as yearlings in 2002) comprised 29% of the walleye catch in the 2004 assessment. The 2002 walleye year class (natural reproduction) comprised 27% of the walleye catch in the 2004 assessment.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2004 (24.75 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 37.12 fish/trapnet for Eagle. The 2004 bluegill average size was small (0.17 pounds and 5.62 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. Black bullhead numbers were moderate in 2004 (6.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 15.71 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2004 black bullhead average size was large (0.96 pounds and 11.05 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.78 pounds from gillnets.Other fish species of special interest captured in 2004 included low numbers of carp (0.17 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of smallmouth bass (0.08 fish/trapnet, 0.95 pounds average weight). The carp historical average catch rate is 0.71 fish/gillnet. The 2004 average carp size was 4.30 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2008 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey of Eagle Lake was conducted in July of 2009. Eagle is a moderate sized (824 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development (275 homes/cabins) has occurred around the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northeast portion of the lake. There are approximately 19 inlets and 1 outlet for Eagle Lake. Highway 23/71 drainage into the lake occurs along the west side. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles along east and south locations of the lake. A large gravel pit is located in close proximity to the north side of the lake. The Eagle outlet (southwest corner) flows into several shallow lakes and eventually drains into Hawk Creek downstream of Foot Lake. Water levels were low during the summer, but normal by the fall of 2009. A public access is located along the southeast corner of the lake. Emergent vegetation (cattails) was sparse in Eagle Lake during 2009. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake were moderate with clasping-leaf pondweed, muskgrass, water moss, sago pondweed, coontail and filamentous algae present in 2009. Submergent vegetation densities were the highest along the extended shallow shelves of the near shore areas. Shoalwater substrates were mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt in the 2009 transects. Water clarity (secchi=6.5 feet) and nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.042 ppm) were moderate in 2009. Dissolved oxygen levels were below 3.0 ppm at 21 feet and deeper during mid July of 2009. Intense algae blooms can occur in Eagle during the late summer months, but these were minimal during the unseasonably cool 2009 summer. Eagle is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Eagle Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low for both gillnets (0.25 fish/gillnet) and trapnets (0.36 fish/trapnet compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The black crappie historical average catch rates were 1.04 fish/gillnet and 0.36 fish/trapnet). The 2009 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.62 pounds and 10.15 inches) from trapnets. Young of year \"YOY\" black crappie numbers were low (7.50 YOY/seine haul, 2.29 inches average length) in the 2009 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2009 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.29 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2009 northern pike average size was moderate (4.12 pounds and 26.12 inches) from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Eagle were generally above Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2004 and 2005 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2009 re-survey northern pike catch in Eagle Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2009 (22.50 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 53.20 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2009 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.13 pounds and 6.48 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges for all ages. The 2006 yellow perch year class comprised 67% of the yellow perch captured in the Eagle Lake 2009 gillnets and trapnets. YOY yellow perch numbers were abundant (108.50 YOY/seine haul, 2.15 inches average length) in the 2009 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2009 (15.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The walleye historical catch rate is 11.89 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2009 walleye average size was moderate (1.20 pounds and 13.72 inches from gillnets), but smaller than the historical average (1.51 pounds). The 2009 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) walleye (4.25 fish/gillnet) was similar to the Eagle Lake historical average (4.76 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking, but limited walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. The 2007 walleye year class (natural reproduction) comprised 30% of the walleye catch in the 2009 re-survey. The 2008 walleye year class (fingerling stocked year) comprised 28% of the walleye catch in the 2009 re-survey. Eagle Lake was recently stocked with walleye in 2002 (26,631 yearlings, 1,132 pounds; 1,562 adults, 142 pounds), 2004 (17,369 fingerlings, 597 pounds; 1,194 yearlings, 199 pounds; 379 adults, 311 pounds) 2006 (27,159 fingerlings, 1,064 pounds; 25 adults/yearlings, 28 pounds) and 2008 (46,610 fingerlings, 1,098 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2009 (5.91 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 34.52 fish/trapnet in Eagle. The 2009 bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.45 inches from trapnets) and greater than the historical average (0.13 pounds). Bluegill growth rates were generally within or above the Spicer normal ranges for all ages. The 2007 year class comprised 52% of the 2009 bluegill re-survey catch. YOY bluegill numbers were low (1.25 YOY/seine haul, 1.26 inches average length) in the 2009 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2009 gillnets (0.25 fish/gillnet) and trapnets (0.82 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The black bullhead historical average catch rates are 14.42 fish/gillnet and 4.72 fish/trapnet. The 2009 black bullhead average size was large (1.25 pounds and 11.96 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum numbers were moderate in 2009 (2.75 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and historical catches. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 3.87 fish/gillnet. The 2009 freshwater drum average size was large (3.67 pounds and 18.83 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2014 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Eagle Lake during September 29, 2021. Four historical stations were sampled for a total of 40 minutes in 2021. The water temperature was 68 F. during the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation (northern milfoil, coontail, sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed and chara) was moderately dense at most stations in 2021. Water levels were low. Water clarity was excellent. We observed abundant numbers of small sunfish (< 3 inches) and Yellow Perch (2-4 inches); fair numbers of Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Northern Pike and Common Carp in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nEagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. Emergent vegetation (cattails) is sparse in Eagle Lake. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking, but limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers were low (10.50 YOY/hour, 6.65 inches) in the 2021 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (135.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches) in the 2018 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.86 inches) were captured during a 2016 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2014 (no fry stocking), but zero YOY Walleye were captured indicating poor natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (29.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Eagle Lake and similar lakes in the 2020 standard summer survey. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 13.78 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The 2020 Walleye average size was small (0.86 pounds and 13.62 inches) from gillnets. The 2018 year class (fry stocked) comprised 77% of the 2020 Walleye survey catch. Eagle Lake was stocked with walleye in 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds), 2016 (822,491 fry; 14,934 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds; 935 yearlings, 284.5 pounds; 24 adults, 30 pounds), 2018 (955,220 fry) and 2021 (548,317 fry). Local residents have reported catching numerous small walleye (12-14\") in Eagle during 2020. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The current Walleye management stocking strategy entails stocking fry three out of four years with supplemental fingerling stockings during years of poor fry success starting in 2022. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2022 fall for YOY Walleye by electrofishing and the 2025 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle is a moderate sized, deep, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Waterlevels were normal to low in Eagle during 2000. The immediate watershed is moderate in sizeand varied for land use (wetlands, residential development, agricultural row crops). Thereare 16 small inlets entering the lake. The Lawler Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" isoperated each year for northern pike fingerling production. Several dam boards are put inplace about 100 yards upstream of the Lawler inlet (Inlet#1) to provide increased spawninghabitat for northern pike in the Lawler NPSA. Most of the small inlets were dry during the2000 summer survey. The outlet is a concrete fixed sill dam with a swinging finger fishbarrier above and a carp trap below the dam. The outlet drains through a series of lakes(Swan Lake, Willmar and Foot Lakes) and eventually becomes Hawk Creek below the Foot Lakeoutlet dam. The shoreline characteristics are mostly residential homes with hardwood trees.There are 275 homes on Eagle Lake. Submergent (muskgrass, filamentous algae, sago pondweed)vegetation was common to rare in Eagle Lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, reedcanary grass) was rare in Eagle Lake. Shoalwater substrates were mostly sand and gravel. Thewater clarity was excellent (10.75 feet secchi disc) on June 12, 2000, but decreasedsubstantially (4.0 feet secchi disc) by July 10, 2000. Nutrient and chlorophyll levels weremoderate (0.032 ppm total phosphorus, 9.9 ppb chlorophyll a) in Eagle. Algae blooms arecommon in Eagle during the late summer months. Dissolved oxygen levels on July 10, 2000 wereabove 5 ppm from 0-20 feet of water depth.     Walleye abundance (4.83 fish/gillnet) was low in 2000 compared to the historical average(12.07 fish/gillnet). The walleye abundance in the previous 1998 assessment was 16.25fish/gillnet (1.13 lbs. average size). The 2000 walleye average size was moderate (1.54 lbs.and 14.57 inches, gillnets). The largest walleye captured in the 2000 survey nets was 24.02inches. Walleye growth rates for ages 1-6 were at or above normal compared to area lakes.Limited walleye natural reproduction has been documented in Eagle by fall electrofishingsurveys, however the contribution to the walleye population is probably minimal during mostyears. Eagle Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every even year. Approximately 48,500walleye fingerlings were stocked into Eagle Lake during the fall of 2000.     Yellow perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (24.83 fish/gillnet). The 2000yellow perch average size was small (0.09 lbs. and 5.95 inches, gillnets). The 1997 yearclass comprised 53% of the 2000 yellow perch catch. Young of year \"YOY\" yellow perch wereabundant (33.43 YOY/seine haul, 2.23 inches average size) in the August of 2000 shorelineseine hauls.     Northern pike numbers were low in 2000 (1.67 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pikeaverage size was moderate (3.78 lbs. and 25.15 inches, gillnets). The 1998 year classcomprised 50% of the total 2000 northern pike catch. Northern pike growth rates for ages 1-4were above the normal ranges of area lakes. Winter rescue adult northern pike were stockedinto Eagle during 1999 (236 fish).     Bluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (24.25 fish/trapnet). The 2000bluegill average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 5.19 inches, trapnets). The largest bluegillcaptured was 8.35 inches in the 2000 nets. The 1998 bluegill year class comprised 74% of the2000 total bluegill catch. Bluegill growth rates for ages 1-5 were within the normal rangesof area lakes. Adult pre-spawn bluegill were stocked in 1999 (582 fish) to boost numbers andnatural reproduction. There were no YOY bluegill captured in the August of 2000 shorelineseine hauls.     Black bullhead were abundant in 2000 (40.50 fish/gillnet). The 2000 black bullheadaverage size was small (0.27 lbs. and 7.34 inches, gillnets). YOY black bullhead numbers wereabundant (110.86 YOY/seine haul) in the August of 2000 shoreline seine hauls.     Other fish species captured in Eagle during the 2000 survey included low numbers ofblack crappie (0.33 fish/gillnet), low numbers of freshwater drum (2.00 fish/gillnet), highnumbers of green sunfish (4.75 fish/trapnet), low numbers of carp (0.17 fish/trapnet), andmoderate numbers of bigmouth buffalo (0.42 fish/trapnet). The 2000 freshwater drum averagesize was large (2.30 lbs. and 16.30 inches, gillnets).      Eagle Lake receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure for walleye and northern pikeduring most years. Local anglers had good success catching walleye in recent years. The poornorthern pike natural reproduction success in recent years is due to fluctuating and lowwater levels in the Lawler NPSA inlet during spawning. Bluegill numbers and naturalreproduction appears to have improved, however, quality bluegill habitat (submergentvegetation densities) conditions are variable in Eagle. The moderately abundant yellow perchpopulation should provide a good forage base for walleye and northern pike in the future.Although, the walleye and northern pike numbers are presently down, these species shouldrebound with stocking and natural reproduction. Eagle Lake is scheduled for a summerpopulation assessment in 2004 to determine gamefish abundance, size, and growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Eagle Lake was conducted during early July of 2014. Eagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Eagle is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Water clarity (secchi=4.0 feet) was fair during the 2014 assessment. The water color is usually brown stained due to lake sediments. Agricultural row crop drainage via inlets and residential development (275 homes/cabins, 2009 survey) are the primary nutrient contributors to Eagle Lake. A habitat rehabilitation project is currently being conducted below the outlet dam along the outlet channel shoreline in order to improve bank vegetation cover and reduce bank erosion. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 from inlets due to numerous rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. The high water levels resulted in some shoreline erosion in addition to some docks and boat lifts floating away from their moorings. A public access is located along the southeast corner of the lake. Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrushes) was sparse in Eagle Lake during 2014. Submergent vegetation species commonly occurring along a large shallow shelf include clasping-leaf pondweed, muskgrass, water moss, sago pondweed, coontail and filamentous algae. Intense algae blooms can occur in Eagle during the late summer months, but these were minimal during a cool 2014 summer. Eagle is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2014 (3.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the Eagle historical average (1.23 fish/gillnet). The 2014 black crappie average size was small (0.15 pounds and 6.31 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (2.35 fish/gillnet) for Eagle. The northern pike average size was moderately large (4.67 pounds and 26.71 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.04 pounds from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of larger (28.00 plus inches) northern pike (1.00 fish/net) captured in the gillnets. The 2010 year class comprised 53% of the 2014 northern pike catch. Northern pike grow rates were excellent. The largest northern pike captured was 33.3 inches from a gillnet in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderately abundant (40.00 fish/gillnet) in 2014. The yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.30 inches) from gillnets. Approximately 86% of the yellow perch captured were from the 2012 year class. Yellow perch growth rates were moderate. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2014 (21.25 fish/gillnet) especially compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Eagle historical average (12.61 fish/gillnet). The walleye average size was small to moderate (0.90 pounds and 13.58 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.47 pounds from gillnets. Low numbers of moderate sized (15.00 plus inches) walleye (2.25 fish/gillnet) were captured in 2014. The largest walleye captured was 27.5 inches from a trapnet in 2014. Walleye growth rates were slower for ages 1-3, but above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 4-8. The walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2014, but no young of year walleye were captured indicating no natural reproduction in 2014. Eagle Lake has been primarily stocked with walleye fingerlings (1,100 pounds) every other year with the most recent stocking occurring in 2014. In addition, walleye fry were stocked (1,000,481 fry) in 2011. The 2011 year class comprised 65% of the 2014 survey catch. Local residents have reported catching numerous small walleye (<12 inches) in Eagle during the past few years, especially in the 2012 summer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant (73.67 fish/trapnet), but small (0.06 pounds and 4.32 inches) from trapnets in 2014. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. Low numbers of larger (6.00 plus inches) bluegill (4.23 fish/net) were caught in the 2014 trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 8.8 inches from a trapnet in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in both gillnets (0.50 fish/gillnet) and trapnets (0.33 fish/trapnet) in 2014. The black bullhead average weight was moderate (0.35 pounds and 8.64 inches) from gillnets. The 2014 black bullhead average weight was 0.30 pounds from trapnets. Yellow bullhead numbers were moderately abundant (3.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes in 2014. The yellow bullhead average weight was large (0.92 pounds) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (2.00 fish/gillnet, 2.83 fish/trapnet). The freshwater drum historical average catch rates are 3.73 fish/gillnet and 0.43 fish/trapnet. The 2014 freshwater drum average sizes were moderate for gillnets (1.01 pounds and 13.35 inches), but large for trapnets (3.35 pounds and 18.56 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in 2014 (0.58 fish/trapnet) was slightly above the historical average (0.33 fish/trapnet). No spring electrofishing surveys were conducted for largemouth bass in Eagle Lake during 2014. The 2014 largemouth bass average size was small (0.87 pounds and 9.94 inches) from trapnets. The largest largemouth bass captured was 18.9 inches from a trapnet in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance in 2014 (2.00 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (0.15 fish/gillnet). The 2014 smallmouth average size was small (0.75 pounds and 11.02 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during 2014 included low numbers of channel catfish (0.25 fish/gillnet, 2.65 pounds average weight), moderate numbers of bigmouth buffalo (0.50 fish/trapnet, 8.15 pounds average weight), and abundant numbers of common carp (3.08 fish/trapnet, 5.03 pounds average size).  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted night electrofishing survey was conducted for Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass on Eagle Lake during June 1, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Five of six representative stations were sampled for a total of 100 minutes in 2022. The water temperature was 64 F. during the 2022 June electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation (northern milfoil, coontail, sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed and chara) was moderately dense in 2022. Water levels were low. Water clarity was moderate. We observed moderate numbers of yearling Walleye in the 2022 June electrofishing survey. A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was also conducted for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye on Eagle during 2022. <br> \n <br> \nEagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. Emergent vegetation (cattails) is sparse in Eagle Lake. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rate was high (59.40 fish/hour) in the 2022 June electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass overall average size was small (0.86 pounds and 10.4 inches). Females comprised 21% of the 2022 Largemouth Bass catch with an average length of 15.4 inches. Approximately 29% of the females were prespawn fish with eggs. Males comprised 17% of the 2022 Largemouth Bass catch with an average length of 14.3 inches. Unknown gender fish comprised 62% of the 2022 Largemouth Bass catch with an average length of 7.60 inches. The Largemouth catch rate of quality size (12.0 inches plus) was high (21.60 fish/hour). The Largemouth catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches plus) was also high (12.60 fish/hour). The largest Largemouth Bass captured was 17.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catch rate was moderate (12.60 fish/hour) in the 2022 June electrofishing survey. The Smallmouth Bass average size was large (2.13 pounds and 15.2 inches). Females comprised 38% of the 2022 Smallmouth Bass catch with an average length of 17.3 inches. Approximately 50% of the females were prespawn fish with eggs. Males comprised 52% of the 2022 Smallmouth Bass catch with an average length of 14.4 inches. Unknown gender fish comprised 10% of the 2022 Smallmouth Bass catch with an average length of 10.9 inches. The Smallmouth catch rate of quality size (11.0 inches plus) was 12.00 fish/hour. The Smallmouth catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches plus) was 8.40 fish/hour. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 21.0 inches. Smallmouth Bass were observed on the nests during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 fall for YOY Walleye by electrofishing and the 2025 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Eagle Lake was conducted during mid-July of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). An Index of Biotic Integrity \"FIBI\" targeted survey for all near shore fish species was conducted in August of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nEagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Eagle is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. Water clarity (secchi=5.5 feet) was fair during the 2020 survey. The water color is usually brown stained due to lake sediments. Nutrient levels (total phosphorus=0.042 ppm) were moderate in 2009. Dissolved oxygen levels were good down to 22 feet and shallower during early July of 2020. Intense algae blooms can occur in Eagle during the late summer months, but these were minimal during 2020 summer. Residential development (271 homes/cabins, 2020 survey) has occurred around the entire shoreline area with the exception of the northeast portion of the lake. There are approximately 19 inlets and 1 outlet for Eagle Lake. Highway 23/71 drainage into the lake occurs along the west side. Point Lake outlet flows from a steep culvert across Highway 23/71 into the northwest corner of Eagle. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles along east and south locations of the lake. A large gravel pit is located in close proximity to the north side of the lake. The Eagle outlet (southwest corner) flows into several shallow lakes and eventually drains into Hawk Creek downstream of Foot Lake. A habitat rehabilitation project was conducted below the outlet dam along the outlet channel shoreline in order to improve bank vegetation cover and reduce bank erosion.  <br> \n <br> \nWater levels were low during July of 2020. A public access is located along the southeast corner of the lake. Emergent vegetation (cattails) was sparse in Eagle Lake during 2020. Submergent vegetation species commonly occurring include clasping-leaf pondweed, muskgrass, narrow-leaf pondweed, water moss, sago pondweed, coontail and filamentous algae. Submergent vegetation densities are the highest along the extended shallow shelves of the near shore areas. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt. Eagle is managed primarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey of nearshore fish species was conducted by seine hauls and backpack electrofishing at 14 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations from August 18-20, 2020. Approximately 19 different fish species (13 species from backpack electrofishing, and 13 species from seining) were captured from backpack electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), potentially large sized non-gamefish (White Sucker, Bullhead species) and small sized non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Fathead Minnow, Bluntnose Minnow, Spottail Shiner and Blacknose Shiner). Intolerant habitat disturbance species captured included: Iowa Darter and Banded Killifish in Eagle. High tolerant habitat disturbance species captured included: Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow from near shore sampling; Black Bullhead and Common Carp from gillnets and trapnets. The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI Tool-2NC was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 24, which is below the impairment threshold (45) for this tool. In the Spicer Area, Bass/Bluegill dominated lakes with dams which inhibit fish movement or limited river flow through connections tend to have lower fish species diversity and corresponding FIBI scores even though water quality and clarity may be excellent. A lack of habitat variety is more likely the cause of lower fish diversity and poor FIBI scores in Eagle. It is unknown the long term effects of different invasive species on fish diversity will be within lakes and rivers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were absent in the 2020 gillnets. The 2020 Black Crappie trapnet catch rate (1.58 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (2.97 fish/trapnet). The 2020 Black Crappie average size was small (0.06 pounds and 4.57 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.47 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2020 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (2.39 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2020 Northern Pike average size was small (2.48 pounds and 22.36 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 3.00 pounds from gillnets. No large Northern Pike (>28.00 inches) were caught in gillnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 37.01 inches in the 2020 trapnets. Northern Pike growth rates in Eagle were fair for ages 1-7. The 2016 year class comprised 36% of the 2020 Northern Pike catch in Eagle Lake. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Eagle Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2020 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (48.60 fish/gillnet) and the normal range for similar lakes. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.11 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow for ages 1-4. The 2016 Yellow Perch year class comprised 83% of the 2020 yellow perch catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2020 (29.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (13.78 fish/gillnet) for Eagle. Walleye numbers were also above the normal range for similar lakes. The 2020 Walleye average size was small (0.86 pounds and 13.62 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.42 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The majority of Walleye captured (77%) were from the 2018 year class (fry stocked). Local residents have reported catching numerous small walleye (12-14\") in Eagle during 2020. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking, but limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. Walleye fry were last stocked in 2018. Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye were abundant (135.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches) in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.86 inches) were captured during a 2016 (fry stocking) fall electrofishing survey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2014 (no fry stocking), but zero YOY Walleye were captured indicating no natural reproduction. Eagle Lake was recently stocked with walleye in 2011 (1,000,481 fry), 2012 (1,365 fingerlings, 100 pounds; 2,890 yearlings, 859 pounds), 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds), 2016 (822,491 fry; 14,934 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds; 935 yearlings, 284.5 pounds; 24 adults, 30 pounds), and 2018 (955,220 fry).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2020 (6.75 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 35.33 fish/trapnet in Eagle. The 2020 Bluegill average size was large (0.28 pounds and 6.86 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2020 (0.08 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead were absent in the 2020 gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 12.40 fish/gillnet and 4.07 fish/trapnet. The 2020 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.16 pounds and 12.68 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were low in 2020 (1.42 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2020 Yellow Bullhead average weight (1.26 pounds) was large from trapnets and above the Eagle Lake historical average (0.89 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum \"Sheepshead\" numbers were abundant in 2020 (7.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (4.00 fish/gillnet). Freshwater Drum were also abundant in the 2020 trapnets (1.42 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (0.50 fish/trapnet). The 2020 Freshwater Drum average size was small (1.00 pounds and 10.51 inches) from gillnets. The 2020 Freshwater Drum average weight was 3.75 pounds in trapnets. The Freshwater Drum historical average weight is 1.46 pounds and 3.67 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were low in 2020 (0.08 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (0.31 fish/trapnet). No spring electrofishing surveys were conducted for Largemouth Bass in Eagle Lake during 2014 or 2020. The 2020 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.29 pounds and 13.43 inches) from trapnets. Abundant young of year Largemouth Bass numbers were captured in the nearshore \"FIBI\" electrofishing and seining gears during mid-August of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2020 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.46 fish/gillnet). The 2020 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (1.92 pounds and 14.97 inches) from gillnets. Low young of year Smallmouth Bass numbers were captured in the nearshore \"FIBI\" electrofishing and seining gears during mid-August of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (0.08 fish/trapnet, 0.50 fish/gillnet) and White Sucker (0.50 fish/gillnet), but abundant numbers of Common Carp (1.25 fish/trapnet, 5.94 pounds average size).  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2023 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

THE 1992 PSD (25) WAS BELOW THE RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (30-60) AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (59). NOP PSD'S FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS WERE VARIABLE RANGING FROM 14 TO 100 WITH ONLY ONE INTERMEDIATE VALUE (42).  THE 1992 RSD-P (25) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (9), HOWEVER THE SAMPLE SIZE OF STOCK FISH GREATER THAN 14 INCHES WAS ONLY 4 IN 1992.  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT OF NOP WAS 4.37 LBS.  THE HISTORICAL MEAN WEIGHT OF NOP IS 2.80 LBS.  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (34.58 PER TN, 5.27 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX AND SLIGHTLY BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (38.62 PER TN, 4.33 LBS PER TN) FOR NUMBERS.  THERE WERE NO BLGS CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS IN 1992.  THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE GILLNET CATCH WAS 1.22 FISH PER GN AND 0.22 LBS PER GN.  THE 1992 PSD (21) WAS BELOW THE RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION AND NEAR THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (18).  THE 1992 RSD-P (0) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (1).  THE 1992.  BLG MEAN WEIGHT (0.15 LBS) CAPTURED FROM TRAPNETS WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.11).  GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE  FOR BLG.  THE 1989 BLG YEAR CLASS STRENGTH APPEARS MODERATE TO STRONG.  THE 1992 YOY BLG CATCH INDEX (0.14 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (19.61 PER SEINE HAUL).  THE 1992 LMB SPRING ELECTROFISHING CATCH INDEX (21.33 PER HOUR, 45.38 LBS PER HOUR) APPEARS TO BE AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS AND POUNDS COMPARED TO LOCAL AREA LAKES. THE 1992 LMB TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (0.08 PER TN, 0.17 LBS PER TN) WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.51 PER TN, 0.23 LBS PER TN) FOR BOTH NUMBERS AND POUNDS.  THE 1992 SPRING ELECTROFISHING PSD (94) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (40- 60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE 1992 SPRING ELECTROFISHING RSD-P WAS 69.  THE LMB MEAN WEIGHT CAUGHT FROM ELECTROFISHING WAS 2.13 LBS.  THE LMB MEAN WEIGHT FROM TRAPNETS WAS 2.13 LBS COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 0.83 LBS.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-4, AVERAGE FOR AGES 5-6, AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGE 7.  BLC WERE NOT CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS OR TRAPNETS IN 1992.  THE BLC HISTORICAL AVERAGES ARE 0.98 FISH PER GN AND 0.54 FISH PER TN.  BLC YOY CATCH INDEX (0.00 PER SEINE HAUL) IN 1992 WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.37 PER SEINE HAUL).  THE 1992 YEP CATCH INDEX (52.00 PER GN, 5.14 LBS PER GN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS AND AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX, BUT BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (71.36 PER GN, 11.73 PER GN) FOR BOTH NUMBERS AND POUNDS.  THE 1992 PSD (3) WAS BELOW THE RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (30-50) AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (15). THE 1992 RSD-P (0) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (1).  THE 1992 YEP MEAN WEIGHT (0.10 LBS) CAUGHT FROM GILLNETS WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.16 LBS).  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-2 AND AVERAGE FOR AGES 3-7. THERE APPEARS TO BE A STRONG 1989 YEP YEAR CLASS. THE 1992 YEP YOY CATCH INDEX (290.71 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (316.11 PER SEINE HAUL).  THE 1992 WAE CATCH INDEX (4.00 PER GN, 7.41 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX, BUT BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (10.58 PER GN, 15.48 LBS PER GN).  THE 1992 WAE PSD (68) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (46).  THE 1992 RSD-P (48) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (17) AND WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED VALUE.  THE WAE MEAN WEIGHT CAUGHT FROM GILLNETS WAS 1.85 LBS IN 1992 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 1.49 LBS.  THE WAE MEAN WEIGHT CAUGHT FROM TRAPNETS WAS 5.16 LBS IN 1992 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 3.10 LBS.  GROWTH RATES WERE VARIABLE FOR WAE PROBABLY DUE TO THE EXCELLENT FIRST YEAR GROWTH OF THE 1991 YEAR CLASS AND THE HIGH NUMBERS OF OLDER FISH.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR AGE 1 AND 3-6 BUT BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 2 AND 7-12.  THE WAE POPULATION APPEARS TO BE COMPOSED OF PRIMARILY AGE I AND AGE V+ FISH WITH FEW FISH OF INTERMEDIATE AGES OR SIZES.  THE 1991 YEAR CLASS APPEARS TO BE STRONG WITH GOOD NUMBERS AND EXCELLENT FIRST YEAR GROWTH (8.0-9.9 INCHES) AS INDICATED FROM THE SPRING ELECTROFISHING DATA. THE 1991 YEAR CLASS WAS FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. WAE NUMBERS OF INTERMEDIATE SIZES SHOULD IMPROVE WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IF THE YEP FORAGE BASE CONTINUES TO BE ABUNDANT AND IF THE 1991 YEAR CLASS IS SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITED INTO THE POPULATION.  FRD WERE FIRST CAPTURED IN THE 1990 SURVEY.  THE 1992 FRD INDEX (2.13 PER GN, 4.27 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 27 INDEX AND BELOW THE 1990 CATCH INDEX FOR NUMBERS (3.83 PER GN, 3.67 LBS PER GN).  THE PSD WAS 100 IN 1992 AND 83 IN 1990.  THE RSD-P WAS 45 IN 1992 AND 4 IN 1990.  THE FRD MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.00 LBS IN 1992 AND 0.96 LBS IN 1990.  THE 1992 BLB CATCH INDEX (0.00 LBS PER GN; 4.25 PER TN, 0.75 LBS PER TN) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (7.57 PER GN, 2.80 LBS PER GN; 5.79 PER TN, 1.81 LBS PER TN).

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Eagle Lake during September 18, 2023. Four historical stations were sampled for a total of 60 minutes in 2023. The water temperature was 70 F. during the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation (northern milfoil, coontail, sago pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed and chara) was moderately dense at most stations in 2023. Water levels were low. Water clarity was moderate. We observed abundant to moderate numbers of small Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Shiners and small Yellow Perch in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nEagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Eagle during 2018. Emergent vegetation (cattails) is sparse in Eagle Lake. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and silt.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to stocking, but limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. No Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye were captured in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of Yearling Walleye (11.00 fish/hour, 9.89 inches) were caught in 2023. YOY Walleye numbers were moderate (22.50 YOY/hour, 5.54 inches) for Eagle in the 2022 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were low (10.50 YOY/hour, 6.65 inches) in the 2021 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (135.00 YOY/hour, 6.26 inches) in the 2018 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (4.50 YOY/hour, 6.86 inches) were captured during a 2016 (fry stocked) fall electrofishing survey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2014 (no fry stocking), but zero YOY Walleye were captured indicating poor natural reproduction. The YOY Walleye average catch rate is 17.77 YOY/hour for Eagle. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (29.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Eagle Lake and similar lakes in the most recent 2020 standard summer survey. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 13.78 fish/gillnet for Eagle. The Walleye average size was small (0.86 pounds and 13.62 inches) from the 2020 gillnets. The 2018 year class (fry stocked) comprised 77% of the 2020 Walleye survey catch. Eagle Lake was stocked with walleye in 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds), 2016 (822,491 fry; 14,934 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds; 935 yearlings, 284.5 pounds; 24 adults, 30 pounds), 2018 (955,220 fry), 2021 (548,317 fry), 2022 (567,731 fry) and 2023 (349,536 fry; 18,412 fingerlings, 493 pounds). Local residents reported catching numerous small walleye (12-14\") in Eagle during 2020. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The current Walleye management stocking strategy entails stocking fry annually with supplemental fingerling stockings during years of poor fry success as determined by electrofishing. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2025 fall for YOY Walleye by electrofishing and the 2025 summer by standard survey gears for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Eagle is a moderate sized (849 acres), deep (67 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Eagle Lake is due primarily to fingerling stockings, but limited Walleye natural reproduction has been documented by past surveys. Eagle Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2008 (46,610 fingerlings, 1,098 pounds, 2010 (17,562 fingerlings, 1,104 pounds), 2011 (1,000,481 fry), 2012 (1,365 fingerlings, 100 pounds; 2,890 yearlings, 859 pounds), 2014 (24,510 fingerlings, 1,195 pounds) and 2016 (822,491 Pike River strain fry; 15,888 Spicer strain fingerlings, 1,145 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (4.5 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) were caught (fry stocked year) in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2016. A fall electrofishing survey was also conducted in 2014 (non-fry stocked year) prior to fingerling stocking, but no YOY Walleye were captured thus indicating no apparent natural reproduction. Fall electrofishing surveys were conducted during the early 1990's, but YOY Walleye catch rates were low (0.0-15.0 YOY/hour) due to natural reproduction. The 2011 Walleye year class (1.0 million fry stocked in 2011 and 2,890 yearlings stocked in 2012) comprised 65% of the Walleye catch in the 2014 summer survey. Local residents reported catching small (about 8 inches) Walleye during the 2012 summer. Walleye yearlings were not stocked until the 2012 fall. Other recent fingerling stocked year classes (2012, 2010, and 2008) each comprised between 6-8% of the Walleye summer survey catch in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Eagle Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Eagle Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Eagle Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 14-17 June 2021.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample all fourteen sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass) and three species (Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 14-16 June 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and walleye comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Walleye and Freshwater Drum comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 5.4 inches, with 17% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Eagle Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Yellow Medicine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
