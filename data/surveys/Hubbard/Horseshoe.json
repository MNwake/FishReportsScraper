                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of Walleye (0.25/gill net and 0.88 lbs/ gill net) were below the first quartile for lake class 25 of the Schupp classification system.  The only Walleye sampled was a 20.80 inch, age 9 fish weighing 3.50 lbs.  Walleye are not stocked in Mirage Lake.  Northern Pike catch rates (12.50 fish/gill net and 34.50 lbs/gill net) were well above the third quartile for lakes of this classification.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 2.76 lbs.  Northern Pike exhibit slow growth, averaging 17.07 inches at age 4.  The present Proportional Stock Density (PSD) value of 46, Relative Stock Density - Preferred (RSD-P) value of 12, and Relative Stock Density - Memorable (RSD-M) value of 2 indicate a good size structure with a good proportion of the population attaining lengths preferred by anglers.  Recruitment appears strong for all year classes sampled.  Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Pumpkinseed catches were all within the normal ranges. Yellow Perch size structure is poor, as no fish reach quality length (PSD=0).  The PSD of 56 for Pumpkinseed indicates a good size structure, however, no fish reach preferred lengths.  Growth rates of Pumpkinseed are slow, averaging 3.80 inches at age 4.  Number of Bluegill caught was within the normal range, while 7.24 lbs/trap net was above the third quartile. This apparent improvement in size over the other panfish is evident in the size distribution of Bluegill (PSD=58, RSD-P=4).  Bluegill exhibit slow growth the first 3 years (average length at age 3=3.12 inches) before experiencing good growth rates. Bowfin catch rates were above the third quartile for lakes of this class.  White Sucker catches were below the first quartile.  Catch rates of Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and Rock Bass were all within the normal ranges.</p>",

Mirage Lake has no public access.  Mirage provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.Anglers will find good numbers of northern pike present in Mirage.  While larger fish are present, the 2002 sample was dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The northern pike population in Mirage is limited by high recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.  Moderate numbers of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass were sampled in 2002.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range and bluegill in the 6-7 inch range common.  Walleye were sampled in very low numbers, similar to the previous survey in 1991.  Other species sampled include moderate numbers of yellow perch, bowfin (dogfish), and rock bass.  Pumpkinseed, common shiner, and  bullheads were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
