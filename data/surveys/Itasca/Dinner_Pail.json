                "narrative": "<p>Dinner Pail Lake is a small, mesotrophic lake near Hill City, MN.  There is a county owned access on the northeast end.  The lake has moderate residential development as five dwellings were noted adjacent to lake.  Despite being primarily in private ownership, the shoreline is generally undisturbed.  The lake appears to support a healthy aquatic plant community and emergent and floating leaf species ring the lake.  Dinner Pail Lake appears to have adequate fish habitat to support a fish community typical of small lakes in the region.  A previous assessment indicated that northern pike and bluegill were the primary species of angler interest in Dinner Pail Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, the northern pike catch rate was relatively high compared to similar lakes.  The assessment indicated a moderate size distribution, as the approximately 40% of the sampled fish exceeded 21 inches 12% exceeding 28 inches.  One pike exceeded 36 inches, indicating at least some potential for large individuals.  Given the small size of the lake, limited prey base, and relatively high pike density, it is unlikely that Dinner Pail Lake could support many large northern pike.  Releasing larger pike (exceeding 22 inches) will help ensure quality fishing in Dinner Pail Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate of bluegill was within the expected range for the lake class.  The size structure was moderate as 74% of the sampled bluegill exceeded 6 inches.  Few individuals (3%) exceeded the angler-preferred size of 8 inches, however, and a lack of large individuals may limit the popularity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured in relatively low numbers in 2008.  The trap net catch was within the expected range but near the lower end.  No crappies were captured in the gill nets.  Size was generally small and no individuals exceeded 8 inches.  It should be noted that a 1977 assessment resulted in a high gill net catch of crappies.  Year class strength in black crappie is often inconsistent among years and poor age structure may contribute to the low catch in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nA previous assessment in 1977 resulted in a yellow perch catch of 29.0/gill net.  In 2008, only one yellow perch was sampled.  Low perch abundance may limit predator numbers in Dinner Pail Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in relatively low abundance included bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
