There was evidence that some natural reproduction had occurred, but stocking also appeared to have contributed to the walleye population.  Walleye growth rates were about average for the area.Yellow perch were relatively abundant, but most were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  White sucker were also abundant, although there was some evidence to suggest that their numbers had declined since walleye were introduced in this lake.  No other game fish or panfish species were taken in 2000, and none were known to have been present.</p>",
