                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a class 22 lake located on the south side of Pengilly, MN.  The lake has one developed public access and the shoreline is highly developed with almost 500 homes/cabins.  The lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie as secondary species.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit with only one walleye over 26 inches in possession was implemented.  The 2013 assessment was conducted to help evaluate the special regulation.  The 2013 assessment included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score and these data are documented in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, northern pike gill-net catch rates have increased from being below the 1st quartile value from 1948 through 1975 to being above the lake class median in all but one assessment since.  In 2000, the northern pike catch was the highest on record at 9.8 fish/net.  In the last three assessments, the catch has exceeded the management goal of 5.0 fish/net; ranging from 6.8 fish/net in 2005 to 7.9 fish/net 2013.  In 2013, the sampled fish ranged from 16.6 to 38.0 inches and had a mean length of 22.5 inches.  Seven year-classes were identified by scales and cliethra with fish from age 1 to 7 represented.  Two through four year old fish represented 86% of the fish aged.  Northern pike growth was similar to statewide averages with fish averaging 23.4 inches after four years. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious assessments have had walleye catch rates from as low as 2.0 in 1985 to as high as 11.1 fish/net in 1954.  Although the 2013 walleye gill-net catch of 5.0 fish/net did not attain the ambitious management goal of 10.0 fish/net, it was within the lake class normal range.  The lower catch is not a concern because a high proportion of the sample was smaller fish that are underrepresented in the gear.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 inches and averaged 14.8 inches.   <br> \n   <br> \nFourteen year-classes were identified from scale and bone analysis with fish from age 1 to 18 years old.  Walleye from the 2008 through 2012 year-classes each represented at least 13% of the sample.  The 2012 year-class (19% of the sample) appeared to be quite large considering they averaged 8.8 inches long and our standard experimental gill nets underestimate small fish.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages through age 10.  Walleye averaged 15.0 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap-net catch was 0.3 fish/net, which is near the 1st quartile for class 22 lakes.  The catch rates have fluctuated from 0.3 to 1.4 fish/net since 1975.  The fish ranged from 7.4 to 10.6 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  Black crappie were not aged in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has never been abundant in Swan Lake.  The 2009 trap-net catch (12.7/net) was the highest on record, approaching the lake class median of 15.3/net.  In 2013, the catch was 1.6 fish/trap net.  The sampled fish ranged from 2.6 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 4.4 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 10.4 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 63.0 fish/net in 1984.  The catch has been fairly stable in the last three assessments.  The gill-net catch was 25.7 fish/net in 2013, which is between the lake class median and 3rd quartile value.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.7 to 10.0 inches and had an average length of 6.4 inches.  The yellow perch population is likely more important to the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target. <br> \n <br> \nThe tullibee is a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 0.9 fish/net and as high as 22.1 fish/net since 1948.  The gill-net catch of 0.9 fish/net in 2013 was the lowest on record for Swan Lake, and it reflects a trend that began in the mid-1980s.  Although the total number captured was low, there were obviously two age-classes present based on the size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the assessment included brown bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a 2,472 acre lake located on the south side of Pengilly, MN.  The lake has two public access and the shoreline is highly developed with approximately 500 homes/cabins.  The 2001 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie as secondary species.  The walleye catch rate (7.7 fish/net) did not attain the management goal of 10.0 fish/net but was identical to the 2000 catch.  Previous assessments have found catch rates from as low as 2.0 in 1985 to as high as 11.1 fish/net in 1954.  In 2005, the sampled fish ranged from 6.9 to 26.4 inches and had an average length of 12.6 inches.Ten year classes were identified from scale analysis with fish from one to 14 years old.  Walleye from one to four years old were well represented in the sample.  The strong 2004 and 2001year classes corresponded to years with fry stocking.  However, both 2003 and 2002 year classes were well represented in the sample.  It is clear that natural reproduction is contributing to the walleye population but it is impossible to determine to what extent since fry are not marked.  Many of the fish produced in years with fry stocking (for example 2004 & 2001) may be a result of natural reproduction.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Walleye averaged 14.0 inches after four years of growth.In general, northern pike catch rates have increased from being below the 1st quartile of 3.0 fish/net from 1948 through 1975 to being above the 3rd quartile of 7.9 fish/net in 1995 and 2000.  In 2000, the northern pike catch was the highest on record at 9.8 fish/net but has since declined to 6.9 fish/net in 2005.  The catch exceeded the management goal catch rate of 5.0 fish/net and was near the size structure goals established for the lake.  Fish ranged from 13.8 to 33.8 inches and averaged 22.9 inches.  The long-term trend of higher numbers of northern pike may be in response to angler harvest.The black crappie trap-net catch was 0.3 fish/net which was below average for this type of lake. Catch rates have fluctuated from 0.3 to 1.3 fish/net since 1975.  In 2005, the fish ranged from 8.9 to 12.3 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  Black crappie were not aged in the 2005 assessment.The bluegill population has never been very abundant with catch rates never attaining the lake class average.  The 2005 trap-net catch (1.1/net) was below the normal range for this lake type.  Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Yellow perch catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 10.4 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 63.0 fish/net in 1984.  The catch increased from 11.2 fish/net in 2000 to 30.2 fish/net in 2005.  The catch was near the 3rd quartile of 33.9 fish/net for lakes similar to Swan Lake.  At this time, it appears the yellow perch population is more important in the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target.Tullibee are a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.   The catch rate declined from 8.4 fish/net in 2000 to 2.7 fish/net in this assessment.   Although the 2005 catch was the lowest on record for Swan Lake, it remained above the lake class average of 1.6 fish/net.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 2.7 fish/net and as high as 22.1 fish/net with no apparent trends.Other species observed during the population assessment included bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin, burbot, common shiner, golden shiner, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a class 22 lake located on the south side of Pengilly, MN.  The lake has one public access and the shoreline is highly developed with almost 500 homes/cabins.  The lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie as secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nIn general, northern pike gill-net catch rates have increased from being below the 1st quartile from 1948 through 1975 to being above the lake class median in all but one assessment since.  In 2000, the northern pike catch was the highest on record at 9.8 fish/net.  The catch declined to 6.9 and 6.8 fish/net in 2005 and 2009 yet still exceeded the management goal of 5.0 fish/net.  In 2009, the sampled fish ranged from 14.3 to 38.6 inches and had a mean length of 22.4 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified by scales and cliethra with fish from age 1 to 8 represented.  Two through four year old fish represented 75% of the fish aged.  Northern pike growth was similar to statewide averages with fish averaging 22.7 inches after four years. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious assessments have had walleye catch rates from as low as 2.0 in 1985 to as high as 11.1 fish/net in 1954.  In 2009, the walleye gill-net catch rate was 6.1 fish/net.  Although the catch did not attain the management goal of 10.0 fish/net, it was similar to the last two assessments and the lake class median.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.6 to 22.9 inches and had a mean length of 12.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nTen year-classes were identified from scale and bone analysis with fish from age 0 to 9 years old.  Walleye from the 2008 and 2006 year-classes represented 37 and 32% of the sample.  The 2008 year-class appeared to be quite large considering they averaged just less than eight inches long and our standard experimental gill nets typically underestimate small fish.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages through age 7.  Walleye averaged 14.0 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap-net catch was 1.4 fish/net which is above average for class 22 lakes.  The catch rates have fluctuated from 0.3 to 1.4 fish/net since 1975.  The fish ranged from 4.1 to 13.3 inches and had a mean of 9.6 inches.  Six year-classes were identified from scales.  No dominant year-classes were observed.  Black crappie average 10.1 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has never been abundant in Swan Lake.  The 2009 trap-net catch (12.7/net) was the highest on record, approaching the lake class median of 15.3/net.  Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 inches with a mean length of 4.6 inches.  Three year-classes were identified from scales with fish from age 2 to 4 represented.  Age-2 bluegill represented 77% of the fish aged.  Growth was similar or a little above average compared to other class 22 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 10.4 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 63.0 fish/net in 1984.  The gill-net catch was 24.6 fish/net in 2009, which is between the lake class median and 3rd quartile values.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.2 to 9.5 inches and had a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Size structure had PSD and RSD-P values of 5 and 0, respectively.  At this time, it appears the yellow perch population is more important in the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee is a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 1.8 fish/net and as high as 22.1 fish/net since 1948.  The gill-net catch rate was 1.8 fish/net in 2009.  Although the 2009 catch was the lowest on record for Swan Lake, it remained above the lake class median of 1.6 fish/net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the lake survey included brown bullhead, bowfin, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Additional species sampled during shoreline seining included banded killifish, blackchin shiner, fathead minnow, Johnny darter, and logperch. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively minor yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A walleye CPUE of 4.0/lift is slightly below the median value for lakes of ecological lake class #22 and is the lowest recorded for Swan Lake.  Historically, CPUE values of 8.0/lift and greater were recorded in 1948, 1975, and 1984 indicating higher abundances than presently exists.  Growth rates of walleyes sampled were slightly below averages established for this species.  A PSD value of 44 was calculated for walleyes from summer gill netting data.  Evaluation of our walleye stocking program is difficult as there was only one non-stocked year in the past eight years.  Ninty-three percent of the walleyes sampled were from years where fry stocking had been implemented.  Age III fish (1987 year class) made up seven percent of the catch and was a non-stocked year.  Information from previous surveys suggested fair to good natural reproduction has occurred within the walleye population.Summer gill netting information indicated a northern pike population of above average abundance and size.   A gill net CPUE of 5.9/lift is slightly above the local median (4.9/lift) and is the highest ever recorded for this lake.  Growth rates, for all age classes identified, surpassed averages established for this species.  Northern pike stocking efforts were discontinued in 1977.  A total of 9,026 yearling northern pike were stocked in Swan Lake between 1971 and 1977.  It is unclear to what degree the northern pike stocking program of the 1970's has affected present populations.  However, there has been an upward trend in abundance since 1975.A PSD value of 68 was calculated for northern pike in 1990.  Historically, PSD values of 55 (1984) and 78 (1975) were calculated from summer gill netting information.  Considering the exceptional growth rates and present size structure of the northern pike population, Swan Lake may respond favorably to special regulations.CPUE values for tullibee and white sucker were near the third quartile for lakes of ecological class #22.A yellow perch CPUE of 30.7/lift was well above the third quartile for lakes of this ecological class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a class 22 lake located on the south side of Pengilly, MN.  The lake has one public access and the shoreline is highly developed with almost 500 homes/cabins.  The lake management plan indicates Walleye and Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Black Crappie as secondary species.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit with only one Walleye over 26 inches in possession was implemented.  The 2018 survey was conducted to help evaluate the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nSwan Lake has experienced similar trends in Northern Pike catches that have been observed statewide; that is more and generally smaller since the first survey in 1948.  Lower density populations are desired because they usually result in better growth and larger fish, especially for Northern Pike.  In the last four surveys, the catch has exceeded the management goal of 5.0 fish/net; ranging from 6.8 fish/net in 2005 to 8.3 fish/net in 2018.  In 2018, the sampled fish ranged from 15.6 to 36.0 inches and averaged 22.9 inches.  Seven year-classes were identified with fish from age 2 to 8 represented.  Age-2 through -4 fish represented 77% of the sample.  Northern Pike growth was good compared to statewide averages with fish averaging 24.2 inches after four years.  Swan Lake can provide quality Northern Pike fishing opportunities at times; however, anglers are encouraged to release fish longer than 26 inches in order to maintain the quality that exists. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from as low as 2.0 in 1985 to as high as 11.1 fish/gill net in 1954.  Although the 2018 Walleye catch of 7.1 fish/net did not attain the management goal, it exceeded the average catch for lakes with similar habitat.  The size distribution was quite diverse; with good representation of smaller fish in the sample.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.4 to 28.4 inches and averaged 14.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nAnnual Walleye fry stocking at lower density appears to be providing consistent recruitment and a diverse size distribution.  Sixteen year-classes were identified with fish from 1 to 23 years old.  Age-1 and 2 Walleye represented 27 and 22% of the sample.  These year-classes appeared to be quite large.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages through age 10.  Walleye averaged 15.6 inches after four years of growth.  The apparent large year-classes of young fish should provide some harvest opportunities in the next few years prior to them growing into the protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rates fluctuated from a low of 10.4 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 63.0 fish/net in 1984.  The catch had been fairly stable in the last three surveys ranging from 24.6 to 30.2/net but declined to a new low of 8.9 fish/net in 2018.  However, the catch was not below levels  commonly observed for other lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.7 to 9.8 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  The Yellow Perch population is likely more important to the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 0.9 fish/net and as high as 22.1 fish/net since 1948.  The catch of 3.9 fish/net in 2018 followed the lowest catch on record for Swan Lake in 2013 (0.9/net).  The sampled fish ranged from 7.9 to 18.3 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  Though the fish were not aged, it would appear that at least three age-classes were present based on the size distribution. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a 2,472 acre lake located on the south side of Pengilly, MN.  The lake has two public accesses and the shoreline is highly developed with approximately 500 homes/cabins.  The 1997 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie as secondary species.  The walleye catch rate (7.7 fish/net) in 2000 exceeded the management goal of 6.6 fish/net.  Previous assessments have found catch rates from as low as 2.0 in 1985 to as high as 11.1 fish/net in 1954.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.5 to 26.2 inches and had an average length of 15.0 inches.  Fifteen year classes were identified from scale and otolith analysis with fish from one to 19 years old.  The strong 1997 year class represented 62% of the sample which corresponded to a fry stocking.  Although natural reproduction is contributing to the walleye population, it is impossible to determine to what extent since we do not mark our fry.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Walleye averaged 15.1 inches after four years of growth.In general, northern pike catch rates have increased from being below 3.0 fish/net from 1948 through 1975 to being above 7.9 fish/net in the last two assessments.  In 2000, the northern pike catch was the highest on record at 9.8 fish/net.  The catch exceeded the management goal catch rate of 5.0 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 14.4 to 30.8 inches and averaged 22.8 inches.  Ten year classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 1 to age 10.  Northern pike averaged 22.2 inches after four years of growth compared to the statewide average of 20.5. The black crappie trap-net catch was 1.3 fish/net which was above average for this type of lake.  The catch rates have ranged from 0.4 to 1.3 fish/net since 1975.  The fish ranged from 3.8 to 11.0 inches and had an average length of 7.3 inches.  Five year classes from age 1 to age 5 were sampled with no dominant year classes.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.The bluegill population has never been very abundant with catch rates never attaining the lake class average.  The 2000 trap-net catch rates (2.6/net) were below the normal range for this lake type.  However, the size distribution was good.  Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Yellow perch catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 10.4 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 63.0 fish/net in 1984.  In 2000, the catch was 11.2 fish/net which was within the normal range for this lake type.  The sampled lengths ranged from 5.1 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  At this time, it appears the yellow perch population is more important in the fish community as a prey source than for anglers to target.Tullibee are a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  The catch rate was 8.4 fish/net in this assessment which exceeds the normal range.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 5.0 fish/net and as high as 22.1 fish/net with no apparent trend in abundance.  Other species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, common shiner, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake has historically supported good walleye and northern pike populations and has been managed as a walleye lake.  The walleye catch rate in this assessment is the lowest on record for Swan Lake and is below the expected range for this type of lake.  The walleye that were captured in gill nets had a mean length of 17.3 inches and a mean weight of 2.3 pounds.  Aging indicates that there is significant natural reproduction.     The gill net catch rate for northern pike is the highest on record and is above the expected range.  Northern pike catch rates have been increasing over the past several years.  Northern pike were sampled up to 38.4 inches in length (mean = 22.6 inches) and the mean weight was 3.3 pounds.     Yellow perch abundance appears to be within the expected range.  Perch captured in the gill nets ranged from 5.1 - 10.0 inches in length.     The bluegill trap net catch rate is below the expected range.  The mean length of these bluegill was 6.4 inches.     Black crappie catch rates for both gill and trap nets is within the expected range.  Crappie captured in the trap nets had a mean length of 7.6 inches.     Largemouth bass were not captured in any gill nets but the trap net catch rate was within the expected range.  Largemouth bass captured in the trap nets ranged from 4.9 to 18.4 inches in length.     The tullibee gill net catch rate is above the expected range.  The majority (73%) of the tullibee that were examined were infested by Triaenophorus.     Other species sampled include;  white sucker, silver and shorthead redhorse, black, brown and yellow bullhead, rock bass, bowfin, common shiner and pumpkinseed sunfish.     Lakeshore owners and users have the ability to preserve water quality and maintain a healthy fish population by practicing wise use of the lakeshore and the surrounding watershed.  Anglers can do their part to help maintain the quality fishery by practicing catch and release or selective harvest.</p>",
