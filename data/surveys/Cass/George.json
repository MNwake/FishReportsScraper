                "narrative": "<p>A fairly dramatic winterkill took place during the winter of 2007-2008 and the lake was open to unlimited fishing for most of March in 2008.  This event and frequent partial winterkills had lake residents worried about the fish in the lake.  They have operated an aeration system to help prevent winterkill since January of 2011.  Now that the lake is aerated, residents have requested that fish be stocked to get their lake back to the way it was before 2008.  Electrofishing was done on George Lake during the day on September 4th, 2012 to get a quick glimpse of the fish population before a lake association meeting.  The last netting was done in 1990.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe most common game fish species captured was yellow perch.  Length ranged from 2.2\" to 11.0\", with a mean length of 4.6\".  Bluegills were the second most abundant and all fish were 5\" or shorter.  A fair amount of largemouth bass were also present, with sizes ranging from 3.8\"-9.3\".  Several of the larger bluegill and bass were aged and all were either one or two years old.  Other fish species captured were black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",
