                "narrative": "<p>Crosby Lake is a small (47.9 acres) fertile hard water lake.  The maximum depth is 17 feet and the median depth is 3 feet.  There is no designated public access but entrance can be gained from Crosby Lake Road on the east lake shore.  There are two inlets and an intermittent outlet from this Mississippi River floodplain lake.  Shallow lake bed soils are 99% muck and 1% sand.  Aquatic vegetaion is moderate to dense with cattails as the predominant emergent.  Submerged plant life is varied but consists chiefly of coontail and white water buttercup.  Test netting of the lake revealed very dense black bullhead and pumpkinseed populations.  Numbers of carp, yellow bullhead, bluegill, yellow perch, and northern pike were below respective state-wide net catch medians - dogfish and hybrid sunfish numbers were above state-wide medians.  An average number of golden shiners were netted.  Although no adult bass were caught 3 young-of-the-year bass were captured with a minnow seine.Fishing pressure is moderate and consists mostly of children and youths fishing from shore in the summer.  Winter angling does occur and is said to be more heavy than summer time fishing.  Winter fishing produces mostly northern pike with a few panfish being taken.</p>",

Summertime vegetation becomes thick and may interfere with angling.Bluegill were abundant but not very large, average size was 5.5 inches with the largest fish measuring 7.8 inches. Black crappie were sampled in low numbers and were small, averaging less than six inches. Northern pike were sampled in higher than average numbers and had an average length of nearly 22 inches, with a range from 16 to 32 inches. Yellow perch were sampled in low abundance and were average sized.</p>",

Brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were lower than the local median for these species.  White sucker were taken only in trap nets where they were near the local trap net median.  Northern pike were shown to be of II, III, and IV annulus fish of which the IV annulus fish were most abundant.  The IV annulus fish exhibited good growth.  Yellow perch were dominated by II and III annulus fish which were found in equal numbers.  The II annulus fish showed fast growth and the III annulus fish good growth.  II annulus pumpkinseed were most common and showed good growth.  The most abundant size black bullhead were 6.0 to 6.9 inch fish.  Few larger than 7.5 inches were taken.</p>",

Northern pike were present in low numbers, with the largest fish weighing under four pounds.  Black crappie, pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish were present in very low numbers.  One largemouth bass was captured.  Black and yellow bullheads were present in low numbers.  Carp numbers were low.  Golden shiner numbers were high.  One bowfin was captured.  Freshwater drum were captured for the first time, probably introduced to the lake by the Missisisippi River flood of 1993.</p>",

The catches of all were near or less than their respective local median catch rates.</p>",

Shore fishing is available at many locations and carry-in access is also available (electric motor only).  Vegetation becomes dense in the summer and may interfere with angling. Bluegill are abundant but small, with an average size of 4.5 inches.  Black crappie were found in low to moderate numbers with most fish betwen 4 and 6 inches, but some up to 9 inches.  Northern pike are present in moderate numbers with lengths ranging from 19 to 29 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers with lengths ranging from 12 to 17 inches.  Small yellow perch were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",
