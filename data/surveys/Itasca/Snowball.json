The netting done in this assessment indicates that the northern pike gill net catch was the highest ever recorded at 12.5.  This compares to the median of 6.7 for this lake class.     Walleye were also sampled at the highest gill net catch ever recorded at 2.8.  This was also above the lake class median of 2.5.  All walleye sampled were aged from years when fingerling stocking occurred.  No walleye were sampled from the three years in which no stocking occurred.     Yellow perch, however, have been sampled at the lowest rate ever seen on Snowball Lake.  The gill net catch dropped from 24.8 in 1989 to 0.7 in this assessment.  Yellow perch are the primary forage for both of the dominant predators in the lake, walleye and northern pike.  The high gill net abundance observed for both of these predator species may be responsible for the decrease observed in yellow perch abundance.     Bluegill are not abundant and are generally small in size. The mean length of those sampled in the trap nets was 5.8 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in good numbers but they to were small.  The mean length of black crappies in this assessment was only 4.6 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nSnowball Lake is a 146-acre lake located one mile east of Calumet, MN.  Approximately 30% of the surface area is littoral (<15 feet) and the maximum depth is 38 feet.  The lake is moderately fertile.  The shoreline is lightly developed and Essar Steel has recently bought much of the north and east shorelines as part of their expanded mining operation.  The lake has an outlet, which drains to the Swan River just west of Swan Lake.  Fishing pressure is considered moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and black crappie were the primary management species.  Goals of the LMP were to increase walleye gill net catch rates to 2.5 per net and maintain black crappie trap net catch rates above 3.4 per net.   A population assessment was conducted in 2013 to evaluate the success of walleye stocking and to determine the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nResults <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats rarely produce large walleye catches, and Snowball Lake has a history of low walleye catches.  Only five walleye were sampled in 2013.  The catch was lower than when compared to lakes with similar habitats and did not meet the management plan goal.  Walleye were recently stocked at one pound/littoral acre (43 pounds) in 2009 and 2004, but the success of stocking is not clear.  It is unlikely that Snowball Lake can produce a quality walleye fishery, given the characteristics of the lake, current fish community, and poor prey base. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches have increased with time.  The 2013 catch rate was higher than expected when compared to similar lakes, and the second highest ever sampled for Snowball Lake.  Increased pike abundance is not desirable in Snowball Lake.  Northern pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when northern pike occur at high densities.  Size structure was poor as most of the sampled fish were between 16 to 18 inches in length.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 26.4 inches by age 6.  Anglers can help improve the size structure by releasing pike exceeding 24 inches. <br> \nSnowball Lake generally produces low yellow perch catches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rate in 2013 was lower than expected compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch are an important prey species and catch rates will likely remain low as long as northern pike catch rates remain high. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates in past assessments have generally been low to moderate.  Bluegill trap net catch in 2013 was typical for lakes with similar habitats.    Size structure was poor as only two sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Similar lakes typically produce slow growing bluegill.  Bluegill from Snowball averaged 7.3 inches at age 6.  No fish older than age 7 were sampled.  Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Catch rates from Snowball Lake have been highly variable.  Black crappie catch rates were lower than expected in 2013, as only four fish were sampled between both gears.  All four crappie sampled in the 2013 assessment were from the same 2009 year class, indicating inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were also sampled in this survey.  Since largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear during summer months, catch rates may not represent an accurate reflection of largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass are likely an important component of the fishery. <br> \nSeveral other fish species were sampled in relatively low abundance and included brown and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and bowfin. <br> \n <br> \nSnowball Lake does not appear to currently contain invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snowball Lake is a 146-acre lake located about 1 mile east of Calumet, MN.  Approximately 30% of the surface area is littoral (<15 feet) and the maximum depth is 38 feet.  The lake's physical characteristics are most similar to those for lakes associated with lake class 31 (average=256 acres, 42% littoral, maximum depth=37, alkalinity= 148 ppm, and Secchi=8.5ft).  Temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements at various depths in late August revealed that the water temperatures ranged from 75.2? F at the surface to 45.0? F at the bottom. The lake was temperature stratified with a warm water layer extending down to 15 feet.  The thermocline layer, where water temperatures cool rapidly, began at 16 feet and continued down to about 23 feet where water temperatures had cooled to less than 50?F.  Water temperatures continued to get colder at greater depths to the maximum depth of 37 feet where the coldest water was 45?F.  Dissolved oxygen levels, which were suitable for fish at the surface, dropped rapidly in a narrow band between 14 and 16 feet, which is at the bottom of the warm water layer.  Dissolved oxygen levels became unsuitable for fish (?2.0ppm) below 16 feet or at the top of the thermocline.Northern pike were the most frequent game fish in the gill net with a catch rate of 16.8 fish/net.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 5.0 - 12.5 fish/net.  The northern pike catch rate also exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 20.0 inches, however, individual fish up to 29 inches were sampled and 10% of the sample exceeded 24 inches.                 Walleye were sampled at a relatively low catch rate of 1.8 fish/gill net, which was slightly lower than the catch rate of the two previous assessments (2.8 fish/net for 1995 and 2.5 fish/net for 1989).  Length ranged from 15.4 to 24.0 inches with a mean length of 20.1 inches.  Growth was excellent and exceeded the statewide means by more than 15%.  The age distribution of the catch indicated that fish from the two age classes, 5 and 9, and may have originated from two recent stockings (1994 and 1998).  Black crappie were not common in gill nets or trap nets, resulting in catch rates of 1.8 fish/gill net and 1.2 fish/trap net.  Although the gill and trap net catch rates appeared low they were within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.3 to 7.3 fish/gill net and 0.8 to 5.8 fish/trap net.  Size structure was dominated by small crappies from 4.5 to 6.5 inches and the ages of fish from the gill net sample indicated that these fish were probably all age-1 fish. Only 4 larger black crappies (11.5-12.9 inches) were captured (in gill nets) and were age-8 and 9.  Growth rates exceeded the statewide averages for all ages and black crappies attain 9 inches in length within 4 years, compared to almost 5 years in other lakes statewide. Yellow perch were rarely caught as only 10 small (? 8 inches) individuals were sampled for a catch rate of 1.7 fish/gill net.  This catch rate was below the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow perch are an important prey base for northern pike and walleye.  Low abundance of yellow perch can affect abundance, growth and size structure of predator species.      Bluegill were quite frequent in trap nets with a catch rate of 16.0 fish/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The size structure of bluegills in the catch consisted of small fish less than 7.5 inches with 32% of the catch exceeding 6 inches.   Largemouth bass were also sampled in this survey with catch rates of 1.0 fish/gill net and 0.3 fish/trap net.  Since largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear during summer months, these catch rates may not represent an accurate reflection of the largemouth bass population.  Although these catch rates may appear to be low, they were within the expected range for similar lakes.  Several other fish species were sampled in relatively low abundance and included pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, brown, black, and yellow bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), and white sucker.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snowball Lake is a 146-acre lake located one mile east of Calumet, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Approximately 30% of the lake is littoral (<15 feet) and the maximum depth is 38 feet.  The lake is moderately fertile.  The shoreline is lightly developed and much of the north and east shoreline is owned by a mining company.  The lake has an outlet which drains to the Swan River just west of Swan Lake.  Fishing pressure is considered moderate. <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last amended in 2017.  Black Crappie and Northern Pike were the primary management species and Largemouth Bass and Walleye were considered secondary species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in late August 2023 to collect updated information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for Northern Pike was typical for the lake and the lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was relatively poor and similar to previous surveys.  Sampled pike ranged from 14 to 34 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average and past surveys, with pike exceeding 21 inches after four years of growth.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger Northern Pike to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for Black Crappie tend to be variable because of their habit of suspending in the water column in off-shore areas.  The trap-net catch for Black Crappie was average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  The gill nets provided a larger sample.  The catch rate (5.3/net) was above the expected range for this lake class.  Size structure was modest for both gears.  Fish from trap nets averaged 7.6 inches and those from gill nets averaged 8.5 inches.  Four year-classes were identified from scales with ages 2 through 5 represented.  Age 5 was the most frequently sampled.  Growth was slow but similar to the statewide average with crappie approaching 9 inches after five years of growth.  Angling opportunities for crappie should improve in the next couple of years as these fish grow to a more preferred size. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was low compared to similar lakes, but typical for Snowball Lake.  Walleye catches have only met or exceeded 2/net twice in eight surveys.  The six Walleye captured were keeper-sized fish ranging from 18 to 24 inches.  Meaningful evaluations of age structure and growth cannot be drawn from such a small sample size.  Of the four Walleye examined, two were attributed to stocked year-classes.  Past fingerling stocking did not appear to contribute much to the population and was discontinued.  Lakes like Snowball rarely produce quality Walleye fisheries due to habitat, fish community and prey base limitations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has typically had low to moderate numbers and poor size structure.  The 2023 trap-net catch was low compared to similar lakes but typical for Snowball.  Size structure remained poor; sampled Bluegill ranged from 3 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 4.8 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in this assessment but previous surveys indicated average growth. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers with fish ranging from 10 to 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test-nets included Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Snowball Lake was conducted beginning on July 10th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Snowball Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Snowball Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Snowball Lake on July 13th, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 88.8 (?2.3) out of 100 possible. A score of 88.8 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is High (85-92). Approximately 30 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 81.1 (?5.7) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderately High (80-85), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.1 (?2.0) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",
