                "narrative": "<p>Grace Lake is bowl shaped with regular shorelines and sandy beaches around most of its perimeter.  Bulrush stands are abundant on the south side of the lake and care is taken to preserve them for fish habitat.  Because of the favorable water clarity the lake supports a diverse community of submerged vegetation.  Development is perhaps more apparent on Grace Lake than on any other small lake in the Bemidji area.  Recreational use of Grace Lake is considered to be high by Bemidji standards.Grace Lake has historically supported a high yellow perch population and several different attempts have been made to reduce their numbers.  More recently the abundant perch population has been utilized to maintain high predator densities.  Since 1984, walleye have been stocked annually at a higher than normal rate.  Since that time, approximately 263,000 walleye weighing 7,552 pounds have been stocked.  Perch have remained abundant, but the catch rate did decline in the most recent assessment.  If this reduced catch rate represents an actual decline, predation from walleye may be a factor in that decline.  Walleye are abundant and appear well fed, but the high level of activity from a variety of water sports on the lake can make angling difficult.  Persistent anglers, not resistant to trying alternative tactics, such as avoiding peak activity times, may be able to establish successful presentations.   Successful natural reproduction in recent years has led to a northern pike catch rate higher than at any time in the sampling history.  Continued successful natural reproduction has led to a wide variety of sizes represented in the lake.  If predation has played a roll in reducing the yellow perch catch rate, the increased northern pike abundance may have been a bigger factor than the walleye stocking program.The sunfish community is represented by pumpkinseeds, bluegill, rock bass, and an occasional hybrid sunfish.  Pumpkinseeds and rock bass were present at the time of the first fisheries assessment on Grace Lake in 1950, and are even a larger component of the fish community now than they were then.  Bluegill were first documented in 1989 with a single fish, but are now quite common.  Hybrid sunfish, a cross between bluegill and pumpkinseed, were first documented in the 2000 assessment.  Most sunfish in Grace Lake are too small to be acceptable to anglers. Black crappie were sampled, but their abundance is probably well below levels found by anglers during the early 1980's.  The population at this time appears to be composed of three adult year classes with few smaller fish coming behind them for replacement.Largemouth bass are common and a variety of sizes are present in the population.  A single smallmouth bass was captured in 2000.  This is the first documented catch of this species, and it is the result of unauthorized stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grace Lake is an 860-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet located 10 miles southeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a DNR-owned public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for 15 vehicles/trailers located on west shore of the lake off of County Road 4.  The lakeshore is heavily developed with homes and cabins.  Grace Lake is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish population present in the lake.  Grace Lake is in lake class 27.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Grace Lake and other class 27 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Big Turtle, Andrusia, and Blackduck Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nGrace Lake is one of the more popular Walleye lakes in the Bemidji area.  The lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on an annual basis.  The 2015 Walleye catch rate of 12.33/gill net is well above the normal range found in similar lakes (3.25/gill net to 8.81/gill net).  The average size of Walleye captured was 18.34 inches in length and 2.21 lbs/fish, with Walleye up to 27.17 inches in length captured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 9.25/gill net was just above the range found in similar lakes (2.76/gill net to 9.00/gill net).  Northern pike captured averaged 22.02 inches in length and 2.33 lbs/fish, which was within the normal range found in similar lakes (1.57 lbs/fish to 2.75 lbs/fish).  Northern pike up to 29.21 inches in length were captured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2015 survey.  The electrofishing catch rate of 64.19 bass/hour is a fairly high catch rate for the Bemidji area, indicating an abundant bass population.  The average size of bass captured was 14.45 inches, with bass up to 18.50 inches in length captured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nWhile Bluegill have gained the attention of anglers on Grace Lake in the past, the 2015 survey showed that Bluegill numbers and size had declined since the previous survey in 2010.  The trap net catch rate (4.08/TN) and the average size (0.10 lbs/fish) were both below the normal range found in similar lakes.  The decline in Bluegill abundance since 2010 is likely related to high levels of angler harvest and size selectivity (keeping the largest Bluegill caught).  Bluegill anglers may want to give Grace Lake a pass for the time being and focus their efforts on one of the many quality panfish lakes in the Bemidji area.  Black Crappie are also present in Grace Lake, but have been captured in very low numbers in this and previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate (76.17/gill net) was well above the normal range found in similar lakes (7.00/gill net to 46.33/GN).  Consistently high perch abundance is likely the reason this lake can sustain relatively high densities of three major predator species; Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. The average size of perch captured in the 2015 survey was 7.27 inches in length, with a small proportion of the catch exceeding 9 inches in length. Yellow Perch up to 10.55 inches in length were captured in the 2015 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Grace Lake was conducted on July 11th, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample twelve stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted during the week of July 11th, 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by both number (77%) and biomass (60%). Compared to similar Lake Class 27 lakes, the numbers and of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Largemouth Bass sampled per net were near or above the 75% quartile.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI score from this survey was higher than previous surveys completed during the previous lake assessment. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grace Lake is an 887-acre lake located 8 miles southeast of Bemidji on the Beltrami-Hubbard County line.  The maximum depth is 42 feet.  There is a concrete boat ramp with parking for about 10 trucks/trailers located on the north shore of the lake.  Grace Lake is in lake class 27 along with Big Turtle, Clearwater, Kitchi and Andrusia lakes in the Bemidji area.   Grace Lake is heavily developed; lake homes encircle most of the shoreline with the exception of a few areas such as the public access and a small parcel of state land.  Most emergent aquatic vegetation (bulrush) has been gradually removed over the years.  Grace is a popular fishing lake, and provides consistent fishing for most of the gamefish species found in the Bemidji area.  Walleye are the primary management species, with northern pike and yellow perch managed as secondary species.  In general, growth rates for most species of gamefish in Grace Lake are above average for this lake class. <br> \nRecently, the walleye fishery of Grace Lake has been getting a lot of attention from local anglers.  Grace Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings on an annual basis.  The 2010 population assessment showed a very diverse walleye population, with 16 age classes of fish present.  Walleye over 28.0 inches in length were captured, with a large proportion of the catch (42%) over 20 inches in length.  The average size was 2.5 pounds (18.3 inches in length).  Walleye from ages 1 to 3 were also well represented in the catch, indicating that recent stockings have been successful, and that this population should continue to provide quality fishing as these fish mature.   <br> \nBluegill fishing on Grace Lake has also been noteworthy during the past few seasons.  Trap net catch rates for bluegill were well above the median for this lake class, and average fish weight nearly doubled since the 2005 assessment, despite the presence of a large number of small fish (3.0 inches in length) in the catch.  Bluegill up to 8.5 inches were present in the sample.  A large proportion of the catch was between 6.5 and 8.0 inches in length, which is a good sign for the population in the near future.   <br> \nBlack crappie up to 13.1 inches in length were captured in the assessment.  The trap net catch rate for black crappie was near the median for this lake class.  Five age classes of fish were present in the sample, indicating fairly consistent reproduction for this species.  Black crappie reproduction can be inconsistent in northern Minnesota lakes, and they are highly sought after by anglers.  Very few quality size black crappie tend to get caught and then released.   <br> \nThe quality of the northern pike population in Grace Lake has improved since the 2005 assessment.  Like many other lakes in the state, the pike population of Grace Lake has been dominated by high numbers of smaller fish, which can be a nuisance to anglers and pose fisheries management problems as well.  While catch rates did increase from 13/GN in 2005 to 16.5/GN in 2010, average size also increased substantially from 19.7 inches (2005) to 22.9 inches in length; 31% of the catch in 2010 was greater than 24.0 inches in length.  The largest northern pike captured in the 2010 assessment was 37.4 inches long.   <br> \nAn electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass was conducted for the first time on Grace Lake as part of the 2010 assessment.  The catch rate of 60.5 bass/hr is indicative of robust bass population.  Largemouth bass up to 18.5 inches in length were captured, and the average size was 13.0 inches in length.  While not the main attraction for anglers visiting Grace Lake, the largemouth bass population can provide consistent fishing with a good average size, and few anglers pursuing them.  Bass are often willing to bite when other species of fish like walleye shut down due to changes in weather conditions.   <br> \n</p>",

There is a DNR-owned public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for 15 vehicles/trailers located on the west shore of the lake off of County Road 4.  Much of the lakeshore is privately owned and developed with cabins and lake homes.  Grace Lake is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nGrace Lake is a popular destination for anglers in the Bemidji/Cass Lake areas.  The lake has provided consistent Walleye fishing in recent years and has been a popular lake in local fishing leagues.  Walleye were captured in good numbers in the 2020 survey with catch rates above the range found in similar lakes in the State.  Walleye up to 25 inches were captured in the survey with a good average size of nearly 18 inches in length and 2 lbs/fish.  The population has good numbers of \"eater size\" Walleye from 14 to 16 inches as well as larger fish over 20 inches in length that are often caught and released.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey showed a good population of Northern Pike in Grace Lake.  Pike up to 33 inches were captured in the survey with an average size just under 24 inches in length.  A good portion of the pike catch was within the north-central pike zone 22 to 26-inch protected slot size range.  These fish should grow rapidly out of the protected slot and provide good angling opportunities for larger pike over the next few years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured in record numbers in 2020.  The Bluegill catch was dominated by high numbers of small fish which drove down the average size.  There were also decent numbers of medium-sized fish from 6 to 8 inches that are growing rapidly and should provide good fishing opportunities in the near term. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie typically are not captured effectively in standard surveys of Grace Lake.  However, a large number of fish were captured in gill nets that greatly exceeded the range found in similar lakes.  Similar to Bluegill, the Black Crappie catch was dominated by high numbers of smaller fish from 4 to 9 inches in length indicating excellent reproduction from recent years.  Anglers should notice these abundant year classes of fish as they grow to acceptable sizes over the next two years.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2020 survey were Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grace lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes of this class are typically very large, deep, hard water lakes.  There are about 103 lakes of this class distributed throughout Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes in this class include: Big, Andrusia, Clearwater, Big Wolf, Big Turtle, Kitchi, and Blackduck.  Grace lake walleye are very abundant, at more than double the average for comparable lakes. The abundance is the result of a high density walleye stocking program, a management tool with a goal of reducing the huge yellow perch population.  The perch population has not declined to the desired goal, though the average yellow perch size has increased.  Average walleye weight has decreased to about 1.3 pounds, and about 15 inches in length due to the higher abundance of young fish from recent fingerling stockings.  The largest walleye sampled was about 26 inches in length. Northern pike abundance is comparable with other class 27 lakes.  The average weight of northern pike has decreased by about one third, but at 2.2 pounds is still near lake class average, as is the mean length of 21 inches. Largemouth bass were not sampled during this assessment, and there is some concern that the population may be declining.  A reason for the possible decline is debatable, but the loss of habitat plus high predation by other fish species is probable.  Future assessments, that may include electrofishing could give a better understanding of the population. Bluegill were represented by a single fish during each of the past two assessments but were not sampled during prior surveys.  A few bluegill were probably introduced by anglers in the past few years.  Pumpkinseed are still abundant and the size has increased to about 0.4 pounds, and about 7.5 inches.  Rock bass are also common and are very similar in size to the pumpkinseed at 7.4 inches and 0.4 pounds. Yellow perch abundance has increased slightly from the previous assessment, and the size has increased to about 0.2 pound, and 7.5 inches.  There has been some winter perch fishing during the past two winters, probably a result of the increased size of perch available.  A few perch are about 10 inches in length.  Most of the perch examined had the parasites Neascus (black spot) or yellow grub.  Black crappie, once abundant are now rare.  The cyclic nature of this fish, the high yellow perch and pumpkinseed populations and a negative interaction with walleyes may prevent the crappie population from returning to the desired abundance.  Muskellunge were stocked in 1984 as a research project to evaluate three muskellunge strains.  Angler reports confirm that there are a few muskellunge remaining in the lake but they are not abundant, and further stocking is not scheduled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grace Lake is an 860-acre lake, located in Hubbard County and 10 miles southeast of Bemidji, MN.  A targeted survey was completed on Grace Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during August of 2020 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible.  All the sites were sampled with a seine and backpack electrofishing.  A total of 15 species of fish were sampled, which included four species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2020 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Grace Lake.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nAccording to the survey, Grace Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",
