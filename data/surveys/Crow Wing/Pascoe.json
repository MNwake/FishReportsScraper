Black, yellow and brown bullheads and black crappie indicated an average population since catch rates fell between the first and third quartile. An initial survey was done on Pascoe Lake in June of 1986. Two gillnets and four trapnets were set. Northern pike aged showed age classes 1 through 6 with the year 3 class making up 56% of the total. All ages of fish grew at above average rates compared to statewide averages. Length-frequency varied from 10 inches to 32.9 inches with a fairly even distribution in length groups. Bluegills aged showed age classes 2 through 5 with the year 3 age class making up 52% of the total. Growth rates appeared to be a little above statewide average. Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 9.5 inches, with 56 of 92 fish measured from 6.5 to 7.4 inches. Black crappies aged showed only the year age class 3 present. Above average growth rates were indicated. Individual lengths ranged from 7 to 10.9 inches with 8 of 11 between 8.5 and 9.4 inches. Bowfin weighed an average of just over 4 lbs each. Yellow, brown and black bullheads ranged in length from 8 to 12.9 inches and an average weight of 1.0, 0.75 and 0.50 lbs each respectively. Pumpkinseeds varied from 5.0 to 8.4 inches and averaged above 4/lb. One 8 lbs walleye was taken in the nets, but is not sufficient enough sample to draw any conclusions other than there is no substantial population.</p>",
