A bog and sweetgale fringe over a muck substrate rings the shoreline.  Aquatic plants are sparse.Largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch were present prior to reclamation with rotenone in 1969.  Rainbow trout stocking began in 1964 and continues to the present time.  Ten lake surveys and fish population assessments dating back to 1964 each consisted of 1-2 gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been used due to the difficult portage access.Rainbow trout numbers in 2000 (2.0/gillnet) were lower than the median catch of 6.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  These trout ranged in size from 8.8-10.9\" and all were likely from the fall, 1999 stocking of 13/lb Arlee strain fingerlings.  Trout stomachs contained midges and sticklebacks.By weight, the rainbow catch of 0.7 lb/gillnet in 2000 was lower than the median catch of 3.0 lb/gillnet in all investigations on this lake and was lower than the median catch of 5.4 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Ely area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Elbow Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 9, which consists of 48 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Elbow Lake is thermally stratified in midsummer with surface temperatures about 70 F and bottom temperatures in the low 40's F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) is retained to about 13 ft, where the temperature is in the mid 50's F.  Little Elbow Lake has no inlets or outlets.  A bog and sweetgale fringe over a muck and silt substrate rings the shoreline.  Aquatic plants are sparse.Largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch were present prior to their removal with rotenone in 1969.  Rainbow trout fingerlings were stocked in 1964 and 1965.  Annual rainbow trout stocking began in 1971 and continues to the present time.  About 500 rainbow trout fingerlings (5\" long) were stocked each fall from 1992 through 2002.  About 250 rainbow trout yearlings (9\" long) were stocked annually each spring from 2003 through 2005.  The change from fingerling stocking to yearling stocking was done in an effort to provide larger fish for anglers and because high catches of rainbow trout were made in the 1977 and 1979 assessments after rainbow yearlings were stocked in addition to fingerlings prior to these assessments.  Nine trout population assessments have been conducted on Little Elbow Lake since the 1969 rotenone treatment.Rainbow trout numbers in 2005 (1.5/gillnet) were lower than the median catch of 4.0/gillnet in all six trout assessments following rainbow trout fingerling-only stockings on this lake.  Rainbow trout weight in 2005 (1.9 lb/gillnet) was lower than the median catch of 2.7 lb/gillnet in these same six trout assessments on this lake.  It should be noted that the 2005 trout assessment occurred in early May, prior to the May 19 rainbow trout yearling stocking, and almost a year after the yearling stocking the previous May.  The rainbow trout captured in 2005 had survived the previous summer's angling season.  Previous trout assessments on this lake, also done in late May or early June, were done seven months after the previous October rainbow trout fingerling stockings, and prior to the trout being exposed to the summer angling season.The average size of rainbow captured in 2005 (14.4\") was larger than the average size of 11.0\" in all six trout assessments on this lake following rainbow fingerling-only stockings.  The largest rainbow captured in 2005 (15.7\") was larger than all but one of the rainbow trout captured in all eight previous trout assessments on this lake.  Trout stomachs examined in 2005 contained amphipods and minnows.</p>",
