                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nThis is the first population assessment done on Schwarzrock's Pit.  Fish management in recent years has consisted of a spring stocking of large black bullheads or bluegill/crappie.  Stocking amounts have varied between 1,000-2,000 pounds annually.  Bluegill were most abundant, averaging 39.00/trap net, and are dominated by one year olds.  Most of the bluegills sampled were small, with only one fish >5.4 inches.  Growth is poor for bluegill, with four year olds averaging 4.8 inches.  White crappie average 3.00/trap net and ranged in size from 5.5 to 7.4 inches.  Two large channel catfish were netted.  They probably were stocked by river anglers.  Orangespotted sunfish, another river species, was also probably introduced by river anglers and averaged 15.50/trap net.  Other species present in low numbers include pumpkinseed, yellow perch, and black bullhead.</p>",
