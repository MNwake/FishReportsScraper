                "narrative": "<p>The number of walleyes taken in gillnets during the current survey (2.45/set) indicates a real increase from the 1985 survey (0.45/set) but remains below the local median (3.52/set).  The present population consists of predominantly small fish (median length group 8.0-8.4 inches) with 24 of the 29 walleyes taken in test nets being under 10 inches in length.  Two larger walleyes were aged at 8+ years old while the remainder were between 1 and 4 years old, the majority of these, 78% were aged at two years old.  The abundance of two year old fish corresponds to a 1987 stocking of carry-over fingerlings.  Extensive stocking of walleye fry, a product of spawn taking operations from 1977 through 1985, and fingerlings since a major decline in the walleye population was observed in the 1979 survey, has produced only sporadic success and failed to maintain a satisfactory population.  An influx of carp over the Knife Lake dam in 1978 and their subsequent proliferation to very high numbers, is suspected of contributing to a general decline in gamefish populations and possibly inhibiting reestablishment of a satisfactory walleye population.  Northern pike (0.09/set) show a real decline from the 1985 survey (1.27/set) to a point far below the local median (3.88/set).  Past northern pike fingerling stocking has been successful in producing good adult populations for short periods.  These populations, however, do not sustain themselves without regular fingerling stocking in large numbers.  The current gillnet catch rate for yellow perch (4.91/set) indicates a real increase in the perch population from the 1985 survey (0.09/set).  This is still substantially below the local median (24.27/set), however.  In an effort to increase yellow perch abundance following the extremely low numbers recorded in 1985, adult yellow perch were stocked in that same year.  This effort appears to have met with some success.  Only one largemouth bass was taken in test nets but young of the year were present in shoreline seine hauls.  Bluegills (3.30/set) have increased somewhat from 1985 (1.80/set) but remain far below the local median (25.67/set).  Bluegills tend to be small with a median length group of 6.0-6.4 inches.  Black crappies have declined substantially and white crappies markedly from the 1985 survey, from 14.00/set and 79.80/set, to 7.60/set and 11.30/ set, respectively.  Carp continue to exhibit extremely high gillnet catches (31.73/set), as they have since 1979 when they were first present in high numbers.  Black bullheads, yellow bullheads and brown bullheads continue to be present in insignificant numbers, far below local medians, as they have been in the past.  Other species taken in test nets, golden shiner, white sucker, silver redhorse, channel catfish, and freshwater drum, do not appear to have undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey nor are they substantially above or below the local medians.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed in October 1989 to remove the undesirable roughfish species, mainly carp, which had made up over 95% of the total fish population in the lake.  Precise stocking plans have been implemented to date to establish the native gamefish population.  Sufficient natural reproduction has already responded well for all species.  The walleye population will be supplemented with fingerling stocking through 1995, or until the population has reached a self-sustaining status.  The current fish population shows a remarkable size to age ratio for most of the species.  When starting from scratch, as in 1990, fish growth usually explodes for the first few years.  In time, the growth rates of the fish will decrease some to that which is normal for Knife Lake.  No carp have been observed.     On September 5, 1995, a lake survey was conducted on Knife Lake (lake class 41).  Standard netting methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Knife Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.     Walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 23.1 inches with an average size of 15.0 inches.  The average weight was 1.5 pounds.  Ages 1-6 were represented with ages 1-4 making up 93% of the walleye population.  Age 1 walleyes, alone, made up 36% of the total walleye catch and most of these fish were from natural reproduction within Knife during the 1994 spawn.  The initial stocking of walleyes on April 11, 1990, (1 year old fish then) were the fish that were over 18 inches and have become the first group to spawn during the springs of 1994 and 1995.  Subsequent natural reproduction will now occur each year in the lake and river by their offspring.Northern pike abundance was normal with 3 age groups (ages 1-3) present in the population.  First stocked in 1992, these fish and the following age groups have had growth rates faster than normal.  Lengths ranged from 17.7 to 31.1 inches with an average length of 24.0 inches.  The average weight of all northern pike sampled was 3.3 pounds.     Largemouth bass were sampled at normal abundance levels for this type of lake.  They had been at high levels since 1991 following a massive spawn by the initial 214 brood-stock adults stocked in May 1990.  With each following year, bass became less abundant due to angler harvest and natural competition with the other predator species; walleye, northern pike, and catfish.  The 1995 catch sampled bass ranging from 3.9 to 17.3 inches.  Bass will reach sexual maturity around age 4 or 5.  At that time, there should be a slight increase to the bass population or at least their numbers will remain at normal levels.     Blueg ll abundance has climbed to above normal levels since their initial stockings during the spring and summer of 1990.  The intent was to stock 63,000 \"male\" adult bluegills to provide an instant fishery.  This was done to avoid an early explosion of bluegills which would upset the restocking plan.  The task proved to be insurmountable, but 9,300 adults did make there way into the lake with an unexpected small amount of adult \"female\" bluegills.  The result was some natural reproduction a year or two ahead of schedule.  This turned out to be favorable since the newly hatched bluegills did not over-populate the walleye/bass stocking plan.   This survey sampled bluegills from 1.4 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 4.2 inches.  The majority of the sample were age 1 fish which were products from the offspring of the original brood-stock adults.  There were no bluegills sampled that would be from the original 9,300.   Black crappie abundance was normal with sizes ranging from 3.2 to 10.9 inches.  The average length was around 6.0 inches with 3 age groups present, ages 1-3.     Yellow perch abundance was the highest record for Knife Lake.  Their sizes ranged from 5.2 to 11.6 inches.  The average length was 7.5 inches and the average weight was a 1/4 pound.  The growth response for perch in this lake has been tremendous, however, their sizes will most likely slow in growth as time goes on.     The remainder of the fish population consisted of black bullhead, common shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.  Their abundance levels were below normal for this type of lake, except for rock bass and white sucker, they were at normal levels.     Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Comprised of 1,266 acres, Knife lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and generally, low summer water clarity.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot limit was implemented for walleye as a special regulation in the fall of 2001.Long range management goals for Knife lake include maintaining the walleye gillnet catch at 10 per lift with a 1.5 pound average and the northern pike catch at 5 per lift with a 2.5 pound average.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Knife lake is assigned to lake class 41.  In order to compare the present fish communities to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Knife lake was netted in September of 2001.The walleye gillnet catch (3.8/set) was within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class but fell well short of the long range management goal.  Walleye averaged two pounds, exceeding the management goal and the lake class norm.  Sampled walleye ranged from 6.1 to 25.5 inches with a 16.8 inch mean.  The 2001 catch rate was the lowest since the 1989 lake reclaimation.  However, average size has never been higher.  Otolith ageing data displayed a healthy distribution of walleye among the 1991 through the 1999 year classes.  While walleye growth was normal compared to the statewide average, growth of the more recent year classes appeared to be slowing.The northern pike gillnet sample was below the management goal for both numbers and size, but with a 3.5 per set catch rate and an average weight of 2.2 pounds it was still considered normal for the lake class.  Sampled northerns ranged from 19.1 to 29.3 inches with a 22.5 inch average.  The average size of northerns in 1999 was comparable but the catch rate was more than double that of 2001.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes represented 65% of the catch.  These four and five year olds ranged from 19.4 to 26.8 inches and should provide quality angling for several years.  Growth was similar to the statewide norm.   The black crappie gillnet catch (10.4/set) was normal compared to other catches in the lake class while their average weight of 0.4 pounds was considered high.  Crappie ranged in length from 3.8 to 12.4 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  The 1999 catch was much higher but the average weight was only 0.07 pounds.  Yellow perch, while still in the normal range for catch rate (4.6/gillnet), decreased noticably since the 1999 catch of 10.5 per set.  The average weight, 0.11 pounds, fell in the low range for the lake class for the first time since the 1989 lake reclamation.  Sampled perch ranged from 4.0 to 11.6 inches.The bluegill trapnetting was normal, compared to others in the lake class, in both catch rate (2.8/set) and average size (0.3 pounds).  Sampled bluegill ranged from 1.8 to 8.1 inches with a 6.4 inch mean.The 1995 catch rate was much higher but the average weight was only 0.08 pounds.Shoreline seining indicated that reproduction was successful in 2001 for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Fall electrofishing indicated walleye reproduction was very successful.  Other species sampled during the survey included Johnny darter, golden shiner, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.       Although gamefish were apparently not as plentiful as in years past, Knife lake should provide quality angling for walleye , northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill in good abundance.  Fishing pressure can be very high at times particularly during the walleye opener.</p>",

The fry are classified as LMS (Lower Mississippi River Strain).  Due to this removal, 315,000 fry (250 per littoral acre) were stocked back into the lake on May 16, 2023.  Knife Lake was electrofished on the night of October 10, 2023, to evaluate the relative abundance of young of the year Walleye.  The catch rate of 626 age-0 Walleye per hour was the highest observed out of the 21 years the lake has been electrofished and compares to the average of 84/hour. The age-0 Walleye ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 inches in length with a 6.7-inch average. Age-1 Walleye were sampled at a rate of 53 per hour.  Age-1 Walleye ranged in length from 9.3 to 11.9 inches and had a 10.8-inch average.  Due to the high likelihood that natural reproduction contributed to the catch rate, the contribution of stocked Walleyes to the 2023 Walleye year class is unknown.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Comprised of 1,266 acres, Knife Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of 9.1 feet.  Shoreline length is 18.24 miles and maximum lake fetch is 2.4 miles.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot limit was implemented for walleye as a special regulation in the fall of 2001.  A 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation for northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003. <br> \n <br> \nLong-range management goals for Knife Lake include maintaining the walleye gillnet catch at 10 per lift with a 1.5 pound average and the northern pike catch at 5 per lift with a 2.5 pound average.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Knife Lake is assigned to lake class 41.  In order to compare the present fish communities to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Knife Lake was re-surveyed from September 11-15, 2006.  Gear sampling types for fish capture included, standard gill nets, standard trap nets, seines, and night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch (5.6/set) was within the normal range compared to other catches in the lake class but fell well short of the long range management goal.  Walleye averaged 2.1 pounds, and exceeded the management goal and the lake class norm.  Sampled walleye ranged from 8.9 to 27.1 inches with a 17.3 inch mean.  Walleye size structure and abundance has increased from the 2001 survey.  Walleye catch rates have improved from (3.8/set) in 2001 to (5.6/set) in 2006.  Average length of walleyes is up from 16.8 inches in 2001 to 17.3 inches in 2006.   Growth and ageing data analysis from otolith bones displayed 11 year classes from 1996 through 2006. These year classes show a healthy distribution of walleyes of all sizes in Knife Lake.  While walleye growth was normal compared to the statewide average.  The 2006 and past surveys have shown the walleye population in Knife Lake to be healthy.  Although there is some variance in year class strength from year to year the overall status of the walleye fishery in Knife Lake is in good condition <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet sample exceeded the long range management goals for Knife Lake for both numbers and size. Sampled northerns ranged from 14.0 to 36.6 inches with a 24.0 inch average.  Northern pike catch rates improved from (3.5/set) in 2001 to (5.2/set) in 2006. Average length of northern pike is up from 22.5 inches in 2001 to 24.0 inches in 2006.  The northern pike maximum length increased 7 inches from 29 in 2001 to 36 in 2006 and is quickly approaching the trophy angling size of 40 inches.  Average weight has also increased and is in the 75th quartile for lakes in this class.  Growth and ageing data analysis from northern pike scales displayed 11 year classes from 1996 through 2006. The growth rate is within the normal range when compared to other lakes in the same class.  By all accounts the northern pike fishery in Knife Lake is presently very healthy and showing great signs of quality angling for years to come.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gillnet catch (13.5/set) was high compared to other catches in the lake class while their average weight of 0.15 pounds was considered low.  Crappie ranged in length from 4.0 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.6 inches with  68% of the total black crappie gill net catch were between 5-7 inches.  Although black crappie average length has decreased the past few years, there is a good number of fish in the 2004 year class, which are presently 5-7 inches, that will create a good black crappie fishery in Knife Lake for years to come.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers increased significantly in the 2006 survey.  Yellow perch catch rate increased from (4.6/gillnet) in 2001 to (50.2/gillnet) in 2006, which is well above 75% quartile for the lake class.  The average weight, 0.20 pounds fell in the 25% quartile for the lake class.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.4 to 9.6 inches, and the average length was 7.1 inches.  Historically Knife Lake has supported high yellow perch populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnetting was high, compared to others in the lake class for the catch rate of (18.25/set).  An average size of 0.2 pounds has decreased compared to the 2001 survey of .3 pounds. Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.3 inches with a 5.7 inch mean.   The bluegill gillnetting sampled (5.2/set) and ranged from 3.7 to 9.2 inches with a 6.0 inch mean.  There is a good number and even distribution of bluegill between 3.2 and 9.3 inches in Knife Lake, which will produce a good number of quality size fish for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining indicated that reproduction was successful in 2006 for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  A high number (137) of young of the year bluegills were captured in the 2006 survey, which indicates a good year class for future years. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate 41 fish per hour in 2006, and indicated good numbers of adult size largemouth bass. Average size of largemouth bass was 1.22 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Johnny darter, golden shiner, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.        <br> \n <br> \nKnife Lake is a great fishery for anglers in east central Minnesota with many different game species to fish.  Anglers have a good opportunity to catch a trophy sized fish or catch smaller fish for table fare.   The overall outlook for the Knife Lake fishery is bright.  The 2006 survey indicted many positive trends regarding fish health and abundance.  Many game fish populations are on the rise and show no signs of slowing down.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed with rotenone in October 1989.  Since that time, the lake management plan was revised to allow for reintroduction of native gamefish populations.  Precise stocking plans have been implemented to date.  This lake population assessment was conducted in September 1991 to evaluate the present fish population status.  Test netting consisted of 4 gillnet and 8 trapnet sets and 5 shoreline seining stations.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish population compared to the previous survey (1990) and to lakes of the same classification are described.  Keep in mind that the present fish population in Knife Lake reflects radical changes due to the reclamation.  \n  The walleye gillnet catch (47.00/set) was higher than the previous survey (1990) catch (31.50/set) and was well above the third quartile (15.67/set).  One reason for the increase catch from last year was that the yearling walleyes were susceptible to the smaller gillnet meshes.  Last year (1990), as young-of-year fish, this year-class of walleyes went through the smallest gillnet mesh.  The 1991 length frequency of captured walleyes ranged from 7.5 to 16.9 inches with a median length group of 9.5-9.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.36 pounds, which appears light and also falls below the first quartile (0.68 pounds) for individual weights in this lake class.  However, age analysis and stocking records indicate that walleyes were one and two year old fish.  The quartile ranges take into account all sizes and ages of walleyes from particular lake classes.  Of all walleyes captured, 91% were one year old, and 9% were two year old.  The abundance of one year old fish was the result of superior survival of the initial fry stocking in May 1990.  This is common in an open system where by initial stocks usually do very well.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical of normal growth rates throughout the state.  Length at capture during this survey indicated that several walleyes were growing at rates above normal; i.e. yearling fish measured up to 13 inches.  The median length group of the two year old fish at time of capture was 14.0-14.9 inches.  \n  The largemouth bass trapnet catch (3.50/ set) was lower than the previous survey catch (14.50/set) but remained above the third quartile (1.07/set).  The largemouth bass captured ranged from 4.0 to 10.9 inches.  Two distinct length groups were evident, young-of-year and yearling (1+) fish.  The median length group of the young-of-year fish was 4.5-4.9 inches and the median length group of the yearling (1+) fish was 9.5-9.9 inches.  Both year-classes were expressing growth rates above normal.  However, like the walleye example above, it would appear that the bass are small because the average weight of largemouth bass (0.31 pounds) was below the first quartile (0.68 pounds).  The 0.31 pound average was only a measure of the young-of-year and yearling weights.  Contrary to quartile ranges, these largemouth bass are growing very well.  Shoreline seining captured 9 young-of-year and 5 yearling largemouth bass.  \n  A total of four smallmouth bass were captured in both the trapnet and gillnet catches.  These fish were yearlings (1+) and measured from 7.5 to 8.9 inches.  They were a product of natural reproduction from pre-spawn smallmouth bass released in Knife River, upstream from the lake, in May 1990.  \n  The bluegill trapnet catch (16.50/set) was above the previous survey catch (9.80/set) and the lake class median catch (8.80/set).  Seventy-seven percent of the catch was represented by yearling (1+) bluegills.  All bluegills captured ranged from 4.5 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 6.5-6.9 inches.  This median length group was composed of yearling (1+) bluegills, which were growing at rates well above normal rates.  Again, typical of rapid growth following a reclamation event.  The average weight of all bluegills captured was 0.34 pounds which was above the third quartile (0.29 pounds) for bluegills in this lake type.  Age analysis determined that captured bluegills were I and IV-VII years old. Shoreline seining efforts recorded 293 young-of-year bluegills in all stations which totaled 0.24 acres.  \n  The black crappie trapnet catch (5.60/set) was above the previous survey catch (0.40/set) but falls below the lake class median catch (8.08/set).  The black crappie captured ranged from 3.5 to 9.4 inches.  The average weight was 0.30 pounds.  Thirty-seven percent of the total catch were young-of-year fish.  They ranged from 3.5 to 4.7 inches.  Age analysis determined that captured black crappies were 0+ and II-V years old.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 9 young-of-year in the 0.24 acre area.  \n  The white crappie trapnet (0.30/set) was below the first quartile (0.93/set).  This was the first time white crappie appeared in test netting since before the reclamation.  The most obvious source of its presence would be from private introduction.  The five fish sampled ranged from 7.5 to 8.9 inches and were aged as I and II years old. \n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (7.75/set) was similar to the lake class median catch (9.35/set).  The perch captured ranged from 7.5 to 11.9 inches with a median length group of 10.0-10.4 inches.  Age analysis determined the fish to be II-VI years old.  One young-of-year (4 inch) yellow perch was taken in the trapnet catch.  Shoreline seining failed to capture any yellow perch.  \n  The white sucker gillnet catch (13.50/ set) was well above the previous survey catch (2.00/set) and the third quartile (6.75/set).  The lengths ranged from 10.0 to 17.9 inches with a median length group of 11.5-11.9 inches.  The average weight was 0.95 pounds.  The white suckers less than 14.0 inches were all yearling (1+) fish (about 90% of the total catch).  Only one young-of-year white sucker was taken in the trapnets (8.7 inches).  \n  The last species taken by gillnets and trapnets was the black bullhead.  The trapnet catch (2.90/set) was below the first quartile (3.20/set) and the gillnet catch (6.25/ set) was also below the first quartile (15.53/ set).  This was the first time black bullheads were sampled by any test gear since reclamation.  \n  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 4 other species not mentioned above; golden shiner, common shiner, fathead minnow, and johnny darter.  All of these native species were reintroduced after reclamation.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake is a 1,266 acre impoundment on the Knife River with an average depth of only 9.1 feet. Water clarity is generally low and the lake is susceptible to algae blooms in the summer. The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with largemouth bass and panfish as secondary species.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot regulation is in effect for walleye, as well as a 24 to 36 inch protected slot for northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Knife Lake have had good natural reproduction in the past, and stocking was not necessary to maintain good numbers of walleye between 1995 and 2006. However, test netting in 2006 indicated that the walleye population had fallen below target levels and fall electrofishing in 2007-2009 indicated poor or no natural reproduction. Stocking efforts began in 2008; fingerlings and fry have been stocked each year except 2010, when only fry were stocked.  Fall electrofishing in 2010 showed that an abundant year class had been produced, likely as a result of the fry stocking. Despite stocking, the 2011 walleye gillnet catch (2.4/set) decreased from the 2006 catch (5.6/set) and was below the normal range for this lake class and below the management goal for Knife Lake.  Sampled walleye ranged from 11.7 to 23.7 inches with a 16.4 inch mean. Walleye stocking and monitoring for natural reproduction will continue  on Knife Lake in an effort to restore the fishery to previous levels. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have shown some increases in size structure since a 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation began in 2003. Northerns sampled by gill net ranged from 19.0 to 37.4 inches with a 28.0 inch average.  Trap nets set in the spring of 2011 showed an even broader size range, with northern pike from 8 to 41.5 inches present. By all accounts the northern pike fishery in Knife Lake is very healthy,  with opportunities for anglers to catch trophy size fish. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie numbers are higher than average for lakes similar to Knife Lake. There are many smaller fish, but average length has increased from the past few surveys. Some 10-12 inch crappies were sampled. In 2011 there were a good number of fish from the 2007 and 2008 year classes. These fish were approaching the 7-9 inch range, and should provide good black crappie fishing in Knife Lake in 2012 and beyond.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap netting in the spring of 2011 revealed a good bluegill sunfish population, with an average size of 0.3 pounds. Most bluegill were between 3 and 9 inches, and one giant 12 inch bluegill was released from a trap net. <br> \n   <br> \nSpring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 68 fish per hour in 2011, an increase from 41 fish per hour in 2006.  Average size of largemouth bass is up from 1.2 pounds in 2006 to 1.6 pounds in 2011. Good numbers of adult size largemouth bass up to 19 inches should provide good angling action. Smallmouth bass are also present in Knife Lake and Knife River, but numbers in the lake are low. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically Knife Lake has supported high yellow perch populations. Gill net catches of yellow perch in 2011 were only half of catches in 2006, but perch numbers are still well above average for similar lakes. Although perch serve primarily as a prey base for walleye and northern pike, some perch were harvestable size, measuring up to 10.5 inches.  <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Johnny darter, golden shiner, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  <br> \n  <br> \nKnife Lake is a great fishery for anglers in east central Minnesota with many different game species to fish.  Anglers have a good opportunity to catch a trophy sized fish or catch smaller fish for table fare.   The overall outlook for the Knife Lake fishery is bright.  The 2011 survey indicted many positive trends regarding fish size and abundance.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake is a 1,266 acre impoundment on the Knife River with an average depth of 9.1 feet. Water clarity is generally low and the lake is susceptible to algae blooms in the summer. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass and panfish as secondary species.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot regulation is in effect for Walleye, as well as a 24 to 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Knife Lake were sustained by natural reproduction from 1995 to 2006. However, test netting in 2006 indicated that the Walleye population had fallen below target levels and fall electrofishing from 2007 to 2009 indicated poor or no natural reproduction. Stocking efforts began in 2008 and fingerlings and/or fry were stocked through 2012.  Fall electrofishing since 2013 has found enough naturally-produced Walleye to forego fingerling stocking.  Despite the contribution of natural reproduction, the Walleye net catch, which remains below both the normal range for this lake class and the management goal for Knife Lake, has shown only a moderate increase since 2011.  However, it's worth noting that between spring trap netting and electrofishing efforts an additional 788 Walleyes were sampled. Measured Walleye ranged from 5.6 to 28.8 inches.  The catch was fairly evenly split between males, which averaged 14 inches, and females, which averaged 23 inches. Annual Walleye natural reproduction monitoring will dictate future fingerling stocking needs. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have shown some increase in size structure since the 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation began in 2003. Netted northerns ranged from 8 to 40 inches with a fairly even distribution among lengths.  The spring trap netting effort found both harvestable size fish below 24 inches and trophy sized fish greater than 36 inches available.  The Northern Pike fishery in Knife Lake appears to be sustaining its quality and maintaining adequate abundance. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie are both present in normal abundance.  In the spring of 2015, 44% of the Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches while 24% of the Black Crappie catch exceeded 8 inches.  By 2016 they should provide good angling opportunities for quality panfish.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found a Largemouth Bass catch rate of 95 fish per hour, up from 73 per hour in 2011 and the second highest catch rate reported for the lake.  Bass averaged 14.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  High numbers of adult Largemouth Bass, up to 19 inches, should provide good angling action.  Smallmouth Bass are also present in Knife Lake and the Knife River, but numbers in the lake are low. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically Knife Lake has supported high Yellow Perch populations. Recent catches have been lower than the levels present during the 1990's, but are at normal levels for the lake type.  Although perch serve primarily as a prey base for Walleye and Northern Pike, harvestable size fish are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed by the use of rotenone during the period of October 10-13, 1989.  Following the reclamation project, a stocking plan was implemented to reintroduce native gamefish populations.  A lake survey in September of 1990 was conducted to evaluate the present fish population.  Netting consisted of 4 gillnet and 8 trapnet sets and shoreline seining efforts.  Daytime electrofishing with a boom shocker was also used to gather additional information on fish abundance, primarily young-of-year walleyes and largemouth bass.  The resulting catch figures from this survey were very high, typical of reintroduced fish populations in reclaimed waters.  Reference to lake class median catches were not discussed in this summary because the fish populations were radically different.  Based on results from these efforts, the status of the present fish population is as follows:  \n  The walleye gillnet catch was 31. 50/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.5-10.9 inches with a median length group of 9.5-9.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.26 pounds.  The trapnet catch was 6.60/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.0-11.9 inches with a median length group of 10.0-10.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.33 pounds.  The combined walleye gillnet and trapnet catch was composed of 99% yearling walleyes (age I+).  These walleye yearlings (30,960) were stocked into Knife Lake on April 11, 1990.  Their rate was 51.6 fish/pound and averaged about 4.0 inches in length.  These walleyes expressed fast growth as shown by the median length group at time of capture.  On May 16, 1990, 1,258,000 walleye fry were stocked in the lake and in Knife River, upstream from the lake.  Electrofishing efforts in September confirmed walleye fry stocking survival.  A total of 37 walleyes were recorded with a catch rate of 21.89 fish/hr.  Of these walleyes, 10 were yearlings (I+) and 27 were young-of-year (0+).  The young-of-year ranged in lengths form 4.0-6.4 inches with median length group of 5.0-5.4 inches.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 6 young-of-year in August and 243 young-of-year in September.\n  The largemouth bass trapnet catch was 14.50/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 4.0-6.4 inches with a median length group of 4.5-4.9 inches.  The gillnet catch was 8.00/set.  The lengths ranged from 4.5 to 6.4 inches with a median length group of 5.0-5.4 inches.  During May 22 to 25, 1990, 250 adult largemouth bass were stocked into Knife Lake.  These pre-spawn fish were collected by electrofishing on four area lakes, North and South Big Pine Lake, Sand Lake, and Green Lake (13-41).  These adult fish successfully produced a copious amount of young-of-year bass.  Shoreline seining in late August recorded 39 young-of-year in a 0.46 acre area and follow up seining in September recorded 40 young-of-year in a 0.69 acre area.  Electrofishing recorded a young-of-year catch rate of 79.88 fish per hour.  They ranged in lengths from 3.0-6.9 inches with a median length group of 4.0-4.4 inches.\n  During June through August 1990, 9,297 adult male bluegills were trapped out of 9 area lakes and stocked into Knife Lake.  The nine lakes were Comfort, North Center, South Center, Green, Spectacle, Lewis, Ann, Five, and Eleven.  In determining sexes, coloration and vent excretion were the most useful factors.  It was not uncommon for a few females to be misidentified as males, especially as the summer progressed, because the bluegills had lost their distinct spawning colorations.  Female bluegills also were introduced by private stocking as reported by local residents.  As a result, a small amount of natural reproduction occurred in the lake.  The bluegill trapnet catch was 9.80/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 7.5 to 7.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.46 pounds.  This was up substantially from the average stocking weight of 0.20 pounds.  The rapid growth increase of the bluegills was easily detectable by the survey crew, since the same crew participated in the stocking just weeks before.  Age analysis found the presence four age classes (IV-VII) sampled by trap net catches.  Thirty-five (35) young-of-year bluegills were recorded by electrofishing and shoreline seining efforts.  Back-calculated lengths showed that these fish had expressed growth rates similar to normal statewide averages before stocking into Knife Lake.\n  The white sucker gillnet catch was 2.00/set.  They ranged in lengths from 9.0 - 11.4 inches with a median length group of 9.5 - 9.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.46 pounds.  Age analysis determined that these fish were all young-of-year and appeared to express tremendous growth.  The DNR reintroduced pre-spawn white suckers in the headwaters of Knife River on April 16, 1990.  Eighty (80) adults at a total of 200 pounds were stocked.  The age (0+) fish caught during the survey may be a result of the adult stocking, however, private stocking may have also contributed to their presence.\n  The black crappie was the only other fish species recorded in Knife Lake by net catches and electrofishing efforts.  One (1) adult and 22 young-of-year were sampled.  This species was not scheduled for 1990 stocking by the DNR.  The most obvious source of its presence would be from private introduction.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed with rotenone in October 1989.  Since that time, the lake management plan was revised to allow for reintroduction of native gamefish populations.  Precise stocking plans have been implemented to date.  All species desired to be in the lake are now present.  Annual test nettings since 1990 have provided good records of fish species composition and age structure for Knife Lake.  The predicted \"imbalance\" (on the high end) of species abundance has been tracked each year following reclamation (e.g. walleye and largemouth bass).  However, this survey showed some signs of normality for the fish population finding its own natural balance in this lake.  It probably will take several years for this process to occur since initial year-classes of different fish species are beginning to reach sexual maturity.  With each coming year, more spawners will be present to add to the diversity of year-class strength.  On September 7, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Knife Lake (lake class 42).  Twelve gillnets and 10 trapnets were used to evaluate the present fish population.  Additional fish sampling also included night electrofishing for largemouth bass (8/30/93) and shoreline seining (9/17/93).  Knife Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Stocking of walleye fingerlings will continue annually through 1995.  If natural reproduction becomes sufficient to maintain the population status, then the stocking should be discontinued or used as a supplement to the natural population.  The walleye gillnet catch (8.3/set) was within the 1st and 3rd quartile range, 1.0-17.9 (interquartile range).  This was the sample represented by the scheduled 12 gillnet sets.  Previous surveys used fewer sets because of high numbers caught.  Lengths ranged from 8.0 to 22.0 inches with a median length group of 14.0-15.0 inches.  Mean weight was 1.2 pounds.  Ages 0 to 4 were represented in the catch with the majority of the catch being of age 2 (1991 year-class) and age 3 (1990 year-class), 56% and 29%, respectively.  At the time of capture, age 2 walleyes averaged 14.0 inches and age 3 walleyes averaged 16.6 inches.  Age 4 fish (1989 year-class) made up 6% of the catch.  The age 4 females had ovaries full of eggs for the spring 1994 spawn.  In fact, at the time of this discussion write up, fisheries crews had observed mature walleyes spawning in Knife River just upstream from the lake.  An anticipated first \"significant\" hatch will be evaluated by future test nettings.  Growth rates of all walleyes were slightly above average.  The northern pike gillnet catch (3.2/set) was within the interquartile range (1.0-8.2).  Lengths ranged from 17.0 to 32.0 inches with a median length group of 20.0-21.0 inches.  Age 1 pike comprised 80% of the sample which averaged 20.4 inches.  This year-class was from the first fingerling stocking in 1992.  The mean weight was 2.3 pounds.  Growth rates of the fingerlings were faster than normal.  The larger pike in the sample were the brood fish used in the NPSA during 1992.  Fingerlings were also stocked in June of 1993.  Four of these fish were caught in test nets and they averaged 9.4 inches.  Largemouth bass caught by electrofishing (136.1 fish/hour, on-time) ranged from 3.5 to 11.0 inches with a median length group of 5.5-6.0 inches.  This length group were the age 1 bass representing 76% of the total sampled by electrofishing.  Growth rates were typical of normal.  The trapnet catch (1.6/set) was above the 3rd quartile (1.2).  Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 14.0 inches with the average being 5.9 inches, again age 1 fish.  The tendency not to sample the older bass (ages 2 and 3) may reflect the theory of bass being \"net shy\".  Few were caught by standard netting gear.  It should be noted that only one station was run during electrofishing procedures due to equipment failure.  That station (EF3 - Knife River inlet) typically is not a good area to sample larger bass.  Shoreline seining sampled only 5 young-of-year (YOY) averaging 2.82 inches.  The cool summer may have had some effect with largemouth bass natural reproduction, keeping numbers low.  Also, the original 214 brood stock bass probably dwindled some, and their offspring are not sexually mature yet.  The bluegill trapnet catch (4.2/set) was within the interquartile range (1.3-28.9).  These fish ranged from <3.0 to 6.5 inches with a median length group of 3.0-3.5 inches.  Bluegills caught by gillnets (4.2/set) were from 3.0 to 8.8 inches with a median length group of 6.5-7.0 inches, much larger than the trapnet catch.  Age analysis found three age classes present in the sample of bluegills, ages 1, 2, and 3.  Age 1 (25 fish) averaged 3.8 inches at time of capture.  Age 2 (14 fish) averaged 6.6 inches at time of capture.  Age 3 (15 fish) averaged 7.7 inches at time of capture.  The latter two age groups were big fish for their age.  Shoreline seining sampled 1,581 YOY averaging 1.17 inches.  The black crappie trapnet catch (3.9/set) was within the interquartile range (2.5-16.7).  These fish ranged from 2.4 to 9.8 inches with a median length group of 4.5-5.0 inches.  Black crappies caught by gillnets (9.7/set) were also in the interquartile range (1.4-19.6).  They ranged from 3.8 to 10.9 inches with a median length group of 5.0-5.5 inches.  Age analysis found four age classes present, ages 0, 1, 2, and 3.  Age 1 comprised 69% of the sample with an average length of 5.1 inches at time of capture.  Upon reviewing average back-calculated lengths for ages 1, 2, and 3 from this survey, there was a distinct growth discrepancy between the current black crappie data and data from the previous two surveys (1991 and 1992).  Back-calculations show that known year-classes appeared to have grown considerably slower than what really occurred.  This may be explained by the Lee's Phenomenon, ruling out ageing accuracy since the fish were quite easy to age.  Shoreline seining captured 593 YOY averaging 2.41 inches.  The yellow perch gillnet catch (35.3/set) remained above the 3rd quartile (30.5).  They ranged from 4.8 to 12.0 inches with a median length group of 8.0-8.5 inches.  Mean weight was 0.3 pounds.  Age 1 and 2 made up 95% of the perch sampled.  At the time of capture, age 1 perch averaged 6.1 inches and age 2 perch averaged 9.1 inches.  The age 2 fish had ovaries full of eggs which were developing for the spring 1994 spawn.  This would seem early for maturity but these year-classes have expressed very rapid growth.  Normal maturity for female perch is 4 or 5 years.  Average back-calculated lengths have shown a decrease in growth from the previous two surveys (1991 and 1992).  Shoreline seining only captured 7 YOY perch which averaged 2.73 inches.  White suckers caught in gillnets (7.5/set) were within their interquartile range (1.0-9.0).  They ranged from 7.9 to 19.3 inches with a median length group of 16.0-17.0 inches.  Mean weight was 2.1 pounds.  Twelve suckers were aged to document the rapid growth noticed in the three previous surveys.  At the time of capture, ages 1, 2, and 3 averaged 9.5, 17.2, and 15.2 inches, respectively.  These were offspring fish from the original brood stocking for Knife River in 1990.  Eight other fish species were also captured by test netting gear: black bullhead, channel catfish, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and smallmouth bass.  All of these fish species were at or below their respective 1st quartile level.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake is a 1,266 acre impoundment on the Knife River with an average depth of 9.1 feet. Water clarity is generally low and the lake is susceptible to algae blooms in the summer. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass and Panfish as secondary species.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot regulation is in effect for Walleye, as well as a 24 to 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Knife Lake were sustained by natural reproduction from 1995 to 2006. However, test netting in 2006 indicated that the Walleye population had fallen below target levels and fall electrofishing from 2007 to 2009 indicated poor or no natural reproduction. Stocking efforts began in 2008 and fingerlings and/or fry were stocked through 2012.  Fall electrofishing since 2013 has found enough naturally-produced Walleye to forego fingerling stocking.  Walleye ranged from 10.4 to 25.8 inches and averaged 17.5 inches.  Half the 2019 Walleye catch belonged to the 2015 year class which had the highest fall electrofishing catch rate on record.  Annual Walleye natural reproduction monitoring will dictate future fingerling stocking needs. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have shown some increase in size structure since the 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation began in 2003. Netted Northerns ranged from 18.6 to 35.2 inches with a fairly even distribution of lengths.  Males and females were sampled in near equal numbers.  They averaged 25.4 and 31.3 inches in turn.  The Northern Pike fishery in Knife Lake appears to be sustaining its quality and maintaining adequate abundance. <br> \n  <br> \nQuality Panfish angling is available in Knife Lake.  Black Crappie and Bluegill are present in normal and high abundance respectively.  Forty five percent of the 2019 Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches while 64% of the Black Crappie catch exceeded 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found a Largemouth Bass catch rate of 35 fish per hour, down from 95 per hour in 2015.  Bass averaged 13.7 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Despite an apparent down turn in abundance, one fourth of the Bass catch exceeded 15 inches in length and should provide good angling action.  Smallmouth Bass are also present in Knife Lake and the Knife River, but numbers in the lake are low. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically Knife Lake has supported high Yellow Perch populations. Recent catches have been lower than the levels present during the 1990's, but are still high for the lake type.  Although they serve primarily as a prey base for Walleye and Northern Pike, with one in five Perch besting 8 inches harvestable size fish are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed with rotenone in October 1989.  Since that time, the lake management plan was revised to allow for reintroduction of native gamefish populations.  Precise stocking plans have been implemented to date.  \n  On September 8-11, 1992, a lake survey was conducted on Knife Lake to evaluate the present fish population status.  Test netting consisted of 6 gillnet and 10 trapnet sets and 3 shoreline seining stations.  Only 6 gillnets were set instead of the normal 12 gillnets because of high catches of walleye.  Based on the results of these efforts, the status of the fish population compared to previous surveys (1991 and 1990) and to lakes of the same classification are described in the following paragraphs.  Bear in mind that the present fish population still reflects radical changes on account of the reclamation.  Also, the summer of 1992 was the second coldest summer on record dating back to the late 1800's.  Cooler than normal water temperatures most likely had a direct correlation with the slower growth rates of all fish species in Knife Lake.  \n  The walleye catch (13.33/set) was significantly lower than the 1991 catch (47.00/set) and now falls within the first and third quartile ranges, 1.00/set and 15.67/ set, respectively.  The reason for the net catch decrease is not fully understood nor should it be too alarming since the walleye net catch still remains well above the lake class median catch (4.33/set).  With time, the previous survey high catches of other species will also fall to that which is normal in an established fish community.  Of course, there will always be some high and low year class representation.  At the time of this survey, the walleye population consisted of only 3 year classes, 1989, 1990, and 1991.  Natural mortality and angling mortality and/or harvest does play an important role in all fish communities.  These are probably some key factors to why the walleye population appears to have decreased.  The walleyes captured in 1992 ranged in length from 9.5 to 17.9 inches with a median length group of 13.0-13.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.64 pounds.  The median length group in 1991 was 9.5-9.9 inches and the mean weight was 0.36 pounds.  Age analysis determined that age classes I, II, and III were present in the lake.  Age I walleyes (1991 year class) were comprised of fry and fingerling stocks.  They made up 42% of the walleyes sampled.  The initial fry stocking (1990 year class) made up 54% of our sample.  Only 4% (3 fish) of the walleyes we sampled were from the first walleye stocking (1989 year class).  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were typical of normal growth rates throughout the state.\n  The largemouth bass trapnet catch (0.10/set) showed a decrease from the previous survey (3.50/set) and falls below the first quartile (0.18/set).  A total sample size of 53 largemouth bass (age I & II) were captured by test nets and electrofishing.  The age I fish made up 77% of the sample (41 fish) and the age II fish made up 23% (12 fish).  The largemouth bass captured ranged in length from 7.0 to 13.9 inches with a median length group of 8.5-8.9 inches.  The average length at capture for age I and age II fish was 8.59 and 12.36 inches, respectively.  The mean weight was 0.47 pounds.  Average back- calculated lengths for each age class indicated that both year classes were growing faster than normal growth rates throughout the state.  Shoreline seining efforts captured 26 young-of-year largemouth bass and electrofishing recorded approximately 500 young-of-year largemouth bass.  The average length for the young-of-year at the time of the survey was 3.0 inches.\n  The northern pike catch (0.83/set) consisted of 4 young-of-year and 1 adult fish.  The young-of-year averaged 13.0 inches and the adult was 24.0 inches.  Growth rates of the young-of-year were very good.  Northern pike were reintroduced this year (1992) from the northern pike spawning area on the north end of Knife Lake.  Approximately 34,488 young-of-year (half from Spectacle Lake northern pike spawning area) and 50 adults were released.  Rates of the young-of-year were 1000 and 1500 fish per pound.  Shoreline seining efforts captured 1 young-of-year northern pike.\n  The bluegill catch (4.40/set) was below both the 1991 and median catch, 16.50/set and 8.80/set, respectively.  The bluegills captured ranged from 3.0 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 5.5- 5.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.19 pounds.  Age analysis found three age classes present in the sample of bluegills, age I, II and VI.  Age I (33 fish) made up 79% of the sample and averaged 5.08 inches at time of capture.  Age II (5 fish) made up 12% of the sample and averaged 7.68 inches at time of capture.  Age VI (3 fish) were from the adult stocking in 1990.  Average back-calculated lengths indicated that bluegills in Knife Lake are growing at rates faster than statewide average growth rates for lakes of this type.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 2600 young-of-year bluegills ranging in length from 0.75 to 2.0 inches.  \n  The black crappie catch (1.40/set) was below both the 1991 and first quartile catch, 5.60/set and 2.50/set, respectively.  The black crappies captured ranged from 3.0 to 10.4 inches with 86% of them being 7.0-7.9 inches.  This median length group was represented by age I fish.  Age analysis also found that these fish expressed superior growth.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 115 young-of-year black crappies with the largest being 3.5 inches.  \n  The yellow perch catch (30.33/set) was the only species present in the lake that actually showed a significant increase in net catch from the 1991 survey (7.75/ set).  The present catch puts the level of yellow perch above the third quartile (28.33/set).  The yellow perch captured ranged from 5.5 to 12.9 inches with a median length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.32 pounds which is above the third quartile weight (0.28 pounds).  Age determination found the fish to be ages I-IV with good representation of each year class.  The yellow perch population is a product of initial adult stockings and natural reproduction within Knife Lake.  Examination of yellow perch during netting found that 7-8 fish were developing eggs for the 1993 spawning season.  By the netting estimates, most perch larger than 7 inches (at time of this survey) may provide adequate natural reproduction for 1993.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 13 young-of-year perch while electrofishing saw about 460 young-of-year.  The average length of the young-of-year was 3.1 inches.\n  The white sucker catch (5.83/set) was down from last year (13.50/set) but remains above the median catch (2.00/set).  The fish ranged from 12.0 to 17.9 inches with a median length group of 15.0-15.9 inches.  The mean weight was 1.31 pounds.\n  Two other species were sampled by test netting; black bullhead and rock bass.  The black bullhead gillnet catch (3.50/set) was below the first quartile (15.53/set).  Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 11.4 inches.  The rock bass gillnet catch (1.17/set) marked the first time this fish has shown up in the lake since their reintroduction into the adjoining Knife River.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake was chemically reclaimed in October 1989 to remove the undesirable roughfish species, mainly carp, which had made up over 95% of the total fish population in the lake.  Precise stocking plans have been implemented to date to establish the native gamefish population.  Sufficient natural reproduction has already responded well for all species.  The walleye population will be supplemented with fingerling stocking through 1995, or  until the population has reached a self-sustaining status.  The current fish population shows a remarkable size to age ratio for most of the species.  When starting from scratch, as in 1990, fish growth usually explodes for the first few years.  In time the growth rates of the fish will decrease some to that which is normal for Knife Lake.  No carp have been observed.     On September 6, 1994, a lake survey was conducted on Knife Lake (lake class 41, formerly LC 42).  Standard netting and electrofishing methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Knife Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.     Walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 22.6 inches with an average size if 15.5 inches.  The average weight was 1.4 pounds.  Ages 0-5 were represented with ages 2, 3, and 4 making up 81% of the walleye population.  The initial stocking of walleyes on April 11, 1990, (1 year old fish) were the fish that were over 18 inches and have become the first group to spawn during the spring of 1994.  There was confirmation of the 1994 walleye spawn with 9% of the gillnet catch represented by young-of-year walleyes.  Subsequent natural reproduction will now occur each year.     Northern pike abundance was normal but most of these fish were from two age groups (age 1 and 2).  Age 1 pike averaged 17.4 inches and age 2 pike averaged 25.6 inches.  The average weight of all northern pike sampled was 3.1 pounds.  Some of the larger northerns (up to 36.8 inches) in the lake were the parents to these offspring.     Largemouth bass abundance still remains very high with sizes ranging from 5.6 to 15.6 inches.  These fish were the offspring of 214 brood-stock adults stocked in May 1990.  The bass will reach sexual maturity around age 4 or 5.  At that time, there should be a slight increase to the bass population.     Bluegill abundance has climbed to above normal levels since their initial stockings during the spring and summer of 1990.  The intent was to stock 63,000 \"male\" adult bluegills to provide an instant fishery.  This was done to avoid an early explosion of bluegills which would upset the restocking plan.  The task proved to be insurmountable, but 9,300 adults did make there way into the lake with an unexpected small amount of adult \"female\" bluegills.  The result was some natural reproduction a year or two ahead of schedule.  This turned out to be favorable since the newly hatched bluegills did not over-populate the walleye/bass stocking plan.  This survey sampled bluegills from 2.8 to 8.5 inches with an average of 5.7 inches.  These were ages 0-4.  The pound-plus bluegills would be from the original 9,300.     Black crappie abundance was normal with sizes ranging from 2.9  to 12.3 inches.  The average length was 7.1 inches which were mostly 1 and 2 year old fish.     Yellow perch abundance was high with sizes from 5.2 to 11.5 inches.  The average length was 7.5 inches and the average weight was 0.3 pounds.  The growth response for perch in this lake has been tremendous, however, they most likely will slow in growth as time goes on and the overall fish population reaches some sort of balance.     The remainder of the fish population consisted of black bullhead, brook silverside, channel catfish, common shiner, fathead minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, johnny darter, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.  Their abundance levels were below normal for this type of lake, except for rock bass and white sucker, they were at normal levels.     Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Knife Lake is a 1,266-acre impoundment on the Knife River with an average depth of 9.1 feet. Water clarity is generally low due to summer algae blooms. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass and Panfish as secondary species.  An 18-to-24-inch protected slot regulation is in effect for Walleye, as well as a 24-to-36-inch protected slot for Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Knife Lake were sustained by natural reproduction from 1995 to 2006. However, test netting in 2006 indicated that the Walleye population had fallen below target levels and fall electrofishing from 2007 to 2009 indicated poor natural reproduction. Stocking efforts began in 2008 and fingerlings and/or fry were stocked through 2012.  Fall electrofishing since 2013 has found enough naturally produced Walleye to forego fingerling stocking.  Adult Walleye ranged from 11 to 25 inches with 86% of the catch between 12 and 18 inches.  Better than three fourths of the catch were 2-year-olds, attesting to Knife Lake's rapid Walleye growth.  Fall night electrofishing was conducted on October 13, 2022 to assess Walleye reproduction.  The catch rate was 118 age 0 Walleye per hour, one of the highest catches to date.  Annual Walleye natural reproduction monitoring results dictate future fingerling stocking needs. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have shown some increase in size structure since the 24-to-36-inch protected slot regulation began in 2003. Netted pike ranged from 18 to 32 inches with an even distribution of lengths.  The Northern Pike fishery in Knife Lake appears to be sustaining its quality, and maintaining adequate abundance. <br> \n  <br> \nQuality panfish angling is available in Knife Lake.  Black Crappie and Bluegill numbers are adequate, and size should be agreeable to anglers.  Sixty percent of trap netted Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches while 78% of the Black Crappie catch exceeded 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found a Largemouth Bass catch rate of 18 fish per hour, the lowest rate on record.  As recent as 2015 the bass catch was approaching 100 per hour.  Bass averaged 13 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Despite an apparent downturn in abundance, half the adult bass catch exceeded 15 inches in length and should provide good angling action.  Smallmouth Bass are also present in Knife Lake and the Knife River, but numbers in the lake are low. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically Knife Lake has supported high Yellow Perch populations. Recent catches have been lower than the levels present during the 1990's normal for the lake type.  The 2022 catch was the lowest since 2001.  The current size structure consigns perch to forage status for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",
