The present walleye abundance is comparable to similar lakes in the Park Rapids area (e.g. Schoolcraft).  Nine out of the eleven walleyes sampled were in the 17 to 21 inch length range, and the average weight was 2.2 pounds.  No walleyes have been stocked in Lake Alice since 1956.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to similar lakes; however the size is small.  The average size of gillnet sampled northern pike was 20.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Black crappies grow fast in Lake Alice, but the population is dominated by 2 and 3 year old fish.  The abundance of black crappies is good for this type of lake.  Bluegill abundance is very low.  Both the yellow perch and black bullhead populations consist of high densities of small fish.  Lake Alice suffered a partial winterkill during the winter of 1993-94; this may continue to contribute to high densities of small bullheads and low densities of bluegills and black crappies.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tLake Alice is located six miles northwest of Lake George, in Northern Hubbard County. Alice has a surface area of 127 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet. There is no public access on Lake Alice. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Alice is in lake class 34. Class 34 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), hard and turbid water, with a very regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 34 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Schoolcraft, Stocking and Big Stony. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike were sampled in high numbers compared to similar lakes, and the highest number ever sampled in Lake Alice. Pike ranged from 10 inches to 32 inches in length.  The average size of 19.2 inches and 1.8 pounds was lower than past surveys.   <br> \n\tAngling opportunities for panfish include Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Bluegills were sampled in lower numbers than similar lakes, but had a very good average size of 7.1 inches. Pumpkinseeds were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes and average size of 4.9 inches. <br> \n\tYellow Perch are important forage for Northern Pike and Walleye, and numbers in 2015 were in line with past surveys and similar lakes.  Perch had an average size of 7.6 inches with the largest fish surpassed 10 inches.  <br> \n\tWalleye were sampled in low numbers but were large with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 2.7 pounds. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Alice. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

There is no public access on the lake.  Lake Alice provides fishing opportunities for northern pike and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Alice is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Schoolcraft, Stocking, and Big Stony.Anglers can expect to find a moderate northern pike population composed of medium to quality sized pike.  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Good numbers of northern pike over 28.0 inches were sampled when compared to other area lakes.  Lake Alice has a low to moderate panfish population composed of quality sized fish.  Good numbers of 8 inch bluegill, 7 inch pumpkinseed, and 10 inch black crappie were sampled when compared to other area lakes.  Panfish exhibited good growth rates when compared to area lakes.  Yellow perch are present in moderate numbers with a few fish of an acceptable size for angling.  One walleye was sampled in 2003.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has also been low.  Lake Alice has not been stocked with walleye since 1956.  High numbers of black bullhead were sampled along with moderate numbers of brown and yellow bullhead.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker and low numbers of golden shiner and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
