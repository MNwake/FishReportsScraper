A public access is located on the south shore of the lake, with small boat access also available from the inlet channel connecting to Ida Lake.  Little Sand is known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Sand is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, and Spider. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance continued to be down with the 2007 gillnet catch rate of 2.3 walleye/gillnet the lowest recorded on Little Sand, and well below the current management goal of 7 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance was also poor in the previous survey in 2002 (2.7 walleye/gillnet), while earlier surveys have had catch rates ranging from 5.3 walleye/gillnet (1977) to 26.6 walleye/gillnet (1962).  Little Sand is currently stocked annually with 225,000 walleye fry.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low to moderate numbers (5.8 perch/gillnet).  Past surveys have had similar yellow perch abundance, generally near the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few perch an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike in Little Sand.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.9 inches.  Northern pike abundance (11.4 pike/gillnet) is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to recent surveys.  Northern pike abundance was low in historical surveys, and then started to explode in the late 1990's.  High numbers of small fish and slow growth rates are limiting the northern pike population in Little Sand.  Silver pike (a genetic color phase) are present in low numbers in Little Sand. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Little Sand does provide angling opportunities for both bluegill and black crappie.  Anglers can expect to find low to moderate numbers of black crappie with fish in the 9-10 inch size range.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Good numbers of bluegill in the 7-8 inch size range were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sand has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.  Largemouth bass are the more common of the two species with smallmouth bass present in low numbers.  Little Sand had good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of rock bass and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and white sucker.  Brown bullhead and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

A DNR owned public access is located on the east shore of the lake off. Access is also available by small craft from Ida Lake. Little Sand provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Little Sand is in class 25. Class 25 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water, and are irregularly shaped. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Dead (Upper Ojibway), Eagle, Island, Little Mantrap, Spider, Straight, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was the highest ever recorded in Little Sand. Anglers will find most northern from 16 - 22 inches in length, a great opportunity to take advantage of the current Northern Pike Regulation.  There were also three Silver Pike sampled, which are Northern Pike without the normal green and white spotted coloration. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 19.8 inches and weighed 1.8 pounds. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers again in 2022, with fish averaging 11.2 inches.  The longest Largemouth Bass sampled was 17.1 inches in length.  Smallmouth Bass have been sampled in the past, and one small fish was again sampled in 2022. <br> \nLittle Sand supports a Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year around.  Only a few crappies were sampled in this survey, with the largest at 13 inches. Little Sand also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with some nicer fish ranging from 7.0-8.5 inches. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Little Sand Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates have been increasing since 1977 and, in 1992 (12.00 fish/set and 13.66 lbs/set) were well above the third quartile for Lake Class 25.  Along with the increase in abundance has been an increase in mean individual weight to 1.14 pounds.  The low mean weight and size structure (PSD = 37, RSD-P = 6) indicate a small-sized walleye population.  About 65% of the sampled walleye were age 3 or younger.  Walleye exhibit good growth through age 5, averaging 14.96 inches at age 4.  After age 5, growth rates rapidly decline and contribute to the lack of walleye over 20.0 inches.  The prey base in Little Sand Lake may not have been large enough in the past to support the large walleye population.  However, yellow perch abundance increased substantially in 1992 and may help improve growth and size structure of the young walleye population.  Some walleye natural reproduction or migration is occurring in Little Sand Lake, as evidenced by the 1989 year class, which accounted for 19% of the aged walleye.Northern pike gillnet catch rates have also been increasing since 1977 and were within the normal ranges for the first time in 1992 (3.75 fish/set and 8.15 lbs/set).  Mean individual weight has also increased since 1982 to 2.17 pounds in 1992.  Similar to walleye, northern pike have a small size structure (PSD = 37, RSD-P = 7) and declining growth rates after age 4.  Mean length at age 5 is 22.30 inches.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests consistent recruitment.Smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and black crappie net catches were within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 25.  Lake survey gear does not efficiently sample smallmouth and largemouth bass populations; however, the net catches do not indicate any fluctuations in population sizes since 1962.  Smallmouth bass up to 15.9 inches were sampled in 1992.  Black crappie abundance was below the first quartile for every survey prior to 1992.  The size structure (PSD = 41, RSD-P = 14) appears smaller than past years, but the population remains favorable to fishermen.Pumpkinseed, bluegill and yellow perch catch rates were also within the normal ranges in 1992.  Pumpkinseed abundance has fluctuated from below the first quartile to within the normal range since 1962.  Bluegill density was below the first quartile until 1992, when the population increased from 3.80 fish/trapnet to 43.00 fish/trapnet.  Both pumpkinseed (PSD = 29) and bluegill (PSD = 32) have small size structures.  Yellow perch also have a very small size structure (PSD = 7).  The abundance of yellow perch has generally been within the normal range since 1962, but, like the bluegill, increased from 4.00 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 23.13 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Trapnet catches of rock bass were above the thrid quartile for the first time in 1992.Tullibee gillnet catches were below the first quartile in 1992 and have been since 1962.  Special deep gillnet sets are required to effectively sample tullibee.  Gillnet catch rates of white sucker were above the third quartile and those of yellow bullhead were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 25.  No black bullhead were sampled in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is located in central Hubbard County, 1.5 miles north of Dorset.  Little Sand has a surface area of 386 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  A public access is located on the south shore with boating access also available from the channel connection to Ida Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Sand is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Bad Axe (2 miles northeast of Emmaville), Belle Taine (west of Nevis), West Crooked (7 miles northwest of Nevis), Eagle (7 miles north of Park Rapids), Island (9 miles north of Park Rapids), Big Mantrap (2 miles east of Emmaville), Little Mantrap (16 miles north of Park Rapids), Ojibway (5 miles north of Dorset), and Spider (2.5 miles north of Nevis).  Little Sand is known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality, and is a popular recreational lake.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (7.8/net), above the range typical for lake class 25.  With the exception of 1962 (26.7/net), historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been similar, ranging from 5.3/net (1977) to 12.0/net (1992).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 6.4 to 22.9 inches, with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye growth rates were slow when compared to other class 25 lakes.  Strongest walleye year classes correspond to stocked years, however, natural reproduction is contributing to the population as 34% of the sample (21 fish) corresponded to years of no stocking.  Little Sand receives walleye fry stockings on even calendar years.The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 9.8/net is above the typical range for lake class 25 and much higher than past surveys.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates in previous surveys have ranged from 1.0/net (1977) to 3.8/net (1992).  Over half of the northern pike sampled (56%) were between 16.0 and 20.0 inches in length.  However, larger northern pike are present with 11% of the sample (10 fish) over 30 inches in length.  Northern pike growth rates were slow for one and two year old fish, but increased for age three and older when compared to other class 25 lakes.  Silver northern pike (a genetic color phase) are present in Little Sand and one 19.3 inch fish was sampled in the 1997 survey.  Spearing is prohibited on Little Sand as it is still classified as a designated muskellunge lake.  Muskellunge were last stocked into Little Sand in 1980 and were last sampled in the 1982 survey.  A remnant muskellunge population still exists in this chain of lakes (Big Sand, Ida, Little Sand), and occasionally one is caught.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 6.9/net is within the range typical for lake class 25.  With the exception of 1992 (23.1/net), historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have been constant ranging from 1.3/net (1982) to 7.7/net (1962).  Average size of yellow perch was small (6.5 inches), however, larger fish are present and do provide a limited fishery to the angler.  Yellow perch up to 12.4 inches were sampled. Little Sand has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.  One fish of each species was sampled, similar to past surveys.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Little Sand.  Little Sand has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population.Black crappie were sampled in low numbers (0.2/gillnet), below the typical range for lake class 25.  Previous surveys have had similar catches.  Black crappie up to 8.5 inches were sampled.  Little Sand has a low density but quality sized bluegill population.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 10.7/net is within the interquartile range for lake class 25.  With the exception of 1992 (43.0/net), previous surveys have had similar bluegill trapnet catch rates ranging from 3.0/net (1977) to 7.6/net (1982).  Sampled bluegill were an average length of 7.1 inches with fish sampled up to 8.7 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 25 lakes.White sucker (6.9/gillnet) and rock bass (6.1/trapnet) were sampled in high numbers, above the typical range for lake class 25.  Pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Little Sand and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

Largemouth bass have been caught at various times but none were taken during the survey.Shoreline development at this time includes five resorts with 37 cabins and boats, and 31 private cottages with 40 private boats.  There were three fish houses located on this lake during the winter of 1962-63.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 2 miles north of Dorset.  Little Sand has a surface area of 386 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  A public access is located on the south shore of the lake, with small boat access also available from the inlet channel connecting to Ida Lake.  Little Sand is known for its walleye fishery and exceptional water quality.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Sand is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, and Spider.Walleye abundance plummeted in 2002 as the gillnet catch rate of 2.7 walleye/gillnet was the lowest recorded on Little Sand.  The present management goal for Little Sand is 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  With the exception of 1962 (26.7/net), historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been fairly stable ranging from 5.3/net (1977) to 12.0/net (1992).  Sampled walleye had an average length and  weight of 17.9 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Natural reproduction and walleye fry stocking are both contributing to the walleye population in Little Sand.  Age analysis showed 16 of 24 walleyes sampled corresponding to years of no stocking.  Little Sand is stocked with walleye fry in even numbered years (225,000 fry).  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low to moderate numbers (5.0 perch/gillnet).  Past surveys have had similar yellow perch abundance, generally near the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.Anglers can expect to find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike in Little Sand.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 29.2 inches.  Northern pike abundance (12.3 pike/net) is the highest recorded on Little Sand, and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The northern pike population in Little Sand has been increasing.  Northern pike abundance was low in earlier surveys, then started to explode in the late 1990's.  High numbers of small fish and slow growth rates are limiting the northern pike population.  Silver pike (a genetic color phase) are present in low numbers in Little Sand.While not known as a panfish lake, Little Sand does provide angling opportunities for both black crappie and bluegill.  Anglers can expect to find low to moderate numbers of black crappie with fish in the 10 inch size range.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Good numbers of bluegill in the 7-8 inch range were sampled.Little Sand has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.  Largemouth bass are the more common of the two species with smallmouth bass present in low numbers.  Little Sand has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and moderate numbers of white sucker.  Pumpkinseed and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 5, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, five sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and two sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on June 19, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Little Sand Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Sand Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The growth was average.  Reports of few muskies being caught.  Bullhead species, perch, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, tullibee, and rock bass are present, but low in numbers.  Large population of adult white suckers present.Management Recommendations:Muskellunge have been stocked eight times since 1967 without establishing a satisfactory population.  There is no interest in musky fishing and stocking of this species should be discontinued.Walleye fry stocking has produced good year classes.  It it recommended that fry stocking be done annually at the rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 2 miles north of Dorset.  Little Sand has a surface area of 409 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  A public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Boating access with a small craft is also available from the inlet channel connecting to Ida Lake.  Little Sand provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of walleye, northern pike, panfish, and bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Sand is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep, clear, hard water lakes, with irregularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up from previous surveys and within the range for similar type lakes, but short of management goals.  Multiple year classes of walleye were sampled with good numbers of walleye in the 16 to 18 inch range.  Little Sand is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Present and past surveys have shown low and sporadic contribution from walleye natural reproduction.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye were sampled in low to moderate numbers for this lake class.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few perch of an acceptable size for angling.  Tullibee (cisco) are present in Little Sand and have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike in Little Sand.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 31 inches.  Northern pike abundance was low in historical surveys, and then started to explode in the late 1990's.  Silver pike (a genetic color phase of northern pike) are present in low numbers in Little Sand.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Little Sand does provide angling opportunities for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Anglers can expect to find low to moderate numbers of black crappie with fish in the 9-10 inch size range.  Bluegill abundance was within the range for similar type lakes.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \nLittle Sand has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population with good numbers and sizes for both species.  Little Sand has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth and smallmouth bass population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in moderate numbers included rock bass, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Sand.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, two miles north of Dorset.  Little Sand has a surface area of 409 acres and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  A public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Boating access with a small craft is also possible from the inlet channel connecting to Ida Lake.  Little Sand provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, Panfish, and Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Sand is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep, clear, hard water lakes, with irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojbway, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from previous surveys and below management goals.  Past surveys have shown the Walleye population in Little Sand to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers for this lake class.  Little Sand is currently stocked with Walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Present and past surveys have shown low and sporadic contribution from Walleye natural reproduction.  Yellow Perch abundance was up from past surveys.   Yellow Perch are an important forage species for the Walleye population.  Yellow Perch were small in size, with few Perch of an acceptable size for angling.  Tullibee (Cisco) are present in Little Sand and have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of small-sized Northern Pike in Little Sand.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 1.7 pounds, with fish measured up to 39.8 inches.  Northern Pike abundance was low in historical surveys, and then started to explode in the late 1990's.    <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sand has both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations with good numbers and sizes of both species.   Little Sand has good water quality, bottom substrates, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure healthy Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Little Sand does provide angling opportunities for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Present and past surveys have shown the Bluegill and Pumpkinseed populations to be at moderate numbers.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  The Black Crappie population has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers in Little Sand. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead and low numbers of Black Bullhead and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Sand.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",
