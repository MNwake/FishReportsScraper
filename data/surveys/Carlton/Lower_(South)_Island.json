                "narrative": "<p>Lower Island is a 281 acre lake with 207 (74%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake is located just south of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered, gravel back-in access.  Walleye fry have been stocked in 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002.  Primary management species are walleye and largemouth bass and secondary management species are bluegill and black crappie.      Walleye abundance of 2.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Of the 17 walleye aged from the 2002 investigation, 13 were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  Mean length of 17.2 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 15.6 inches.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2002.  Largemouth bass abundance was 8.7 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length was 13.8 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 12.3 inches.     Bluegill abundance of 6.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 6.2 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 5.6 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year-class and no fish older than five.     Black crappie abundance of 0.2 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Sample size from the 2002 investigation was insufficient for analysis of size structure, growth and age distribution.     Northern pike abundance of 6.7 per gillnet lift was averge compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 18.9 inches was small.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 19.9 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1999 year-class and all year-classes from 1996 through 2000 represented.     Yellow perch abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.8 inches was average.     Brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were both sampled at an abundance that was higher than average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of brown bullhead was 12.8 inches.  Mean length of yellow bullhead was 10.6 inches.     Other fish species sampled in Lower Island Lake include black bullhead, bowfin and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Bowfin are native to only a small number of lakes within the Duluth fisheries management area.     Management for walleye in Lower Island Lake was changed to double-density (2,000 per littoral acre) fry stocking in 2000.  Results of the 2002 investigation suggest that fry stocking is contributing to walleye abundance in the lake.  The current stocking rate will be continued until evaluation is complete.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Island is located adjacent the town of Cromwell, MN and is connected to Upper Island by a shallow-unobstructed channel.  Lower Island was sampled in conjunction with Upper Island and results are very similar between lakes.  Lower Island has a priority rating of 6 due to it's proximity to Cromwell, Minnesota Highway #210 and presence of a public water access. Sampling of Upper Island has indicated that it is most suited to northern pike and panfish, with a supplemental walleye fishery provided through stocking.  It is speculated that largemouth bass are also an important component of the fishery.     Results of the 1994 assessment document bluegill and black crappie populations with good size structure.  Reports indicate that recent angler catch rates have begun reflecting the quality panfish population.  Although not abundant, walleye size structure and growth rates are good.  Stocking appears successful in producing an incidental walleye fishery on Lower Island Lake.  Despite their absence in summer assessment gear, largemouth bass were frequently sighted by the survey crew.  Spring electrofishing will be used to assess bass populations in Lower and Upper Island Lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Island is a 281-acre lake with 207 (74%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake is located just east of Cromwell, Minnesota off Highway #210.  The lake has a DNR administered, gravel, back-in access located on the southeast shore.  Lower Island has been actively managed with stocking of fry, fingerling and yearling walleye from 1948 through 2006.  Most recently, walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1994 through 2006.  The stocking rate was increased from 1,000 to 2,000 per littoral acre in 2000.\n\nWalleye abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from six investigations since 1972 have ranged from 2.0 to 8.7 per lift.  Mean size of 18.0 inches for walleye sampled in 2007 was considered large and rate of growth has been fast over the last four investigations.  Of the total walleye sampled during 2007, 97% were aged to years that walleye fry were stocked.  Aging of walleye from the previous three investigations resulted in correlations to years of stocking which ranged from 57 to 76%.\n\nNorthern pike abundance of 7.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 21.4 inches.  Rate of growth had increased from typical to what is considered fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2004 year-class and all year-classes from 2001 through 2006 represented.\n\nLargemouth bass abundance of 12.2 per hour of electrofishing was considered low compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average size of 12.3 inches was relatively large and growth was fast.  Age analysis from 2007 revealed a relatively strong 2005 year-class and six year-classes represented from 2000 through 2005.\n\nBluegill abundance of 16.0 per trapnet lift had increased since 2002 (6.3) but was still considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.9 inches was large and growth was typical compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2001 and 2002 year-classes and all year-classes from 1999 through 2003 represented.\n\nBlack crappie abundance of 0.4 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.6 inches was small and rate of growth was average.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2005 year-class and four year-classes from 2002 through 2005 represented.\n\nYellow perch abundance of 1.2 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of yellow perch was small and rate of growth was considered typical compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed three year-classes represented from 2001 through 2004.\n\nShoreline seining was conducted during the 2007 survey.  Young-of-the-year (YOY) bluegill, largemouth bass, rockbass and yellow perch were sampled.  No minnow species were identified.\n\nOther fish species sampled include bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead. \n\nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic macrophytes was average with a total of 29 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  Clasping-leaf pondweed, flat-stem pondweed and northern water milfoil were abundant along greater than 89% of the transects.  Seven other species had abundance ratings of common.  The shoalwater substrates most often encountered were detritus, muck and sand, which were identified along 75, 50 and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Lower Island is an alkaline lake with moderate fertility.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Island is a 320-acre lake with 207 (65%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake is located just east of Cromwell, Minnesota off Highway #210.  The lake has a DNR administered, gravel, back-in access located on the southeast shore.  Lower Island was last surveyed in 2007.  Lower Island was sampled in 2013 to help evaluate the walleye stocking program as well as update information on other fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nLower Island has been actively managed with stocking of fry, fingerling and yearling walleye from 1948 through 2012.  Most recently, walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1994 through 2012.  The stocking rate was increased from 1,000 to 2,000 per littoral acre in 2000.  Walleye abundance of 2.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from seven investigations since 1972 have ranged from 2.0 to 8.7 per lift.  Mean size of 19.7 inches for walleye sampled in 2013 was considered large and rate of growth was average.  Of the total walleye sampled during 2013, 94% were aged to years that walleye fry were stocked.  Walleye aging from previous investigations resulted in correlations to years of stocking which ranged from 50% to 97%. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 7.6 inches and rate of growth was average.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2010 year-class and all year-classes from 2007 through 2012 represented, except 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 20.6 per trapnet lift had increased since 2007 (16.0) but was still considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.1 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment and all year-classes from 2005 through 2011 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance of 36.0 per hour of electrofishing was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes and represented a historic high for Lower Island Lake.  Previous largemouth bass electrofishing assessments on Lower Island have ranged from 8.7 (2002) to 13.9 (1998) per hour of electrofishing.  Average size of 13.2 inches was relatively large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed a relatively strong 2007 year-class and all year-classes represented from 2006 through 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 7.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was small at 19.3 inches.  Northern pike were not aged for this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.3 per lift was down from 2007 (1.2) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 5.9 inches.  Yellow perch were not aged for this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Island is a 320-acre lake with 207 (65%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake is located just east of Cromwell, Minnesota off Highway #210.  The lake has a DNR administered, gravel, back-in access located on the southeast shore.  Lower Island was last surveyed in 2013.  Lower Island was sampled in 2023 to help evaluate the walleye stocking program as well as update information on other fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nLower Island has been actively managed by stocking Walleye fry, fingerling and yearling between 1948 and 1993, followed by fry stocking in even years from 1994 through 2022.  Walleye abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from seven investigations since 1972 have ranged from 1.7 to 8.7 per lift.  Mean size of 17.5 inches for Walleye sampled in 2023 and the rate of growth was considered average. Eighty percent of Walleye that were sampled in 2023 were aged to years with fry stocking.  Walleye aging from previous investigations resulted in correlations to years of stocking which ranged from 57% to 97%. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 0.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 8.8 inches and rate of growth was average.  All year-classes from 2017 through 2021 were represented. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 16.1 per trapnet lift had decreased since 2013 (20.6) but was still considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.1 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes from 2014 through 2021 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance of 20.7 per hour of electrofishing was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Previous Largemouth Bass electrofishing assessments on Lower Island have ranged from 8.7 (2002) to 36.0 (2013) per hour of electrofishing.  Average size of 11.2 inches was average and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed a potentially strong 2021 year-class. All year-classes from 2015 through 2022 were observed except for 2019 and 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 8.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 21.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was the same as in 2013 at 0.3 per lift and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lower Island Lake was conducted on June 28, 2024 by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 9 sampling stations, but 1 station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 3 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Rock Bass) and 1 that is tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
