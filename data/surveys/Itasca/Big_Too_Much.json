                "narrative": "<p>Big Too Much is a class 23 lake located just north of Talmoon, MN.  Lakes in this classification are smaller, deep, relatively clear, infertile waters with limited shallow habitat. The lake has one public access and moderate shoreline development.  The 2016 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were primary management species while Bluegill and Walleye secondary.  The LMP goals were to provide angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Walleye through natural reproduction.  Specific goals were to maintain an electrofishing catch of 50 Largemouth Bass/hr and a Northern Pike gill-net catch <5.0/net with 30-inch fish present. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have been sampled with spring night electrofishing three times since 1999.  The catch of 15/h in 1999 was low compared to the 2007 (83.5/h) and 2020 (94.2/h - on-time) catches.  Bass populations appeared to have increased in many area lakes in the last 30 years but it is also possible the one night of sampling in 1999 may have under represented the population.  One night of sampling is the standard methodology due to time constraints but catch rates can be influenced by seasonal timing and weather.  The 2020 catch exceeded the LMP goal for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.9 to 17.9 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  Nine age-classes were estimated by scales with fish from age 2 to 9 represented.  Growth was somewhat slow compared to the statewide average which may be indicative of the higher catch rates.  Bass anglers would consider this an action lake with few large fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catches have ranged from 0.5 fish/net in 1960 to 3.8 fish/net in 2007, which all are viewed as low.  The catch of 2.3/net in 2020 was similar to previous catches and achieved the LMP catch goal of <5/net.  Lower pike numbers often result in size distributions that include larger fish.  The sampled fish ranged from 20.8 to 36.1 inches and averaged 28.6 inches.  The LMP size structure goal was also achieved since fish over 30 inches were sampled.  Six year-classes were estimated from aging structures with fish ranging from age 3 to 9.  Pike averaged 25.7 inches after four years of growth; which was above the statewide average.  The excellent size structure and growth is likely the result of the low-density population with access to a high quality prey like Tullibee.  Though finding the pike may be a challenge at times, anglers have a chance at catching a quality fish.  However, anglers are encouraged not to harvest the large pike because the lake is small and vulnerable to overharvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch rates have ranged from 0.1 fish/net in 1960 to 45.9 fish/net in 2007.  In 2020, the catch of 16.8 fish/net was about average for lakes with similar habitat.  Bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 8.1 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Seven age-classes were estimated from scales with fish from age 3 to 9 represented.  Growth appeared to be slow compared to lakes known for quality Bluegill populations but similar to other class 23 lakes.  Fish averaged only 6.4 inches after seven years of growth.  The poor size structure likely discourages anglers from targeting Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThe MNDNR discontinued Walleye stocking after the 2015 survey because the results did not justify the investment.  However, private residents have stocked the lake with approximately 56 lbs of fall fingerlings (or 1lb/littoral acre) in 2017 through 2019.  The 2017 and 2018 year-classes should have been large enough to sample in the June 2020 survey.  The catch of 0.8 fish/gill net was higher than the prior two catches yet only approached the lower end of what is considered normal for class 23 lakes.  Gill-net catch rates have ranged from 0.2 to 2.0/net despite numerous years of stocking.  Only once has the catch exceeded 1.3 Walleye/net.  Statewide Walleye Stocking Guidelines recommend discontinuing stocking if it fails to produce a viable fishery supporting a catch rate of 2.0/gill net.  In 2020, the five sampled fish ranged from 10.5 to 19.7 inches.  The four year-classes included fish from 2 to 7 years old.  Three fish corresponded to years of stocking while two did not.  Too few fish were sampled to adequately assess growth.  Anglers may occasionally catch a Walleye or two but the lake will never support a destination fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitat to Big Too Much typically have low crappie numbers.  Black Crappie catches have generally been low but the catches have been comparable to similar lakes.  In 2020, the gill-net and the trap-net catches were 0 and 0.2 fish/net.  The catch was one of the lowest in the last 40 years.  The two sampled fish were 8.0 and 9.6 inches and were estimated to be age 4 and 7.  The apparent low population would likely deter angler interest. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to sample because they frequently live suspended over deep water, an area the standard nets were not designed to sample.  However, they are important to fish communities as a prey source for large predators.  Tullibee gill-net catch rates have ranged from 1.6 fish/net in 1979 to 37.6 fish/net in 1990.  The 2020 catch of 9.8/net was below average for the lake but relatively high compared to similar lakes.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.3 to 14.7 inches and averaged 11.9 inches.  Although age information was not collected, it appears there were at least two year-classes based on the length distribution. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from 0 fish/net in 2015 to 9.3 fish/net in 2007.  In general, catch rates have been low except for the 1960 and 2007 surveys.  Only one fish was sampled by gill nets in 2020 (0.2/net), which was the second lowest catch on record.  The 14 perch sampled in trap nets ranged from 5.3 to 9.4 inches and averaged 6.7 inches.  Due to the poor size distribution and low numbers, perch may not provide enough prey to increase predators such as Walleye or interest anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Rock Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Too Much Lake is located just north of Talmoon, MN in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 232 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  Big Too Much Lake is in ecological lake class #23.  Other area lakes in this class include LaCroix, Hatch and Clubhouse Lakes. The US Forest Service maintains a concrete ramp boat access at the northwest corner of the lake.\n\nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate in the 2007 assessment was 3.8/net.  This is within the lake class normal range and similar to the previous assessment.  Northern pike size structure was good.  Sampled pike ranged from 19.1 to 36.7 inches, with an average length of 25.3 inches and an average weight of 4.1 pounds.  Growth was above the statewide average for ages 1-5, and similar to the statewide average for ages 6-9. \n\nBig Too Much Lake has historically supported a modest walleye population through natural reproduction, in addition to occasional stocking.  Only one walleye was captured in the most recent assessment for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  This catch rate is below the lake class normal range but similar to recent assessments.  The one walleye sampled was large, with a length of 28.9 inches and a weight of 8.9 lbs. \n\nThe gill-net catch rate for tullibee remained above the expected range at 25.3/net.  Sampled fish ranged from 8.0 to 13.4 inches, with an average length of 11.8 inches.  Tullibee are likely an important prey source for the large northern pike and walleye in Big Too Much Lake. \n\nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill was high at 45.9/net.  This is slightly above the expected range for this lake class and the highest catch recorded for Big Too Much Lake.  Size structure was poor; sampled bluegill ranged from 2.9 to 7.9 inches, with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average for all ages.\n\nThe gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was also the highest on record at 9.3/net.  This catch rate is above the lake class median (4.6/net) but still within the normal range.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.1 to 7.0 inches, with an average length of 5.9 inches.  \n\nBlack crappie were sampled at 3.6/trap net, above the lake class normal range and the highest catch on record.  Size structure was modest; sampled crappie ranged from 7.0 to 9.2 inches, with an average length of 8.3 inches. \n\nA night electrofishing assessment for largemouth bass was also conducted in 2007.  This is the second time this type of sampling has been used on Big Too Much Lake.  The 2007 catch rate of 83.5 fish/hour of on-time is considered relatively high and much higher than the 1999 catch rate of 15.0/hour.  Spring electrofishing catches are often highly affected by local weather conditions around the time of sampling.  In addition, small bass (< 8 inches) made up a large portion of the 2007 catch, indicating strong recruitment of bass in recent years.  These two factors may explain much of the difference in catches between the two sampling periods.  As in 1999, size structure of largemouth bass in 2007 was relatively modest.  A strong 2005 year class (age 2 fish) made up 58% of the sample.  Sampled largemouth ranged from 3.8 to 17.0 inches, with an average length of 8.8 inches.  Ages 1 through 9 were represented in the sample.  Growth was below the statewide average for ages 1 and 2, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Too Much Lake is located just north of Talmoon, MN in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 232 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  Big Too Much Lake is in ecological lake class 23.  Lakes in this class are generally clear and deep with relatively hard water and a low percentage of littoral area.  Other area lakes in this class include LaCroix, Hatch and Clubhouse Lakes. The US Forest Service maintains a concrete ramp boat access at the northwest corner of the lake.  A standard survey was conducted in June of 2015 to assess the status of the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most common fish sampled in the gill nets.  The catch rate was above the expected range for this lake class, but fairly typical for Big Too Much.  The majority of Tullibee in the sample were 12 to 14 inches.  Seventy percent of Tullibee examined were infested with the parasitic grub Triaenophorus.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have generally been low in Big Too Much, though some large pike are commonly sampled.  The 2015 gill-net catch was below the lake class expected range, but sampled pike averaged 28.3 inches and two pike exceeded 35 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class and similar to previous surveys, though size structure was poor. Sampled crappie ranged from 4 to 10 inches with several different year classes represented.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with crappie averaging 8.2 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate for Bluegill was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate; 45% of Bluegill exceeded 7 inches but only three fish exceeded 8 inches.  Age analysis indicated consistent recruitment with ages 3-11 represented.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with Bluegill averaging 5.4 inches after six years. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Walleye have been low in all surveys, despite periodic stocking.  Gill nets captured only one Walleye in the latest survey, while four were sampled in trap nets.  Walleye numbers in Big Too Much Lake appear to be limited by environmental conditions.  A similar, low-density population would likely be maintained by natural reproduction.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Too Much Lake was conducted on August 17, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample one station, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Big Too Much Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Too Much Lake was conducted on June 27-29, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes and the average length was 5.2 inches, with 23% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Big Too Much Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold and exceptional thresholds for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Too Much Lake is a small bass-panfish lake located just north of Talmoon, MN in the Chippewa National Forest.  This 232 acre lake also has a modest natural walleye population.Walleye, although not abundant in this lake, should provide an excellent bonus fishery. The walleye in the gill nets in this assessment varied from 16.4 to 20.5 inches. The two walleye sampled in the trap nets were of quality size, both 28 inches and over 7 pounds.  All walleye in this assessment were from natural reproduction or possibly immigration from Little Too Much or Little Turtle Lakes.  Immigration, however, is unlikely in recent years because of beaver dams between the lakes.The northern pike in Big Too Much, although not abundant, have excellent growth and are of quality size.  Northern pike in this assessment varied in length from 18 to 32 inches.  From information in this assessment, a 25.2 inch fish is four years old.Tullibee and yellow perch are the main forage species present in the lake.  Tullibee were abundant while yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Lakes with a good population of tullibee many times have quality northern pike.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing at the rate of 15/hour on 6/2/99.  Night electrofishing is an excellent tool to evaluate largemouth bass since summer testnetting for this species is usually not effective.  The largemouth sampled varied from 5.5 to 17.8 inches.Bluegill abundance in trap nets was 12.8/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  The average size was small averaging only 5.2 inches.  Black crappie varied from 3.9 to 9.7 inches.  Although not abundant, crappie fishing can be good at times.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tullibee comprised 72% of the biomass sampled in the gill nets in 1990.  Historically tullibee have dominated the gill net catch, although there have been wide population swings, or sampling variability.  Length-frequency distribution indicate a variety of sizes, with a mode in the 12-13 inch size range.The northern pike population remains low at 0.6/gillnet, but the average size is large (31.6 inches) n=3.  This mirrors past netting results.  The limited sample of northern pike indicate that growth is very good.The walleye catch at 0.4/gillnet is well below the statewide median and Schupp's lake class 23 median.  Historically, the walleye population has been low.  Only 2 walleye were sampled, but growth was good with length at last annulus formation for age IV = 18.4 inches (n=1), and age VII = 20.0 inches (n=1).  It appears there is poor recruitment of predator species (walleye and northern pike) in this lake.  Bluegill are abundant, as indicated by a trap net catch of 25.3/lift.  The trap net catch for bluegill has risen from a low of 0.1 in 1960, 14.1 in 1979, 13.5 in 1985, to 25.3 in 1990.  Growth is extremely slow; i.e. length at last annulus formation age III = 3.4 inches (n=14), IV = 4.3 inches (n=6), V = 5.2 inches (n=2), VI = 5.8 inches (n=13), VII = 6.3 inches (n=6).Only a small number of largemouth bass were sampled using standard survey gear, but large numbers of largemouth bass were observed during the course of the survey.  The small sample of largemouth bass indicate growth is average.Pumpkinseed, black crappie, and rock bass are very close to the statewide trap net medians, and fell within the 1st and 3rd quartiles for lake class 23.</p>",
