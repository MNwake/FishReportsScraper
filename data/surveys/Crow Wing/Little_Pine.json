                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine Lake is the easternmost lake in the 14,000 acre Whitefish chain of lakes in northern Crow Wing County. At 387 acres Little Pine is one of the smaller lakes in the Whitefish chain. Access is from Cross Lake via Daggett Lake. Boating activity can be high with over 100 cabins on Little Pine and over 200 on nearby Daggett Lake.A population survey was conducted on Little Pine Lake in early July 2005 to monitor the fish community. Northern pike was the most common fish in gill nets catches while bluegill was the most abundant species in trap nets. The northern pike catch of 14 per gill net was high compared to other similar lakes and has been fairly consistent over the past several surveys. Most northern pike were 19 to 25 inches long; the largest was 32 inches. The cisco (tullibee) gill net catch of 6 per net was high compared to other similar lakes. In previous surveys, the cisco gill net catch was near normal. Most ciscoes were around 9 or 17 inches long. Other species were caught in low numbers (less than 3 per gill net), which is consistent with previous assessments. The three walleyes captured in this survey were all large (21 to 26 inches) and old (11 to 18 years). The walleye catch has been below two per gill net in all surveys since 1987.</p>",

Development is heavy, with 101 homes/cabins (1995) along the 6.6 miles of shoreline.  Recreational use is very heavy with much boating and jet ski use.  In the year 2000, the northern pike catch rate was high at 11.0/gillnet.  Five year classes were observed and sizes ranged from 14.5 to 28.4 inches with 36% twenty-four inches or larger.  Walleye numbers were very low with only three fish observed.  Numbers of walleye present have been on the low side in past nettings since 1950 when numbers were high at 5.8/gillnet.  At that time northern pike were at an all time low of 2.8/gillnet.  Bluegill numbers were very high and 21.1% were 7.0 inches or larger.  Black crappie and largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers with various sizes present.</p>",

Little Pine is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 16, 2018, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 6 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 3 sampling sites.  Twenty species were sampled, including 8 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, blackchin shiner, mimic shiner, rock bass, least darter, longear sunfish, logperch, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 9-12, 2018 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye population has changed little when compared to the 1973 catch rate, which fell in the third quartile of the state median. The yellow perch population showed a significant gain with the bulk of the population in the 5\"-6\" range. The bluegill population is very high with catch rates of 63.7 per lift on traps and 2.0 per lift on gill nets. The black crappie population appeared in the third quartile, but indicated a significant gain from the catch rate in 1973. There were no trapnets to compare with in 1973. Both the white sucker and shorthead redhorse catch rates are at about the statewide median. Both yellow and brown bullhead are in the third quartile.</p>",

Development is heavy, with 101 homes/cabins along the 6.6 miles of shoreline.  Much of the shoreland fish habitat has been destroyed by residential development and the water quality reflects poor riparian zone management.In 1995, northern pike were found in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Lake whitefish, shorthead redhorses, tullibees, white suckers, yellow perch and bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers.  Walleyes, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, largemouth bass, pumpkinseeds, rock bass and yellow bullheads were found in \"low\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine is a 387 acre lake, and is part of the Whitefish Chain located in northern Crow Wing County.  The maximum depth is 36 feet, with 58% of the lake 15' or less. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 12.8/gill net.  Average length was 21.9\", with 32% measuring at least 24\" in length.  Fish up to 34.7\" were sampled.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked into Little Pine, but are stocked annually as fry and every other year as fingerlings into the Whitefish Chain.  Walleyes can move through the chain and into Little Pine.  The gill net catch of 0.6/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 18.5\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill nets (2.1/net), and in trap nets (0.9/net).  Average length was 8.1\" in gill nets, and 8.0\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 52% were at least 8\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 30.1/trap net.  Average length was 5.6\", with 27% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in low numbers in gill nets at 0.2/net.  Average length was 13.4\".  Largemouth bass electrofishing was done in Little Pine, along with various stations across the Whitefish Chain of Lakes, resulting in a combined catch rate of 68.8/hr run-time.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nLittle Pine Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
