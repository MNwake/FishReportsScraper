                "narrative": "<p>Lake Burgen, located southeast of Alexandria, is the southern most lake on the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, but does not have a navigable connection to the rest of the Chain.  Water quality is good with a mid-summer secchi reading of 8.0 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is limited with emergents isolated to the west central shore.  Submergent vegetation is limited.  The bottom consists primarily of sand.Lake Burgen can offer good fishing opportunities.  Walleye numbers are relatively low with a catch rate of 3.3 fish/gillnet but they tend to run bigger than average.  The mean weight of these fish is 2.1 pounds.  The average length of sampled fish was 18.2 inches.  These fish can be located on the deeper drops on the north east side.Good numbers of northern pike are present with a catch of 5.8 fish/gillnet.  Despite a 24 inch maximum length limit on northern pike, (all fish over 24 inches must be returned) these fish remain on the small side with an average length of 20.8 inches. Local rumor suggests the presence of a huge fish lurking in the depths.  Trolling deep diving crankbaits and live bait rigs should provide good action.Bluegill numbers are limited so you may want to try for black crappie.  Their numbers are up from the past survey and can provide good fishing especially in the spring around the hardstem bulrush along the west central shoreline.  These fish averaged 8.0 inches with the largest fish measuring 11.6 inches.Bass are abundant but can be difficult to locate due to the clear water and lack of classic bass structure.  The spring electrofishing survey resulted in a catch of 98.0 fish/hour.  These fish averaged 12 inches.  Try the weedline drops on the point along the northeast end of the lake.  Deep water tactics may be needed to entice these fish. </p>",

Walleye were substantially below local median in number and weight per set and averaged 1.75 pounds.  This was about half the number and weight per set as in the last survey.

                "narrative": "<p>Burgen Lake is a moderately productive, 184-acre basin located southeast of Alexandria.  A concrete plank public access is located on the north shore, just off County Road 23.  The lake has a relatively unique basin morphology with steep shoreline breaks and limited shallow-water area.  Maximum depth is 43 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 31 feet.  Water quality is very good with average water transparency measures exceeding 12 feet during summer months.   Burgen Lake supports abundant Largemouth Bass and panfish populations with moderate densities of Walleye and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed on Burgen Lake, July 29-August 1, 2019.  Six gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish community.  Due to an increased effectiveness of springtime electrofishing sampling for Largemouth Bass, the bass population was surveyed in advance of the netting survey.   <br> \n <br> \nSurvey efforts yielded good numbers of Largemouth Bass and panfishes.  Largemouth Bass averaged 13.9 inches.  The largest bass caught exceeded 18.0 inches in length.  Black Crappie catches during the 2019 survey increased to average 6.1/trap net.  Most crappie captures were three-year-old fish.  These fish averaged 8.2 inches.  This strong year class will likely provide good fishing opportunities in coming years.  Bluegill remain abundant.  Average length of Bluegill captures was 6.6 inches.  The largest approached 9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefish catches common to the survey included Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike catches were modest, averaging 3.2/gill net.  Most of the pike catch ranged from 14.0 to 24.0 inches, but large individuals are present.  The largest pike caught measured 34.6 inches.  Large Walleye fingerlings or yearlings are stocked to sustain fishing opportunities.  Walleye catches averaged 4.0/gill net.  This proved to be the highest recorded among all surveys.  Average size was 17.0 inches and 2.1 lbs.  Over 30% of Walleye exceeded 21.0 inches.  Few Yellow Perch were captured during the 2019 survey. Gill net catches averaged only 0.5/gill net, which is below expected catch rates of similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average size of perch caught in gill nets was 7.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels, an aquatic invasive species, exist in Burgen Lake.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike catch rates decreased from 7.3 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 2.3 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The catch rate in 1992 is below the first quartile of mean catch rates (3.5 fish/net) for lakes within lake classification 31.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gillnets was 2.0 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were measured at 35.8% and 7.1, respectively.  Only ages 1-4 were represented in the catch.  Northern pike growth is rapid in Lake Burgen and exceeds the mean growth rate for other area lakes within lake class 31.  Age 3 fish averaged 22.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Northern pike spawning habitat is limited in Lake Burgen.  The low water levels associated with an extended drought period in the late 1980's may have further impacted northern pike reproduction success by limiting access to optimal spawning habitat.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 2.5 fish/net in 1992 compared to 0.25 fish/net in 1987.  The present catch rate is within the inter-quartile range of mean catch rates for lake class 31.  The mean weight of walleye captured in gillnets was 1.0 pounds. PSD and RSD-P were measured at 16.7% and 8.3%, respectively.  Walleye fingerling stockings initiated in 1987 appear to have been successful.  Age structure of the 1992 capture sample corresponds well to those years of fingerling stocking.  Age 3 fish (1989 year class) comprised 10 of 16 fish captured.  Walleye growth in Lake Burgen is similar to other area lake class 31 lakes.  Daytime ac electrofishing yielded 12 largemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.4 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 53.3% and 26.7%, respectively.  There appears to have been a decline in both abundance and size structure of the largemouth bass population since 1987 when electrofishing yielded 37.3 bass per hour and PSD was calculated at 94.1.  Largemouth bass growth is rapid in Lake Burgen.  Age 3 fish average 12.4 inches in length at time of annulus formation.  Only one largemouth bass was captured during shoreline seining efforts in late August. Poor recruitment may be limiting the abundance of largemouth bass.  Bluegill catch rates have declined over the past twenty-five years.  Mean catch rate was 9.2 fish/trapnet in 1992, which is below the first quartile of mean catch rates for lake class 31.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds. PSD was calculated at 63.6%.  Ages 1-6 were represented in the catch, however ages 3 and 4 comprised 94% (50/55) of the fish captured.  No young of the year bluegill were collected during shoreline seining in late August.  The decline in submergent aquatic vegetation over the past fifteen years may be responsible for a decline in bluegill recruitment and ultimately bluegill abundance.  The size structure of the bluegill population is desirable from a fishing quality standpoint, however the low abundance and lack of recruitment is a concern. Given the lack of reproductive success; over exploitation of the bluegill population is possible, especially with improvement of the public access scheduled for 1993.  Bluegill catch rates averaged 5.2 fish/trapnet in 1992, which is above the third quartile of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 31.  Size distribution of the bluegill population is skewed towards larger individuals. The mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds. PSD was 83.9%.  Age 6 fish (1986 year class) comprised 68% of the fish captured.  Cohorts of the 1986 year class dominated the age class distribution of bluegill captured during the 1987 survey when the catch rate averaged 14.2 fish/net. The mean growth rate of bluegill in Lake Burgen is less than the area mean for lake class 31.  This is likely due to slow growth of the cohorts of this large 1986 year class.  Yellow perch catch rates increased from 1.8 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 23.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The present catch rate falls within the normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 31.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  PSD was 2.2%.  None of the fish captured exceeded three years in age.  It is difficult to ascertain the cause of the recent yellow perch expansion. Concurrent declines in northern pike and bluegill abundance may have facilitated the expansion.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Burgen is a 184-acre basin located just southeast of the city of Alexandria.  It is considered as part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, but the channel connecting Lake Burgen to the other lakes is non-navigable. The lake is characterized by steeply sloped shoreline, rapid drop offs, and limited shallow area. This limits the distribution of aquatic vegetation that provides spawning habitat and cover for many fish species. The undeveloped western shoreline is more gradually sloped and provides some shallow water habitat. This area supports the remaining stands of hardstem bulrush in Lake Burgen.  It is important to protect and preserve this vegetation when this area undergoes residential development.  Survey results indicate that largemouth bass and bluegill are relatively abundant and should provide ample fishing opportunities.  Size structure of these species is also desirable.  One-half of the largemouth bass captured were 12 inches in length or greater and 12% exceeded 15 inches.  One-half of the bluegill captured were 6 inches or greater, however few exceeded 8 inches.  Black crappie are likely an important component of the recreational fishery, but they are not effectively sampled with survey nets during summer months.Northern pike catches were lower in 2004 than in previous years.  Most of the fish captured were between 18 and 23 inches in length.  A 24-inch maximum length limit was established in 1997 to improve the size structure of the northern pike population.  The effectiveness of this experimental regulation will be evaluated at the end of 2007.  Preliminary results suggest that the regulation has had little effect on northern pike size structure.Walleye numbers were limited in 2004.  Lake Burgen is included in an ongoing research project aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of different walleye stocking strategies in Minnesota lakes.  Walleye frylings (six week old fish) were stocked in 2001.  Large fingerlings were stocked in 2003 and are scheduled for 2005.  The study will continue through 2006.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Burgen Lake was conducted on August 23-24, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance (i.e. Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass and were most abundant by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was just below the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 5.1 inches, with 13% over 7 inches. Three tolerant species were sampled in the trap nets (i.e. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey will be considered when the biological health of Burgen Lake is assessed during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similarchemical and physical characteristics is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.9pounds.  Approximately 25% of the fish captured were 21.0 inches in length or greater, however noneexceeded 28.0 inches.  An experimental 24 inch maximum size limit will be imposed in 1997 as part ofthe Statewide Experimental Regulations Project.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 1.7 fish/net, similarto the catch rate of 2.5 fish/net in 1992.  Gillnet catches ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1978 and prior to the  initiation of walleye stocking in 1987.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet.  Most of the walleye captured werebetween 15.0 and 20.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.6 pounds.  Largemouthbass were abundant in the emergent vegetation that was sampled with DC electrofishing during earlyevening hours.  Electrofishing catch averaged 90.0 stock-size fish per hour.  Approximately 80% of thefish captured were 12 inches in length or greater and 10% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 1.3 pounds.  Bluegill catches averaged only 0.7 fish/net.  Trapnet catches have declinedsteadily since 1983 when catches averaged 44.0 fish/net.  The decline may be related to a significantloss of submergent vegetation over the past fifteen years.  The most recent decline could be the resultof poor reproductive success during the cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Fish captured in 1996 rangedfrom 5.3 to 7.7 inches in total length.  Mean weight was 0.2 pounds.  Yellow perch gillnet catchesaveraged 4.8 fish/net.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.8 to 23.0 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1978.  The recent decline in gillnet catches may be a response to increased northernpike abundance.      </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Burgen.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSeventeen species were collected during this survey.  One species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.   \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Burgen.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Burgen has a small walleye population. Only one walleye was sampled during the 1987 survey. Previous surveys in 1966, 1978, and 1983 also suggested a small population with 2.0, 0.8, and 1.0 walleyes/gillnet captured, respectively. This small population existed either by natural reproduction and/or fish runs from Lake Union or Victoria. In the early 1980's, a fish barrier was put in place between Victoria and Burgen. In the fall of 1987, Burgen was stocked with walleye fingerlings. Northern pike abundance has remained stable over the last four surveys. However, the mean size of northern pike has decreased from 2.0 pounds to 1.4 pounds. The decrease in mean size may be a sampling bias due to the hot weather which may have suspended the larger northerns. Northern cisco are present and can provide excellent forage for walleye and northern pike. The bluegill population appears to be decreasing. The largemouth bass population sampled by electrofishing gear, appears to be good. Most of the bass captured were over 12.0 inches. Very strong (1986) year class of black crappie has been established. These fish were 3.7 to 4.5 inches long during the survey and should enter the creel in 1988 or 1989. Burgen lake also seems to have a high population of bowfin. One shorthead redhorse was also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Burgen is a 184-acre basin located just southeast of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, but the channel connecting Lake Burgen to Lake Victoria is non-navigable.  A concrete public access is located along the north shoreline.  The lake is characterized by steeply sloped shoreline, rapid drop offs, and limited shallow area.  This limits abundance and distribution of aquatic vegetation that provides critical habitat for many fish species.  The relatively undeveloped western shoreline is more gradually sloped and provides some shallow water habitat.  This area supports the remaining stands of hardstem bulrush in Lake Burgen.  It is important to protect and preserve this vegetation as residential development along the western shoreline increases.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Secchi disk transparency typically exceeds 6.0 feet during summer months. <br> \n <br> \nLake Burgen is primarily managed as a bass-panfish fishery with secondary management efforts directed toward walleye.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are abundant.  Size structure of these populations is considered good and should prove favorable to most anglers.  Walleye are also present.  Anglers targeting Minnesota's state fish can expect limited abundance, but most fish caught will be larger individuals.  Supplemental stockings maintain this limited population.  Similar to the walleye population, yellow perch also exhibit low abundance but large average size.  The largest perch sampled in 2008 exceeded 13.0 inches in length.  Northern pike abundance is also considered low.  Most fish are relatively small, but larger pike are present.  An experimental 24-inch maximum size limit for northern pike was imposed on Lake Burgen from 1997-2007 in attempt to increase size structure of this population.  Expected benefits of the regulation were not realized and the regulation was rescinded in 2008.  Currently, no special or experimental regulations are in effect on Lake Burgen.       <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2008 survey included: black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, rock bass, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2012. <br> \n</p>",
