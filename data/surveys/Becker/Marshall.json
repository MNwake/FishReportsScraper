                "narrative": "<p>The gillnet catch for northern pike is at a level just under the local median, a significant increase from the 1.00/set recorded in 1985.  Aging of northern pike indicates only two year classes present, 1986 and 1987.  The 1987 year class is by far the largest of the two, but both are most likely a combination of various sized winter rescue northern pike stocked in '87, '88, and '89; or possibly, the large 1987 year class is recruitment from a successful spawning of adult northern pike stocked in February of 1987.  These fish have exhibited above average growth.  The gillnet catch for walleyes has declined somewhat from 1985 but is still nearly double the local median.  A large 1986 year class dominates the walleye population and corresponds to a 1986 fingerling stocking.  Walleyes also exhibit an above average growth rate.  In the 1985 survey, yellow perch were very abundant, nearly three times the local median.  It appears that the large 1987 year class of northern pike and 1986 year class of walleyes have combined to decimate that abundant yellow perch forage base.  Yellow perch are now less than one-half the local median.   With the decline of the yellow perch forage base, northern pike predation may now be inhibiting the success of walleye fingerling stocking.  None of the walleye fingerlings stocked in 1988 appeared in test nets.  Absence from test nets could also be a result of reduced fingerling growth due to the low yellow perch forage base, producing two year old fingerlings too small to be taken in gillnets.  In any case, further stocking of northern pike under current conditions would only exacerbate the situation.  Conditions can change rapidly, however, since the lake is susceptible to partial winterkills.  The presence of an excessive bullhead population is evidence of previous winterkill situations that have favored the more resistant bullheads over other species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marshall Lake is known primarily as a bullhead lake that will also produce good sized walleyes.  Walleyes can be difficult to catch (especially with live bait) due to the abundant bullheads.  Walleyes grow fast in this lake and those sampled in 2004 averaged 3.3 pounds.  Walleye spawning habitat (clean, gravel or cobble substrate) is rare in this lake and stocking sustains the fishery.  Once stocked, they tend to thrive with the abundance of forage fishes like small bullhead, shiners, and occasionally, yellow perch.  Walleye stocking rates were doubled in this lake in 1998.  Yet, test net catches of walleye have not increased in recent surveys.  The increased presence of northern pike is suspected as the cause.Northern pike also grow rapidly in Marshall Lake and those caught during the most recent test netting averaged just over four pounds each.  With relatively high water levels since the late 1990's, northern pike have access to good spawning habitat (flooded grasses and other vegetation).  When water levels drop to more normal conditions, pike spawning habitat is not as available and populations may not be able to sustain themselves naturally.Despite stocking in the past, crappie, sunfish, and largemouth bass have not done very well in this lake.  However, a remnant population of bluegills was found in 2004 and largemouth bass catch rates were within the normal range when compared to other ecologically similar lakes.In summary, gamefish may be difficult to catch because of an abundance of forage and frequent bait-raiding by bullheads.  However, anglers occasionally are successful at catching Marshall Lake's good-sized northern pike and walleye and both are present in numbers that warrant fishing.  The public access is located on the east shore off Becker County 103.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marshall Lake is a 191-acre lake located in southwest Becker County, within the Buffalo-Red Watershed Management District.  Maximum depth is 20 feet.  A public access is located off Becker County Highway 103.  The island on Marshall Lake is an Aquatic Management Area (AMA), and is open for low impact public use such as hunting and shorefishing. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey to assess the fish population was conducted on Marshall Lake in early June 2018, using six gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers visiting Marshall Lake have reported challenging fishing, likely a result of the abundant forage base and poor water clarity.  While fishing may be difficult, anglers that find successful methods are generally pleased with their catch as the lake is known locally for large Walleyes, Northern Pike, and abundant Bullheads.  Bullheads, Yellow Perch, and sunfish were abundant in the 2018 survey, with Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and White Sucker also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack and Brown Bullheads were sampled, both in lower numbers than in previous surveys.  Brown Bullheads were quite large, with an average length of 11.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch sampled ranged in size from nearly 6 to nearly 12 inches, with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Anglers may be interested in the perch in the future if the population continues to succeed.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have decreased from the previous survey, and are below the normal range for Marshall Lake.  The size of pike sampled was decent, with an average length of 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was slightly above average for Marshall Lake and fish were relatively large.  Average length of Walleyes sampled was over 18 inches, which is similar to the historical average.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled for the first time during this survey.  Though they have reportedly been caught by anglers for quite some time, standard sampling gear failed to capture them.  Crappies sampled were between 6 and 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were abundant, yet quite small in Marshall Lake.  Average length of Bluegills sampled during this survey was 5.6 inches, and the largest Bluegill sampled was 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nProtecting aquatic habitat is important to preserve the quality of Marshall Lake.  Although Marshall Lake is classified as a Recreational Development Lake, future development on Marshall Lake should follow the more restrictive shoreline standards set by Becker County for Natural Environment Lakes.  In addition, care should be taken by shoreline owners to preserve aquatic and riparian vegetation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marshall Lake is a small, shallow, fertile lake that can experience severe summer algal blooms and critically low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months.  Although a documented winterkill has not occurred for many years (past surveys mention 1947 as a major winterkill), examination of fish population data suggests at least partial winterkills have periodically occurred.  There is a relative abundance of winterkill resistant species and scarcity of winterkill sensitive species.  No inlet or outlet is present so that reintroduction of fish by immigration is not possible.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and black crappie were all absent from the initial survey in 1964.  All these species were subsequently stocked at one time or another.Northern pike were sampled in the current survey at a rate of five per gillnet.  This is virtually the same as the previous survey and near the lower end of the normal range for lakes of this type.  As a relatively winterkill resistant species, it is somewhat surprising that northern pike aren't more abundant; especially since they were periodically stocked throughout the 1970's and 1980's.  The lake does not have an abundance of northern pike spawning habitat, particularily in low water years, and this is likely the limiting factor.  It is expected that northern pike abundance will increase in response to the recent high water levels.  Northern pike sampled in the current survey exhibited above average growth.  They ranged in age from one to eight years of age with two-year-olds comprising the largest age group.  These two-year-olds are probably an indicator of improved natural reproduction with higher water levels.  The average length was 22 inches.  Several large individuals (over 30 inches) were sampled in test nets.  An abundance of yellow perch provides an ample forage base for northern pike. Marshall Lake has a history of very high bullhead numbers.  This is typical for a lake that experiences low oxyen concentrations.   Bullheads are tenacious survivors and usually the last to succumb to winterkill.  Black bullheads and brown bullheads are both present.  Blacks, usually, far out number the browns. Historical netting data show an inverse relationship between black and brown bullhead abundance; as one species increases, the other declines.  The trapnet catch for black bullhead in the current survey was 29.6/TN, a major decline from the 308.5/TN recorded in 1990.  The brown bullhead trapnet catch increased from 17.0/TN in 1990 to the current 34.9/TN.  Brown bullhead net catches now exceed the black bullhead catch.  With the exception of bluegills in the 1964 initial survey, members of the sunfish family have never been abundant in Marshall Lake.  The bluegills present in 1964 were gone by the 1974 survey.  As a family, centrarchids (sunfish, crappies, and bass) tend to be one of the more sensitive to winterkill. Bluegill and largemouth bass seem to be particularly vulnerable.  Bluegill and black crappie were stocked in 1966 and bluegill again in 1981.  Some bluegill apparently survived and a few were taken in 1990 test nets, however, none were found in the current survey.  Largemouth bass were never sampled in test nets until the current survey.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked in 1989 and some have apparently survived to reproduce.  Although no adult bass were taken in the current survey; nine yearling bass were sampled, indicating that adults must be present.  The yearling bass exhibited above average growth.  Black crappies have never been sampled in test nets in Marshall Lake.  This is somewhat surprising since of the sunfish family, black crappie is considered the most winterkill resistant.  Black crappie may have a better chance of producing a fishery, in the long run, than either bluegill or largemouth bass.  Walleye have routinely been stocked in Marshall Lake since 1965, following the initial survey when none were found.  Gillnet catches have ranged from a low of 5.0/GN in 1974 to a high of 27.3/GN in 1981.  The current gillnet catch of 9.0/GN is approximately average for the last three surveys.  This is three times the normal range for this lake type.  The current survey sampled walleye from three to eleven years of age.  The average length of the walleyes sampled was a very good 19.2 inches.  Growth rate is above average.  Above average growth is not surprising with the bountiful supply of yellow perch.  Shiners also appear to be plentiful, large schools were observed throughout the lake by the survey crew.  Walleye have also been observed to feed heavily on young bullheads, when preferred prey were lacking.Gillnet catches of yellow perch have shown extreme variation from survey to survey; from over several hundred per gillnet (1964) to as few as three per gillnet (1974).  The current survey found 161.8/GN compared to the 7.0/GN in 1990.  What exactly is responsible for these extreme fluctuations is not clear.  Yellow perch are relatively winterkill resistant and usually not affected unless winterkill is severe.  Historical netting data shows a relationship between yellow perch and black bullheads, similar to that between black and brown bullheads; as one increases the other declines.  Whatever the cause, the currently abundant yellow perch population should provide ample forage for the large predatores like northern pike and walleye in Marshall Lake.Marshall Lake has very little development and can provide an enjoyable outing away from the maddening crowd.  The gamefish community is lacking in some regards but regular walleye fingerling stocking has succeeded in producing an excellent walleye population.  Anglers have complained about the pesky bullheads and perch during the summer months but spring and late fall fishing can be productive for the walleye angler.  The bullhead angler is virtually assured of plenty of action.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marshall Lake is known primarily as a bullhead lake that also provides opportunities to catch good sized Walleyes.  Walleyes can be difficult to catch (especially with live bait) due to the abundant bullheads.  Walleyes grow fast in this lake and those sampled in 2013 averaged 2.3 pounds.  Walleye spawning habitat (clean, gravel or cobble substrate) is rare in this lake and stocking sustains the fishery.  Once stocked, Walleyes tend to thrive with the abundance of forage fishes like small bullhead, shiners, and periodically, Yellow Perch.  Walleye stocking rates were doubled in this lake in 1998.  Despite an increase in pike numbers, the Walleye catch rate also increased in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike also grow rapidly in Marshall Lake and those caught during the most recent test netting averaged just under four pounds each.  With relatively high water levels since the late 1990's, Northern Pike have access to good spawning habitat (flooded grasses and other vegetation).  When water levels drop to more normal conditions, pike spawning habitat is not as available and populations may not be able to sustain themselves naturally. <br> \n <br> \nDespite stocking in the past, Black Crappies have not been sampled in test nets in this lake.  Stocked Bluegills and Largemouth Bass have fared a little better and modest populations of each were found in 2013.  Bluegills ranged from 3.9 to 9.7 inches and bass ranged from 5.6 to 18.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn summary, gamefish may be difficult to catch because of an abundance of forage and frequent bait-raiding by bullheads.  However, anglers occasionally are successful at catching Marshall Lake's good-sized Northern Pike and Walleye and both are present in numbers that warrant fishing.  Though not as abundant, some good-sized Bluegills and Largemouth Bass can also be caught.  The public access is located on the east shore off Becker County 103. <br> \n</p>",

Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe targeted survey of the nearshore fish community data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2013 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score for assessing the aquatic life use in Marshall Lake. Prior to assessment, updated gill net and trap net data will be collected. Using the 2013 standard survey, FIBI Tool 4 is used for scoring and results in a FIBI score of 32, which is below the impairment threshold (38) for this tool. The low number of omnivorous species and the high proportion of small benthic-dwelling individuals in the nearshore survey positively contributed to the score; however, the low diversity of small benthic-dwelling species, the low proportion of biomass of insectivorous species in the trap nets, the high proportion of biomass of omnivorous species in the trap nets, and the high proportion of biomass of tolerant species in the trap nets contributed negatively to the score. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
