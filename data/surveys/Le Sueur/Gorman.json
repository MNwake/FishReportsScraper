Gamefish populations have not recovered from the kill and reflect relative low abundance for most species.Black crappie averaged 0.67/trap net compared to 117.83/trp net in 1983.  Black crappies were represented by 2-4 yr. olds with 2 year olds most abundant.White crappie averaged 0.33/gill net compared to 5.00/gill net in 1983.  White crappie are represented by 4 year olds compared to age classes 1-4 sampled in 1983.Bluegill were not sampled in trap nets compared to 13.67/trap net sampled in 1983.  Two bluegills, however, were sampled by gillnets in 1989.  Bluegills were represented by 1-4 year olds in 1983 compared to 2 and 3 year olds sampled in 1989.Northern pike catch rates averaged 1.22/gill net compared to 2.11/gill net in 1983.  Northern were evenly distributed between 16.0-33.0 inches in 1983 compared to most fish 15.0-24.0 inches in 1989.  Northern are represented by young-of-year 4 and 6 year olds compared to 1-3 and 5 year olds sampled in 1983.Walleye were sampled in good numbers averaging 6.11/gill net compared to 1.11/gill net in 1983.  Walleye are represented by 1 and 4-6 year olds with ages 1 and 5 most abundant.  walleye sampled in 1983 were represented by age classes 4-6 with 4 year olds most numerous.Black bullhead are abundant and are probably limiting the recovery of the panfish populations.  It is suspected one dominant year class is present and averaged 253.07/gill net compared to 139.22/gill net sampled in 1983.Carp were abundant averaging 40.00/gill net compared to 3.11/gill net in 1983.Bowfin have increased from 0.50/trap net in 1983 to 4.33/trap net in 1989.Other species sampled in relatively low abundance include freshwater drum, yellow bullhead, white bass, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nLocated in Le Sueur County, Gorman Lake is a 499 acre lake southeast of the town of Le Center. A DNR owned public access is located on the south end of the lake off Dodd Road. A county owned public access is located on the west side of the lake within the town of Cordova. Gorman Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a maximum depth of 14 feet. The lake is aerated each winter, so caution should be used when traveling on ice. Based on limnological variables, Gorman Lake is classified in Lake Class 43. Other area lakes within this classification include Scotch Lake (Le Sueur County), Rice Lake (Faribault County), and Loon Lake (Waseca County). Gorman Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike. A base walleye stocking plan of 748,500 fry (1,500 fry/littoral acre) stocked three out of every four years is in place. Northern pike fry (N = 90,000) are stocked annually to sustain the population. Gorman Lake was surveyed the week of July 7, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThroughout the survey history, walleye abundance in Gorman Lake has varied from 1.1 fish/gill net in 1983 to 8.1 fish/gill net in 1994. The walleye catch rate from the 2014 survey was 3.7 fish/gill net, which is slightly above the long-term lake average of 3.3 fish/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 7.9 to 24.7 inches and averaged 15.9 inches, indicating a relatively good size structure. Growth rates appear to be moderately fast compared to other lakes in southern Minnesota, with three year old walleye averaging 15.5 inches. Walleye fry were recently stocked in Gorman Lake in 2012, 2013, and 2014 at a target rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre. Since walleye fry are stocked three out of every four years, walleye will not be stocked again until 2016. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in the 2014 survey was the highest rate in survey history at 3.6 fish/gill net, which is above the long-term average for Gorman Lake (2.0 fish/gill net). The catch rate of northern pike has steadily increased since its historic low of 0.9 fish/gill net in 1994. Northern pike lengths ranged from 14.4 to 29.3 inches and averaged 21.7 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Northern pike in southern Minnesota grow relatively fast. The average length of northern pike from Gorman Lake was 18.0 inches at age-2, 22.9 inches at age-3, and 24.7 inches at age-4. Northern pike fry are stocked annually in Gorman Lake at a target rate of 90,000 fry per year. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nWith the exception of two surveys with relatively high catch rates (1983, 13.7 fish/net; 1999, 6.1 fish/net), bluegill abundance in Gorman Lake has remained moderately low. The 2014 bluegill catch rate was 2.9 fish/net, which is about average for lakes similar to Gorman Lake. The lengths of bluegill ranged from 7.3 to 8.5 inches and averaged 7.9 inches, indicating a good size structure. Although bluegill were not aged, a length frequency histogram suggests that all bluegill collected from trap nets in 2014 were from the same single year class. The absence of young bluegill from the survey may indicate lack of recent year classes and sporadic spawning success in Gorman Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates bounced back from the record low rate of 2009 (0.2 fish/gill net) to a more moderate level in 2014 of 5.3 fish/gill net, which ranks above the long-term average for Gorman Lake (4.4 fish/gill net). Black crappie abundance in Gorman has been variable throughout the survey history and is likely dependent on a strong year class at least every three to five years to carry the population. The lengths of black crappie from 2014 gill nets ranged from 3.9 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.4 inches, indicating a moderate size structure. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThroughout the survey history in Gorman Lake, yellow perch catch rates have varied from 0.3 fish/gill net in 1994 to 36.3 fish/gill net in 2004, averaging 9.2 fish/gill net from 1970 to 2014. The 2014 catch rate was 7.7 fish/gill net. Yellow perch collected in 2014 ranged in length from 4.8 to 10.7 inches and averaged 8.4 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Yellow perch are an important prey source for predators in Gorman Lake, such as walleye. No stocking plan exists for yellow perch, so the population is sustained through natural recruitment.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nHistorically, black bullhead abundance in Gorman Lake has been high, averaging 151.7 fish/gill net from 1970 to 1994. Since 1999, however, black bullhead numbers have been below 6.0 fish/gill net, except during a 2004 survey when the catch rate was 85.9 fish/gill net. The 2014 survey yielded only 2.7 fish/gill net, which is very low black bullhead abundance compared to lakes similar to Gorman Lake. Black bullhead from gill and trap nets ranged in length from 8.9 to 13.5 inches and averaged 11.4 inches. Younger, smaller individuals that are often preyed upon by walleye and northern pike were completely lacking from the survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther fish species that were collected in the 2014 survey included white bass (N = 6), common carp (N = 60), bowfin (N = 39), freshwater drum (N = 36), white sucker (N = 5), and bigmouth buffalo (N = 4). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

Black bullheads averaged 253.67/gill net and 31.00/trap net in 1989.  The present bullhead population appears to be a single cohort with a median length of 7.5 inches.Black crappie remain low in abundance with only ten fish sampled.  Black crappie adults (7,000) were stocked in 1991 to bolster the population.  Few crappie seem to be present, with only ten sampled, and it is unclear what the stocked crappie contributed through reproduction.Bluegill abundance remains low, with five captured compared to only two sampled in 1989.  Adult bluegill (25,000) were stocked in 1991 to bolster the panfish population.  Few of these fish seem to be present and their contribution through reproduction is unknown.Walleye have declined, averaging 0.75/gill net compared to 6.11/gill net in 1989.  Walleye were 2 year olds compared to the four age classes present in 1989.Northern pike remain in low abundance, 1.00/gill net compared to 1.22/gill net in 1989.  Northern pike are represented by ages 1 and 2.Carp are relatively abundant at 11.50/trap net.  They are well distributed at 9.5-26.0 inches.Other species sampled in relatively low numbers include white sucker, bowfin, pumpkinseed, white bass, and freshwater drum.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gorman Lake is located along the Cannon River near Cordova.  This 500 acre lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet.  A fishery survey was conducted on Gorman Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Yellow perch catch was high and increased significantly from the 1994 and 1999 samples when yellow perch were at low abundances.  Most yellow perch were around 9 inches with the largest about 10 inches long.  Walleye catch per gill net declined from a moderate level in 1994 to a low catch in 1999 and again in 2004.  Walleye were around 15 to 24 inches long.  Northern pike were caught in low number, but most of the fish were 20 to 30 inches long.  Black bullhead were the most abundant species in both the gill and trap net catches, but the catches were within normal values compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  The black bullhead were relatively large with may fish around 8 to 12 inches long.  Bluegill and black crappie were present in low numbers.  Other species present included bowfin, carp, channel catfish, freshwater drum, white bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and bigmouth buffalo.  Except for near the Cannon River inlet and outlet aquatic vegetation was rare in Gorman Lake.  A boat launch with a concrete ramp is located on the south shore.  An unimproved access is located on the southwest shore and a small county park is located at the outlet where the Cannon River flows out of Gorman Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gorman Lake in Le Sueur County is a 499 acre lake southeast of the city of Le Center. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake off Dodd Road.  A county-owned public access sits on the west shore of the lake off 205th avenue.  <br> \n <br> \nGorman Lake was surveyed the week of July 6th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Netting results turned up a little bit of everything; fourteen fish species were counted all at moderate levels. Yellow perch were the most abundant fish in the gill nets, at 15 fish per lift. Perch ranged from 5.6 to 11.6 inches in length and averaged 3 to a pound, a mean weight that exceeds the upper quartile for class 43 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance is at the highest level observed in fifteen years at just under 4 walleye per gill net lift. Walleye fry are stocked 3 of 4 years in Gorman Lake. Walleye size distribution is variable; fish range from 7.5 to 24 inches with an average of 14 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are modestly abundant at 3 fish per gill net lift. Like walleye, pike size distribution varies with fish ranging from 18 to 35 inches. Northern pike fry are stocked into a drainable wetland on the southwest end of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant fish in gill nets were yellow perch. Perch declined from 36 fish per gill net lift in 2004 to 15 fish in 2009. Perch averaged 8.5 inches, a \"quality\" stock index value. The largest perch was 11.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were not captured particularly well in trapnets. Gill nets averaged 5 fish per net while trapnets averaged 2. Average bluegill size was favorable at 7 inches, a value between \"quality\" and \"preferred\" in stock indices. Curiously, only one black crappie was captured. Historically black crappies have always maintained a low level of abundance on Gorman, but never to a nearly undetectable level. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass averaged 5 fish per gill net lift. Nearly all white bass where between 13 and 14 inches, indicating a strong year class (fish were unaged). Other fish observed in the survey include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Gorman Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gorman Lake is a 521-acre lake located approximately 4 miles southeast of Le Center in Le Sueur County. The lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet. It is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. The lake is aerated during the winter to prevent low oxygen. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shoreline off Dodd Road and a county-owned public access is located on the west shoreline within the town of Cordova. Gorman Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike. It is included in a research project investigating Walleye strain performance in the Cannon River chain of lakes beginning in 2018. The management plan calls for stocking 249,500 each of Lower Mississippi and Mississippi Strain Walleye fry annually. Approximately 87,000 Northern Pike fry are stocked in odd years and other species are stocked as needed following winterkill events.  <br> \n <br> \nGorman Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years. The 2019 standard survey was completed the week of June 24, 2019 using 9 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 54 minutes of standard boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 4.4/gill net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. The previous catch rate in 2014 was 3.7/net and the average catch rate from 1994 to 2019 was 3.9/net. Lengths ranged from 7.9 to 24.1 inches with an average of 18.3 inches. About half the Walleye exceeded 20 inches in length. Seven more Walleye ranging from 20.1 to 23.3 inches were sampled with trap nets. Walleye from both gears ranged from 1 to over 15 years old with 9 year classes present. Approximately 70% of Walleye were from years in which fry were stocked, although it was unknown to what extent stocking contributed to those year classes. Growth was moderately fast with Walleye reaching 15 inches before year 3 and 20 inches by year 5.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were the most abundant fish surveyed in 2019. A total of 184 Black Crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 20.4/net, indicating high numbers were present. The 2014 catch rate was 5.3/net. Before 2019, the highest catch rate was 5.6/net and the average was just 3.2/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 4.1 to 12.9 inches with an average of 8.5 inches. About 28% of Black Crappies sampled were larger than 10 inches. An additional 50 Black Crappies ranging from 3.9 to 11.7 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 8 year classes present. Most Black Crappies were 2 to 4 years old. Growth was fast with Black Crappies reaching 8 inches by year 3 and 10 inches by year 4. Hopefully the 2019 survey is indicative of a new trend for Black Crappies in Gorman Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 73 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 8.1/net. This was the highest catch rate recorded from 1994 to 2019 when catch rates averaged just 3.6/net. The previous catch rate in 2014 was 2.9/net. Lengths in 2019 varied from 4.7 to 8.3 inches with an average of 6.7 inches. Approximately 8% of Bluegills sampled exceeded 8 inches in length. Three more fish ranging from 7.2 to 9.4 inches were sampled with gill nets. Ages from both gears ranged from 2 to 5 years with 4 year classes present. Growth was moderate with Bluegills reaching 6 inches by year 4. Ideal habitat is limited in Gorman Lake and inhibits our ability to produce a quality Bluegill fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 3.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The 2014 catch rate was 3.6/net and the average since 1994 was 2.7/net. Lengths ranged from 19.0 to 38.5 inches with an average of 26.4 inches. Approximately 71% of the sample exceeding the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Ten additional Northern Pike, ranging from 20.7 to 35.1 inches, were sampled with trap nets. Northern Pike from both gears ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 6 year classes present. Age distribution was fairly even with most Northern Pike being 2 to 5 years old. Growth was moderate with quality length of 21 inches exceeded by year 3. Northern Pike numbers continue to trend up in Gorman Lake and the impressive size structure should appeal to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nGorman Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nLargemouth Bass are less common in Gorman Lake than in many other Waterville Area lakes. A total of just 15 were sampled with standard boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 16.6/hour. This was the first targeted electrofishing sample conducted in Gorman Lake. Lengths ranged from 8.4 to 15.0 with an average of 11.3. One 14.3 inch Largemouth Bass was also sampled with trap nets. Largemouth Bass from all gears ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Growth was moderate with Largemouth Bass reaching 12 inches by year 4. Like Bluegills, preferred habitat for Largemouth Bass is limited in Gorman Lake. A positive change in nearshore vegetation could lead to better habitat for Largemouth Bass and Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the second most sampled fish species in the gill nets in 2019. A total of 128 were sampled for a catch rate of 14.2/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2014 was 7.7/net. Since 1994, catch rates have varied from 0.3/net to 36.3/net with an average of 13.1/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 5.3 to 10.4 inches with an average of 8.0 inches. Approximately 44% were larger than 8 inches. Yellow Perch were mostly young ranging from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. Yellow Perch reached 8 inches by year 4, indicating a moderate growth rate. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for managing Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike in Gorman Lake and offer and additional target for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1994, Black Bullhead numbers have been quite erratic in Gorman Lake with survey numbers either exceeding 85/net or failing to surpass 6/net. In 2019, the catch rate was just 5.3/net and low numbers had been sampled in 2009 and 2014 as well. Black Bullhead numbers often surge following fish kills and wane during periods of stability. Judging by the catch rates alone, Gorman appears to be enjoying an extended period of stability since the early 2000s. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp remained a prominent member of the Gorman Lake fish community in 2019. A total of 40 Common Carp, ranging from 16.3 to 28.9 inches, were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 4.4/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The 1994 to 2019 average was 5.6/net and catch rates exceeded 5.5/net three times during that time. High Common Carp numbers are correlated with poor nearshore habitat and water quality due to their destructive feeding habits. Efforts to reduce Common Carp numbers in Gorman Lake should be considered. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2019 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Quillback, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 8.2 ppm and 70.5 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 3.5 ppm and 70.0 degrees Fahrenheit at 14 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

The majority of walleye caught were in the 12 to 20 inch range, and locals reported success during the walleye opener.  Panfish numbers are up compared to past years and bluegills averaged 7 inches with some fish caught over 9 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gorman Lake is a 521-acre lake located approximately 4 miles southeast of Le Center in Le Sueur County. Gorman Lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet and is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. Gorman Lake is aerated during the winter to prevent hypoxic conditions. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south shoreline off Dodd Road and a county-owned public access is located on the west shoreline within the town of Cordova. Gorman Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike and is included in a research project investigating Walleye strain performance in the Cannon River chain of lakes beginning in 2018. The management plan calls for stocking a 50:50 ratio of Lower Mississippi and Mississippi Strain Walleye fry annually. Northern Pike fry are stocked in odd years and other species are stocked as needed following winterkill events. Gorman Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will typically be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA 2022 targeted survey using gill nets was added to align with the other Cannon River chain lakes included in the Walleye strain research project. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Methods for this targeted survey were identical to a standard survey including number of nets, net location, and timing of the survey. Therefore, results from this targeted survey can be compared to historical standard surveys. The targeted survey was completed the week of June 21, 2022 using 9 gill nets. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 59 Walleyes were sampled for a catch rate of 6.6/net, which was up from the 2019 catch rate of 4.4/net. Catch rates have varied from 1.3/net to 8.1/net with an average of 4.3/net since 1994. Walleye ranged from 8.0 to 25.8 inches with an average of 18.6 inches. Almost all Walleye were over 15 inches and approximately 27% were over 20 inches. Walleye ranged from 1 to 9 years with 7 year-classes present. The 2019 year-class was the most abundant, accounting for 42% of the sample. Approximately 89% of Walleye sampled were from years when fry were stocked. Walleye growth was fast with an average length of 16.6 inches at year 3. Walleye numbers improved in 2022, perhaps due to the annual stocking of multiple strains since 2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most abundant species in the 2022 survey. A total of 181 Black Crappie were sampled for a catch rate of 20.1/net. The 2022 Black Crappie catch rate was nearly identical to the 2019 catch rate of 20.4/net, which was the highest recorded since 1994. Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 to 12.5 inches with an average of 8.1 inches. Approximately 35% of Black Crappie sampled were over 8 inches and 18% were greater than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at an all-time high catch rate of 6.0/net in 2022. Northern Pike catch rates averaged 3.2/net from 1994 to 2022. Northern Pike ranged from 21.0 to 32.9 inches with an average of 25.2 inches. Approximately 57% of Northern Pike sampled exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch was the second most abundant species in the 2022 survey with a catch rate of 15.6/net. The 2019 catch rate was 14.2/net and the long-term average is 13.5/net. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 11.2 inches with an average of 8.2 inches. Almost half of the Yellow Perch sampled were over 8 inches and about 8% were over 10 inches. Gorman Lake offers a somewhat rare opportunity to target \"keeper\" Yellow Perch in the Waterville area. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bigmouth Buffalo (1.9/net), Black Bullhead (2.8/net), Bluegill (0.9/net), Bowfin (7.6/net), Common Carp (3.1/net), Freshwater Drum (7.3/net), Golden Shiner (0.1/net), White Bass (0.4/net), and Yellow Bullhead (1.3/net). <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2 feet. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen readings ranged from 7.5 ppm and 77.9 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 6.5 ppm and 77.9 degrees Fahrenheit at 12 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",
