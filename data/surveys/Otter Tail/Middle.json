                "narrative": "<p>Middle Lake is a 194-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately eight miles south of the city of Battle Lake, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 56 feet and 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with areas of muck located in the bays.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 17.5 feet.  A public access is located on the southwest shoreline, however, this access is very primitive.  The road is not maintained and parking and turnaround areas are very limited.  The last survey conducted on Middle Lake was in 1971.     Development is very light on the lake; six houses were counted during this survey.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Middle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Middle Lake contains good populations of northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.       Northern pike are common and are of good average size with 33% of the fish greater than 24.0 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 14.7 to 31.5 inches with an average length and weight of 24.7 inches and 2.5 pounds.     Bluegill abundance is moderate.  Thirteen percent of the bluegill sampled were greater than seven inches in length.  Black crappie numbers are also good with some fish greater than ten inches in length present.  Thirty-five percent of the crappies in the summer trap net sample were at least ten inches in length.       The largemouth bass population is well balanced.  Bass sampled in a special electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 3.7 to 20.7 inches.  Age data indicate that consistent year classes are produced.      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Middle Lake is a 194-acre mesotrohpic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  The maximum depth is 56 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of hardwood woodlots.  Shoreline substrates are primarily sand and gravel with areas of muck in the bays.  The secchi disk reading was 25.0 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings were 10.0 and 17.5 feet.  An unimproved public access is located on the southwest shore in the Jensen Wildlife Management Area.   <br> \n     Development on the lake is very light.  Six houses are located along the shoreline.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several species of fish including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Middle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists in abundance throughout the lake.   <br> \n     Northern pike ranged in length from 13.1 to 36.8 inches with an average length and weight was 20.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Twenty-five percent of the northern pike exceeded 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 20.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Ninety-three percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     The black crappie test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for this class of lake.  The 2002 year class is strong and composed a majority of the black crappie sample.  Forty-seven percent of the black crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 8.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in 2008.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum size limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the largemouth bass population.  A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to evaluate the bass population.  Data indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.0 to 20.7 inches with a mean length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 11.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Middle Lake is a 194-acre mesotrohpic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 56 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.0 to 17.5 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline in the Jensen Wildlife Management Area.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (5 per day) was implemented in 2022.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is extremely abundant and has a quality size structure.  Eighty-one percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 27% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.3 inches at seven years of age.  <br> \n     A special harvest regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2008.  All bass 12.0 inches and longer must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Middle Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Middle Lake is a 194-acre mesotrohpic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 56 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.0 to 17.5 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline in the Jensen Wildlife Management Area.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A special harvest regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2008.  All bass 12.0 inches and longer must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n    A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Data indicate that a high density, slow growing population exists.  Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 2.9 to 19.7 inches with an average length and weight of 10.6 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.7 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Middle Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
