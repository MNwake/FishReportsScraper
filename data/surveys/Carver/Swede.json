                "narrative": "<p>Swede Lake is 432-acres (432 littoral acres), with a maximum depth of 12 feet. Swede is located southeast of Watertown in northwestern Carver County. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the northeast side of the lake off of County road 10 and Swede Lake road (up to 5 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Swede is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie. Swede Lake is unique in that past surveys have found very little predator (Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike) presence. <br> \n <br> \nSwede Lake has been known to \"boom or bust,\" however it has been several years since a substantial winterkill. A Standard Survey (9 trap nets/2 gill nets) was conducted on Swede Lake during the week of 8/9/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Swede was very productive (green stained water), with very low water clarity, measured at 2 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen remained above 3 parts per million (ppm) at 9 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Swede Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (64.3/net). There were 579 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 6.1 inches and a maximum length of 8.7 inches. Bluegill growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the metro with an average length of 5.6 inches by age 2 and 6.8 inches by age 3. The presence of large Bluegill (8\"+) and fast growth rates are encouraging signs for the future of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nExtremely high numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (392/net) and trap nets (78.4/net), far exceeding the catch rates of similar lakes across the metro. There were 1,490 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 6.1 inches and the largest measured at 12.6 inches. Black Crappie growth rates were fast compared to similar lakes with an average size of 6.2 inches by age 2. The current Black Crappie population is dominated by a single (2019) year class (94% of catch), which should provide great angling opportunity in the next 2-3 years. <br> \n <br> \nSince the 1996 survey, zero Largemouth Bass had been sampled in Swede Lake previous to this survey. While targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2021 survey, incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 80 Largemouth Bass. These fish averaged 10.7 inches, with the largest measured at 17.6 inches. Largemouth Bass appear to have established a robust population with consistent recruitment and multiple fish (28%) greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

In 2000-2001 there was a \"boom\" in the fishery noted by heavy ice-fishing pressure in the winter and heavy open-water fishing in the spring.   <br> \n <br> \nSince the initial survey in 1996, two species previously collected did not show up in the 2006 survey and three species were sampled that were not previously collected.  One largemouth bass and one walleye were collected in the 1996, but none were present in the most recent population assessment.  Species gained included golden shiners, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nSwede lake is not considered preferable smallmouth bass habitat.  Swede is shallow, very productive, and susceptible to high summer temperatures, whereas smallmouth bass prefer cool clear waters.  Minnesota law prohibits the transport of live fish (see Minnesota statute 97C.205) to prevent illegal stockings, which can be harmful to the ecosystem and detrimental to the species being stocked.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch was 29 fish/gillnet and 0.88 fish/trapnet.  Mean length was 7.9 inches in gillnets and 9.8 inches in trap nets. Two-year-old fish dominated the catch with the oldest fish being eight years old.  Growth rates were well above average, which is typical for a boom-and-bust  lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch was mostly made up of the 2001 and 2004 year-classes.  In 2004, only 0.2 fish/trapnet were collected.  In 2006, the catch was 49.3 fish/trapnet and 27 fish/gillnet.  The average bluegill measured 5.1 inches and weighed 0.12 pounds.  Growth was slightly above average.   <br> \n <br> \nAn increase in numbers of black crappie was also observed.  In 1994, only 0.3 fish/gillnet and 0.6 fish/trapnet were collected.  The 2006 catch averaged 65.9 fish/gillnet and 41.9 fish/trapnet.  Average length and weight was similar between surveys. Growth was above average to age two and slightly below average thereafter. <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected included:  carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swede Lake is a 376 acre lake with a maximum depth of 12 feet.  The lake is located in north central Carver County, southeast of Watertown.  Swede Lake provides limited recreational opportunities.  A state-owned boat launch with a gravel parking lot is present.  Water quality in Swede Lake is very poor, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than four feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than four feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Due to the dissolved oxygen disappearing at such a shallow depth, fish may become thermally stressed.  The combined exposure to very low dissolved oxygen and high water temperatures in late summer could potentially result in fish ceasing their feeding behaviors.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.   <br> \n <br> \nNo predator community exists in Swede Lake.  Neither of the last two surveys found largemouth bass, northern pike or walleye.  Five species of panfish are present.  Black crappie abundance is very high.  Average length was 8.26 inches.  Over 12% of sampled black crappie were 10 inches or larger.  Individuals over 11.5 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance decreased compared to the 2006 survey, but is still above average.  Fully 95% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  More than one-third were 8 inches or larger.  No bluegill over 9 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch abundance in Swede Lake is above average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was below average. Average length was 7.6 inches.  Over 36% of sampled fish were 8 inches or larger.  Hybrid and green sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in above average numbers, compared to similar lakes.   Common carp abundance decreased since the 2006 survey, but remains above average.  Black bullhead were also sampled at above average abundance.  The 2011 measure was the lowest yet for Swede Lake.  Golden shiner are also present.   <br> \n <br> \nNearshore seining and backpack electrofishing only found species mentioned previously.  Overall, Swede Lake contains a limited forage base.  The absence of other minnows and darters reasserts the notion that water quality in Swede Lake is very poor.       <br> \n    <br> \nDissolved oxygen readings taken during the winter of 2010-2011 indicated the potential for winterkill.  To prevent total loss of the fishery, Swede Lake was opened to liberalized fishing.  Lakes are opened to liberalized fishing when a fish population is endangered due to the lack of oxygen available in the water. These lakes are opened so that the public can take fish before they die. Lakes opened to liberalized fishing have signs posted at the public access or along the shore, and announcements will be made in the local newspaper and through the DNR Section of Fisheries central office in St. Paul. <br> \n</p>",
