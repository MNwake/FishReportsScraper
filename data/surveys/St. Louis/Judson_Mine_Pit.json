                "narrative": "<p>Test netting with 250 ft standard experimental gill nets and ? \" mesh, 3'x5' framed trap nets was conducted on this abandoned iron ore open pit mine to evaluate the status of the artificially created rainbow trout fishery.  The IRRRB (Iron Range Reclamation and Rehabilitation Board) has been involved in a long term reclamation project on this mine pit that included reshaping the vertical rock walls to a more gentle, less erodible slopes and planting  conifers, grasses, and clover.   As  part of the final phase of this reclamation project the IRRRB agency has been  purchasing catchable sized (3 per lb) rainbow trout from  private coldwater hatcheries to provide and maintain a  recreational fishery.   Since 1996 about 600 yearling rainbows have been stocked  twice annually,  spring and fall, to maintain a put and take fishery that is popular with local anglers.      Due to the mine pit shape gill nets sampler sampling rainbow trout better than trap nets as most of the shoal area is steeply sloped .  Eight gill net sets and 12 trap net sets caught  21 and 8  rainbow trout respectively.  The average length of gill net caught rainbow trout were 11.5 while trap net trout averaged 9.2 inches.  Average individual weights of rainbow trout in the gill nets were 0.7 lbs while those caught in trap nets weighed an average of 0.6 lbs.  Most of the  fish in both gear types were between 8.0 to 13.0 inches in length and are suspected to have originated from the two most recent stocking, June 1st and Oct 6th (21 days previous to test netting). The lack of larger rainbow trout indicates most fish are caught by anglers shortly after being stocked.   Other fish species sampled included  green sunfish and white suckers.  Small white suckers were very abundant in the catch as the gill net catch was 12.75 fish/gill net which exceeds the catch rate  for 75 % of the  gill netting studies on lakes which have similar characteristics as this mine pit.  The average length of white suckers from the gill net and trap net catches were 11.5 inches (n=102) and 9.2 inches (n=116) respectively.  Green sunfish were rare in the gill nets as only 2 fish were sampled in eight sets,  but were much more common in  trap nets  as the catch rate was  6.25 fish/ net.  These fish were small sized as the average  length of 75 fish measured  was 3.8 inches.   Minnow traps were also set but only small green sunfish were caught.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>JJudson Mine Pit is located just west of the City of Buhl, MN.  The relatively small, 18 acre pit has very little littoral area (3 acres), a maximum depth of 64 feet, and about 0.8 miles of shoreline.  The City of Buhl maintains two carry-in accesses; one on the southwest shore and a fishing platform on the northwest shore.  Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) has been the lead agency for a long-term reclamation project that has included reshaping pit walls, stabilizing erodible areas, and purchasing trout from a private hatchery for stocking.  Trout management began in 1984 and IRRRB has biannually (spring and fall) purchased rainbow trout since 1997. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout numbers appeared to be limited, as only one was sampled during the assessment.  The gill net catch rate was 0.3/net, while the length was 10.3 inches.  This fish was likely from the spring stocking.  The absence of fish suggests poor survival from competition, environmental factors, or angler harvest. <br> \n <br> \nAngler reports suggested the invasive species, rainbow smelt, were present in the pit.  A special small mesh gill net, specifically set to sample smelt, had a catch rate of 183.0/net.  Lengths ranged from 4.6-8.3 with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  The length frequency distribution suggests multiple age classes present.  Standard gill nets also sampled two smelt with lengths near six inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were the most numerous species sampled in gill nets (11.5/net), while green sunfish were sampled at a rate of 1.8/net.  Both catch rates were similar to previous assessments (9.0/net and 2.6/net).  Conversely, green sunfish were sampled at a rate of 30.8/trap net and white sucker at a rate of 1.8/trap net.  Again, the catch was similar to the previous assessment (25.6/net and 1.2/trap net).  This was the first assessment to sample yellow perch, at a rate of 4.0/trap net. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling included a minnow trap which sampled only green sunfish.  Crew notes indicated other species of minnows were observed in the shallows, but not sampled. <br> \n</p>",

This mine pit has undergone extensive reclamation to revegetate the shoreline and the surrounding area.     The pit has been annually stocked with rainbow trout yearlings but brook trout and splake have also been stocked.  Brook trout were stocked in 1987 and 1988 and splake in 1992.  This assessment indicated that a modest population of rainbow trout are present.  The rainbows ranged in length from 11.5 inches to 15.3 inches.  The mean weight of these trout were 0.9 pounds in the gill nets and 0.6 pounds in the trap nets.  In addition to the rainbow trout, two splake were sampled from the 1992 stocking.  Both of the splake were 17.6 inches and each weighed 1.9 pounds.     Several warmwater fish species have also been sampled in this pit.  This assessment sampled creek chubs, common shiner, green sunfish, white sucker and northern redbelly dace.  Black crappies, which were sampled in the past, were not sampled in this assessment.         </p>",

Iron Range Resource and Rehabilitation Board has contracted with a private vendor to stock yearling Rainbow Trout semiannually since 1997.  The 2014 management plan goal was to have a gill net catch rate for Rainbow Trout to exceed 1.5/net with 75% greater than 12 inches and at least two year classes present.  Brown Trout were listed as a secondary management species despite never being stocked. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout has been the only species stocked since the last survey, including the spring.  Despite the stocking effort, only one trout was caught, similar to the previous survey.  The absence of trout indicates poor survival.  Competition is likely limiting trout abundance and will likely impact future management. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Smelt were first recorded during the previous survey.  One small mesh gill net, targeting smelt, caught 58.  Down from the previous survey that caught 183.  Lengths ranged from 4.4 to 7.3 inches with an average length of 5.2 inches, suggesting multiple ages present. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches for Green Sunfish have steadily increased.  The catch was 76.5/trap net, over double the previous survey (30.8/net).  Lengths ranged from 2.4 to 7.8 inches.  Green Sunfish were caught in all four gear types; standard gill net, small mesh gill net, near-shore trap net and wire-mesh minnow trap. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker was the only other species captured. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>There are several non-salmonid species present in this mine pit.  White suckers, black crappies, and green sunfish were found during this assessment.  All fish of these species were determined to be less than age 5.  Most white suckers were age 3 fish which had slow growth rates.  All black crappies were young of year, no annulus found on scales, and their average length at capture, 2.6 inches, indicates an above average growth rate for their first year.The present rainbow trout population is predominately yearling age 1 fish that were stocked this last spring (5/1989).  This assumption is determined from scale examinations and the length frequency distribution of 19 fish caught during this study.  All fish in the sample had one annulus.  The question arises about whether this annulus was formed before or after stocking.  The fish were approximately 7.8 inches long when it was formed, indicating that the first annulus formation occurred while growing in outdoor ponds at the state trout hatchery at Lanesboro, MN.  According to stocking records, the average length of any lot of stocked rainbows was about ten inches or larger thus dismissing the chance that the one annulus found on the sample fish were formed after being stocked in the mine pit.  If all the rainbow trout in our smaple were from the 5/1989 stocking the question arises about what happened to fish stocked in previous years.  Heavy angling pressure and high harvest rates are suspected although no creel census data is available.  The small sample makes growth inconclusive but indications from the weight of all the fish in the sample suggests that the fish grew quite slow from the time when they were stocked to the date when captured.  Brook trout are still present in the mine pit from three previous stockings on 11/1987, 5/1988, and 9/1988.  Growth estimations were not practical for this species due to small size of sample (2 fish), varying size rates between lots of stocked fish, and inadequate ageing method for this species of fish (small scales).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Judson Mine Pit is an 18-acre pit located just out side the City of Buhl, MN.   The pit has a maximum depth of 64 ft and a littoral area of 3 acres.  Judson Mine Pit is in lake class 4 and has a walk down access with a fishing platform on the northwest shore.  Iron Range Resources (IRR) has been the lead agency for a long-term reclamation project that has included reshaping the pit walls and planting the erodible slopes with trees and grasses.  As part of this reclamation project, IRR has been stocking the pit with 600 yearling rainbows, twice annually in the spring and fall. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout catch in gill nets was 1.1/net, which was lower than the 2000 gill net catch of 2.6/net.  The 2000 catch rate was higher than expected because the fall stocking of rainbow trout occurred 3 weeks prior to the assessment.  No rainbow trout were sampled in trap nets in 2006.  Rainbow trout varied in length from 13 to 15 inches and were most likely fish stocked in the spring of 2006.  The absence of larger fish indicates poor over winter survival or high angler harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled a high number of green sunfish with a catch rate of 25.6/net compared to 6.3/net in the 2000 assessment.  Gill nets also sampled 9.0 white sucker/net, which was similar to the 2000 catch rate of 12.8/net.  Baited minnow traps sampled moderate number of blacknose shiners and fathead minnows. <br> \n <br> \nMine pits are rather sterile environments with limited littoral habitat and prey resources.  The increasing abundance of green sunfish is a concern, because they likely compete with rainbow trout for limited prey. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
