Walleye, largemouth bass and northern pike had been stocked until 1973.The lake is predominantly a centrarchid lake but does have a self-sustaining population of walleye.  The numbers sampled in this assessment were below the first quartile of 0.6/gillnet.The centrarchid species were sampled between the first and third quartile but were not abundant.  Largemouth bass were sampled for the first time in this assessment, but only four individuals were captured.Northern pike have never been abundant and were captured at 2.0/gillnet, below the first quartile in this 1992 assessment.  Mean weight of the northern pike sampled was 2.0 lbs.The population reflects a rather infertile centrarchid lake.  None of the fish species present have been sampled in high numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anderson Lake is a walleye-centrarchid lake located about 10 miles southeast of Bigfork, MN.  The lake has 274 acres, a maximum depth of 110 feet and a Secchi disk reading of 9 feet.       Stocking of walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass has occurred only a few times since 1930.  No fish have been stocked since 1973.     The northern pike population is characterized by low numbers (1.7/gill net) of small fish.  The mean weight of those sampled in the gill net was 1.4 pounds.  Age 2-4 fish made up 90% of the catch.  Growth was within 15% of the statewide averages.      The walleye population appears to have improved over the past years, entirely from natural reproduction.  No walleye stocking has occurred since 1958.  In this survey, walleye were sampled at 2.5/gill net.  The walleye sampled ranged in length from 7.4 to 18.2 inches and had a mean length of 14.2 inches.  They had a mean weight of 0.9 pounds.  Seven year classes were represented in the testnetting.  In addition to the walleye sampled in the testnetting, many were observed during the bass electrofishing portion of the survey in mid-June.  Three and four year old walleye made up 57% of the catch.        Few bass were sampled in this assessment.  Only one largemouth bass was sampled in the testnetting and only one in the bass electrofishing survey in June.  Smallmouth bass, never before observed in Anderson Lake, were sampled in this survey.  Only one was sampled in the gill net and one in the electrofishing survey.     Black crappie were sampled in the trap net at 1.1/set but none were sampled in the gill nets.  They were of quality size as indicated by a PSD of 100 and an RSD-P of 70.  They ranged in length from 8.1 to 12.6 inches and had a mean length of 10.8 inches. Growth was excellent.             Bluegill were sampled in low numbers at 0.3/gill net and only 1.9/trap net. Both were well below the 1st quartile for this lake class. Those sampled in the trap net ranged in length from 3.5 to 9.9 inches and had a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Similar to bluegill, growth was excellent.      Yellow perch were sampled near the lake class 1st quartile at 2.0/gill net.             Other species sampled in this survey were rock bass, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullhead.    </p>",
