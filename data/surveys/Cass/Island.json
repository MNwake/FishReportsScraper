                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake (DOW# 11-0102; Lake Class 23) is a 358-acre lake located near Longville, MN. There is county owned public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 55. Island Lake has 5.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Island Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake has a game fish community that is dominated by Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike. The average Largemouth Bass in the 2014 sample was just over 12 with fish up to 16 inches. Most Bluegills sampled were between 6 to 8 inches. Northern Pike numbers are similar as to past years, with Pike up to 30 inches present. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie,  Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Island Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 277 acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet.  It is located three miles south and seven miles east of Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources hasclassified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Island Lake is in lake class 23.  Approximately 21% of the lake is fifteen feet orless in depth. There is a DNR public access on the west shore on township road 55.Northern pike abundance was above previous survey findings and what is typically found in lake class 23 lakes.  NOP sampled ranged in length from 10.5 to 29 inches with a mean length andweight of 16.6 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Approximately 67% of the sampled fish were age two and three.  Natural reproduction was consistent with seven different year class present in the sample. There is ample spawning habitat for northern pike in Island Lake especially in the shallow marshy areas on the west, northwest, and south shores.  There are also inlets and an outlet that are possibly being used for spawning.Walleye abundance for 1997 was typical of previous surveys and of other lake class 23 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 12.5 to 28.0 inches with a mean length and weight of 19.7 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Forty-four percent of the sampled walleye were 20 inches or longer.  Island Lake has a good reputation for quality-sized fish.  All walleye are from natural reproduction.  Walleye grow well with an age four walleye averaging 17 inches long.Forty largemouth bass were sampled that ranged in length from 5 to 20 inches.  The average length and weight were 13.3 inches and 1.35 pounds.  There was excellent natural reproduction with ten different year classes present in the sample.  Growth was good with an age five fish being 13.6 inches in length.Bluegill abundance was typical of previous surveys on Island Lake as well as other lake class 23 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 3.3 to 8.7 inches with an average length and weight of 5.7 inches and 0.15 pound.  Forty-six percent of the sampled bluegill were seven inches or longer.  When looking at bluegill information in 1962, there appears to be no change in quality of bluegill. Growth was slow with an age five fish measuring four inches in length.  The statewide average for lake class 23 lakes is five inches.Black crappie ranged in length from 4.3 to 12.7 inches with an average length and weight of 8.2 inches and 0.3 pound.  Natural reproduction was consistent with many different year classespresent in the sample.  Growth was good with an age three fish averaging 7.5 inches long.Other fish sampled were  white sucker, rock bass , yellow and brown bullhead, bowfin, and pumpkinseed sunfish.The number of lake homes  nearly doubled from 1968 to 1992 In 1992, 25 lake homes were counted . To help maintain quality fish populations in Island Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Island Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality. Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fishpopulation and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 277-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 4.44 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  There is a county owned public access on the southwest shore off of County Road 55.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Island Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are very deep and very clear lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and largemouth bass and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch.    Northern pike are present in Island Lake with fish up to 29 inches sampled.  The northern pike mean length for the fish sampled was 19 inches.  Largemouth bass are present in Island Lake with fish up to 18 inches sampled.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Island Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 358-acre lake with 5.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet located southeast of Longville, MN. A county owned public access is located on the west shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Island Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally deep and clear. Other area lakes in this class include Jack, Ponto, Stony, and Baby Lake. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity and a game fish community dominated by sunfish and Northern Pike. Though Northern Pike abundance was below the management goal, size goals were met in 2022 highlighting quality size structure. Sampled pike ranged in length from 10 to 34 inches. Black Crappie abundance and size exceeded management goals and ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches. Largemouth Bass averaged 12 inches long and abundance was low. Sampled Bluegill exceeded size goals with fish measuring up to 9.5 inches and most exceeding 6 inches in length. Walleye abundance in Island is low and lengths ranged from 13 to 24 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Island Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
