THERE IS A MODERATE POPULATION OF LARGE WALLEYES PRESENT AND A FAIR POPULATION OF NORTHERN PIKE, THE PREDATOR POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN MAINTAIND THROUGH STOCKING. BLACK CRAPPIE AND BLUEGILLS ARE EXPERIENCING POOR RECRUITMENT, WHICH PROBABLY RE- FLECT THE UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS (BULLHEADS) PRE- SENT.

BLC ARE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 48.25/ TRAP NET AND 63.00/GILL NET.  THE MEDIAN LENGTH IS ABOUT 5.5 INCHES COMPARED TO 4.2 INCHES IN 1991. BLC ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 1 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT.  GROWTH IS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE STATE MEDIAN OF 6.9 AND 8.8 INCHES AT AGES 3 AND 4 RESPECTIVELY.  BLG REMAIN ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 190.00/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 167.00/TRAP NET IN 1991.  THE MEDIAN IS 6.0 INCHES FOR BLG COMPARED TO 3.2 INCHES IN 1991.  BLG ARE REPRESENTED BY THREE STRONG AGE CLASSES; 2-4.  GROWTH IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE STATE AVERAGE OF 6.7 INCHES AT AGE 4.  OBSERVED AGES OF BLC AND BLG SEEM INCONSISTENT WITH THE 1991 POPULATION ASSESSMENT DATA.  498 OF 503 BLG COLLECTED IN 1991 WERE ASSIGNED TO THE 1990 YEAR CLASS AND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE UNIMODAL 1992 SAMPLE CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF 1990- COHORT FISH.  THE OBSERVED MEAN LENGTH OF 5.9 INCHES SEEMS REASONABLE AFTER ALMOST THREE GROWING SEASONS IN A POST-RECLAMATION SITUATION. SIMILARLY FOR BLC, 50 OF 52 4-INCH FISH OBSERVED IN 1991 WERE ASSIGNED TO THE 1990 COHORT AND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE 1992 SAMPLE CONSISTS IN LARGE PART OF 1990- AND 1991-COHORT FISH, WITH MODAL LENGTHS AT 5.7 AND 8.2 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY. THESE OBSERVATIONS APPEAR TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STOCKING HISTORY FOR THESE TWO SPECIES:  100 BLG AND 50 BLC STOCKED IN 1989 DID NOT GENERATE  A 1989 YEAR CLASS, AS NEITHER SPECIES WAS SAMPLED THAT FALL.  6350 ADULT BLG AND 5100 ADULT BLC WERE THEN ADDED IN 1990, APPARENTLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT 1990 YEAR CLASSES OF BOTH SPECIES. NOP ARE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 5.00/GILL NET COMPARED TO 1.66/TRAP NET IN 1991 GILL NETS WEREN'T USED IN 1991).  NOP RANGED FROM 19.0-27.9 INCHES, AND WERE ALL THREE YEAR OLDS.  ALL THE NOP SAMPLED APPEAR TO BE FROM THE FIRST YEAR'S (1989) REPRODUCTION.  NONE OF THE 160 NOP WITH PELVIC CLIPS THAT WERE STOCKED IN 1992 WERE SAMPLED. GROWTH HAS BEEN FAST FOR PIKE AT 20.3 INCHES AT AGE 3, COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 17.7 INCHES.  YEP ARE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 102.00/GILL NET.  AGES 1-3 WERE SAMPLED WITH TWO YEAR OLDS DOMINATING.  GROWTH IS GOOD WITH PERCH AVERAGING 6.8 INCHES AT AGE 2 COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 4.5 INCHES.  TWO CCF CORRESPONDING TO THE 1989 YEARLING STOCKING WERE NETTED.  GROWTH APPEARS GOOD, WITH BOTH FISH 19.0-20.9 INCHES. LMB AVERAGED 15.4/HOUR IN 1992 SPRING ELECTROFISHING.  LMB HAD A PSD OF 80%.  LMB WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN NETTING, WITH 1, 2, 3 AND 5 YEAR OLDS NETTED AND 2 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is located in northern Faribault Co., northeast of Winnebago.  A fishery survey was conducted on Bass Lake in early June 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Both gill and trap net catches in 2002 were comprised primarily of black bullhead, returning to an abundance not recorded since the 1980's.  Black bullhead were 78% of the fish caught in gill nets and were 61% of the weight.  Trap net catches were 98% bullheads numerically and by weight.  Walleye and channel catfish abundance are at their highest level since the reclamation in 1988.  Most walleye were from 18 to 24 inches and channel catfish ranged from 16 to 22 inches.  Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch abundance have all decline from the early 1990's when they were at high levels.  Yellow perch were the second most abundant fish in gill net catches and ranged from 5 to 9 inches.  Northern pike numbers were at moderate levels with most fish around 15 to 20 inches in length.  The best fishing opportunities in Bass Lake are for black bullhead, yellow perch, walleye, channel catfish, and northern pike.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tBass Lake in northern Faribault County is a 203 acre lake located near Delavan. A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake, off 400th Avenue. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Bass Lake is in Lake Class 38; lakes in this class are generally small, shallow, and have stained hard water. <br> \n\tBass lake was the site of a regularly scheduled fisheries survey conducted the week of May 27th 2008. Black bullheads were the most abundant species in gill and trap net catches in 2008. Average weight of black bullhead was large, at greater than one pound per fish in both gill and trap nets. Walleye gillnet catches were the highest in the lakes\u0019 survey history at 8.5 fish per gillnet, in the upper quartile for class 38 lakes.  Also in the upper quartile for walleye gillnet catches was average weight of walleye at 3.6 pounds per fish. 200,000 walleye fry are stocked in even years. Yellow perch abundance was at an all time low. Only three perch were caught in the entire survey.  <br> \n\tBluegill and black crappie abundance was low. Eight bluegill were caught in both gill and trap nets. Five black crappie were caught in the gill nets, and only one of the nine trap nets held all fourteen black crappie. While crappie abundance was poor, average size of trap netted crappies was exceptional at 1.17 pounds per fish. One twenty-inch largemouth bass was taught in one of the trap nets. Largemouth bass are not well sampled in test netting. Centrarchids (bluegill, crappie, and bass) appear to be experiencing poor recruitment due to unfavorable conditions of abundant black bullheads and a lack of aquatic macrophytes. <br> \n\tNorthern pike abundance remains fair. Pike gillnet catches averaged 3.25 fish per net. Average weight was close to three pounds. Pike fry are stocked annually into a 50-acre CREP wetland on the southwest side of the lake.  <br> \n\tChannel catfish catches declined from the 2002 survey average of 6.0 catfish per gill net to 0.5 catfish per gill net. Catfish are not well sampled in test netting. 10,000 channel catfish fingerlings are stocked annually into the lake.  <br> \n\tWater clarity is poor for most of the summer due to algal blooms. Aquatic vegetation is limited by sunlight penetration for much of the summer due to these blooms, and plant species richness is poor. Much of the shoreline is developed, except for where 400th Avenue follows the shoreline in the northeast corner and where shorelines are too steep for building. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Bass Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a 203 acre lake located in Faribault County northwest of the city of Delavan.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake, just off 400th Avenue.  Bass Lake is a small basin with a maximum depth of 20 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nBass Lake was surveyed the week of June 3, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  This survey consisted of deploying trap nets, gill nets, and electrofishing to monitor the fish community.  Although black bullhead was the most abundant fish species in the survey, total numbers were at moderate levels.  Trap and gill net catches averaged 4 and 9 fish per net, respectively.  Black bullheads from Bass Lake were large, averaging over 13 inches in length and over 1.25 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall panfish (black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch) abundances have recently been lower than historic levels. Black crappie abundance was low at the time of the 2013 survey.  Only 1 fish was sampled between both net types and was over 11 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance was also low, with only 2 fish collected throughout the survey.  Yellow perch, which historically have had high abundance in Bass Lake, were non-existent in the 2013 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe behavioral and physical characteristics of largemouth bass make them difficult to capture in nets.  Thus, electrofishing was the most effective method to assess the largemouth bass population.  While the nets in this survey didn't catch any largemouth bass, electrofishing sampled 41 fish per hour.  No stocking plan exists for largemouth bass, so the Bass Lake population is maintained by natural reproduction.  Largemouth bass sampled in 2013 ranged from 3 to 9 years old and averaged over 16 inches in length (2.5 lbs), making Bass Lake one of the highest quality largemouth bass populations in the area.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike fry are stocked annually in Bass Lake, which apparently maintains the population successfully.  In 2013, gill nets produced an average of 5 northern pike per net lift.  These fish averaged almost 22 inches in length and weighed over 2 pounds per fish.  Most northern pike were from the 2011 year class, when 26,700 fry were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance remained high in Bass Lake.  The 2013 survey yielded nearly 5 fish per gill net, which is above average for similar lakes in the area.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10 to 25 inches with an average over 18 inches.  Most of the walleye sampled from this survey were from the 2012 year class, when 218,000 fry were stocked.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at Bass Lake to sustain the population.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish collected in this survey in low numbers included common carp, yellow bullhead, and channel catfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners can contribute to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a 203-acre lake located in Faribault County northwest of the city of Delavan.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake, just off 400th Avenue.  Bass Lake is a small basin with a maximum depth of 20 feet. <br> \n  <br> \nA standard survey was performed the week of June 11, 2018 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR). A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey consisted of trap nets, gill nets, and electrofishing to monitor the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nBass Lake has historically produced low numbers of medium sized Black Crappies. Black Crappie in 2018 were sampled at a rate of 16.3/trap net. Black Crappie were also sampled well with gill nets, and were captured at a rate of 18.0/gill net. Black Crappie scales and otoliths were used to estimate age and indicated the presence of 4 year classes in the Bass Lake sample (2014-2017). Age-3 (2015 year class) Black Crappies were the most abundant, accounting for 36% of Black Crappies sampled. Black Crappie size structure was small, indicative of a population dominated by young fish. Black Crappie ranged from 4.0 to 11.2 inches and averaged 6.9 inches in trap nets.  Gill nets sampled slightly larger Black Crappies that ranged from 4.1 to 10.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled at a rate of 23.4/trap net in 2018. Which was higher than the median (15.9/trap net) for similar lakes. Bluegills ranged from 2.7 to 8.8 inches in length and averaged 6.5 inches in 2018. Only four year classes of Bluegill were sampled in 2018. The majority of Bluegills aged (67%) were from the 2015 year class (age-3).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Bass lake have historically occurred at low numbers (4.3/gillnet).  In 2018 Walleye were at an all-time high of 13.0/gillnet.  Walleye ages were estimated using scales and otoliths. Six year classes of walleye were present (2004, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016). Walleye in Bass Lake were large and ranged from 16.0 to 27.2 inches while averaging 20.3 inches in gill nets. Walleye growth was fast in Bass Lake as fish averaged 17.0 inches at age-2 and 19.8 inches at age-4. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were assessed using day-time electrofishing. Relative abundance of Largemouth Bass was 68.2/hour. Average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2018 was 11.2 inches and ranged from 4.3 to 19.4 inches.  Two primary length groups were sampled in 2018, 31 fish were between 4.3 and 7.0 inches and 41 were captured between 13.0 inches and 19.4 inches.  Scales were used to estimate ages of Largemouth Bass, seven age classes were sampled (2009, 2011-2014, 2016, and 2017).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically had a moderate abundance in Bass Lake, and the trend continued in 2018 with a catch rate of 5.3/gill net. Northern Pike sampled with gill nets ranged from 20.1 to 30.9 inches in length and averaged 25.6 inches. Sixty-seven percent of Northern Pike sampled in 2018 were greater than the 24-inch minimum length limit. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect at Bass Lake. Anglers are allowed 2 fish which must be at least 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch catch rate was 23.5/gill net.  Yellow Perch exhibited fair size structure, but had no fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.6 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThree Channel Catfish were sampled in gillnets during the 2018 survey.  These fish ranged from 20.0 to 30.8 inches in length.  Pectoral spines were taken from the fish for aging purposes.  Two of the fish were from the 2014 year class and one was from the 2010 year class. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp and Yellow Bullheads were also present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, specialist <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Black crappie and yellow perch populations are presently low, with few fish in the 6-8 inch range.  However, good numbers of smaller fish for both species will provide quality fishing in the next 2-3 years.  Bluegill are abundant, with a moderate number of fish between 6-9 inches.  Strong numbers of young fish are moving into this size range.  Channel catfish were not sampled in 1996, but angler reports indicate fish above 10 pounds are present.  Largemouth bass over 3 pounds can be caught.</p>",
