                "narrative": "<p>Wanless Lake is a moderately soft-water lake, having a total area of 74.7 acres, a maximum depth of 16 feet, and a median depth of 4 feet. It is located near the east boundary of the Kawishiwi River Watershed, and is part of the Dumbbell River system.     An inlet from swamp drainage is present on the south shore, and an outlet to Greenwing Lake is present on the northeast shore. A beaver dam on the outlet prevents any fish movement beyond its location.     Shoal water soils consist of about 60% mixed sand, gravel and rubble, 25% muck, 5% sand and gravel, 5% gravel and rubble, and 5% boulder.     About 80% of the lake's margin is bordered by high ground with coniferous forest, and 20% is bordered by lowland marsh.     A secchi disc reading of 9.5 feet at the time of the survey showed that the lake was quite clear.     Emergent aquatic vegetation was scattered along the shoreline, and waterlilies and submerged aquatic plants ranged from scattered to moderately abundant in various shoal water locations.      Test netting and shoal water seining indicated that the lake supported good populations of Northern Pike, and fair populations of White Suckers and Yellow Perch at the time of the survey, and that natural reproduction of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch was good in 1961.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nWanless Lake is a small lake located approximately 11 miles northeast of Isabella. The lake has a maximum depth of 16 feet, is undeveloped and receives light fishing pressure. The lake can be accessed from a rough, narrow logging road approximately 1 mile from Lake County Rd. #7. There is a carry down access on Federal land suitable for launching canoes and small boats.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Wanless Lake is comprised of northern pike, yellow perch and various minnow species. Fish population assessments in Wanless Lake have historically collected northern pike in relatively high numbers; this was again the case in 2006, as the catch was above average compared to other lakes in this class. Northern pike collected in 2006 averaged 1.7 pounds/fish, which is typical of the size of northern pike collected in previous assessments on this lake. The largest northern pike collected in 2006 was 34.6 inches (9.3 pounds); however, fish this large are uncommon in Wanless Lake. Approximately 50% of the northern pike in this assessment were between 22 and 26 inches, with only one fish larger than 26 inches sampled. Growth of northern pike collected in 2006 was average compared to similar lakes in this class. The northern pike population in Wanless Lake is maintained through natural reproduction and does not require stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch in 2006 was near the low end of the normal range for the lake class and was typical of the net catches in most of the other assessments on this lake. Yellow perch collected in this assessment averaged 6.8 inches (only one fish over 8.0 inches sampled), and most of the fish were too small to interest anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were introduced into Wanless Lake in 2002 to meet the increasing demand for fishing opportunities for this species in the Finland area. The 2006 assessment did not sample any black crappies, and indications are that the stocking may not have been successful.  At this time it has not been determined if future attempts will be made to establish a black crappie population in this lake. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this lake class, with fish up to 27.4 inches (4.4 pounds) taken.  Average size was about a pound and a quarter.  Although northern pike up to 35 inches have been sampled during previous assessments large northern pike are uncommon in Wanless Lake.Yellow perch collected during the 2000 assessment were quite small (averaging about 6.3 inches) and not very abundant.  Only one yellow perch larger than 8 inches was collected during this assessment.Wanless Lake normally does not receive much angling pressure.</p>",

The average size of northern pike sampled in the 1995 survey was approximately 21 inches with 40% of the fish ranging between 23 inches and 27 inches (2.5 pounds to 4.0 pounds). Northern pike in excess of 5 pounds are not common.     Angling by the public has been very low due in part to the access road being under private ownership. In 1995 the U.S. Forest Service acquired ownership of this property allowing the public access to the lake.</p>",

Access is on a rough logging road for 1 mile; northwest from Lake County Road 7, and is suitable for canoe or small boat only.  The lake is surrounded by federal land, the shoreline is in a natural state.Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers in the 2003 assessment, as has been the case in most previous assessments.  The quality of northern pike was fair; they averaged approximately 1.4 pounds.  Fish up to 27.4 inches (4.3 pounds) were sampled, but fish over 3.0 pounds were not common.Yellow perch were sampled in this assessment; however, they were not abundant.  The size was too small to interest anglers.Black crappie were introduced into Wanless Lake in 2000.  Although it is too early to tell if a self-sustaining population will result from the initial stocking, the failure to sample any fish from that stocking is not encouraging.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>On May 29, 2013 a special assessment was performed using trap nets to assess the mid-range objective in the Lake Management Plan of determining survival and reproductive success of stocked Black Crappie.  In late October 2002, 295 Black Crappie fingerlings were stocked, however; stocking records indicate that fish were weak and some mortality was noted.  Population assessments performed in 2003 and 2006 using gill nets, trap nets and quarter inch mesh trap nets did not sample any Black Crappie.  Once again in this assessment, no Black Crappie sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nWanless Lake is categorized as a lake class 12 lake, is 78 acres, 99% littoral with a maximum depth of 16 feet and Secchi disc reading of 9.3 feet in brown stained water.  The lake is located 10 miles east and 4 miles north of Isabella near Lake County Hwy 7.  The access is a 0.5 mile trail, (FS 171K) then a 25 foot carry-in trail to the lake.  The trail is somewhat narrow and brushy with some boulders present but is suitable for 4x4 pickup trucks and SUV type of vehicles. There is a small turn around area and an old dock is present.  The carry-in trail is wide enough to push a small trailer to the lake and is suitable for canoes and small boats. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 Northern Pike catch in 10 trap nets was 1.8/lift with a mean weight of 1.73 pounds.  Due to the fact that no gill nets were set, and this assessment was performed early rather than mid-summer, no comparisons to past catches were made. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker catch was 12.9/lift with a mean weight of 2.7 pounds. Quarter inch mesh trap nets sampled Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pearl Dace and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
