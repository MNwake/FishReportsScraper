Pumpkinseed sunfish were relatively abundant for this type of lake, but the average length was only 4.7 inches. Green and hybrid sunfish were also sampled but in very low numbers.Both black and white crappies were captured during this survey. Black crappies were moderately abundant but were small. The average length of gillnet and trapnet black crappies was 5.2 inches and 5.4 inches respectively. Only 4.8% of the black crappies measured in both gear types exceeded 8 inches. One white crappie measuring 11.5 inches and weighing 0.66 pounds was sampled.Largemouth bass, while not targeted, were also sampled. The average size was 14.3 inches and 1.6 pounds. Two walleyes were also captured. The number of walleyes present in the lake is below average for this type of lake. These fish were a result of the 1987 stocking done by the lake association.Northern pike were found to be abundant. The average size sampled was 23.3 inches and 2.8 pounds. Over 20% of the northern pike measured were over 25 inches. Carp were found for the first time by DNR fisheries crews in 1996. The number per gillnet set fell in the range considered average for this type of lake. Black bullheads were also found in normal abundance. Only one yellow bullhead was sampled during the survey.Three forage species, yellow perch, white suckers, and golden shiners were sampled in low abundance.</p>",

BLG HAD A MEDIAN SIZE IN THE 6.0 - 6.4 INCH TOTAL LENGTH RANGE AND A PSD OF 86.4% BLG CATCH RATES GREATLY EXCEEDED STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS.  BLB WERE ABUNDANT, BUT SMALL IN SIZE, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 7.0 - 7.4 INCHES AND A RATE OF 5.2 FISH PER POUND.  CATCH RATES EXCEEDED STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR BOTH GEARS BY A FACTOR OF THIRTEEN OR MORE.  GOS AND WTS WERE PRESENT IN NUMBERS FIVE AND SIX TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL NETS.  HSF, PMK, AND BLC WERE SAMPLED AT FOUR TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN LEVEL FOR TRAP NETS.  BLC WERE SMALL, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 7.0 - 7.4 INCHES, ONLY TWO FISH LONGER THAN 7.9 INCHES AND A RATE OF 5.9 FISH PER POUND.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN THE SURVEY WERE NOP, YEB AND BRB, CCF, GSF, LMB, YEP, AND WAE.  THE LAKE ASSOCIATION FOR GLEASON LAKE STOCKED YEARLING NOP, LMB, AND WAE IN APRIL 1987.  THEY ALSO STOCKED 5 - 7 INCH CCF AT THE SAME TIME.  THREE OF THE SEVEN NOP CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY WERE THE SAME AGE-CLASS AS THE STOCKED FISH (V+), THREE WERE OLDER (VII+) AND ONE WAS YOUNGER (IV+).  NO LMB FROM THE SAME AGE- CLASS (V+) AS THE STOCKED FISH WERE SAMPLED. THREE AGE V+ AND THREE AGE IV+ WAE WERE ALSO SAMPLED.</p>",
