The lake is located 13 miles north of Duluth, Minnesota off Highway #44 on County Road #272.  The lake has a carry-down access located along the southwest shore.  A population assessment (trapnets only) was conducted during the late fall of 2009 to update information on fish populations.  Late fall trapnetting was adopted as the primary sampling gear in 1999 as a means to limit mortality of stocked rainbow trout. <br> \n <br> \nBriar has been managed as a put-and-take rainbow trout fishery with annual yearling stocking of approximately 75 per surface acre (5,250) since 1958.  Additionally, since 2003, surplus rainbow trout age-1 or older have been stocked into Briar Lake at a rate of up to 25 fish per surface acre when available.  Rainbow trout trapnet abundance of 4.3 per lift was greater than 1999 (2.0).  Rainbow trout mean length of 9.6 inches was less than 1999 (11.2).  Age analysis revealed that all but three of the 39 trout sampled in 2009 were age-1.  The three older trout sampled in 2009 were age-2.  Mean length of age-2 trout was 13.4 inches.  Similarly, age analysis from the 1999 assessment revealed that all but one of 12 sampled trout were age-1.  The only older trout was age-2 with a length of approximately 14.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, golden shiner and white sucker.  Black bullhead trapnet abundance of 5.6 per lift was greater than 1999 (3.3) but still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  White sucker trapnet CPUE of 7.2 per lift was greater than 1999 (1.7) and had risen to what was considered above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.   <br> \n</p>",

The rate at time of stocking was 4.5 per pound, which was smaller than yearlings stocked in previous years.  Rainbow trout catch rates for both gill and trapnets were higher than any previous sample.  this may be a result of low angler harvest during the summer.  One landowner reported that fishing was slow during the summer of 1994.  The greater abundance of trout in Briar Lake prior to the winter of 1994-95 may translate into higher angler catch rates during the winter angling season.  Mild winter conditions may allow for more rainbows to reach age 2+.</p>",
