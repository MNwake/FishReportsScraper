                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have shallow shorelines.  Colby Lake is larger, has a more complex shoreline shape, and has softer (less mineralized) and more bog-stained water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Colby Lake was thermally stratified on 07/06/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 58 F.  Colby Lake has inlets from the Partridge River, Wyman Creek, and Whitewater Lake.  There is a coal fired electrical generating plant on Colby Lake with a fish screen in front of the cooling water intake.  The power plant discharge goes into a long narrow arm of the lake that leads to the outlet - the Partridge River.  Lake shoal substrates are 31% sand, 23% boulder, 20% gravel, 16% muck, 9% rubble, and 1% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft; watershield is the most common plant.  There are six homes and a public access on the lake.The 2000 fish population assessment was conducted in early to mid July and consisted of nine gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Seven previous fisheries lake surveys and fish population assessments, dating back to 1968, consisted of 3-12 gillnet sets and 4-10 trapnet sets and were all done in mid August or early September except for 1995 when trapnetting was done in mid July.  Shoreline seining was done during the lake surveys in 1968 and 1985.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 15.1 fish/net (10.7 lb/net) was at the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 12.8 fish/net (10.8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Yellow perch numbers were higher in 2000 and walleye numbers were lower.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 31.2 fish/net (11.1 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 16.5 fish/net (13.2 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish were caught in 2000 than in previous investigations, which could be partially due to the earlier trapnetting date in 2000 than in most previous investigations.  Catches of other fish species in the trapnets in 2000, however, were similar to previous trapnettings.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, followed by northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Other species were present in low numbers.Bluegill numbers in 2000 (24.8/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were much higher than the median catch of 5.5/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  The next highest catch of bluegill in Colby Lake was 8.7/gillnet, in mid July of 1995.  Bluegill sizes in 2000 averaged 5.1\" (0.11 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest bluegill was 8.0\".  Most bluegill were ages two and three, from the 1998 and 1997 year classes.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (2.1/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 21.3\" (2.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 34.1\".  Pike scales were difficult to read and no generalization can be made about pike growth rates.Yellow perch numbers in 2000 (7.9/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2000 averaged 6.4\" (0.12 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch (caught in a trapnet) was 10.5\".  Most perch were ages three and four, from the 1997 and 1996 year classes.  Perch scales were difficult to read, but growth appeared to be normal for area lakes.Walleye numbers in 2000 (0.9/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 1.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 14.3\" (0.9 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye (caught in a trapnet) was 17.6\".  Walleye growth was normal for area lakes.Many of the northern pike examined in 2000 had neascus, and many of the yellow perch had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are parasites that are common and native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is a 514-acre lake with a maximum depth of 30 feet located at Hoyt Lakes in eastern St. Louis County.  Based on physical and chemical characteristics, Colby, along with 48 other northeastern Minnesota lakes, is categorized in lake class 11.  Typically, lakes in this class are small in size (mean = 161 acres), moderately deep (mean = 30 feet) and have a high percentage of littoral area (mean = 63%).  The lake is used as a water source for the Laskin coal powered electrical plant owned by Minnesota Power.  There is a fish screen on the water intake in the main part of the lake preventing fish from entering the plant.  There is a Minnesota Department of Health consumption advisory for fish In Colby Lake due to higher levels of mercury.  Go to the www.mndnr.gov  website and Lakefinder to view guidelines for consumption of fish on Colby Lake. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish, by weight, were the most abundant fish sampled in 2010.  Catfish sampled ranged in length from 11.5 to 28.1 inches with an average of 20.4 inches.  Catfish are not normally sampled in lake class 11.   <br> \n <br> \nThere is a low-density, quality-sized population of northern pike in Colby Lake.  In 2010, pike sampled ranged in length from 21.0 inches to 32.7 inches with an average of 25.0 inches.  This was the highest average length of any assessment conducted on Colby Lake.  Because there are few pike in the lake, anglers should practice selective harvest.  Keep the small pike for eating, but release the bigger mature spawners.  This practice will help maintain a quality size structure and protect spawning pike. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species present in Colby include bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Bluegill up to 8 inches and crappie up to 10 inches in length were sampled in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Colby Lake has been highly variable.  Colby Lake has a long and varied history of walleye stocking with limited success.  Both fry and fingerling stocking has been attempted, but stocked year classes were generally no stronger than non-stocked year classes.  For this reason, stocking was discontinued.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is fairly shallow (30') and has a high proportion of shoal area less than 15' deep.  It differs from the other lakes in its ecological lake class in that it is larger, has lower water clarity, and is less chemically fertile.  Colby Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen below 14'.  The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the 1995 gillnet catch was lower than average for this lake class.  Catches of fish in gillnets and trapnets dating back to 1968 have been very stable in Colby Lake.Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by bluegill sunfish and northern pike.  Bluegill numbers were average for this lake class, but bluegill sizes were above average: the average bluegill size was 7.5\" and 37 percent were larger than 8.0\".  Most bluegill were age four or older, reflecting poor reproduction during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill growth was average through age 4, then became faster than average.Northern pike numbers were average for this lake class.  The average size of pike was small (17.8\"); the largest pike captured was 34\".  Many northern pike and bluegill had \"black spot\", otherwise known as Neascus, in the skin.  Neascus is a parasite that is harmless to people, is usually removed with the skin, and is killed by cooking.  Other gamefish examined in 1995 were lightly infested with Neascus.Average numbers of shorthead redhorse, white sucker, yellow perch, and walleye were also captured in 1995.  Below average numbers of black crappie were present.  Perch sizes were small.  Walleye growth was average and natural reproduction was fairly consistent from year to year.  Crappie sizes were average; the largest was 10\".Low numbers of bullhead, channel catfish, and rock bass were also present in 1995.  The catfish were good sized, averaging 8.5 pounds each.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have a lot of shallow shoreline area.  Colby Lake is larger, has a more irregular shoreline shape, and has darker (more bog-stained) and softer (less mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Colby Lake ranks as mesotrophic, according to the amount of chlorophyll and phosphorus in the water.    Colby Lake is used as a water source for the Laskin Energy Center coal powered electrical plant owned by Minnesota Power.  The power plant intake is on the main part of the lake and has a fish screen.  The outlet is on the other side of a long point, in the channel where the Partridge River exits the lake.  Colby Lake was also used as a water source by the Erie Mining Company (later LTV) taconite plant to the north.  Adjacent Whitewater Lake was impounded in the 1950's by Erie Mining Company, to be used as a back up water source for Colby Lake when water levels in the Partridge River were low.  In operation, water would flow through a channel from Colby Lake to Whitewater Lake during the spring runoff, then be pumped back into Colby Lake when needed.  This system was never used as much as expected, as 30+ foot fluctuations in the water level of Whitewater Lake were anticipated, but never realized.  Water levels on Colby Lake had annual fluctuations averaging 3.3 ft from 1999 through 2001, and were similar to water levels recorded from 1939 through 1980. Colby Lake was thermally stratified on 7/11/2005 with a surface temperature of 81 F and a bottom temperature of 55 F in the central portion of the lake.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 57 F.  Very high surface temperatures were recorded near the power plant outlet (101 F) and further upstream (100 F) near Benchmark 2.  The summer of 2005 was very dry, with very low flows in the Partridge River when oxygen and temperature profiles were done on 7/11/2005.  It is likely that some of the warm power plant effluent was cycling back around to the main lake basin towards the power plant intake, as there was hardly any flow in the Partridge River at the outlet.  It should be noted that the inlet and outlet stream flows were measured on 7/15/2005, after a rainstorm the previous day had replenished water levels somewhat.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Colby Lake are mostly boulder and rubble, with lower amounts of gravel, sand, and silt.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 6 ft and are moderate in abundance.  Water lilies, potamogetons, water shield, and algae are the most common plants.  Curly-leaf pondweed, a non-native plant, was found in several locations on the west end of the lake.  Also found, while shoreline seining along the southeast shoreline, was the empty shell of a Chinese mystery snail.Colby Lake has a public access with a concrete boat ramp on the south shore.  There is a public park and swimming beach to the northeast of the public access.  There were 20 private homes or cabins on Colby Lake in 2005, up from six in 1985 and three in 1968.  The private dwellings on Colby Lake are along the southeast and west shores; most of the shoreline (about 75 percent) is owned by Minnesota Power, much of this shoreline was acquired by Minnesota Power from the bankrupt LTV Taconite operation around 2003.The 2005 fisheries lake survey was conducted in mid July and used nine gillnets, nine trapnets, and shoreline seining to sample fish populations.  Previous fisheries investigations on Colby Lake were two fisheries lake surveys (1968, 1985) and seven fish population assessments; each of these investigations used 3-12 gillnets and 4-10 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was done during the two previous surveys.  These investigations show that fish populations have generally been low, but that bluegill sunfish catches have recently increased.  Fish populations in 2005 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, northern pike, black crappie, channel catfish, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Largemouth bass may be more abundant than indicated in this survey, as bass are known to be \"net-shy\" and difficult to catch in standard sampling nets.  Bluegill catches in the first seven investigations on Colby Lake, from 1968 through 1995, averaged 4.6/trapnet; all of these investigations were done in late August or early September when bluegill are less likely to be caught in trapnets.  Trapnetting was moved to early July in 2000 and 2005, and the bluegill catches in these investigations (24.8/trapnet and 26.7/trapnet, respectively) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  We do not know if the increase in bluegill catches on Colby Lake mean the population has increased or is just a result of changing the sampling dates to early in the summer.  We have observed increases in bluegill populations in many area lakes in recent years, irrespective of trapnetting dates.  Bluegill sizes in 2005 averaged 6.6\" (0.22 lb), which was near the median for this lake class.  The largest bluegill captured in 2005 was 8.6\".  Many of the bluegill (44 percent) were age four, from the 2001 year class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2005 was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (5.4/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were about twice as high as the highest previous pike catch (2.9/gillnet in 1989).  Pike sizes in 2005 averaged 23.3\" (2.7 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 19.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2005 was 37.6\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike appeared to be well distributed among ages 3-6 and pike growth appeared to be in the normal range by area standards.Black crappie numbers in 2005 (8.9/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median crappie catch of 2.8/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2005 averaged 7.5\" (0.23 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average crappie size of 7.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie captured in 2005 was 9.6\".   Most of the crappie were ages 3-5.  Growth of crappie captured in 2005 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Channel catfish numbers in 2005 (4.4/trapnet) were much higher than the median catch of 0.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake. The reason for the increase in the trapnet catch of catfish in 2005 is not known.  Catfish sizes in 2005 averaged 17.2\" (1.6 lb); the largest catfish was 22.8\".Yellow perch numbers in 2005 (4.2/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median perch catch of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2005 averaged 6.1\" (0.09 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  Perch were the most commonly caught species in the shoreline seines in 2005.Many of the game fish examined in 2005 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Many of the perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Black spot and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect people, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.    </p>",

It is believed that the yellow bullheads found in this survey (they had white barbels) may be the brown bullhead recorded in earlier surveys, pumpkinseeds were captured in the 1968 survey, but not since. </p>",

Fish populations were dominated by northern pike, followed by black crappie, bluegill, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, walleye, and yellow perch. A few rock bass, yellow bullhead, and black bullheads were also caught. The average size of fish of all species was normal for the area. Recruitment of bluegill and walleye is good; crappie recruitment is uneven, a strong 1988 year class dominates the population. Bluegill and black crappie growth is good; walleye growth is unknown due to uncertainty with ageing. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is a 518 acre lake located on the northwest edge of the town of Hoyt Lakes.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp on the lake's south shore, with a large parking area available for 20 plus vehicles with trailers.  This lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and dark brown water.  \n\nColby was thermally stratified on July 14, 2020 with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 55 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 12 feet where the temperature was 68 F.  Colby is heavily influenced by the Partridge River which flows in on the east side and out the northwest end.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and gravel with muck in the bays.  Several residences line the eastern part of the south shore, but overall Colby is largely undeveloped.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 23.0 fish/net which was the highest on record for the lake.  The yield was 32.8 lbs/net, which was also the highest on record.  Both of these values were heavily influenced by record black crappie and channel catfish catches.  Fish species sampled were black crappie, channel catfish, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, shorthead redhorse, largemouth bass, burbot, and bluegill.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 23.4 fish/net which was better than average compared to past surveys on Colby Lake.  Yield was 17.3 lbs/net which was also better than the average of all surveys on the lake.  Brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and rock bass were the additional species sampled in trap nets that weren't also sampled in gill nets.\n\nThe 2020 gill nets sampled 76 channel catfish for a catch rate of 8.4 fish/net.  This catch rate was by far the highest on record for Colby.  The trapnet catch was also impressive at 4.8 fish/net, also the highest on record for the lake.  Lengths ranged from 11 to over 29 inches with an average of 18 inches.  This average length was generally slightly smaller than past surveys, however the largest cat sampled was the second biggest on record for Colby.  Ages ranged from 5 to 22 years with nearly 87% of the catch 8 years old or older.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 2.1 fish/net which was better than the average for Colby Lake, but below average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 13 to nearly 30 inches with an average of 22 inches.  Nine additional pike were caught in trap nets, the largest individual measured over 35 inches.  \n\nFour walleye were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4 fish/net.  This catch rate was below average compared to past surveys on Colby.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 24 inches with an average of 16.5 inches.  The largest walleye captured was 19 years old.  \n\nEighty-nine black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 9.9 fish/net which was very good when compared to similar lakes in the state.  Eighty-six additional crappie were also sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 9.6 fish/net which was by far the highest on record for Colby.  Lengths of the combined catch ranged from 5 to 10 inches with an average of 7.5 inches.  Sizes were similar to past surveys.  Ages ranged from 2 to 14 (N=70) with several strong year classes represented, however growth rates were slow compared to other crappie lakes in the area.  \n\nThree largemouth bass were sampled and ranged from 12.7 to 16.1 inches long. Bass do not net well so likely they are more abundant than they appear from the low numbers in our survey. The bluegill trapnet catch was 3.7 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys on Colby.  Sizes ranged from 6 to 8 inches.  \n</p>",

A playground and swimming beach are also nearby. Most of the development is on the east side. Colby Lake is also used by Minnesota Power for cooling at the Laskin electrical plant on the north side near the outlet. Colby Lake outlets to the Partridge River which joins the St Louis River a few miles downstream. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2015 were sampled with nine trap nets and nine gill nets. Thirteen species of fish were sampled with black crappie and bluegill the only species sampled in above average numbers compared to other similar area lakes. Northern pike and channel catfish were also sampled. Only three walleye were sampled and small yellow perch are present. <br> \n <br> \nColby lake is somewhat unique as it is one of few lakes that have channel catfish in the Tower Fisheries Area. Channel catfish abundance was above  average compared to previous assessments on Colby Lake. Catfish average lengths for gill nets and trap nets were 20.8 inches and 18.5 inches, respectively. The largest catfish sampled was 24.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Crappie were mostly small, averaging 7 inches, although the largest was 10.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was twice the historic average of 6.6/trap net for all surveys on this lake. The average bluegill sampled was 5.9 inches long and about 6 years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 7.8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was higher than the long term average on this lake. Pike were slightly longer at 22.7 inches compared to past averages. Thirty-six percent of the pike sampled were 24 inches or larger and the largest was 30 inches long. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
