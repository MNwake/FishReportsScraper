The lake is in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and access is limited to portages from other lakes.  Northern pike gill-net abundance in 2005 was 4.33 fish/lift, which was below what is found in most class-17 lakes.  Number of northern pike per set was also lower to what was observed during the previous survey (1983).  Six year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 1-11 years.  Total length ranged from 8.6-32.4 inches and the mean was 18.8.  Growth was slow; total length at age-4 was 20.2 inches, which was well below the area average of 23.7.  The mean weight of northern pike captured was similar to what is found in most class-17 lakes.    Walleye gill-net abundance was 2.67 fish/lift, which was well below what is found in most class-17 lakes.  Abundance in 2005 was lower than what was observed in 1983 (3.67 fish/lift).  Five year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 2-8 years.  Total length ranged from 7.1-18.0 inches and the mean was 10.3.  Growth for walleye was below average; total length at age-4 was 11.5 inches, compared to an area mean of of 14.4.  The mean weight of walleye captured was below other class-17 lakes.    Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 2.83 fish/lift, which was well below what is found in most class-17 lakes.  Abundance has decreased considerably since 1983, when 13.33 fish/lift were captured.  Eight year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 3-10 years.  Total length ranged from 5.5-11.3 inches and the mean was 7.9.  Growth was slightly below the area mean.  The mean weight captured was 0.24 pounds, which was similar to what is normally found in most class-17 lakes.     </p>",
