                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugar Bush is a relatively small (222-acre) but productive bass and panfish lake located in north central Becker County.  In addition to bluegills and crappies, several other common fish species are found here.  Northern pike, walleye, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfishes, bullheads (black, brown, and yellow), white sucker, and yellow perch were sampled in 2011.  Spawning habitat is good for all species except walleye in this lake.  The walleye fishery is sustained by stocking. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sugar Bush became part of a walleye fryling stocking research study beginning in 2008.  Frylings were stocked during 2008 and 2010 with scheduled follow up studies three years after each stocking-when walleyes would be most vulnerable to netting gear.  This was the first of those studies and the second will occur in 2013.  The 2008 fryling stocking apparently did not survive in large numbers and the 2010 year class will be more easily judged after the 2013 assessment.  Catch rates for walleye in 2011 were near the middle of the normal range for ecologically similar lakes while catch rates for northern pike were well above the normal range with many young pike (ages two and three).  Walleyes were dominated by age seven fish averaging a relatively large 3.4 pounds and pike were mostly younger than four years averaging just 1.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the walleye and northern pike, other fish species will be more heavily scrutinized during the 2013 assessment, when trap netting and electrofishing are also proposed.  For example, bluegills and black crappies have a history of good growth rates in Little Sugar Bush and future analysis will help to show if that has changed or if overfishing has resulted in smaller panfish in this popular fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugarbush is a small, moderately fertile lake typical of those found in the glacial moraines of the north central hardwood forest ecoregion.  A good deal of its shoreline is still undeveloped making it an attractive lake to those interested in a relatively quiet, natural setting.  The lake harbors a diverse fish community that can provide a variety of angling experiences.Test netting results in 1997 would indicate an increase in abundance in nearly every species sampled, an unusual occurrence.  Northern pike (at 10.8 per gill net) and walleye (4.5 per gill net) were both near the high end of what would normally be expected in a lake of this type.  Northern pike showed a very good size distribution from 10 to 32 inches in length that represented 6 different age classes.  Walleye sizes were also well distributed with an overall average of 17.3 inches in length.  Both northern pike and walleye exhibited above average growth rates that were very likely a product of the bountiful yellow perch supply.Yellow perch and bluegill numbers both appeared to be far above what is considered normal for a lake of this type.  Although growth rates were near normal for these species, the bulk of fish in both populations was small.  The average length of bluegills was 5.5 inches and yellow perch 6.5 inches.  Ninety-one percent of the bluegills were three years old.Standard summer test nets do not sample black crappie or largemouth bass very effectively but modest populations of both species are apparently present in Little Sugarbush Lake.  Anglers have reported good bass fishing at times.  Sixteen black crappies were sampled that ranged from 6.5 to 14.2 inches in length.  Anglers should be attracted by the larger crappies.Little Sugarbush is a small lake and is sensitive to ecological changes.  Shoreland owners should make every effort to use best management practices in order to minimize impacts to the lake.  Avoiding shoreland excavation, establishing native vegetation buffer zones along shore, providing adequate septic systems, and preserving aquatic vegetation like bulrushes and cattails are a few examples of best management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A current northern pike gillnet catch rate of 3.25/GN is below the first quartile for this lake class (#29) and is significantly lower than the 8.75/GN recorded in the 1987 survey.  Past surveys indicate a history of wide fluctuations in northern pike abundance, possibly related to spring water levels and consequent spawning success.  Two and three-year-olds comprise 85% of the northern pike in the current survey, and their growth rate is fast.  Although young, fast growth results in a PSD of 85 for the population, RSD(3)=0.  The fast growth is likely a product of an abundant yellow perch forage base.Black, yellow, and brown bullheads are all present but not abundant, their levels are near the first quartile for this lake class, as they were in 1987.  Bullheads were relatively abundant in the 1970's and harvested by commercial fishermen.  The last commercial harvest occurred in 1978.The bluegill trapnet catch at 59.56/TN is just above the third quartile for this lake class.  It follows an extremely high trapnet catch in the 1987 survey of 104.40/TN.  Bluegills, from low levels in the 1970's, appear to have exploded in abundance in the 1980's, and are now declining somewhat again.  The bulk of the bluegill population consists of two and three-year-olds and the growth rate is slightly below average.  The combined effect has produced a meager PSD=5 and RSD(10)=1.Largemouth bass at 0.44/TN are between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  PSD=25 and RSD(15)=0, but the sample size is small.  Growth rate calculated from the seven fish taken in test nets is normal.  It appears from past surveys that the lake has historically supported a modest largemouth bass population.The trapnet catch for black crappies at 0.44/TN is just below the first quartile value for this lake class.  PSD=33 and RSD(10)=8, but only 12 fish were sampled.  Growth rate appears to be above average.  Trapnet catches for black crappies have been near the first quartile since the early 1970's.The history of the yellow perch population is similar to that of bluegills, fluctuating widely.  The 1970's saw a much lower yellow perch population than today's.  The current gillnet catch rate at 54.00/GN is over double the third quartile value for this lake class.  This abundance of yellow perch provides an excellent forage base for major predators.Walleye fingerling stocking has been successful in establishing and maintaining a walleye population near the third quartile value for this lake class since the mid-1970's.  The current gillnet catch rate of 3.50/GN is just above the third quartile value.  Walleye growth rate is normal.  Age classes present in the current survey indicate some natural reproduction has occurred.  The previous survey found no year classes present other than stocking years.  It appears that walleye fingerling stocking has been the mainstay of the walleye population with an occasional contribution from natural reproduction.  The abundant yellow perch population should provide ample forage for walleyes.Some interesting observations regarding the fluctuating bluegill and yellow perch populations in Little Sugarbush Lake can be made from historical netting data.  Whenever bluegill abundance has been low, yellow perch have also been low, and whenever bluegill abundance has been high, yellow perch have also been high.  This seems contrary to what is observed in most lakes.  Further examination finds that whenever bluegill and yellow perch populations have been low, the bullhead population has been high, and, conversely, whenever bluegills and yellow perch have been high, the bullheads have been low.  One can then speculate that when an abundant bullhead population was present, it served to inhibit bluegill and yellow perch reproduction through predation on eggs and fry.  What might have triggered a reversal of the populations is not apparent.  There is some evidence suggesting that bullhead reduction through commercial harvest may have played a role.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugar Bush is a relatively small (202 acre) but productive lake in north central Becker County.  Despite its size, water quality has remained good due to a largely undeveloped, heavily wooded watershed and extensive bulrush stands.  A mid June 1999 secchi disk reading of 12.2 feet reflects water clarity typical of the area.Another indicator of decent water clarity is the yellow to black bullhead ratio.  Black bullheads are favored by turbid water while yellows prefer clear water.  Consequently, lakes with relatively clear water generally have a yellow to black bullhead ratio of five to one or higher.  Little Sugar Bush Lake's ratio was 31 yellow to one black bullhead in trap net catches.Yellow bullheads were not the only successful fish species in Little Sugar Bush Lake.  Good numbers of northern pike, walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and some black crappie were also found.  Northern pike averaged two pounds each while bluegills averaged about 1/3 pound.  Walleyes were small (averaging 0.9 pounds each) but the size was heavily influenced by a very strong 1996 year class.  This should change as the year class ages, provided fishing pressure doesn't decimate it from the fishery in this small lake.Spawning habitat is very good for all species listed above except walleye.  The walleye population in Little Sugar Bush is essentially a stocked one and is vulnerable to overfishing.  Anglers can help sustain the fish community by releasing mid-sized fish and by stopping well short of their limits when fish are biting.Lakeshore dwellers can help protect water quality, fish populations, and property values by being good stewards of the land.  Some stewardship methods include: (1) not disturbing aquatic vegetation stands (bulrush especially important for water quality and fish production), (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus-free fertilizers, (3) bringing septic systems into compliance with most recent standards, (4) starting and participating in a lake improvement association, and (5) utilizing the practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shore is one of the more beneficial methods shown in this booklet.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugar Bush is a relatively small (202 acre) but productive bass and panfish lake located in north central Becker County.  In addition to the largemouth bass, bluegills, and crappies, several other common fish species are found here.  Northern pike, walleye, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfishes, bullheads (black, brown, and yellow), white sucker, and yellow perch were sampled in 2004.  Spawning habitat is good for all species except walleye in this lake.  The walleye fishery is sustained by stocking.Walleye and northern pike sampled in 2004 averaged just over two pounds each.  Catch rates for walleye were near the high end of the normal range for ecologically similar lakes while catch rates for northern pike were near the low end of the normal range.Little Sugar Bush has a history of producing large bluegills (over 8.0 inches).  Unfortunately, the proportion of large bluegills declined from 20% of the sample in 1999 to just 2% of the sample in 2004.  Only one bluegill over four years of age was found in the 2004 sample.  This is strong indication that large bluegills are harvested as quickly as they reach acceptable sizes (usually about seven inches).  Bluegill growth rates are faster than normal in Little Sugar Bush, but fish can only grow to large sizes if they are not harvested first.  This lake appears to be a good candidate for special bluegill regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Little Sugar Bush Lake was conducted on July 18, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and abundant emergent vegetation fringe to deep water prevented the use of a seine at one sampling site.  Sampling was difficult at several sites due to a substantial fringe of abundant bulrush, water lilies, and wild rice out to deep water.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey will be combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey planned for 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugar Bush is a 221-acre, moderately developed lake located in central Becker County near Richwood, MN.  The lake is surrounded by hardwood forest, marsh, and agricultural land.  It has an average water clarity of 11.9 feet and a maximum depth of 29.0 feet.  Submerged vegetation is common throughout near shore shallow areas.  There are several stands of native vegetation such as bulrush, water lilies, and cattail located in various areas around the lake.  There is an intermittent inlet and outlet located on the 3.6 miles of shoreline.  The 13.7-acre Bullhead Lake Aquatic Management Area (AMA) is located on the eastern shore and a public boat access is located on the south shore.  The lake is located within the White Earth Indian Reservation. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Little Sugar Bush in June 2018 to assess the fish community.  The survey was completed using gill nets and trap nets.  The gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased in 2018 and was near the historical high observed in 1987.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.4 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.    Bluegills greater than 8.0 inches long were sampled.  In order to maintain this balanced population, it is recommended anglers keep smaller Bluegills and release the majority of larger Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance continues to increase and was at a new historic high in 2018.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 17.4 to 34.8 inches and averaged 22.8 inches long.  Nineteen percent of the Northern Pike measured were greater than 24.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has increased since the last survey and was above average for this lake.  Walleye length averaged 17.2 inches and ranged from 9.8 to 26.7 inches.  The Walleye population is sustained by fingerling stocking, since spawning habitat is sparse. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie lengths ranged from 5.5 to 11.5 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  Black Crappie abundance was typical and within the normal range for lakes such as Little Sugar Bush.  Six year classes of Black Crappie were sampled, with the oldest fish being seven years old.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was below average, with perch lengths ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 inches and averaging 6.6 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance decreased to a historic low in 2004, but has started to rebound in recent surveys.  Yellow Perch are a primary forage for many fish species and may be negatively affected by the high abundance of Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was modest and near the historical average for this lake.  The largest Largemouth Bass measured 18.7 inches.  Other species sampled during the survey included Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sugar Bush is infested with Curly-Leaf Pondweed, a known aquatic invasive species (AIS).  Curly-Leaf Pondweed was dense in shallow areas at the time of this survey.  Curly-Leaf Pondweed and other AIS can be transferred from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively impact lakes and aquatic communities.  To avoid spreading AIS to other waters, please follow the current AIS regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Little Sugar Bush is a relatively small (221-acre) but productive Largemouth Bass and panfish lake located in north central Becker County.  In addition to Largemouth Bass, Bluegills and Black Crappies, several other common fish species are found here.  Northern Pike, Walleye, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, bullheads (Black, Brown, and Yellow), White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were sampled in 2013.  Spawning habitat was considered good for all those species except Walleye in this lake.  The Walleye fishery is maintained by stocking. <br> \n   Little Sugar Bush became part of a Walleye fryling stocking research study beginning in 2008.  Frylings were stocked during 2008 and 2010 with scheduled follow up studies three years after each stocking-when Walleyes would be most vulnerable to netting gear.  The first evaluation was done in 2011 and the second in 2013.  The 2008 fryling stocking apparently did not survive in large numbers and the 2010 year class was just slightly better.  Catch rates for Walleye in 2013 were near the middle of the normal range for ecologically similar lakes while catch rates for Northern Pike were well above the normal range with many young pike (ages two, three and four).  Age three Walleyes were most abundant, but older and larger fish were also found with the average sampled Walleye weighing a relatively large 2.8 pounds.  Pike were mostly younger than five years and they averaged just 1.9 pounds and 20 inches long. <br> \n   Little Sugar Bush has a history of relatively fast growth rates for Bluegills and Black Crappies.  Bluegills averaged 7.7 inches and crappies averaged just under 11 inches in 2013.  Bluegills were more abundant than crappies, but good numbers of both were present along with a modest population of Largemouth Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sugar Bush Lake is a 221-acre lake located in central Becker County near the community of Richwood.  The lake is located within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake is moderately developed and surrounded by hardwood forest, marsh, and agricultural land.  Submerged vegetation is common throughout near shore areas.  There are several stands of bulrush, water lilies, and cattail located in various areas around the lake.  There is an intermittent inlet and outlet located on the 3.6 miles of moderately developed shoreline.  Little Sugar Bush Lake has a special regulation for sunfish limiting anglers to keeping five fish per day.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in June 2023 to evaluate the fish population in Little Sugar Bush Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a high number of Northern Pike in Little Sugar Bush Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike sampled was 21.5 inches, but one 38-inch fish was measured.  Walleye numbers were slightly below average for the lake, but size was good.  Every Walleye sampled in 2023 was over 15 inches and 38% were over 20 inches.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of Bluegills over eight inches.  About 32% of the Bluegills sampled in 2023 were over eight inches long and Bluegills over ten inches were measured.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie were measured up to 11 inches long and Largemouth Bass were up to 16.5 inches long.  Other fish species observed were Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n</p>",
