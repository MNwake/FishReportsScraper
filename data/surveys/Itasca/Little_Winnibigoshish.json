                "narrative": "<p>Little Winnibigoshish is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for black crappie and yellow perch.  In recent years, it has been stocked biennially with walleye fry.  Since 1994, the stocking has been done by the Leech Lake Indian Reservation's Department of Resource Management, so it does not appear in this report.In this assessment, the walleye gill net catch rate (3.6/set) was within the expected range for lakes in this class.  Gill net sampled walleye ranged from 6.7 to 28.0 inches long and had a mean length of 15.3 inches.  Walleye were sampled from most years, both  stocked and non-stocked, with the largest year class (1999) being a non-stocked year.  Growth appears to be average.The northern pike gill net catch rate (8.1/set) was within the expected range.  Gill net sampled northern pike were relatively small.  They ranged from 14.4 to 29.3 inches long and had a mean length of 18.7 inches.  Their mean weight was 1.5 pounds, which is below the expected range for weights.  Growth appears to be normal.The yellow perch gill net catch rate (12.4/set) was within the expected range.  Gill net sampled yellow perch ranged from 4.9 to 11.0 inches long and had a mean length of 8.2 inches.The trap net catch rate for black crappie (0.9/set) was within the expected range.  No black crappie were sampled in the gill nets.  Crappie ranged from 8.0 to 12.2 inches long and had a mean length of 10.7 inches.The bluegill trap net catch rate (0.4/set) was well below the expected range.Other species sampled include; bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, rock bass, tullibee and white sucker.All anglers can help ensure good fishing in Little Winnibigoshish Lake by limiting their harvest of all species, especially by releasing the medium and larger sized fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Winnibigoshish Lake (Little Winnie) is located 10 miles northwest of Deer River, MN within the Chippewa National Forest.  The Mississippi River flows through the lake and water level fluctuations are common.  The shoreline is essentially undeveloped with the exception of a resort on the north shore.  The 2008 lake management plan lists Walleye as the primary management species, with Northern Pike and Yellow Perch as secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in July 2017 to collect updated information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was the highest on record and above the typical range for similar lakes.  Size structure was modest with fish ranging from 7.2 to 26.8 inches and having an average length of 14.3 inches.  Only 17% of the sample exceeded 18 inches.  The lake was stocked with Walleye fry, frylings or fingerlings (or combinations) annually for the last 10 years, making stocking evaluation difficult.  Age 1-5 fish made up the majority of the sample.  Growth was average with Walleye attaining 15.7 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch was above the typical range for lakes with similar habitat, but near the long-term average for Little Winnie.  Size structure was poor; pike ranged from 12.4 to 32.9 inches with an average length of 20.8 inches.  Only 13% of the sample exceeded 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in numbers similar to the long-term average for the lake.  Perch ranged from 5.2 to 9.4 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Only 9% of the sample exceeded 8 inches.  Ages 2-7 were represented in the sample with age 3 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth was average with perch attaining 7.1 inches at age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill-net catch was similar to the long-term average for the lake.  Tullibee ranged from 6.8 to 16.2 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker and Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Winnibigoshish appears to support a healthy and diverse fish population.  Walleyes were sampled in this assessment at a rate that is near the median for this type of lake.  This catch rate is similar to those seen in past assessments.  Walleyes sampled in this assessment had a mean length of 14.9 inches and a mean weight of 1.2 pounds.  The walleyes that were sampled appear to be equally distributed between years in which stocking took place and unstocked years suggesting that natural reproduction in Little Winnibigoshish may be sufficient to support the walleye population at its current level with little or no stocking.      Northern pike were also sampled at a rate near the median for this lake class.  Catch rates were higher in all four of the previous assessments.  However, the northern pike sampled in this assessment had a mean length of 21.2 inches and a mean wieght of 2.2 pounds.  This is the largest mean size observed in an assessment since 1974.      Yellow perch were also sampled at a rate near the lake class median.  The yellow perch that were sampled ranged in length from 5.3 to 10.7 inches and had a mean length of 7.3 inches.     Tullibee were sampled at a high rate for this lake class.  They ranged in size from 6.4 to 14.4 inches long and had a mean length of 9.1 inches.  Ninety percent of the tullibees that were examined were free of paracites.     Black crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass and muskellunge were not sampled in this assessment but are also present in low numbers.  Bullheads, bowfin, burbot, pumpkinseed sunfish, redhorse, rock bass, white suckers, whitefish and many varieties of minnows also inhabit this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Winnibigoshish is a 938-acre lake located 10 miles northwest of Deer River, MN.  The lake is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 28 ft and a littoral area of 209 acres.  Little Winnibigoshish is in lake class 27 and has a public access on the northwest shore.  The Mississippi River flows through the lake and water level fluctuations are common.  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and Leech Lake Indian Reservation and is essentially undeveloped with the exception of a resort on the north shore. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch was 10.3/net and was higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill net catch rates have historically been moderate and varied from 2.7 to 8.4/net.  Size structure was moderate with approximately 50% of fish sampled greater than 15 inches.   Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 18 inches by age five.  Walleye fingerlings, fry, or frylings have been stocked in six out of the last 8 years making stocking evaluation difficult.  Most year classes were represented in the sample indicating consistent recruitment through natural reproduction or stocking.    <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was very high at 23.3/net, and exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 4.4 to 17.3/gill net.  Size structure was generally poor, however, a few fish greater than 30 inches were sampled.  Growth was good, but not exceeding 115% of the statewide average with fish reaching 24 inches in four years.  Size structure may be lower than expected due to large year classes in 2004 and 2005.  Anglers can help to improve size structure by releasing northern pike larger than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 36.5/net, which was within the expected range.  Historical catch rates have been similar and have varied from 12.4 to 56.8/gill net.  Size structure was generally poor with few fish exceeding nine inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species have historically been sampled at very low numbers.  In 2007, the bluegill catch rate was less than 1/trap net, and no black crappie were sampled.  Tullibee have commonly been sampled in past assessments, however, only one tullibee was sampled in this assessment.  Warm summers the last couple years have likely caused tullibee populations to decline. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled include, black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and common shiner. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A substantial perch population is present and appears to be providing adequate forage for walleyes and northern pike.  The cisco population is quite high.  Net catches are not sufficient to determine possible weak year classes in northern pike and walleye populations.</p>",
