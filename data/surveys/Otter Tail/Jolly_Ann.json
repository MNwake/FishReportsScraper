                "narrative": "<p>     Jolly Ann Lake is a 256-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eleven miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The maximum depth is 89 feet; however, 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 12.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the lake. Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 2.6 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Jolly Ann Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jolly Ann Lake is a 256-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central OtterTail County approximately eleven miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The maximum depth is 89 feet; however, 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 9.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 10.1 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Jolly Ann Lake is included in lake class 25; other area lakes in this same classification include Beers, Sewell, Swan, Sybil, and Franklin.\n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Only four houses were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the lake. Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\n     Jolly Ann Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.\n     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.0 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 12.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.\n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 4.0 to 20.4 inches with an average length and weight of 10.8 inches and 1.1 pounds.  \n     The black crappie test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expectedl range for similar lakes.  Forty-two percent of the black crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.\n     The bluegill test-net catch rate also exceeded the expectedl range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Eleven percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.\n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Jolly Ann Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Jolly Ann Lake was conducted on July 2, 2018 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, boat seining was used at three locations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \n     The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \n     Data from this survey indicates Jolly Ann Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jolly Ann Lake is a 256-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately 11 miles southeast of the town of Dalton, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 89 feet and 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with gravel/rubble.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 10.1 feet.  Readings from previous surveys ranged from 8.5 to 10.0 feet.  A DNR public water access is located on the south shore of the lake.     Light development exists around the lake.  Four houses were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Jolly Ann Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Jolly Ann Lake contains good populations of black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.       Black crappie abundance has increased in recent surveys with a good number of fish greater than ten inches in length.  Crappie ranged in length from 4.1 to 11.1 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and 0.4 pounds.     Catch data indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population may exist.  Bass reproduction appears to be consistently good as five year classes were represented in the lake survey sample.  Bass ranged in length from 5.7 to 14.6 inches.  A spring electrofishing assessment would provide better information on the largemouth bass population in Jolly Ann Lake.       Northern pike abundance is low, however, some larger fish are present in the lake.  Pike ranged in length from 18.4 to 28.1 inches with an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.1 pounds.       The walleye population is dominated by larger fish, primarily from the 1995 year class.  The average length and weight of walleye was 20.1 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Walleye exhibit good growth rates with a mean length of 16.4 inches at four years of age. It appears that walleye stocking is establishing year classes of walleye in the lake.  Future walleye management includes a biennial walleye fry stocking regime.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jolly Ann Lake is a 256-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eleven miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The maximum depth is 89 feet; however, 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 12.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 10.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Only four houses were located along the shoreline during the 2011 lake survey.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the lake. Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Jolly Ann Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrachid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.3 to 21.6 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  The 2009 year class appears to be moderately strong.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.8 to 19.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The black crappie population has historically been increasing in abundance.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.8 to 13.2 inches with an average length and weight of 9.3 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained stable.  Age and length data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Five percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Jolly Ann Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jolly Ann Lake is a 256-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eleven miles southeast of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land.  The maximum depth is 89 feet; however, 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 12.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 10.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and common cattail) is prevalent throughout the lake. Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Jolly Ann Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-centrachid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 5.3 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The 2015 year class appears to be moderately strong.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 2.6 to 19.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n      Northern Pike population characteristics have historically remained stable.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistent but low.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 35.1 inches with an average length and weight of 24.5 inches and 3.2 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at age-IV.     <br> \n     The Black Crappie population has historically fluctuated in abundance.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.6 to 13.2 inches with an average length and weight of 8.1 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 8.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained stable.  Age and length data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-five percent of the Bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.7 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Jolly Ann Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Jolly Ann Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",
