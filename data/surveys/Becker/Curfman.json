There is no obstacle to block the movement of fish between the two lakes.  Curfman Lake provides some of the best nursery and spawning habitat found on Detroit Lake for numerous fish species.  The lake is most suitable for northern pike, largemouth bass and the panfish species.  The fish species sampled in Curfman Lake mirror those found in the main portion of Detroit Lake.  Northern Pike were described as above average in the 1970 report.</p>",
