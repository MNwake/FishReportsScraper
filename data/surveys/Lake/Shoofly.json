Only one line is permitted at any time.  All stream trout must have head, tail, fins and skin intact when being transported.  There are two carry-down accesses to the lake.  One is approximately 500 feet across a bog and the other is a 1000-foot trail over rough terrain.  The lake is surrounded by public land and is in a wild state.In 2005 brook trout were sampled in below-average numbers compared to other stream trout lakes.  Shoofly Lake was once known as a very good brook trout lake; however, in recent years survival of brook trout has been poor which has led to significant decline in the quality of the fishery.  The few brook trout that were collected in 2005 averaged 13.1 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shoofly Lake is a designated trout lake located in Lake County approximately three miles northeast of Isabella Minnesota.  The lake has a surface area of 10 acres and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake access road proceeds north approximately 0.7 miles from the Wanless Road (FR 172).  The road is rough and a high clearance vehicle is strongly recommended.  This road ends in a small parking area.  From this parking area there are two routes to the lake, a 450 foot trail down the hill from the parking lot and then across an area of bog to the southeastern part of the lake or a 1,000 foot trail along old road, then down a hill and out to the end of the point on the east side of the lake; there is a user made campsite on this point.  The lake shoreline is in a combination of state and federal ownership.  Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout are stocked annually and are the only managed species in Shoofly Lake.  During the 2016 survey, Brook Trout catch was near average relative to similar lakes in the area.  The average length of Brook Trout sampled was 13.0 inches with fish up to 15.6 inches long sampled.  The average weight of Brook Trout sampled was 0.9 pounds, above average relative to other similar lakes in the area.  It was estimated that three year classes were present in the sample (2012, 2013, and 2014) with the 2013 year class making up 70 percent of the catch.  Growth was slow relative to other area lakes.  Eight of the 19 Brook Trout sampled contained roundworm parasites in their gut cavities.  The only other fish species sampled in the lake was Brook Stickleback.     <br> \n <br> \nShoofly Lake is scenic and provides a good opportunity to catch nice Brook Trout.  However, access to the lake is somewhat difficult.  Due to the nature of the lake shoreline, there is only a small area on the point along the east shore that is suitable for shore angling, unless you are willing to fish off of bog shoreline in hip boots.  This lake could be relatively easily fished with a float tube. <br> \n</p>",

The catch from the 2021 survey revealed a healthy trout population with good opportunities for anglers based on the number and size of fish captured. Brook Trout ranged in size from 7.3 to 14.7 inches with 37% greater than 12 inches long at the time of the survey. Fish from each of the previous three stocking events were identified in the catch indicating good survival from year to year. <br> \n <br> \nCreel data collected as part of the fisheries assessment found a small amount of use by anglers in summer and winter. Results of the 2021 survey confirm that Shoofly Lake continues to provide a fishable Brook Trout population with good size structure.
