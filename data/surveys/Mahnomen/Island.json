                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 611 acre, fertile lake that can experience heavy summer algal blooms and low dissolved oxygen levels in severe winters.  Although no documented winterkills have occurred, the initial survey in 1953 definitely resembled a lake that had experienced winterkill in the past.  Bullheads and yellow perch predominated with some northern pike and white suckers also present.  These winterkill resistant species along with some minnows and darters comprised the fish community in 1953.  Walleye and centrarchids (bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass) have since been introduced and are currently present in Island Lake.  Walleye are routinely stocked to maintain the population while other species are naturally reproducing.  The 1995 northern pike gillnet(GN) catch of 5.1/GN is not substantially different from the 4.7/GN found in 1990.  Northern pike spawning habitat is somewhat limited in Island Lake, particularily in low water years.  For this reason northern pike have occasionally been stocked (most recently in 1989).  High water levels in recent years appear to have improved spawning success with 70% of the northern pike sampled in the current survey being either one or two years old.  An abundance of yellow perch provides ample forage for the northern pike and they exhibit an above average growth rate.  Yellow perch abundance has consistently been very high in Island Lake.  The current gillnet catch of 74.4/GN is not a significant change from the 100.2/GN sampled in 1990.  Yellow perch growth rate, not surprisingly, is somewhat below average.  The abundance of yellow perch provides a ready food supply for the large predators like northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.  Bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have been stocked on several occasions since 1953 in an effort to first establish and then improve these populations in Island Lake.  All three species now appear to have modest populations present in Island Lake.  Spring trapnetting and/or electrofishing for largemouth bass and black crappie would help to more accurately assess their populations.  Growth rate of the fish sampled appears to be normal for all three species.  Black bullhead trapnet(TN) catches were extremely high in the 1953 initial survey (120/TN).  By the time the 1971 survey was conducted black bullheads had dramatically declined to 0.9/TN.  Large numbers of bullheads were harvested by commercial fishermen in the 1960's that probably initiated the decline.  In the 1980's the Island Lake Association members, with permission from the Section of Fisheries, began removing schools of young of the year bullheads by dip-netting.  These factors, combined with the introduction and establishment of other species, have prevented black bullheads from returning to former levels.  Walleyes have been routinely stocked in Island Lake since the 1960's.  They have been the only species stocked since 1990.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited and any natural reproduction that occurs is likely minimal.  Despite routine stocking the walleye population has undergone a significant decline in recent years.  What has caused the walleye population decline is not known.  Increased fishing pressure is probably a contributing factor as the lake has become heavily developed.  An abundant forage base is certainly available and continued walleye stocking will hopefully bolster the population.  Mean length of walleye sampled in the current survey was 18.8 inches and growth rate was normal.  The immediate area of Island Lake does not host a bounty of good fishing lakes.  Island Lake provides opportunities for water related recreational activities that include angling for a variety of fish species.  Consequently, it is heavily developed.  It is a fertile lake that has occasionally come precariously close to suffering a major winterkill of the fish community.  Any unnecessary nutrient input threatens the fish community by increasing the likelyhood of winterkill.  It also threatens other recreational activities like swimming by increasing the likelyhood of severe summer algal blooms.  For these reasons it is imperative that lakeshore owners on Island Lake use \"best shoreland management practices\" to minimize nutrient input.  Buffer strips of natural vegetation between the lake and lawns, that will absorb nutrient rich run-off before it enters the lake, is a good example.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 611 acre lake located approximately 4 miles south of Lengby, MN.  Island is a fertile lake that often experiences heavy summer algae blooms.  Low dissolved oxygen levels may also occur in Island Lake during severe winters.  Although no severe winterkills have been formally documented, the initial survey in 1953 seemed to indicate that the lake had experienced winterkill in the past.  Bullheads and yellow perch dominated the net catches, with some northern pike and white suckers also present.  These winterkill resistant species comprised the fish community at that time, even though old stocking records indicate that centrarchids and walleye had been stocked in Island Lake prior to 1953.  This suggests that at least one major winterkill occurred (prior to 1953) to eliminate these species.  Walleye and centrarchids (bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass) have since been reintroduced and are currently present in Island Lake.The watershed surrounding Island Lake is mostly rolling hardwood forest land, with some pasture and hayland also present.  There are numerous other small lakes, ponds and wetlands nearby, but Island is one of the few lakes in the immediate area which provides angling for a variety of fish species.  Consequently, it is heavily developed.  Although aquatic vegetation is still fairly common, stands of hardstem bulrush and other beneficial aquatic plants have been removed in many areas.  Development of the lakeshore has adversely affected water quality and aquatic habitat.Northern pike abundance in Island Lake appears to have increased substantially in recent years.  The gill net catch rate of pike in 2000 reached an all-time high of 14.25/net, more than twice the average for comparable lakes.  Northern pike spawning habitat is somewhat limited in Island Lake, particularly in low water years.  For this reason, northern pike have occasionally been stocked in the past (most recently in 1989).  High water levels in recent years appear to have increased spawning success and recruitment, with most of the northern pike sampled in the 2000 survey being either 2 or 3 years old.  Despite the abundance of young pike, growth rates seem to be above average.  The average weight of pike captured in gill nets was 3.0 pounds, and the average length was 23.3 inches.  The northern pike population in Island Lake is supported by an ample prey base of yellow perch.Yellow perch abundance has consistently been very high in Island Lake.  The current gill net catch rate of 70.5/net is nearly equal to the 1995 catch rate of 74.4/net, and well above the normal range for similar lakes.  Not surprisingly, the average size of yellow perch is low at 6.3 inches, with few individuals over 7 inches in length.Bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have been stocked on several occasions since 1953 in an effort to first establish and then improve these populations in Island Lake.  All three species now have self-sustaining populations in Island Lake.  Net catches for these two species reached all-time highs in 2000.  The trap net catch rate for bluegill was 47.4/net in 2000, more than double the 1995 catch rate of 18.5/net.  Average length of bluegills was fairly low at 5.3 inches, and no bluegills over 8 inches in length were sampled.  Several different year classes of black crappie were represented in the net catches, indicating good reproduction in recent years.  Trap net CPUE for black crappie increased to 7.1/net in 2000.  Anglers on the lake reported good fishing for black crappie during the time of the survey.  Only 3 largemouth bass were captured in the test nets.  Future assessments utilizing spring night electrofishing may help to more accurately assess the largemouth bass and black crappie populations.Black bullheads were extremely abundant in the 1953 initial survey (120/trap net), but declined dramatically by the time of the 1971 survey (0.9/net).  Large numbers of bullheads were harvested by commercial fishermen in the 1960's, which probably initiated the decline.  Net catches of black and brown bullheads have consistently remained low since 1971.  The increase in abundance of other fish species has likely held bullhead numbers in check.Walleyes have been routinely stocked in Island Lake since the 1960's, and have been the only species stocked since 1990.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited, and any natural reproduction that occurs is likely minimal.  Walleye abundance has been quite variable in Island Lake.  The current gill net catch rate of 4.25/net is an increase from the 1995 catch rate of 2.25/net, but considerably lower than the historical high of 13.5/net in 1985.  A majority of the walleyes sampled in the 2000 survey were from the 1995 and 1996 year classes, and are probably attributable to walleye fingerling stocking which occurred in those years.  The average size of walleyes in Island Lake is good.  Mean length of walleye from the gill nets was 18.4 inches and the mean weight was 2.3 pounds.  The most recent management plan for Island Lake called for biennial stocking of walleye fingerlings at the rate of 1 pound per littoral acre.  Due to the available yellow perch prey base and historically higher walleye abundance, the stocking rate was increased to 2 lbs./littoral acre.  While stocking is a useful tool for providing angling opportunities, it is likely that shoreline development, habitat destruction and increasing fishing pressure will ultimately be the overriding factors affecting the fish populations in Island Lake.  This is a lake that has occasionaly come precariously close to suffering a major winterkill of fish community.  There are presently 188 homes or cabins on Island Lake.  Any unnecessary nutrient input threatens the fish community by increasing the likelihood of winterkill.  It also impacts other recreational activities like swimming by promoting severe summer algae blooms.  For these reasons, it is imperative that lakeshore owners use \"best shoreland management practices\" to minimize nutrient input.  These practices include: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, and (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems.  The DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" has advice for riparian owners interested in restoring and maintaining natural shorelines. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Island Lake was conducted on July 27, 2022, by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff.  Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 53.  The previous score for Island Lake was 58 in July 2015.  The impairment threshold score is 45, suggesting that the fish population in Island Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the lake is likely not biologically impaired.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Wild Rice River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 611-acre lake located in northeastern Mahnomen County approximately 4 miles south of Lengby, MN.  Island is a fertile, eutrophic lake that often experiences heavy blue-green algal blooms and has experienced a winterkill in the past.  However, no severe winterkills have been documented during the past three decades.  In the original lake survey, bullheads and yellow perch dominated the net catches, with some northern pike and white suckers also present.  This indicates that heavy winterkill had occurred sometime prior to the 1953 study.  Walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have since been reintroduced and are currently a large part of the fishery in Island Lake.In 2005, test net catches for northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and largemouth bass were similar to the lake's historical average catches.  Pike as large as 37 inches were sampled, but the average length was 24 inches.  Walleyes averaged 15 inches in length and lengths ranged from 6.7 to 25.7 inches.  Bluegills and black crappies sampled in test nets were small with average lengths of 5.1 and 6.1 inches, respectively.  No bluegills over 7.5 inches and no crappies over 9.0 inches were caught.  Bluegill trap net catches increased in 2005 and growth rates declined.  It is likely that fish of these species are being harvested as fast as they reach \"keeper\" sizes.Walleyes have been routinely stocked in Island Lake since the 1960's, and have been the only species stocked since 1990.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited in Island Lake and the fishery is sustained by regular fingerling stocking.  Stocking rates of walleyes were doubled in 2000 because there was a good forage base of yellow perch and it was believed the fishery in this lake might benefit from increased stocking.  Test net catches increased slightly from 2000 to 2005.  However, catches of the primary forage (yellow perch) declined to historic lows over the same period.  Although there are still relatively good numbers of yellow perch, walleye growth rates appear to have declined over the past five years.  Perch numbers and walleye growth will require close monitoring to ensure that the forage population does not decline to unacceptable levels with the increased walleye stocking.Black bullheads were extremely abundant in the 1953 initial survey at 120 per trap net, but declined substantially by 1971 to 0.9 per net.  Commercial fishermen harvested large numbers of bullheads in the 1960's, which probably initiated the decline.  Net catches of black and brown bullheads have consistently remained low since 1971.  The increase in abundance of other fish species has likely held bullhead numbers in check.  In lakes with marginal water quality like Island, shoreline development, habitat destruction like loss of bulrush, and increasing fishing pressure will likely be the principal factors affecting the fish community.  There are presently 188 homes or cabins on Island Lake.  Nutrient input from increased runoff threatens the fish community by increasing the likelihood of winterkill.  It also impacts other recreational activities like swimming by promoting severe summer algae blooms.  For these reasons, it is very important that lakeshore owners use \"best shoreland management practices\" to minimize nutrient input.  These practices include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, and ensuring compliance of septic systems.  The DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" has advice for riparian owners interested in restoring and maintaining natural shorelines and protecting water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 611-acre lake located in northeastern Mahnomen County approximately four miles south of Lengby, MN.  Island is a fertile, eutrophic lake that often experiences heavy blue-green algal blooms and has experienced a winterkill in the past.  However, no severe winterkills have been documented during the past three decades.  In the original lake survey, bullheads and yellow perch dominated the net catches, with some northern pike and white suckers also present.  This indicates that heavy winterkill had occurred sometime prior to the 1953 study.  Walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have since been reintroduced and are currently a large part of the fishery in Island Lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, test net catches for walleye, black crappie, and largemouth bass were roughly similar to the lake's historical average catches.  Walleyes averaged over 17 inches in length and lengths ranged from 9.0 to 28.3 inches.  Pike catches were near record highs and some as large as 36 inches were sampled, but the average pike length was 22 inches.  Bluegills and black crappies sampled in test nets had average lengths of 5.9 and 9.5 inches, respectively.  Several bluegills over 8.0 inches and crappies over 10 inches were found.  This was the first assessment since 1995 in which bluegills longer than eight inches were sampled.  Prior to 1995, large bluegills were more common.  Bluegill trap net catches increased in 2010 and growth rates remained good. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been routinely stocked in Island Lake since the 1960's, and have been the only species stocked since 1990.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited in Island Lake and the fishery is sustained by regular fingerling stocking.  Stocking rates of walleyes were doubled in 2000 because there was a good forage base of yellow perch and it was believed the fishery in this lake might benefit from increased stocking.  Test net catches increased slightly from 2000 to 2005 and remained about the same in 2010.  However, catches of the primary forage (yellow perch) declined to historic lows over the same period.  There are still relatively good numbers of yellow perch, but perch and pike numbers and walleye growth will require close monitoring to ensure that the forage population does not decline to unacceptable levels with the increased walleye stocking and currently high pike abundance. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were extremely abundant in the 1953 initial survey at 120 per trap net, but declined substantially by 1971 to 0.9 per net.  Commercial fishermen harvested large numbers of bullheads in the 1960's, which probably initiated the decline.  Net catches of black and brown bullheads have consistently remained low since 1971.  The increases in abundance of other fish species has likely held bullhead numbers in check.   <br> \n <br> \nIn lakes with marginal water quality like Island, shoreline development, habitat destruction like loss of bulrush, and increasing fishing pressure will likely be the principal factors affecting the fish community.  There are presently 188 homes or cabins on Island Lake.  Nutrient input from increased runoff threatens the fish community by increasing the likelihood of winterkill.  It also impacts other recreational activities like swimming by promoting severe summer algal blooms.  For these reasons, it is very important that lakeshore owners use \"best shoreland management practices\" to minimize nutrient input.  These practices include leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, and ensuring compliance of septic systems.  The DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" has sound advice for riparian owners interested in restoring and maintaining natural shorelines and protecting water quality, as well as property values. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 616-acre lake located in Mahnomen County within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  This productive lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and occasionally experiences large algal blooms in the summer.  Though no severe winterkills have been formally documented in Island Lake, water quality records suggest winterkill is possible in certain areas of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked biennially in Island Lake.  Walleye catch rates in Island Lake have been variable since initial surveying, however they have stabilized over the past four surveys.  Since 2005, surveys reported an average catch rate between four and eight Walleye per gill net, with the 2020 survey catching almost four Walleye per gill net.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 13.3 to 28.4 inches, averaging 18.9 inches.  Walleye 16 to 19 inches in length were most abundant, accounting for 47% of total Walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates of Northern Pike have increased in Island Lake since initial surveying, likely as a result of several high water years leading to improved pike spawning habitat.  On average, eight pike were caught per gill net in the 2020 survey.  Sampled pike ranged in length from 10.6 to 35.5 inches, averaging 22.4 inches.  Nine pike over 30 inches were caught, indicating trophy potential.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was similar to past surveys.  Sampled Bluegill had an average length of 5.9 inches, with fish up to 9.8 inches long also present.  Approximately 8% of the sampled Bluegill were eight inches long or longer, indicative of a population dominated by small to moderately sized fish.  On average, Bluegill eight inches long were six years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance remained high in 2020.  Sampled crappie ranged in length from 0.6 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was up slightly, with fish ranging in length from 5 to 11.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the 2020 survey included Largemouth Bass, Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass.  Anglers can help to maintain Island Lake's valuable fishery by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium-large size fish and harvesting smaller fish for eating, specifically Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Shoreline owners can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 616-acre lake located in Mahnomen County approximately seven miles south of Lengby, MN.  The shoreline is heavily developed, with 188 homes or cabins and a former resort. Emergent beds of bulrush and cattail are scattered around the shoreline, although many historical beds have been eliminated in heavily developed areas. Island Lake has been identified as a class 25 lake, but it does not fit the general profile of some other class 25 lakes that are deeper and clearer. The lake is fertile and often experiences heavy summer algal blooms.  Island Lake is classified as eutrophic with a Carlson's trophic state index of 55.   <br> \n <br> \nNo severe winterkills have been formally documented for Island Lake. However, surveys indicate the lake experienced winterkill prior to 1953.  As a result, bullheads and Yellow Perch dominated 1953 net catches, with some Northern Pike and White Sucker also present.  These winterkill-resistant species comprised the fish community at that time, even though old stocking records indicate that centrarchids (Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass) and Walleye had been stocked prior to 1953.  Dissolved oxygen samples in early spring of 2013 and 2014 detected levels near or below 2 ppm, suggesting some winterkill is possible in isolated areas of the lake during severe winters.   <br> \n <br> \nFish stocking of Island Lake began in 1908, and has included sunfish, suckers, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Currently, Walleye is the only species that continues to be stocked and has consisted of a variety of sizes and ages.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited, and any natural reproduction that occurs is likely negligible.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been quite variable in Island Lake.  The 2015 gill net catch was 7.7 per net, which was above the Island Lake historic mean of 6.1 per net.  Walleyes up to 10 years old were sampled, but 42% were attributed to the 2011 year class. Gill netted Walleye ranged in size from 9.1 inches to 27.1 inches long with an average length of 16.0 inches.  Walleye growth remains good with fish reaching an average length of 14.4 inches by four years old. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch for Northern Pike was 11.6 per net in 2015, which is near the historical record.  Northern Pike spawning habitat is somewhat limited, particularly in low water years. However, recent high water levels have likely contributed to increased Northern Pike numbers as a result of greater spawning habitat availability. The 2011 and 2012 year classes comprised 69% of the Northern Pike sample. Average length of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 22.3 inches, and ranged from 14.5 inches to 33.9 inches. An ample prey base of Yellow Perch likely supports the Northern Pike population in Island Lake, and Northern Pike growth rates were typical for this lake at 22.8 inches long by four years of age. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have historically been high in Island Lake with an average catch rate of 74.5 per gill net.  The 2015 gill net catch rate of 44.4 per net was the third lowest in Island Lake's history, but still well above the normal catch for similar lakes in the state.  Lengths of Yellow Perch captured by gill nets in 2015 ranged from 4.0-10.0 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches in 2015 averaged 20.5 per net, which is above average for Island Lake. Bluegills caught in trap nets had an average length of  6.5 inches, and ranged in size from 3.7 inches to 9.0 inches. Twenty-five of the 246 Bluegills captured in trap nets in 2015 were over 8 inches. Bluegill growth rates in 2015 were similar to historic lake averages with four-year-old Bluegills reaching 5.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch in 2015 was the highest on record at 23.4 per net, which is well above both the Island Lake average and that of similar lakes in the state. Average length of trap netted Black Crappie was 5.9 inches, and ranged in size from 3.3-11.1 inches. Twenty-five of the 280 Black Crappie captured in trap nets in 2015 were over 10 inches long.  Black Crappie growth rates in 2015 were similar to historic lake averages with fish reaching 9.1 inches long by four years of age. Fifty-six percent of sampled Black Crappies were attributed to the 2014 year class. <br> \n <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this productive and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The gillnet catch of northern pike has increased since 1985 but is still somewhat less than the local median.  Stocking of adult northern pike in 1989 is apparently responsible for the increase as there appears to be little recruitment.  The gillnet catch of yellow perch has doubled from a previously high level to what is now nearly six times the local median.  Walleyes have declined but still remain well above the local median and display an excellent length frequency distribution.  Trapnet catches of bluegill nearly doubled from 1985 and is now just over the local median.  Dipnetting of schools of YOY bullheads by local residents has apparently succeeded in reducing the bullhead population.  The existing population is now comprised of predominantly older fish.</p>",
