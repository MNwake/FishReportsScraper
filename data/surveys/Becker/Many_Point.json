                "narrative": "<p>Many Point Lake, at 1,701 acres, is located in northeast Becker County approximately nine miles northwest of Ponsford.  It lies within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation, and more than half of the shoreline is owned by the Boy Scouts of America. The Otter Tail River enters along the northwest shore and exits the southeast corner where it flows to Round Lake.  Many Point Lake contains a diverse fish community in part due to its good water quality and diverse physical habitat.  Many Point is one of the few lakes in the Detroit Lakes area that receives regular Muskellunge stocking and also supports transient Lake Sturgeon. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye catch rate was 7.1 fish per gill net, surpassing the historical average 5.7 fish per net.  Walleye abundance has been stable over the past three surveys.  Sampled Walleyes averaged 17.0 inches in length, and ranged from 10.7 to 28.3 inches, which was similar to the previous survey in 2013.  The majority of the Walleye population resides in what is commonly referred to as the catchable size.  Although trophy-sized Walleyes have been routinely sampled in Many Point Lake, 46% of the Walleyes were between 14.0 and 17.9 inches.  Nine year classes were sampled with the oldest fish being 11 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were relatively few in number before the mid 1980's, but increased dramatically by the 1988 survey and have since remained higher than the lake's average.  The 2018 catch rate was 9.5 fish per gill net, falling below 10.0 fish per net for the first time in twenty years.  Lengths of sampled Northern Pike ranged from 7.0 to 32.8 inches, and averaged 22.1 inches.  Twenty-five percent of the pike measured were longer than 24 inches, but fish over 28 inches were rare, despite Many Point Lake having the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that are necessary to produce large Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance rebounded substantially in 2018, and was the highest catch rate since 1983.  Yellow Perch averaged 7.0 inches in length and ranged from 4.6 to 11.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of Bluegill has historically fluctuated from low to moderate levels since surveys began in Many Point Lake.  The 2018 catch rate was 44.3 fish per net, which was near some of the higher values observed.  Bluegill grew slow, only reaching 3.9 inches by age four.  Bluegills size was relatively small, averaging 5.7 inches in length.  Very few, if any, Bluegills longer than 8.0 inches have been caught in trap nets during past surveys, and 2018 was no exception.  The longest Bluegill captured was 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappie abundance appeared to be similar to past surveys.  The mean length of trap net sampled Largemouth Bass was 9.9 inches, and 8.0 inches for Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nIn an effort to provide additional Muskellunge fishing opportunities in the Detroit Lakes Management Area, Many Point Lake was selected from several lakes for Muskellunge management in 2005.  Many Point Lake showed the best potential, was promoted by tribal personnel and generally was supported and accepted by riparian owners and local anglers.  Muskellunge were introduced into Many Point Lake in 2006.  Stocking occurred annually through 2012, but has occurred every other year since.  A single, immature Muskellunge was captured in a gill net in 2018.  However, a targeted Muskellunge survey also occurred shortly after ice out in 2018.  This survey targeted spawning adults and captured 113 unique fish.  These fish ranged from 35.2 to 49.7 inches in length and averaged 41.4 inches.  The 2018 Muskellunge survey was the second consecutive such survey, the combination of which was used to calculate an estimate of the number of adult Muskellunge in Many Point Lake in 2017.  This estimate was 338 fish, or a density of 0.23 fish per surface acre.  This density estimate is slightly higher than what is observed in other muskie-managed waters in Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nA coordinated effort among state, federal, and tribal natural resource agencies has resulted in Lake Sturgeon being reintroduced into the Red River Basin.  One of the stocking locations is Round Lake, which is downstream of Many Point Lake.  It appears these sturgeon are travelling upstream, over the Many Point Dam that was modified to allow fish passage in 2008.  Three Lake Sturgeon were captured during spring muskie surveys in 2017 and 2018, and one Lake Sturgeon was caught in a gill net during the summer 2018 survey.  The sturgeon caught in the gill net was just shy of 40 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCisco occur at moderately low levels, but their average size is usually small.  Lake Whitefish have also been sampled occasionally in past surveys, but none have been found recently.  Other fish species sampled include Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eighteen sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and dense vegetation. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample seven stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-two species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. </p>",

Many Point Lake contains a diverse fish community in part due to its good water quality and diverse physical habitat.  Many Point is one of the few lakes in the Detroit Lakes area that receives regular Muskellunge stocking and supports transient Lake Sturgeon.  A standard survey was completed in Many Point Lake on 07/10/2023 to assess the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been steadily increasing over the past three surveys.  In 2023, the Walleye catch rate was nine fish per gill net, surpassing the historical average of five fish per net.  Walleyes averaged 16 inches in length and ranged from 7 to 28 inches.  Most of the Walleye population resides in what is commonly referred to as the catchable size.  Although trophy-sized Walleyes have been routinely captured in Many Point Lake, 33% of the Walleyes measured in 2023 were between 14 and 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Northern Pike have been steadily falling since 2013, when gill nets caught a record number 14 fish per gill net.  The 2023 catch rate was six pike per gill net, with fish ranging in size from 14 to 35 inches.  Forty percent of the pike measured were longer than 24 inches and 18% of the pike measured were longer than 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of Bluegill has historically fluctuated from low to moderate levels since surveys began in Many Point Lake.  The 2023 catch rate was 56 fish per net, which was the highest value observed since 1978.  Very few, if any, Bluegills longer than eight inches have been caught in trap nets during past surveys, and 2023 was no exception.  Bluegill caught in trap nets averaged five inches in length and the longest fish captured measured only eight inches.  Gill nets did capture a Bluegill that was 8.5 inches long, but it was found to be 17 years old. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge have been stocked into Many Point Lake since 2006.  The 2023 survey was not geared to adequately assess the musky population, but two fish were captured that measured 17 and 29 inches long.  A more targeted musky survey occurred in 2018, when a total of 113 fish were captured that ranged in size from 35 to 50 inches long.  The 2018 data was used to estimate the number of musky in Many Point Lake and calculations resulted in an estimate of 338 fish or 0.2 fish per surface acre. <br> \n <br> \nA coordinated effort among state, federal, and tribal natural resource agencies has resulted in Lake Sturgeon being reintroduced into the Red River Basin.  One of the stocking locations was Round Lake, which is downstream of Many Point Lake.  It appears these sturgeon are travelling upstream, over the Many Point Dam that was modified to allow fish passage in 2008.  Although no Lake Sturgeon were caught in the 2023 survey, previous surveys have encountered fish up to 40 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has rebounded substantially in the last couple of surveys, and 2023 was the highest catch rate on record at 37 fish per gill net.  The average catch rate for Many Point Lake is 29 perch per gill net.  Yellow Perch averaged seven inches in length and ranged from five to 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappie abundance appeared to be similar to past surveys.  The average length of Largemouth Bass caught in trap nets was nine inches, and Black Crappie caught in trap nets averaged 10 inches long.  Cisco occur at moderately low levels, but their average size is usually small.  Lake Whitefish have also been sampled occasionally in past surveys, but none have been found recently.  Other fish species captured during the 2023 survey included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Many Point is a diverse lake with an abundance of underwater structure, as well as numerous bays and peninsulas.  The lake's fish community consists of many common species like northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill, and a few not-so-common species like the lake whitefish.  Large tracts of undeveloped land owned by the Boy Scouts of America adjoin this 1,737 acre lake and help give the lake a pristine quality.During the 1950's and early 1960's, Many Point had a strong walleye fishery that was sustained primarily by natural reproduction.  At that time, much of the walleye reproduction was thought to occur in the vicinity of the inlet from Johnny Cake Lake.  During the most recent decades, walleye reproduction has not been as successful in Many Point.  The most abundant year classes of walleye are now associated with years of fingerling stocking.  It is not clear what caused the downturn in natural walleye spawning success.  The high abundance of small northern pike may be playing a role.  It is apparent that walleye stocking is now necessary to help sustain the fishery in this lake.  Although test net catches do not indicate an abundance of walleyes, the 2003 sample was nearly double that of 1998.Northern pike are another popular target of anglers on Many Point.  Sampled pike were small in size and very abundant.  This lake has the potential to produce large pike if they escape harvest for several years.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24 inches or greater in length.Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are also popular angling targets.  Bluegills are currently abundant, slow-growing and small.  It takes about eight years to produce a seven inch bluegill in this lake.  Larger bluegills were present in some past studies.  Black crappies can be fairly large when found.  Largemouth bass appear to be present in good numbers.Voluntary release of mid to large sized fish of all gamefish species is encouraged.  This is especially true for northern pike.  Large fish in a population tend to act as a control in balancing the fish community.  Often, harvesting most of the large fish as soon as they become acceptable to anglers results in an overabundant population of small fish.</p>",

The 1987, 1985 and 1981 year classes of walleyes were the only recent cohorts not represented in the catch.  Those years were also the only recent years in which there was no fingerling stocking.  Although these data are not conclusive, they may indicate poor natural reproduction in the past several years.</p>",

The Boy Scouts of America own large tracts of undeveloped shoreline that give the lake apristine look and feel.  The current walleye population is a combination of naturally reproduced and stocked fish.  At 6.2 walleye pergillnet it is within the normal range for this lake class.  Walleye size structure is excellent, 68% of the fishare over 15 inches and 18% over 20 inces in length.  Average weight is 1.5 lbs.Northern pike are abundant but the majority of those sampled in the current survey were small, 16-20 inches inlength.  They consisted primarily of two, three and four-year-old fish.  Older and larger northern pike may beoff-shore feeding on the tullibee population, in which case they would not be sampled by standard lake survey testnets.   Anglers occasionally report catching large northern pike.Modest panfish populations are present in Many Point Lake but are generally overlooked in favor of the walleye. Bluegill growth rate is slow but eight and nine inchers are still present.  Large black crappies are occasionallytaken by anglers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Many Point is a diverse lake with an abundance of underwater structure, as well as numerous bays and peninsulas.  The lake's fish community consists of many common species like northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill, and a few not-so-common species like the lake whitefish and, more recently, muskellunge.  Large tracts of undeveloped land owned by the Boy Scouts of America adjoin this 1,737 acre lake and help give the lake a pristine quality. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 1950's and early 1960's, Many Point had a strong walleye fishery that was sustained primarily by natural reproduction.  At that time, much of the walleye reproduction was thought to occur in the vicinity of the inlet from Johnny Cake Lake.  During the most recent decades, walleye reproduction has not been as successful in Many Point.  The most abundant year classes of walleye are now associated with years of fingerling stocking.  It is not clear what caused the downturn in natural walleye spawning success.  The increased abundance of small northern pike may be playing a role.  It is apparent that walleye stocking is now necessary to help sustain the fishery in this lake.  Test net catches of walleye increased to the second highest level since 1954, aided primarily by fingerling stocking.  The walleyes are good-sized with an average length just under 17 inches and an average weight of nearly two pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are another popular target of anglers on Many Point.  Sampled pike were small in size and very abundant.  This lake has the potential to produce large pike if they escape harvest for several years.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24 inches or greater in length. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Many Point in 2006.  There was strong interest by muskie fishing groups, some individual anglers, and tribal natural resource officials to provide a second muskie lake in the Detroit Lakes fish management area.  Detroit is the only other area lake stocked regularly with muskies.  After an in-depth search of area lakes based on recommended criteria, Many Point was selected for inclusion in the muskie program.  The current plan calls for annual stocking of 565 muskellunge fingerlings until a modest population is established.  At that time, stocking rates will likely be reduced to an amount necessary to sustain a trophy fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are also popular angling targets.  Bluegills are currently abundant, slow-growing and small.  It takes about seven years to produce a seven inch bluegill in this lake.  Larger bluegills were present in some past studies.  Black crappies can be fairly large when found.  Largemouth bass appear to be present in good numbers. <br> \n <br> \nVoluntary release of mid to large sized fish of all gamefish species is encouraged.  This is especially true for northern pike.  Large fish in a population tend to act as a control in balancing the fish community.  Often, harvesting most of the large fish as soon as they become acceptable to anglers results in an overabundant population of small fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Many Point is a diverse lake with an abundance of underwater structure, as well as numerous bays and peninsulas.  The lake's fish community consists of many common species like Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill, as well as a few not-so-common species like the Lake Whitefish and, more recently, Muskellunge.  In addition, Lake Sturgeon may become a future component of Many Point's fish community, given the likelihood of upstream migration from Round Lake.  Large tracts of undeveloped land owned by the Boy Scouts of America adjoin this 1,737 acre lake and help give the lake a pristine quality. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 1950's and early 1960's, Many Point had a strong Walleye fishery that was sustained primarily by natural reproduction.  At that time, much of the Walleye reproduction was thought to occur in the vicinity of the inlet from Johnny Cake Lake.  During the past three decades Walleye reproduction has not been as successful in Many Point.  The most abundant year classes of Walleye are now associated with years of fingerling stocking.  It is not clear what caused the downturn in natural Walleye spawning success.  Predation and competition from the increased abundance of small Northern Pike may be playing a role.  It is apparent that Walleye stocking is now necessary to help sustain the fishery in this lake.  Test net catches of Walleye in 2013 were identical to the lake's historical average of 5.6 fish per set, aided primarily by fingerling stocking.  The Walleyes are good-sized with an average length just over 17 inches and an average weight of nearly two pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are another popular target of anglers on Many Point.  Sampled pike were generally young and abundant in 2013.  Sizes were typical for Many Point when compared to past test netting reports with pike lengths ranging from 13.9 to 36.6 inches.  This lake has the potential to produce large pike if they escape harvest for several years.  Anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike 24 inches or greater in length. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Many Point in 2006.  There was strong interest by muskie fishing groups, some individual anglers, and tribal natural resource officials to provide a second muskie lake in the Detroit Lakes fish management area.  Detroit is the only other area lake stocked regularly with muskies.  After an in-depth search of area lakes based on recommended criteria, Many Point was selected for inclusion in the muskie program.  The current plan calls for biennial stocking of 565 Muskellunge fingerlings.  Mid-summer catches of muskie with standard test nets are rare in muskie lakes and just one was observed in 2013.  However, 11 muskies ranging from 26.4 to 41.3 inches in length were sampled during spring netting with large-frame trap nets in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are also popular angling targets.  Bluegills are currently abundant and relatively old, but slow-growing.  It takes about seven or eight years to produce a seven inch Bluegill in this lake.  Bluegills over eight inches long were reported in higher proportions in 1969 and 1983, though some were present in 2013.  Black Crappies can be fairly large when found.  Largemouth Bass appear to be present in good numbers. <br> \n <br> \nVoluntary release of mid to large sized fish of all gamefish species is encouraged.  This is especially true for Northern Pike.  Large fish in a population tend to act as a control in balancing the fish community.  Often, harvesting most of the large fish as soon as they become acceptable to anglers results in an overabundant population of small fish. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is best known for its walleye fishing, although it has a diverse fish community including most of the common fish species and a few not-so-common species like the lake whitefish.  Its 1,737 acres are surrounded by several large tracts of undeveloped land owned by the Boy Scouts of America that give the lake a pristine quality.Despite increased stocking in recent years, the 1998 walleye catch was lower than in any previous survey.  Walleye size, however, was quite good as the average weight of sampled fish was nearly two pounds.The walleye population was likely affected by recent increases in northern pike.  While yellow perch are considered the preferred forage for pike, net catches of perch were also down.  Young walleye, closely related to the yellow perch, are certainly more likely to be eaten by northern pike when perch are unavailable.  The good news for anglers is that the abundant northern pike were fast growers and some large pike were available.Bass and panfish are also part of the fish community in Many Point.  Bluegills are slow-growing and large ones are rare.  Large black crappies are occasionally taken by anglers.  Large fish of both of these species are vulnerable to overfishing and anglers can help sustain a larger size structure by releasing a portion of medium to large fish that might otherwise have been kept.</p>",
