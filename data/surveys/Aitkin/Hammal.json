                "narrative": "<p>Hammal Lake, a 374-acre basin located a few miles southeast of the city of Aitkin, is characterized by an abundance of littoral acreage, relatively low fertility, and a moderately complex shape. The majority of the immediate shoreline is developed with lake homes or seasonal cabins that are interspersed with mixed hardwood forest while the remaining shoreline consists of marshland. In the fall of 2001, as part of the accelerated walleye-stocking program, walleye fingerling stocking was added to this lake's management plan and was evaluated for the first time in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nA full lake survey was conducted in 2007 to assess the current status of the fish population, aquatic vegetation and water quality. Assessment of the fish community included spring electrofishing, summer gillnetting, trap netting and vegetation transects. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 55 largemouth bass were sampled in all gears with lengths ranging from 6.1 to 19 inches, and a mean length of 12.1 inches. They have an excellent size distribution with fish over 19 inches, as well as good numbers between 12 and 16 inches. Largemouth bass numbers are above average for this lake type and showed increases in both trap net and gill net catches. Largemouth bass have been steadily increasing in abundance, and have been at levels well above average in all surveys since 1989. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were above average for lakes of this type at 3.0 per gill net, but were lower than in 2001 when crappie abundance reached a historical high of 6.7 per net. Measured crappie ranged from 4.8 to 11.4 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches. Growth rates were slower than previously observed at Hammal Lake.  The 2001 year class appears strong. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish numbers were down slightly, but would still be considered average by statewide standards. Their numbers have been decreasing since a high of nearly 40 fish per net in 1989.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.8 to 7.9 inches with an average of 5.8 inches. This was the first time since the 1970 survey that bluegill over 7.5 inches have been sampled.  Although the 1999 and 2001 year classes appear strong, no age three and few age 4 bluegill were sampled, suggesting that recruitment in 2003 and 2004 was poor.  If recruitment remains low for a number of years we may observe a corresponding increase in growth rates, which is currently slow. <br> \n <br> \n Northern pike numbers spiked in 2001 when the catch rate was 12 fish per gill net, which was the highest ever sampled by DNR test nets dating back to the initial survey in 1970. In 2007, catches dropped back to normal levels (7.6 per gill net) while the average length remained small at 18.1 inches.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s a research project was attempted to increase the average size of pike by altering the fish community.  After six years of intensively removing smaller pike, and stocking of larger pike and yellow perch, there were no changes to density, size structure, or growth rate of pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike, were sampled at low levels. The few fish we did sample were smaller, suggesting that natural reproduction is occurring, albeit at a lower level. Historically, perch numbers have always been relatively low. High densities of northern pike most likely limit perch abundance. The sampled fish community in Hammal Lake also included black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling stocking began in 2001 and has continued in alternate years. A total of seven walleye were sampled in the 2007 gill nets putting the catch rate for walleye at 1.17 fish per net, which is about average for lakes of this type. Walleye ranged in size from about 16 to 24 inches and were represented by three year classes.  Only 2 of the 7 walleye sampled were from known fingerling stocking. Four were from a stocking of yearlings from the 2004 year class, and one was from an adult stocking from 2005.  The walleye stocking in Hammal Lake will be reviewed following an additional population assessment scheduled for 2012. <br> \n <br> \nHammal Lake anglers are likely to encounter an abundance of largemouth bass of all sizes, an abundance of small northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and good numbers of smaller black crappie. Selective harvest of smaller fish is encouraged. Releasing the larger fish will help maintain and improve the current quality of the fish population and provide angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish. Because Hammal Lake is relatively low in fertility, shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can help maintain or improve the current water quality by re-establishing shoreline buffer strips with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; using farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Hammal Lake was conducted on June 19, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with three sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample one station, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Hammal Lake based on this survey was below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  However, this lake did score above the impairment threshold in a resurvey completed by the Fisheries Lake IBI program staff on August 8, 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nThe June 2017 nearshore survey was conducted early in the sampling season when water temperatures were lower and there are concerns that the sampling was not representative of nearshore fish assemblages.  Therefore more weight was given to the August 2017 survey.  Data from these surveys will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Hammal Lake was conducted on August 8, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including high numbers of five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2017 to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Hammal Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hammal Lake is a moderate sized lake located a few miles southwest of the City of Aitkin.  The lake has diverse habitat including shallow vegetated bays, submerged points, and deep holes.  Residential development ranging from seasonal cabins to year-round homes occurs around much of the shoreline.  There is a public access located in the southeast corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will be greeted with an abundant largemouth bass population with a variety of sizes.  While traditional survey gear captured only average numbers, additional spring night electrofishing collected 99 fish in one hour of sampling.  These fish averaged 12.6 inches with 13% over 14 inches and fish up to 19 inches observed in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked in alternate years since 2001.  The walleye catch of 0.2 per gill net was well below the goal listed in the current management plan of 2-3 per gill net.  The current fingerling stocking strategy does not appear to be producing significant returns. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 5.5 per gill net was the lowest observed catch since 1970, and was within the normal range for similar lakes.  However, size was not favorable.  Pike captured in gill nets ranged from 10.9 to 20.9 inches and averaged just 16.4 inches and 1.0 pound.  Growth was similar to previous surveys, and slow compared to county and state averages. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers should have opportunities to catch respectable sunfish and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance was normal for this type of lake at 15.3 per trap net.  Size averaged 6.4 inches with 29% greater than 7 inches.  Fish grew slow compared to county and state averages, but similar to previous assessments.  Although black crappie abundance was below the normal range for similar lakes for the first time in nine surveys to date at 0.8 per gill net, growth improved from the previous survey and was similar to county averages. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hammal Lake is a moderate sized lake located a few miles southwest of the City of Aitkin. The lake has diverse habitat including shallow vegetated bays, submerged points, and deep holes. Residential development ranging from seasonal cabins to year-round homes occurs around much of the shoreline. There is a public access located in the southeast corner of the lake. Spring night electrofishing indicated that anglers can expect to find an abundant largemouth bass population with a variety of sizes.  These fish averaged 12.7 inches with 23% over 14 inches and fish up to about 18 inches observed in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 3.1 per gill net was the lowest observed catch rate since 1970, and was below the normal range for similar lakes. However, the size structure did improve somewhat with about 20 percent larger than 24 inches. Pike captured in gill nets ranged from 13 to 36 inches and averaged just over 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance showed a decrease from the previous survey and catch rates were below normal for this type of lake at 7.6 per trap net. Average length in trap nets was a respectable 6.5 inches with 48% greater than 7 inches, which meets management objectives for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in gill nets (2.2/net) showed a slight increase from 2012. This catch is within the expected range, but below the goal of 3 per net for the lake. The average size of crappie was 7.7 inches and fish up to 10.4 inches were found in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are reminded to follow current MN-DNR Aquatic Invasive Species guidelines as described in the MN fishing regulations handbook in order to prevent the spread of unwanted invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hammel Lake has been part of a research project which sought to manipulate the fish community and cause an increase in mean size of northern pike and sunfishes. Northern pike were removed and yellow perch were stocked from 1985 through 1990.    Northern pike abundance has remained between 7.0 and 8.3 fish per gillnet set from 1982 through 1996. This rate is normal for lakes of small to medium size, mostly shallow water, relatively infertile, and moderately complex in shape. Growth is slow for fish during their fifth through eighth year, which constitutes most of the acceptable sized pike. Production of new northerns, or recruitment, is consistent and will lead to continued acceptable catch rates for anglers. The increase of northern pike greater than 24 inches from 11 % in the 1989 and 1991 surveys to 27% in 1996 may be the result of anglers practicing catch and release.    Black crappies were caught at above-average rates and were mostly smaller, 3 year old fish. These fish should be 7 inches in 1997 and 8 inches in 1998. Some larger crappies were also caught, however harvest is probably high and restricts the establishment of older, larger crappies.    Bluegills continue to grow slowly in the lake. The mean length in this survey was only 5.3 inches and the largest bluegill was only 7.2 inches long. The lake has abundant spawning areas for bluegills, lots of vegetation to protect young fish and low fertility which supplies limited food for young fish. The experimental addition of yellow perch did not noticably increase predation on young bluegills and stunting continues to restrict bluegill size.    Largemouth bass were caught in two sizes in this survey, 9 inches and 14 inches, due to inconsistent recruitment. Bass angling may continue to be attractive if anglers release larger bass. Growth is slower than normal for young bass and therefore quality sized bass bass do not quickly replace larger bass that have been removed.    Adult yellow perch continue to be relatively uncommon, despite the previous stockings. Apparently northerns will rapidly deplete the yellow perch population, making stocking an ineffective means of changing the fish community.     Yellow bullheads were caught in this survey at more than twice the average rate for this lake type. They average only 9 inches, yet a few one pound bullheads are available for anglers. Commercial harvest has occurred on two occassions, but angling harvest is probably minimal.</p>",

The majority of the immediate shoreline is developed with lake homes or seasonal cabins that are interspersed with mixed hardwood forest while the remaining shoreline consists of marshland.  Recently, as part of the expanded walleye stocking program, walleye have been added to the list of species for which the lake is managed with walleye fingerling stocking beginning in the fall of 2001.Evaluation goals of the current management plan called for a population assessment in 2001 to assess the current status of the fish population and the water quality.  Assessment of the fish community included spring night electrofishing and summer gill and trap netting.  A total of 78 largemouth bass were sampled with their lengths extending from 5.7 to 20.9 inches.  Bass abundance appears to be above average and of excellent quality with 42% of the sample at 14.0 inches or greater in length.  Normal growth was characteristic of all ages.  Black crappie numbers were above normal for lakes of this type.  When compared to historical assessments, crappie abundance in 2001 was the highest ever documented by DNR surveys.  Measured crappie ranged from 4.8 to 10.1 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches.  Bluegill sunfish were at normal abundance levels with their lengths extending from 0.6 to 7.4 inches.  Bluegill numbers remain consistent with previous surveys dating back to 1989 and their sizes remain small.  When compared to statewide averages, black crappie and bluegill sunfish growth was normal at age 1 and slow thereafter.  Northern pike numbers were above normal for lakes of this type while their average size, at 1.4 pounds, was below normal.  The 2001 catch rate was the highest ever sampled by DNR test nets dating back to the initial survey in 1970.  Measured northern pike extended from 10.7 to 31.7 inches with 64% of the sample between 14.0 and 19.0 inches.  Even after intense removal efforts of smaller pike and stocking of larger pike over a 6 year period, as part of a research project that sought to alter the fish commumity and cause an increase in average size of pike, these stratagies were ineffective in notably altering pike densities and improving pike growth.  The percentage of sampled pike in 2001 that were at 24.0 inches or greater in length (12.5%) was down from 1996 (24%).  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike, were sampled at below normal levels.  Historically, perch numbers have always been relatively low.  Despite intensive stocking efforts from 1985 to 1990, perch numbers were not significantly increased.  High densities of northern pike most likely limit perch abundance.  The sampled fish community in Hammal Lake also included black bullhead, brown bullhead, dog fish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Abundance levels of black bullhead, brown bullhead, and dog fish were normal, rock bass and yellow bullhead were above normal, and pumpkinseed sunfish were below normal.  Hammal Lake anglers are likely to encounter an abundance of largemouth bass of all sizes, an abundance of small northern pike and bluegill sunfish, and good numbers of smaller black crappie.  Selective harvest of smaller fish is encouraged.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain and improve the current quality of the fish population and provide angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish.  Because Hammal Lake is relatively low in fertility, shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can help maintain or improve the current water quality by re-establishing shoreline buffer strips with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hammal Lake is a moderate sized lake located a few miles southwest of the City of Aitkin. The lake has diverse habitat including shallow vegetated bays, submerged points, and deep holes. Residential development ranging from seasonal cabins to year-round homes occurs around much of the shoreline. There is a public access located in the southeast corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing and the gill net assessment both indicated that anglers could expect to find an abundant Largemouth Bass population with a variety of sizes. The electrofishing bass averaged 12.4 inches with 21% over 14 inches and fish over 18 inches observed in the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained low (4.2/gill net) and continued a trend of lower numbers that has been observed since 2012. Lower abundance tends to result in better size structure, and this has improved somewhat over the last two surveys, with about 20 percent larger than 24 inches. Pike captured in gill nets ranged from 10 to 34 inches and averaged just shy of 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate (8.7/trap net) was similar to the previous survey and there has been a general decline since 1996. While catch rates were below the expected range for similar lake types and slightly below the management goal of 10-20 per net for the lake, the average length in trap nets was 6.5 inches with 33% greater than 7 inches, which does meet the management objectives for the lake. Few Bluegill over 8 inches have ever been observed in any previous surveys . <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in gill nets (2.3/net) was essentially unchanged from 2017 and was within the normal range for gill nets and trap nets (1.3/net), yet below the goal of (3.0/net) for the lake. Black Crappie numbers have been reasonably stable over time in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are reminded to follow current MN-DNR Aquatic Invasive Species guidelines as described in the MN fishing regulations handbook to prevent the spread of unwanted invasive species. <br> \n</p>",
