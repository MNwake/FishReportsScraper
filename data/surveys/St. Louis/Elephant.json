The public access located on the southeast side of the lake was used during the population assessment.   <br> \n     Several species of panfish were caught, including bluegill, black crappie, and pumpkinseed.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small.  However, black crappie abundance was a notable exception.  Abundance in trap nets was 6.2 fish/set, which was well above what is found in most class 5 lakes and the second highest level ever recorded in Elephant Lake; but down from the record high of 11.8 fish/set observed during the investigation in 2001.  Six year-classes were present in trap nets and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Total length (TL) ranged from 3.5-14.4 inches.  However, few fish were found in the larger length groups, which was evident by the average weight (0.26 lb) that was lower than most class 5 lakes.     <br> \n     Northern pike gill-net abundance was 3.0 fish/set, which was similar to most class 5 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-5 years.  Total length ranged from 17.0-33.2 inches in gill nets and growth was well above the area average.  The average weight was 4.2 lb, well above most class 5 lakes.   <br> \n     Smallmouth bass were captured at an extremely high rate of 322 fish per hour of electrofishing, which was twice the rate observed during the previous investigation.  Total length ranged from 1.7-17.7 inches and the mean was 7.5.     <br> \n     Walleye abundance has fluctuated greatly throughout the past 40 years.  In 2006, walleye abundance was 18.2 fish/set, which greatly exceeded most class 5 lakes.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-18 years.  The 2002 year-class represented 48% of the sample.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 8.3-28.5 inches and the average was 16.0.  Growth was similar to the area average.  The average weight of walleyes captured in gill nets was heavier than what is observed in most class 5 lakes.   <br> \n     Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 21.7 fish/set, well above most class 5 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-5 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.8-9.9 inches.  Growth was above the area average.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Bass, panfish, walleye, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample 218 smallmouth bass during a single night in late May.  Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 115 fish per hour of on-time; which was similar to the capture rate in 2008 and 2009, but lower than the extremely high rate of 322 fish per hour captured in 2006.  In 2010, total length ranged from 2.1-17.6 inches and the mean was 9.7.  Mean weight was 0.68 lb, which was within the range observed during the two previous investigations.   <br> \n</p>",

Centrarchids, walleye, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to capture smallmouth bass at a rate of 89 fish per hour of on-time; which was similar to the capture rate in 2009 and 2010, but lower than the extremely high rate of 322 fish per hour captured in 2006.  In 2011, total length ranged from 2.3-17.9 inches and the mean was 10.3.  Mean weight was 0.87 lb, which was higher than the three previous investigations (0.68 lb in 2010, 0.58 lb in 2009, 0.73 lb in 2008).  Eleven year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-12 years.  Several strong year-classes were present in the sample and recruitment was consistent.  Growth was below the area average. <br> \n</p>",

Fishable populations include walleye, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and northern pike.  Recruitment appeared to be good in most years, except for 1992 and 1993.  The summers of these years were unusually cold, and limited the reproduction and growth of most species.The walleye population appeared to be in good shape in terms of growth, age distribution, and size distribution.  The average walleye sampled in gill nets was 15.4\"  Yellow perch were abundant.  The average size of perch from gill net samples was 7.1\", but perch rarely exceeded 10\".  Northern pike numbers were low, but growth rates were very good and the average size was 30.1\".The smallmouth bass population seemed to be about average for this type of lake.  Growth rates were slow, but older fish reached about 15\".  Black crappie abundance was typical and growth rates were good.  Sizes of crappie ranged from 8\" to 14\".  Bluegill and pumkinseed both reached harvestable sizes.  Some of the bluegill from gill nets approached 10\".White suckers and golden shiners were also sampled during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant Lake is one of Minnesota's 24 Sentinel Lakes.  Sentinel Lakes were specially designated study lakes for extensive monitoring to measure human impacts like climate change on Minnesota's aquatic resources.  Fishery monitoring on Elephant Lake in 2008 included ice out trap netting targeting northern pike (results reported elsewhere), spring electrofishing targeting smallmouth bass and summer trap netting.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2008 smallmouth bass electrofishing CPUE was 169.1 fish per hour sampled. Lengths of captured bass ranged from 2.4 to 18.2 inches and averaged 9.9 inches.  The catch in 2008 had a better size distribution than the two previous years electrofished (2001 and 2006).  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 black crappie trap-net abundance (6.58 per net) was the second highest on record for Elephant Lake.  The average abundance for Elephant Lake dating back to 1962 was 2.01 per net.  Elephant's crappie abundance was greater than average when compared to other Minnesota Class 5 lakes.  Black crappie caught during the 2008 investigation ranged in length from 6.26 to 13.82 inches with an average of 9.05 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 blugill trap-net abundance (6.67 fish per net) was the highest ever recorded for Elephant Lake.  The average abundance for Elephant Lake was 0.17 fish per net.  When compared to other Minnesota Class 5 lakes however, Elephant had below average abundance.  Historically, bluegill captured in trap nets on Elephant Lake have been small and 2008 was no exception.  The average weight was only 0.10 pounds.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in length from 3.54 to 8.11 inches and averaged 4.53 inches.  Only 14% of the bluegill were greater than six inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 trap-net investigation suggests that smallmouth bass abundance is increasing in Elephant Lake.  Prior to 1988, the average abundance in trap nets was 0.07 fish per net.  Since 1988 however, the average abundance has increased to 0.32 per net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the trap-net catch included northern pike, walleye, pumpkinseed and yellow perch.</p>",

Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 11.7 with a mean of 5.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.18 lbs, which is below 25% of other similar lakes.  Three year classes were present with ages ranging from 1 to 6 years, however 85% of the aged fish in the sample were age-1. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 0.75/set, far below 25% of similar class lakes.  Lengths ranged from 2.6 to 7.2 with a mean of 6.3 inches.  Mean weight was 0.20 lbs which is above 50% of similar class lakes.  Four year classes were present with ages ranging from 1 to 6 years.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed trap-net abundance was 2.08/set which is below 50% of similar class lakes.  Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 6.6 with a mean of 5.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.13 lbs which is just above 25% of similar class lakes.

TWO YEAR-CLASSES DOMINATED THE CATCH; THE 1984 YEARS CLASS COMPRISED 32% OF THE CATCH, AND THE 1986 YEAR CLASS MADE UP 50% OF THE CATCH). WALLEYES WERE STOCKED IN 1984 WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THAT YEAR CLASS'S STRENGTH; HOWEVER, THE 1986 YEAR CLASS WAS THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE 1985 YEAR CLASS WAS A WEAK YEAR CLASS. WALLEYE PSD IS NOW MORE FAVORABLE (OBSERVE PSD GRAPH, WALLEYE PSD'S HAVE SHOWN SIDE VARIATION DUE TO CHANGES IN RECRUITMENT). NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE DECLINED AGAIN; THEIR CPUE HAS DECLINED IN EVERY SURVEY SINCE THEIR PEAK CPUE IN 1983 ( THE LOW ABUNDANCE OF NORTHERN PIKE IS SURPRISING DUE TO THE FACT THAT SPAWNING HABITAT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE). YELLOW PERCH INDEX OF ABUNDANCE IN- CREASED FROM THE LOWEST RECORDED LEVEL IN 1986 (38 FISH/GILLNET IN 1988 VERSUS 15 FISH/GILLNET IN 1986). THE ABUNDANCE AND PSD OF YELLOW PERCH IS REGULATED BY WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE. HIGH DENSITY OF YELLOW PERCH HAS OCCURRED WHEN BIOMASS OF PREDATORS WERE LOW. HIGH YELLOW PERCH PSD'S, WHICH OCCUR AT HIGH DENSITY, MAY TRIGGER POOR WALLEYE RECRUITMENT YEARS. PAST WALLEYE STOCKING AND PERCH REMOVAL PROJECTS HAS FORCED THE COMMUN- ITY TO A NEW EQUILBRIUM, WHICH HAS A MORE FAVOR- ABLE WALLEYE/PERCH SIZE STRUCTURE.</p>",

Half of the 8 previous test nettings reported walleye catch rates above average for similar lakes in the area, while the remaining four investigations reported catch rates within the range typically observed in lakes of this type.  While the current test netting compares favorably with similar lakes in the area, walleye catch     rates on Elephant Lake have declined since the 1988 and 1991 investigations.  Average size of the walleyes sampled was 15.2\" long, or 1.4 pounds.     Northern pike abundance as sampled by test nets remains less than what is typically observed in lakes of this type.  However, the size of northern pike sampled was quite large, with an average length of 35.1\" and average weight of 9.4 pounds.  Very few smallmouth bass were sampled in test nets, however, smallmouth bass usually do not sample very well in nets.  Yellow perch gillnet catch rates have increased dramatically since the last      investigation in 1991, and is cause for concern when combined with the decline in walleye abundance and the low numbers of northern pike.  Gillnet catch rates for black crappie and bluegill were both within the range typically observed for similar lakes in this area.  The size of black crappie sampled was above average at 0.6 pounds.</p>",

Historically, Elephant Lake has had a relatively sparse northern pike population.  Spawning and nursery habitat for pike is limited.  Reports from local anglers indicate, however, that in the past, the lake contained large individuals.  In an attempt to improve the size structure of the northern pike population, a special regulation requiring the release of all pike under 40 inches in length was enacted on May 10, 2003.  <br> \n  <br> \nTrap netting during the week of ice out in 2009 produced a total catch of 75 northern pike or 1.63/net.  The size structure of the catch had shifted toward larger fish when compared to ice out netting in 2003 and 2008.  Male pike averaged 20.8 inches in 2003, 21.8 inches in 2008 and 21.5 inches in 2009.  Female pike averaged 21.8 inches in 2003, 25.9 inches in 2008 and 26.5 inches in 2009.  The maximum size caught during sampling increased from 32.8 inches in 2003 and 34.6 inches in 2008 to 35.3 inches in 2009. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant Lake is a 742 acre, located approximately 10 miles northeast of Orr, Minnesota.  Approximately 45 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Bass, panfish, walleye, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, investigations will be used to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were caught, including bluegill, black crappie, and pumpkinseed.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small.  However, black crappie was a notable exception; abundance was above what is typically found in most lakes of this type and size reached 10.8 inches.  Strong 2005 and 2007 year-classes were found, which should continue to keep numbers and size above average.   <br> \n <br> \nIn an attempt to improve the size structure of the northern pike population, an experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike under 40 inches was enacted on May 10, 2003.  In 2009, northern pike abundance was below the typical range for this lake type.  However, growth was fast and individuals were large; the average weight was 4.6 pounds, which is well above the typical range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 18.4-31.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are abundant in Elephant Lake.  Fish up to 18.5 inches were captured during this investigation and should provide those seeking smallmouth bass with good fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has fluctuated greatly throughout the past 40 years.  In 2009, abundance was below the level found in the previous investigation (2006), but still remained above the level observed in most lakes of this type.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-12 years.  Walleye fishing in the near future looks bright; the 2006 year-class represented 62 percent of the sample and the 2002 year-class remained strong.  Size in the sample ranged from 8.8-23.1 inches and the average was 14.2.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but are likely more important as forage for predators than as a recreational fish for anglers.  Less than 1 percent were above 9 inches.  </p>",

Historically, Elephant Lake has had a relatively low density northern pike population and angler reports indicate that large northern pike were once present.  In an effort to improve size structure, an experimental regulation requiring the release of all northern pike under 40 inches was enacted on May 10, 2003.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, the current investigation was part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used from April 25-29, 2011 to sample 116 northern pike (61 male, 55 female, and 0 unknown).  Northern pike were captured at a rate of 5.27 fish per set.  Total length for all northern pike ranged from 13.2 to 28.4 inches and the mean was 22.0.  Total length for male northern pike ranged from 13.2 to 28.2 inches and the mean was 20.8.  Total length for female northern pike ranged from 14.8 to 28.4 inches and the mean was 23.2.  </p>",

Historically, Elephant Lake has had a relatively low density northern pike population and angler reports indicate that large northern pike were once present.  In an effort to improve size structure, an experimental regulation requiring the release of all northern pike under 40 inches was enacted on May 10, 2003.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, the current investigation was part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used at ice-out to sample 115 northern pike from April 2-5, 2010 (94 male, 16 female, and 5 unknown).  Northern pike were captured at a rate of 3.83 fish per set.  Total length for all northern pike ranged from 13.7 to 34.2 inches and the mean was 20.6.  Total length for male northern pike ranged from 14.8 to 26.7 inches and the mean was 20.0.  Total length for female northern pike ranged from 22.0 to 34.2 inches and the mean was 25.1.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant Lake is located approximately 10 miles northeast of Orr, Minnesota.  This 728 acre lake has a maximum depth of 30 feet, and about half of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Elephant is part of the Sentinel Lake program, meaning that it is subject to more frequent and intensive lake surveys to monitor long term environmental changes. A fisheries survey was completed in Elephant Lake during the 2019 field season as part of a regular rotation of surveys in the International Falls Management Area. Anglers familiar with Elephant Lake should note that the experimental regulation for Northern Pike was repealed in 2020 after it failed to significantly improve the size structure of the population.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at fairly low numbers in the near-shore trap nets during the 2019 survey. However, the catch rates in the gill nets were above average for this type of lake. The average size was also bigger than what would be expected for Elephant Lake. Crappies in the trap nets averaged about 9 inches while the gill nets produced an average of about 10 inches. Growth rates were similar to other lakes in the International Falls Management Area. A strong 2010 year class (age 9 at the time of this survey) made up 40% of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers looking for panfish also have an abundant Bluegill population to target. Shallow trap nets sampled Bluegill from 3 to 8 inches, while the deeper gill nets produced Bluegill from 5 to 9.5 inches. Growth rates were slightly slower than the average International Falls area lake. The maximum age for Bluegill during this survey was 10 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were the second highest ever recorded for Elephant Lake. The average size was similar to past surveys, which have shown that Elephant Lake has a Northern Pike population with an above average size structure. Length averaged 25 inches and the largest were over 35 inches during this survey. The average weight was just over 4 pounds. Growth rates were faster than the average International Falls area lake. Ages ranged from 2 to 10 years, but a few recent strong year classes made up the majority of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nEquipment failures prevented Smallmouth Bass electrofishing in 2019, which is the preferred method to assess bass populations. However, gill nets sampled enough of these fish to gain some information about the population. Catch rates were average for this type of lake. Sizes ranged from 10 to just over 17 inches and growth was above average for this area. Ages ranged from 4 to 9 years, and the 2015 year class (age 4 at the time of this survey) made up 60% of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has fluctuated greatly throughout the history of surveys for Elephant Lake, and experimental stocking on top of the naturally reproducing population has been tried without much success in the past. The 2019 survey produced catch rates within the expected range for this type of lake; however, this is less than what has been historically caught in Elephant Lake. A lack of recent year classes has produced a population of fairly old and large Walleye. Lengths during the survey ranged from 18 to 30.5 inches, and an average Walleye was over 23 inches. Ages ranged from 8 to 17 years, and particularly strong year classes in 2011 and 2006 dominated the catch. There is a good stock of spawning fish in Elephant Lake, but expanding populations of other gamefish may be suppressing recent year classes. MN DNR will continue to monitor the success or failure of new year classes in Elephant Lake and adjust management strategies accordingly.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are extremely abundant in Elephant Lake, and likely provide the forage base for most of the larger predators. Catch rates in 2019 were well above average for this type of lake. The average size was normal, with lengths ranging from about 5 to 10 inches. Most Yellow Perch were age 4 or younger, however some of the older fish appear to reach sizes that would be of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught during this survey include Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant Lake is a 742 acre lake located 10 miles northeast of Orr, Minnesota.  Moderately fertile this 44% littoral lake stratifies by mid-July.  Large stands of emergent aquatic vegetation and hard sand shores provide cover and spawning areas for the centrarchid community which is dominated by black crappie and smallmouth bass.  Walleye, yellow perch and white sucker are also common with lower abundance of northern pike, pumpkinseed and bluegill present in the fish community.     The 2001 lake survey found high number of fast growing black crappie with an average length of 9.5 inches with several crappies over 12 inches.  Spring electrofishing sampled large numbers of smallmouth bass.  The average bass measured 7.5 inches although a few fish over 14 inches were also measured.     Walleye numbers in 2001 were typical of this class of lake.  Growth was good with an average walleye measuring 15.8 inches and ranged from 8.9 to 22.2 inches.  Northern pike numbers were low but with an average length of 27.5 inches, the quality made up for the quantity.     High numbers of yellow perch and white sucker provided ample forage for the game fish.</p>",

Bass, northern pike, panfish, and walleye dominate the sport-fish community.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were captured, including black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small.  However, black crappie was a notable exception.  Anglers can expect good crappie fishing.  The number captured was near the upper end of the normal range for this lake type and size was good.  Fish up to 11.9 inches were captured and the mean was 10.1.  Mean weight was 0.61 pounds, which was slightly above the normal range for this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nFew walleyes were captured in trap nets, but those captured were generally large.  Walleye trap-net abundance was below the normal range for this lake type.  Total length ranged from 16.5 to 21.7 inches and the mean was 18.7.  Mean weight was 2.15 pounds, which was near the upper end of the normal range for this lake type.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant is a 742-acre lake located northeast of Cusson.  It is a relatively shallow lake with a small basin of deeper water with a maximum depth of 30 feet.  Historically, Elephant Lake has had a relatively sparse northern pike population.  Spawning and nursery habitat for pike is limited.  Reports from local anglers indicate, however, that in the past, the lake contained large individuals.  In an attempt to improve the size structure of the northern pike population, an experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike under 40 inches in length, was enacted on May 10, 2003.  <br> \n  <br> \nTrap netting during the week of ice out in 2008 produced a total catch of 75 northern pike, or 1.92 per net.  The size structure of the catch had shifted toward larger fish when compared to 2003, the only previous ice out sampling on record.  Male pike averaged 20.8 inches in 2003 and 21.8 inches in 2008.  Female pike averaged 21.8 inches in 2003 and 25.9 inches in 2008.  The maximum size caught during sampling increased from 32.8 inches in 2003 to 34.6 inches in 2008.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elephant Lake is 728 acres and located approximately 10 miles northeast of Orr, Minnesota.  Approximately 45 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Bass, northern pike, panfish, walleye, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.  Elephant Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, investigations will be used to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were caught, including bluegill, black crappie, and pumpkinseed.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small in the past.  However, recently black crappie and bluegill have been notable exceptions. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was above what is typically found in most lakes of this type and size reached 12.2 inches.  A strong year-class in 2011 should continue to keep numbers and size above average.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was near the high end of what is typically found in most lakes of this type and the highest level ever recorded in Elephant Lake.  Size reached 8.2 inches.  The 2011 year-class was outstanding and should continue to keep numbers and size above average. <br> \n <br> \nIn an attempt to improve the size structure of the northern pike population, an experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike under 40 inches was enacted on May 10, 2003.  In 2014, northern pike abundance was within the typical range for this lake type.  Growth was fast and individuals were large; the average weight was 3.9 pounds, which was slightly above the typical range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 20.0-31.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are abundant in Elephant Lake.  Fish up to 18.5 inches were captured during this investigation and should provide those seeking smallmouth bass with good fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has fluctuated greatly throughout the past 45 years.  Stocking has occurred numerous times up until 1996 and no difference was detected in the strength of walleye year-classes between stocked and un-stocked years.  In 2014, abundance was within the expected range for lakes of this type, but it was the lowest abundance ever recorded on Elephant Lake.  A healthy number of year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-17 years.  Size in the sample ranged from 8.8-23.1 inches and the average was 14.2.  Walleye fishing in the near future should be similar to recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but are likely more important as forage for predators than as a recreational fish for anglers.  Only about 5 percent were above 9 inches.  </p>",
