                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is the largest lake in the Chisago City area.  It has three distinct basins: the north end, which is commonly called Little Green, the large windswept main basin, and the southern end, which consists of shallow bays with abundant vegetation.  Green and blue-green algaes flourish in the summer, with average water clarity around 4.2 feet.  The lakeshore is heavily developed, with 335 homes. Two invasive plant species, Eurasian watermilfoil and curlyleaf pondweed, are present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management includes annual fingerling stocking at a rate of 0.8 pounds per littoral acre (1,000 pounds) and a 17 inch minimum harvest regulation. Walleye abundance remains within the normal range for this lake type.  However, catch rates continue to trend downward despite the change from biennial to annual stocking.  Yellow Perch, a key Walleye forage, has been in low abundance since the 1991 assessment.  Despite the 17 inch minimum length regulation, most of the Walleye measured during the assessment exceeded 17 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake continues to support a quality Northern Pike population, with an average length of 25 inches and fish in the mid-thirties present. Largemouth Bass are abundant with about one-quarter of adult bass 14 inches or longer.  Requiring 6 to 7 years to reach a length of 12 inches, bass growth remains slow. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill are the species most frequently caught by anglers on Green Lake, and abundance of both species is normal compared to similar lakes. Although some larger individuals are present, anglers will most often encounter 7-8 inch Black Crappies and 6 inch Bluegills. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake (1,714 acres) in Chisago County is the largest lake in the Chisago Chain of Lakes.  It is characterized by three distinct basins: the north end which is commonly called Little Green, the centrally located main basin, and the southern end which encompasses many shallow bays.  The lake was most likely named by its natural green coloration taken on during the summer months.  This is primarily due to tiny free-floating plants found in the water, called algae.   Algae are in most lakes throughout the world, however, different types of lakes may have different kinds of algal species present.  In Green Lake, green and blue-green algae flourish well in the summer time, which is typically the growing season for most plants.  During very warm temperatures, the lake may take on a green color due to alga blooms causing clarity readings to average around 4.2 feet from the surface.The Department of Natural Resources, Section of Fisheries manages the lake as one body of water.  Fish stocking consists of walleye fingerlings stocked on an every other year basis.  This is done to supplement the natural walleye population which sustains itself at low levels.  Netting assessments are done on a 5-year rotation to keep an inventory of the present fish population.  This information helps to refine long-term management strategies for benefiting the fish, lake,  and its users.  The DNR also encourages carp removal by licensed commercial fishermen.  Since 1990, the lake has been chemically treated several times in the fight against Eurasian water milfoil infestation.During July 22-26, 1996, a lake survey was conducted on Green Lake to evaluate the present fish population status.  Gear types used consisted of fifteen gillnets, ten trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass, and shoreline seining.  The following paragraphs describe how the net catch relates to the abundances and the condition of the fish population.  Green Lake is in lake class 24 and fish abundances are based on the mean ranges observed in other lake class 24 lakes.  Not related to this netting survey, there was a \"creel survey\" in progress on Green Lake by the research unit of the fisheries section.  This survey started in 1995 and continued into 1997.  It was used to gather angler catch/harvest information in conjunction to the new experimental regulation for crappie in Green Lake,  minimum size limit - 9 inches, effective March 1, 1997.The walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake.  Sizes ranged from 8.3 to 31.5 inches with the average fish being 16.4 inches long.  The average walleye sampled weighed 1.8 pounds.  Ages two through six and eight through ten were represented in the catch sample with 88% of the walleye being of age five or less.  Their growth rates were typical of statewide averages. Past catches from all surveys have found walleye to maintain numbers similar to this survey.  Surveys like this one have been conducted on Green Lake since 1941, but we have been using data since 1956 for comparison sake.  Nine surveys since 1956 have concluded the same thing in terms of the walleye population: walleye in this lake can exist naturally without the use of stocking.  The key to remember, though, is that poor lakeshore use or poor development practices poses the greatest affect to the walleye natural spawning grounds in Green Lake.  Walleye spawning habitat consists of clean gravel/rock blankets along the shore in shallow depths.  Keeping a band of gravel clear of excess siltation or sand will allow for adequate spawning capabilities.  But to ensure against low or bad hatches on any given year, stocking has bolstered or supplemented the walleye numbers to maintain normal abundance.  Green Lake is a popular walleye lake near the metro area receiving a great deal of angler use and harvest.  It would only seem prudent to maintain the walleye spawning habitat and not lose that type of fishing opportunity.The northern pike abundance was above normal for this lake type.  It was the highest catch dating back to 1956.  This was good news in terms of where they had been.  They were experiencing low levels over the last ten years but now hold strong numbers from good pike hatches coming from 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Three year-olds dominated the catch and averaged 20 inches long.  All pike sampled ranged from 16.9 to 28.7 inches with a 20.6 inch average.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds.  Stocking of northern pike has occurred at various times through the years with little or no impact to their numbers.  They rely on good natural \"year-class\" hatches in the lake and having an adequate food source as they grow, preferably yellow perch.  Perch numbers were drastically low for many years, increased some ten years ago, but now are low again. Night electrofishing is a technique used to sample largemouth bass.  This method momentarily stuns the fish so they can be collected for measurements and then released.  The sample of bass ranged in length from 5.8 to 16.5 inches, averaging 11.7 inches.  They were sampled at a rate of 43 fish per hour which indicates a good catch in relation to the habitat sampled for the lake.  Green Lake has long been popular for bass fishing providing many catches to various types of angling public.  If this is to continue, a thing to remember is to keep an adequate amount of habitat available to their liking.  Aquatic vegetation is their number one preference for cover, however, they have had a variety of stumps and flooded timber to use the past few decades.  These stumps originated as being mature trees many years ago (probably before 1900), which meant the lake was much shallower for a long period of time then.  Now that the lake is up and the stumps are in one to five foot depths, the bass are benefiting from the extra cover.  It will not last forever though, stumps are shifted or moved by ice cover, wave action,  and of course, man.  This leaves only the aquatic plants and lake contour to maintain bass abundance at desirable levels.The black crappie abundance was normal during this survey and reflects where they have stayed for many years.  Since 1956, crappie in Green Lake maintained good population levels but a slight shift toward smaller fish has been noted recently.  The fish sampled this year ranged from 3.9 to 9.4 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.  The average weight was 0.20 pounds.  Age-growth rates were normal.   The shoreline seining catch (which measures the numbers of natural hatch from that year) for crappie was very good with fish averaging 1.7 inches on July 31, 1996.  Annual crappie spawning success is usually good in Green Lake where as this is not a common trait found in the average lake.  Typically, crappie populations tend to cycle from low numbers to high numbers and their size structure varies in each lake dependant upon things like growth rate, harvest, etc...  The purpose of the experimental regulation mentioned earlier (min. length to keep - 9 inches) is to see if there can be a shift from smaller (8 inch) crappie to larger (10 inch) crappie, over a seven year study period.  We know the crappie harvest is very high each winter and spring, but the average fish kept is around eight inches or less.  Very few crappie above the nine inch size are seen.  The logic of the experimental regulation is that if crappies were protected from harvest until they reached nine inches, more quality size crappies would be available for harvest.  Hopefully, this release practice will allow for crappie to live longer and grow to longer lengths.  Being a \"study\", if it works - great, if it is found not to work, the experimental  regulation would most likely be dropped. Bluegill are readily caught on this lake and this surveys catch was no different than the 1991 catch.  Ten years ago in 1986, the bluegill were sampled in very high abundance but numbers have since returned to normal for this lake type.  Like crappie, bluegill can be a cyclic fish species going from highs to lows.  Green Lake has experienced that trend with numbers being very low in some of the earlier surveys and now maintaining some sort of norm.  The fish sampled ranged from 2.8 to 7.6 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  Shoreline seining did not record very many bluegill which may indicate a poor hatching year for them.Yellow perch abundance was very low this year.  Historically, they have carried low populations except in 1986 and 1991, when their numbers were normal.  A low catch was also sighted in the shoreline seining efforts.  This decrease could be related, in-part, to higher northern pike and walleye levels but is by no means predictable in this lake.Common carp in Green Lake were recorded in the 1941 survey.  There was no other information on file suggesting when they first appeared in the lake but we do know they were introduced to the United States in 1872.  Stockings in Minnesota occurred in 1883.  Most of the surveys since 1941 have shown carp to be present but not in alarming numbers.  In fact the 1996 catch sampled the highest catch ever but was considered normal for this type of lake.  Carp use the shallow bay areas when spawning during late spring and this is probably the time when people see them the most.  It does not appear that their presence greatly affects the game fish population and it is certain that the carp are here to stay.In December of 1993, a fifty pound lake sturgeon was caught through the ice by an angler.  Pictures and records are available on file.  The most logical source of this old fish would be a migrant fish from the Sunrise River, which flows into St. Croix River which is home to sturgeon.Eight other species were represented in the netting gear: channel catfish, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and golden shiner.  The abundance levels were low for the bullhead species and normal for the remaining five species.Prepared by:   Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Green Lake has been surveyed every three to five years since 1956.  The lake was assessed during July of 1991 with 15 gillnets, 10 trapnets, and six shoreline stations were seined.  The results of each survey were compared to previous surveys to assess trends in the fish populations.  Net catches and growth rates were compared to statewide medians for the same lake type.  \n  The northern pike net catch (0.20/set) was far below the first quartile (1.75/set) indicating a small population, but remained unchanged from the 1986 survey.  The northern pike ranged in length from 19.0 to 24.9 inches with a median length group of 21.0 to 21.9 inches.  The mean weight was 2.36 pounds, which is similar to the statewide median (2.44 pounds).  Only two ages of northern pike were identified (3 and 5 year olds).  The average back-calculated lengths were similar to statewide averages and to the 1986 survey lengths for northern pike.\n  Although the walleye net catch was significantly lower in 1991 (6.07/set) than 1986 (8.67/set), the net catch was above both the statewide median (2.28/set) and third quartile (4.00/set).  The walleye ranged in length from 7.5 to 27.9 inches with a median length group of 11.5 to 11.9 inches.  The walleye were of average weight (1.63 pounds).  Age analysis indicated fish of ages one through eight years.  Limited walleye reproduction may occur in Green Lake since fish from the 1985 year class were captured.  And walleye were not stocked during 1985 and yearlings were not stocked during 1986.  The average back- calculated lengths indicates a normal growing population when compared to statewide averages.\n  The bluegill net catch (26.4/set) was much lower than the 1986 survey (94.00/set), but was slightly higher than the statewide median (21.79/set).  The bluegill ranged from 4.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches.  The average weight (0.15 pounds) was below the statewide median (0.19 pounds) but above the first quartile (0.19 pounds).  Although the net catch decreased dramatically from the 1986 survey, the average length and weight changed very little.  Two hundred and thirty nine young of the year bluegill were seined.\n  The largemouth bass net catch (0.20/set) was below the statewide median (0.25/set), but above the first quartile (0.17/set).  The length for largemouth bass ranged from 10.0 to 12.9 inches with a median length group of 10.5 to 10.9 inches.  The average weight (0.30 pounds) was below the statewide median (0.76 pounds), but above the first quartile (0.25 pounds).  The largemouth bass ranged in age from one to three years old.  The average back calculated lengths were similar to statewide averages.  Fifteen young of the year largemouth bass were captured in seines.\n  The black crappie net catch (8.90/set) decreased from 14.56/set in 1986, but was still the second highest recorded catch in Green Lake.  The net catch was above the statewide median (5.86/set).  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 7.0 to 7.4 inches.  The average weight (0.17 pounds) was below both the statewide median (0.28 pounds) and the first quartile (0.21 pounds).  The average weight was below that of the 1986 survey (0.24 pounds).  Seining failed to captured young of the year black crappie.\n The yellow perch net catch (17.33/set) was significantly higher than the 1986 survey (9.93/set) and was the highest recorded catch in Green Lake.  The net catch was slightly higher than the statewide median (12.75/set).  The yellow perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  The mean weight (0.11 pounds) was below the statewide median (0.14 pounds), but above the first quartile (0.10 pounds).  Two young of the year yellow perch were seined. \n  One channel catfish was captured, which was in the length group 23.0 to 23.9 inches and weighed 5.50 pounds.  Eight other species were captured during the survey (carp, golden shiner, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed).  The net catches for these species were all near their statewide median, except the white sucker and black bullhead were below the median and first quartile ranges.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake (1,714 acres) in Chisago County is the largest lake in the Chisago Chain of Lakes.  It is characterized by three distinct basins: the north end which is commonly called Little Green, the centrally located main basin, and the southern end which encompasses many shallow bays.  The Department of Natural Resources, Section of Fisheries manages the lake as one body of water.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical and biological similarities.  Green Lake is assigned to lake class 24.     <br> \n <br> \nIn Green Lake, green and blue-green algae flourish well in the summer time, which is typically the growing season for most plants.  During very warm temperatures, the lake may take on a green color due to algae blooms causing clarity readings to average around 4.2 feet from the surface.  Development is substantial on the lake, with 335 residences counted during the survey of 2006. <br> \n <br> \nFish stocking consists of walleye fingerlings at a rate of one pound per littoral area (1,228 pounds) on an every other year basis.  This is done to supplement the natural walleye population which sustains itself at low levels.  Netting assessments are done on a 5-year rotation to keep an inventory of the present fish population.  The DNR also encourages carp removal by licensed commercial fishermen.   <br> \n <br> \nLong range management goals for Green Lake include maintaining the walleye gillnet catch near 5 per set with a 1.5 pound average and the northern pike catch between 2 and 4 per net with a 2.5 pound average.  Green Lake is also included in a statewide experimental regulation research project.  In 1997, a 9 inch minimum size limit was implemented for black crappie.  The daily bag limit remained unchanged.  The goal of the regulation was to increase the portion of crappies greater than 10 inches to 5% of the population while maintaining the current angler harvest in pounds.  This regulation has been extended until 2010, at which time decisions will be made to implement it permanently, modify or eliminate the existing regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring the week of July 24 2006, a survey was conducted on Green Lake to evaluate the present fish population status.  Fish sampling types consisted of fifteen gillnets, ten trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass, and shoreline seining.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe walleye abundance (3.1/net) was normal for this type of lake, but was short of the goal of 5 per net.  Sizes ranged from 8.6 to 29.6 inches with the average fish being 20.3 inches long.  The average walleye sampled weighed 3.3 pounds, which was well above the goal of 1.5 pounds.  Over 12% of the walleyes sampled were greater than 25 inches in length.  Ages two through eleven except age three were represented in the catch sample with 80% of the walleye being of age five or more.  Their growth rates were typical of statewide averages. Past catches from all surveys have found walleye to maintain numbers similar to this survey.  Nine surveys since 1956 have concluded the same thing in terms of the walleye population: walleye in this lake can exist naturally without the use of stocking.  Poor lakeshore use and poor development practices pose the greatest threat to the walleye natural spawning grounds in Green Lake.  Walleye spawning habitat consists of clean gravel/rock blankets along the shore in shallow depths.  Keeping a band of gravel clear of excess siltation or sand will allow for adequate spawning capabilities.  However, to ensure against low or bad hatches on any given year, stocking has bolstered or supplemented the walleye numbers to maintain normal abundance.  Green Lake is a popular walleye lake near the metro area receiving a great deal of angler use and harvest.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike abundance (5.2/net) was normal for this lake type and exceeded long range goals.  Sizes ranged from 18.7 to 36.6 inches with the average fish being 25.4 inches long.  The average northern sampled weighed 3.9 pounds, which was also above the long range goal of 2.5 pounds.  Nearly 12% of the catch was greater than 30 inches in length.  Ages three through nine were represented in the catch sample.  Their growth rates were typical of statewide averages.  Five year-olds dominated the catch and averaged 25 inches long.  Stocking of northern pike has occurred at various times through the years with little or no impact to their numbers.  They rely on good natural \"year-class\" hatches in the lake and having an adequate food source as they grow, preferably yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on May 31, 2006.  This electrofishing effort yielded an average of 103 bass per hour.  The bass that were sampled ranged in length from 6.6 to 19.8 inches, averaging 11.0 inches.  Seventy-one percent of the catch was less than 12 inches.  Scale samples indicated that the largemouth bass catch was well distributed from the 1996 to the 2003 year classes.  Nearly 60 percent of the catch was 4 and 5 year old fish averaging 10.2 inches.  Growth was slow compared to the statewide average.  The number of bass sampled increased significantly from what was sampled in 2001 (43 bass/hr).   <br> \n <br> \nBoth gillnets and trapnets are used to evaluate the black crappie population.  The black crappie gillnet catch (30.3/set) was well above normal compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Lengths ranged from 4.3 to 8.6 inches with an average of 5.7 inches.  However, the trapnet catch (12.7/set) was within normal range of abundance when compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Lengths here ranged from 6.5 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  Green Lake has maintained consistent population levels but a slight shift toward smaller fish has been noted recently.  The average weight in all surveys has been very constant around 0.20 pounds.  Age-growth rates were slow compared to the statewide average.  Annual crappie spawning success is usually good in Green Lake.  The purpose of the experimental regulation mentioned earlier is to see if there can be a shift from smaller crappie to larger crappie.  Data from creel surveys indicate that the crappie harvest is very high each winter and spring, but the average fish kept is around eight inches or less.  Very few crappies above the nine inch size are seen.  The logic of the special regulation is that if crappies were protected from harvest until they reached nine inches, more quality size crappies would be available for harvest.  At this time, it is apparent that the regulation has not dramatically improved the crappie population size structure, abundance still fluctuates, and growth rates have not improved.  Angler creel surveys have indicated that angler noncompliance may be limiting the effect of the regulation on the crappie population.  However, slow growth rates may hamper Green Lake crappies likelihood to exceed 9-inches.  The experimental regulation was set to expire in the spring of 2005.  A public input meeting was held in November of 2004, and a consensus was reached to extend the regulation another five years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch (31.5/set) was normal compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  This year's catch ranged in length from 3.3 to 7.1 inches with an average of 6.1 inches.  Nearly seventy percent of the bluegill catch were greater than six inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gillnet catch (2.5/set) was normal compare to similar Minnesota lakes.    Historically, they have carried low populations except in 1986 and 1991, when their numbers were normal.  The sample of perch ranged in length from 5.6 to 7.2 inches, averaging 6.4 inches.  The rebound of yellow perch is good news as they provide a good forage base for walleye and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nSeven other species were represented in the netting gear: black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and common carp.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Comprised of three distinct basins (the north end commonly called Little Green, the central main basin, and and a series of bays on the south end) Green lake, at 1,714 acres is the largest lake in Chisago county.  Summer algae blooms limit water clarity between 4 and 5 feet.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Green lake is assigned to lake class 24.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Green lake was netted and electrofished during the summer of 2001.Green lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and black crappie.  The lake management plan calls for walleye fingerling stocking (1,228 pounds) on alternate years and northern pike stocking (31,000 fingerlings) when net catches fall below 1.5 per gillnet.  A 9 inch minimum size limit for black crappie was implemented in 1997 as part of a state wide experimental regulation study.  Long range management goals for Green lake include maintaining the walleye gillnet catch near 5 per set with a 1.5 pound average and the northern pike catch between 2 and 4 per net with a 2.5 pound average.The gillnet catches for northern pike, walleye, and black crappie were within the normal range when compared to lakes in Green's lake class.  The yellow perch catch was very low with only 3 being taken.  The 1996 catch rate was identical but as recently as 1991 the catch rate was above the 50 percentile for the lake class.  The northern pike catch met the management goal for size with a 3.2 pound mean.  The catch rate of 1.5 per net fell below the management goal.  However both indicies were normal compared to other catches in the lake class.  Northerns ranged in length from 19.4 to 28.9 inches with a 24.0 inch average.  The 1996 catch was noticeably higher at 6.7/set but in both 1991 and 1986 the catch was a mere 0.2/set.  The 1997 year class was dominate, accounting for 46% of the catch.  These four year old fish averaged 24 inches and should provide quality angling.Walleye met management goals for size but fell short in numbers.  Both catch rate (4.1 per net) and average weight (1.9 pounds) compared favorably to other lakes in the class.  The 2001 netting marks the first time in 20 years the walleye catch rate has fallen below 5.0/net.  Sampled walleye ranged from 9.3 to 29.0 inches with a 16.9 inch mean.  Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 12 years with strong year classes from 1996 to 1998.  The 1998 year class provided 34% of the catch and averaged 13.4 inches.  Walleye growth was normal compared to the statewide average. Both the trapnets and the gillnets sampled black crappie above the lake class 50 percentile in numbers and at the 50 percentile in weight.  The combined catch ranged from 3.8 to 9.5 inches with a 7.4 inch mean.  There were no crappie over 10 inches sampled during the netting; therefore the management goal for crappie was not met.  Three year old crappies from the 1998 year class represented 58% of the catch and averaged 7 inches.  Based on scale aging, crappie growth slowed significantly at age three.       The yellow perch gillnet catch was very low with only 3 fish being sampled.  The catch was identical in 1996 but as recently as 1991 the catch rate was 17.3 per set.  The current low perch abundance may be limiting walleye and northern pike production.Bluegill were sampled at normal levels compared to other lake class catches.  The trapnet catch rate (42.7/set) was quite an increase from the 1996 catch of 17.2 per net.  Sampled bluegill were small compared to other lakes in the class, falling below the normal range for size for the first time in 15 years.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.0 to 6.9 inches with a 5.2 inch mean.Night electrofishing on May 10, 2001 sampled 43.6 bass per hour, very similar to the 1996 catch.  The 71 bass ranged from 6.1 to 18.2 inches with a 10.9 inch and 0.8 pound average.  Sampled bass were nearly an inch smaller on average compared to the 1996 catch.  Bass ranged in age from two to eight years with the strong year classes from 1996 to 1998.  The 1998 class accounted for 34% of the catch and while only 3 years old averaged 9.1 inches.  Bass growth was similar to the statewide norm.    The 2001 catch indicated that while the management goals for walleye and northern pike were met based on size, both species fell short of their goal numbers.  The northern pike catch rate was very near the stocking threshold.  The black crappie goal was not met since no fish over 10 inches were sampled, however the mean length of sampled crappie did increase a full inch since 1996.  The largemouth bass catch increased slightly in numbers and decreased slightly in size but appears healthy overall.  Other species present included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is the largest lake in the Chisago City area.  It has three distinct basins: the north end, which is commonly called Little Green, the large windswept main basin, and the southern end, which consists of shallow bays with abundant vegetation.  Green and blue-green algae flourish in the summer, with average water clarity around 4.2 feet.  The lakeshore is heavily developed, with 335 homes. Two invasive plant species, Eurasian watermilfoil and curlyleaf pondweed, are present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management includes annual fingerling stocking at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (1,228 pounds) and a 17 inch minimum harvest regulation. Walleye abundance is within the normal range for this lake type, although survey gill net catch rates have decreased since peaking in 1986.   A recent management change from biennial to annual fingerling stocking may help to boost walleye numbers; however, yellow perch, an important prey for walleye, have been declining as well. A 17 inch minimum length regulation is in effect for walleye, but nearly half the walleye caught in gill nets in the 2011 assessment were 17 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nGreen lake has a quality northern pike population, with an average length of 24 inches and large fish up to 35 inches present. Largemouth bass are abundant, but most of the bass have lengths less than 12 inches.  Green Lake largemouth bass require 6 to 7 years to reach a length of 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill are the species most frequently caught by anglers on Green Lake, and abundance of both species is normal compared with similar lakes. Although some larger individuals are present, anglers will most often see 7-8 inch crappies and 6 inch bluegills.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is the largest lake in the Chisago City area.  It has three distinct basins: the north end, which is commonly called Little Green, the large windswept main basin, and the southern end, which consists of shallow bays with abundant vegetation.  Green and blue-green algae flourish in the summer, with average water clarity around 4.2 feet.  The lakeshore is heavily developed, with 335 homes. Two invasive plant species, Eurasian watermilfoil and curlyleaf pondweed, are present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management includes biennial fingerling stocking at a rate of 1.3 pounds per littoral acre (1,596 pounds) and a 17 inch minimum harvest regulation. Walleye abundance remains within the normal range for this lake type.  Yellow Perch, a key Walleye forage, has been in low abundance since the 1991 assessment.  Despite the 17 inch minimum length regulation, most of the Walleye measured during the assessment once again exceeded 17 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake continues to support a quality Northern Pike population, with an average length of 22 inches and fish in the mid-thirties present. Largemouth Bass are abundant with about one-quarter of adult bass 14 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill are the species most frequently caught by anglers on Green Lake, and abundance of both species is normal compared to similar lakes. Although some larger individuals are present, anglers will most often encounter 7-8 inch Black Crappies and Bluegill between 6 and 7 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is the largest lake (1,714 acres) in the Chisago City area.  It has three distinct basins: the north end, which is commonly called Little Green, the large windswept main basin, and the southern end, which consists of shallow bays with abundant vegetation.  Green and blue-green algae are common in the summer, with average water clarity around 4 feet.  The lakeshore is heavily developed, with over 300 homes. Two invasive plant species Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed are present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management includes fingerling stocking at a rate of 1.3 pounds per littoral acre (acres of water less than 15 feet deep; 1,596 pounds) in even years (2018, 2020, 2022, etc.) and a 17-inch minimum harvest regulation. Walleye catch rates remain within the normal range for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch, a key Walleye prey species, have had low catch rates since the early 1990s.  Despite a 17-inch minimum length regulation, most of the Walleye sampled during the assessment once again exceeded 17 inches in length.  Green Lake continues to support a quality Northern Pike population, with an average length approaching 25 inches with fish in the upper 30-inch range present. Black Crappie and Bluegill are the species most frequently caught by anglers on Green Lake.  Numbers of each are average and high respectively, compared to similar lakes. Although some larger individuals are present, anglers will most often encounter 7-8 inch Black Crappies and 6-7 inch Bluegill. <br> \n</p>",

The yellow perch at 1.22 is extremely low.  The yellow bullhead at 23.00 per gill net set was extremely high.  Ample populations of largemouth bass and panfish known from previous surveys.  Fish population evaluation based on total acreage of Big Green and Little Green Lakes.  * See additional information.\n* Additional information:  Previous surveys and test netting results have been based on a total acreage of Big and Little Green Lakes combined.  Due to what is normally a narrow channel connecting the two lakes, the net catches should be separated accordingly for making proper management decisions and recommendations.
