                "narrative": "<p>     Fish Lake is a 435-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of Parkers Prairie, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 17 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 9.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 13.5 feet.   <br> \n     Shoreline development is very limited.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline.  Areas of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Fish Lake is subject to periodic winterkills; therefore, fish populations can fluctuate widely dependent on the frequency and extent of winterkill events.  The most recent partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1996-97.  <br> \n     Fish Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 14.5 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 23.9 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 26.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A balanced largemouth bass population is present in Fish Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 5.4 to 19.6 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 14.7 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     A high-density black crappie population is present.  The 2008 and 2009 year classes are very strong and should provide excellent crappie angling for several years.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A quality bluegill fishery exists in Fish Lake.  Ninety percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth is fast with an average length of 7.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fish Lake is a 435-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southwest of Parkers Prairie, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 17 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   <br> \n     Shoreline development is very limited.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 79 along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Fish Lake is subject to periodic winterkills; therefore, fish populations can fluctuate dependent on the frequency and extent of winterkill events.  The most recent partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1996-97.  The Parkers Prairie Sportsman's Club operates an aeration unit during severe winters to minimize winterkill.  <br> \n     An abundant Bluegill population exists.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 41% of the Bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  The 2015 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Bluegill angling for several years.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies are also abundant.  Thirteen percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  The 2015 year class is strong and should provide consistently good crappie angling for several years.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Fish Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 435- acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of the city of Parkers Prairie, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand with areas of gravel and muck.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was five feet during the 2000 lake survey.  Previous readings ranged from 3.5 to 13.5 feet.  A public access is located on the east shoreline.     Light development exists around the lake.  Emergent vegetation  (bulrush, cattail and wild rice) is prevalent in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Fish Lake can experience partial winterkills during long, harsh winters.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely dependent on the frequency of these winterkills.  The most recent partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1996-97.     Data from the population assessment indicate that there are good populations of black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye in Fish Lake.       Black crappie are present in good numbers with many fish greater than ten inches in length.  Sixty-one percent of the crappies captured in a special spring crappie assessment exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Black crappie reproduction appears to be consistently good. Crappie also exhibit good growth with an average length of 10.4 inches at four years of age.     Bluegill abundance is low, however, a quality fishery exists.  Of the bluegill sampled in the 2000 survey, 70% were greater than seven inches in length.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 9.8 inches.  Bluegill also exhibit good growth with an average length of 7.6 inches at four years of age.     Northern pike abundance is at a historical high and some good size fish are present.  Pike ranged in length from 15.9 to 29.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 1.9 pounds.       Walleye abundance has increased since the last survey.  The 1997 year class appears to be strong.  This year class corresponds to a year when walleye fry were stocked after a partial winterkill.  These fish range in length from 12 to 14 inches and should provide good walleye angling for several years.   Future walleye management on Fish Lake includes a biennial walleye fry stocking regime.  Walleye fry will also be stocked in years that a documented winterkill has occurred.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fish Lake is a 435-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of Parkers Prairie, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 17 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 8.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 13.5 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fish Lake is included in lake class 42; other area lakes in this same classification include Adley, Jacobs, and Tamarack.\n     Shoreline development is very limited.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline.  Areas of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\n     Fish Lake can experience partial winterkills during long, harsh winters.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely dependent on the frequency of these winterkills.  The most recent partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1996-97.\n     The northern pike catch rate decreased but is still within the expected range for similar lakes.  The historical high of 7.6 fish per gill net was recorded in the 2000 survey. During the 2006 assessment, northern pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 31.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 23.9 inches and 3.1 pounds.\n     The black crappie catch rate increased from the previous survey and is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Recent age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistent and that the 2004 and 2005 year classes are very strong and should provide excellent angling in the next couple years.  Black crappies in the trap net sample ranged in length from 3.2 to 9.4 inches.\n    Largemouth bass abundance appears to be low.  An electrofishing assessment may be needed to further confirm this speculation.\n     The bluegill catch rate increased from the previous survey and is now within the expected range for similar lakes.  A quality bluegill fishery exists in Fish Lake.  Of the bluegill sampled in the 2006 survey, 61% were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill ranged in length from 5.5 to 9.4 inches with a mean length of 7.1 inches.\n     The yellow perch catch rate increased from the previous survey.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.1 to 9.5 inches.\n     The walleye catch rate decreased slightly from the previous survey but is still within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 26.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 19.3 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Recent age data indicate that natural reproduction is very limited, and it appears that walleye fry stocking is  maintaining a fishable walleye population.  Future walleye management on Fish Lake includes a biennial walleye fry stocking regime.  Walleye fry will also be stocked in years that a documented winterkill has occurred. \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\n        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fish Lake is a 435-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southwest of Parkers Prairie, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 17 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   <br> \n     Shoreline development is very limited.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 79 along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can even absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Fish Lake is subject to periodic winterkills; therefore, fish populations can fluctuate dependent on the frequency and extent of winterkill events.  The most recent partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1996-97.  The Parkers Prairie Sporstman's Club operates an aeration unit during severe winters to minimize winterkill. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing survey indicate that a high-density, slow growing Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.7 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 11.8 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.1 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Fish Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
