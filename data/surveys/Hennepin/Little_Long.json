                "narrative": "<p>Little Long is a 69-acre (53 littoral acres) lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet. Little Long is located in the central portion of Minnetrista, in western Hennepin County. Little Long is primarily known for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Little Long is also known for Its exceptional water quality, making it a popular recreational destination. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the northeast side of the lake off of Game Farm Road (up to 7 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was completed on Little Long Lake during the week of 7/5/2022 to assess the fishery. Little Long Lake had excellent water clarity, measured at 16 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 52 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Little Long Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (6.5/net). There were 39 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, the highest catch in the previous four surveys. During the 2022 survey, gill netted Northern Pike averaged 21.3 inches, with the largest measured 39.8 inches. Catch and size data describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Northern Pike growth was moderate compared to similar lakes across the metro, with an average length of 17.0 inches by age 3. Recruitment was consistent with 6 consecutive year classes present during sampling and age analysis. Although the average size of Northern Pike was typical for a metro lake, the presence of a single fish greater than 39 inches is a rare occurrence and a very encouraging sign for the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Little Long Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2022 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 2 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 14.0 inches and the largest measured at 14.4 inches. Future surveys will include targeted spring boat-electrofishing component. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (23.8/net). There were 214 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 5.7 inches and the largest measured at 7.8 inches. Bluegill growth was slow with an average length of 4.5 inches by age 4 and 6.1 inches by age 6. Although average numbers of Bluegill are present in Little Long Lake, slow growth and small sizes limit angling potential. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

These characteristics allow the Minnesota DNR to stock rainbow trout twice annually. This unique situation allows anglers to fish for trout without traveling hundreds of miles. Northern pike up to 31 inches were also sampled during the survey. The average length of pike sampled was 21 inches. Growth is rather slow in this lake. Bluegills are found in average numbers but are small. They have an average length of only 5.5 inches. A 10 horsepower limit is imposed on this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake provides a unique resource in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.  The deeper parts of this cool, clear lake are able to harbor trout year round, while at the same time a community more typical of area lakes lives in the warmer shallows.  Rainbow trout are stocked semi-annually in the spring (1000 fish) and fall (500 fish).  Water quality remains good for supporting trout despite increased development in the watershed.  The warmwater fish species occur at low densities relative to area lakes and are slow growing due to the infertility of the sysstem.  Northern pike averaged 21 inches, although some larger ilndividuals have been sampled in the past.  Bluegill averaged 5.3 inches, and only 3% of individuals exceeded 7 inches.  Largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead are also present in numbers typical of this lake type.  Also present are green and hybrid sunfish, and bowfin.</p>",

This type of lake (lake class 32) is rare within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis, and therefore provides a unique fishing opportunity for anglers.  The DNR has been stocking rainbow trout one to two times annually since 1987.  The total number of rainbow trout stocked per year is as follows (stocked as yearlings unless noted):   <br> \n  <br> \n1987: 333 (ADL) <br> \n1988: 1553 <br> \n1989: 1200 (ADL) <br> \n1989: 1300 <br> \n1990: 1400  <br> \n1991: 1509 <br> \n1992: 1500 <br> \n1993: 2030 <br> \n1994: 1999 <br> \n1995: 1500 <br> \n1995: 20 (ADL) <br> \n1996: 1504 <br> \n1997: 1560 <br> \n1998: 1338 <br> \n1999: 1500 <br> \n2000: 1498 <br> \n2001: 1500 <br> \n2002: 1500 <br> \n2003: 1500 <br> \n2004: 1500 <br> \n2005: 1204 <br> \n2006: 1500  <br> \n <br> \nBrown trout (60 ADL) and brook trout (10 ADL) were also stocked into Little Long Lake in 1995. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the survey in 2006, only one rainbow trout was sampled.  The rainbow was 12.24 inches in length, and was found to be age-3.  Of the three surveys completed in years where trout were stocked into Little Long Lake (1990, 1995, 2000), only 7 total rainbow trout were sampled, with none sampled in 1990.  This is to be expected because Little Long Lake, as is with the metro\u0019s other trout lakes, is a put-and-take fishery, where anglers catch nearly all the stocked trout in between stockings.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at below average rates, but with weights that were well above average for a lake like Little Long Lake.  They ranged in length from 13.0-29.50 inches, with 64% over 20.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile the sampling gears used during this survey don\u0019t target largemouth bass, three were caught ranging from 6.0-12.5 inches in length and averaging about 0.4 lbs/ fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and black crappie were all present in low numbers, along with yellow bullheads (although they were found to be at well above average weights).  Bowfin (dogfish) were also sampled, at average numbers and weights. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is a deep, cool, clear lake located in Hennepin County.  This type of lake (Lake Class 32) is rare within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis, and therefore offers unique fishing opportunities, among them \"two-story\" management that includes trout.  Rainbow trout management via stocking yearlings, absent from 2009-2012, has resumed to provide a put-and-take winter fishery.  A public boat launch is located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Motors with more than 10 horsepower may not be used.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, Three Rivers Park District Board of Commissioners approved a purchase agreement for 127 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to the lake.  The land was once the site of Camp Kingswood, owned by the Minnesota United Methodist Church.  Three Rivers Park District will maintain the land for public use, focusing on basic stewardship and resource management. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the summer population assessment, no rainbow trout were sampled.  This is not surprising, since no stocking occurred after spring 2009.  Stocking resumed after this assessment, in time to provide fish for the 2013 winter trout season.  Typically, in Little Long Lake, as with the Metro's other trout lakes, anglers catch nearly all the stocked trout soon after season openings.  A few survivors might remain for later open-water trout seasons, which open in mid-May. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught at a below-average value, and the fish were of average size.  Sampled northerns ranged from 16.4 to 27.4 inches in length, with 20.9 inches as the average.  The average northern weighed a little over 2 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were caught at below average rates, and the fish were of average size.  Mean weight for bluegill and pumpkinseed was 0.15 lbs and 0.21 lbs, respectively.  About 58% of sampled bluegill and 42% of sampled pumpkinseeds were greater than 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, hybrids of the sunfish species, largemouth bass, bowfin (dogfish), and yellow bullhead were all present in low numbers.  The bullhead were found to be well above average in weight.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
