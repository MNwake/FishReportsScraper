                "narrative": "<p>    Anderson Lake is an 83-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  Anderson Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to Anderson Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forests.  The maximum depth is 25 feet; however, 58% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.1 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anderson Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the northeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered around the entire lakeshore.  Common cattail is prevalent along the southwest shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Anderson Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that exists.  Special spring assessments were conducted to analyze these populations.   <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists in Anderson Lake.  Age data suggest that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 2.9 to 19.2 inches with an average length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.5 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     An abundant Bluegill population exists.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 69% of the Bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.9 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies are also abundant.  Twenty-three percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.6 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n     Anderson Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anderson Lake is an 83-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County, approximately five miles east of Erhard, MN.  Anderson Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to Anderson Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forests.  The maximum depth is 25 feet; however, 58% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.1 to 7.0 feet.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anderson Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the northeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered around the entire lakeshore.  Common cattail is prevalent along the southwest shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect data for an evaluation of the Bluegill population.  Catch data indicates that an extremely abundant Bluegill population exists.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  A quality Bluegill size structure exists with 62% of the Bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length and 7% exceeding 8.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n     Anderson Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",
