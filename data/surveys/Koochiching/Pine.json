This lake was stocked with Largemouth Bass and Bluegill in 2009, and both of these species were present in the 2013 population assessment. Bluegill abundance is low to average in comparison to other small lakes in the area, with average lengths of over 7.5 inches, and fish up to 9.45 inches sampled. Largemouth Bass are abundant, and although most fish are less than 12 inches, a few larger fish can be caught as Bass up to 19 inches were sampled. Yellow Perch are abundant with an average length of 6.69 inches, and fish over 9 inches sampled. </p>",
