                "narrative": "<p>Midge Lake is a 545-acre lake located 10 miles southeast of Bemidji in northern Hubbard County.  Much of the lake is less than 10 feet deep.  There is a DNR public water access with a concrete boat ramp and parking for about six trucks/trailers located on the south shore of the lake.  Midge Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Walleye and Northern Pike.  Statewide fishing regulations are in effect for all species found in Midge Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGiven its proximity to the population center of Bemidji, Midge Lake is a popular fishing destination and receives a fair amount of attention from local anglers.  The 2021 survey documented healthy populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike in Midge Lake.  Walleye are present but in low numbers, so anglers seeking Walleye may want to turn their attention to the many other quality Walleye lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie numbers were within their historic ranges for Midge Lake and up considerably from the previous survey in 2010.  A few Bluegill over 8 inches in length were captured with a good proportion (45%) measuring between 7 and 8 inches.  The Black Crappie catch showed fish over 11 inches in length present with good numbers of smaller crappies coming up in the population.  This should provide good Bluegill and Black Crappie fishing opportunities in the near term.   <br> \n <br> \nMidge Lake has provided good fishing for Northern Pike over the years. Northern Pike up to 32 inches in length were captured in this survey with a good average size of 23 inches.  Anglers do well trolling and casting for pike on Midge Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are also sought after with good results for many anglers.  Bass over 18 inches in length were captured in this survey.  As with panfish, good numbers of smaller fish in the population bode well for the future of the lake's bass population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish present in Midge Lake are Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Midge Lake is located about 10 miles southeast of Bemidji.  The earthen access is located on the south side of the lake with parking for about six fishing rigs.  The maximum depth in Midge Lake is 24 feet, and submerged aquatic plants are present throughout most of the lake basin.  The decomposition of vegetation in the winter causes Midge Lake to experience periodic partial winterkills.  The last documented partial kill was during the winter of 1992-1993.  Northern pike, yellow perch, and bullheads are tolerant of low oxygen levels and will typically respond quickly after winter kills.  Sunfish, bass, and walleye are more susceptible to winterkill conditions and they generally must be reintroduced.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1993 (after the winterkill), 1994, 1996, and 1999.  Largemouth bass and black crappie adults were stocked in 1993 to reestablish populations probably decimated by winterkill.The panfish community in Midge Lake is currently the most notable portion of the fishery.  The angler has a choice of black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch.  Black crappie had not been sampled since 1981, but following the stocking of adult brood stock in 1993 they have reestablished a population.  The average length was around seven inches and the largest crappie measured was 10.9 inches long.  At least some bluegill appear to have survived the 1992-1993 winterkill, to spawn successfully, because the catch rate in 2000 was very high, in fact, near the all time high catch rate set in 1990, prior to the last winterkill event.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are another important component of the sunfish population.  Although they are less abundant than bluegill, they generally are more aggressive in taking a bait.  Rock bass are also common, and very willing to take a bait.  The average size for sunfish is around six inches, but some of quality size are available.  Yellow perch are also abundant and nice sized.  Twenty four percent of the measured sample was more than eight inches long.Largemouth bass were restocked after the 1993 winterkill and are once again abundant in Midge Lake.  Nearly 75% of the aged sample was from the 1998 year class.  They averaged about 7 inches long.  The largest bass captured was 15.6 inches.  Much of the lake basin is suitable bass habitat.Northern pike are more abundant in Midge Lake than in most lakes in the Bemidji area.  Natural reproduction is successful on most years and that combined with good growth rates results in a wide variety of sizes available to anglers.  The largest pike sampled in 2000 was 37.6 inches long and was 9 years old.Only five walleye were captured in the 2000 assessment.  They had an average length of 24.5 inches and an average weight of 5.7 pounds.  There is no evidence of natural reproduction, and fry stocking has not been successful recently.  Walleye from the 1999 stocking, if they were present, may have been too small to sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Midge Lake is a 520-acre lake located 10 miles southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County.  There is a concrete boat ramp with parking for about six trucks/trailers.  Midge is in lake class 38, which is a group of shallow, productive lakes with regularly shaped shorelines.  The maximum depth is 24 feet, but most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep.  Due to the shallow nature of the lake, it is prone to winterkills, which periodically kill species that are intolerant of low oxygen levels such as sunfish, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye.  These species are reintroduced after a winterkill occurs, and tend to respond favorably with fast growth rates that can produce fishable populations in just a few years.  Due to recently mild winters, Midge Lake has not experienced a winterkill since 1993-94, and the fish population has gone through the \"rearing pond\" boom and has stabilized with more typical growth rates and densities of fish.  As of this writing (March, 2011) testing indicated that oxygen levels are still adequate for fish survival throughout much of the water column, and it does not appear that a winterkill will occur in winter 2010-11.   <br> \nMidge Lake is considered to be a good multi-species fishery.  Anglers fish for panfish, yellow perch, largemouth bass and northern pike with success.  Average size of bluegill captured in the 2010 population assessment was 7.2 inches, with fish over 9.0 inches present.  Bluegill from the 2006 year class dominated the catch.  Bluegill numbers are currently lower than the average from historic assessments, but growth rates are noticeably faster than at higher population levels.  The 2006 year class of bluegill should attain quality size within the next year or two and provide some consistent fishing into the near future.  Black crappie numbers are currently at low levels, with a few fish in the 12-inch length range captured in the assessment.  Black crappie reproduction can be inconsistent in northern Minnesota lakes, and they are highly sought after by anglers.  Because of their popularity with anglers, few quality size black crappie get caught and then released.  Yellow perch numbers are also currently lower than historic levels.  A bacterial infection outbreak (Columnaris) that occurred in the late spring of 2010 killed a significant number of fish.  On the positive side, the perch population is still very fishable, and the remaining yellow perch are good sized, with an average length of 8.1 inches.  Yellow perch numbers were extremely high before the outbreak, as evidenced by the poor body condition of perch captured in the 2010 assessment.  Natural thinning of this high density perch population will likely result in improved condition and better growth.  Largemouth bass sampling conducted in 2010 showed a decent bass population, with fish up to 19.0 inches captured.  The catch rate (21 bass/hr) was comparable to other lakes managed for largemouth bass in the area, and the average size of 14.1 inches was larger than in most bass assessments.  Northern pike numbers have always been high in Midge Lake, as they are well adapted to flourishing under periodic winterkill conditions.  Previous assessments show that the pike population is often dominated by high numbers of smaller fish.  The 2010 assessment captured pike in high numbers, but the size structure of the population had improved noticeably since the last assessment (2000), as average fish weight was 3.0 pounds. Twenty five percent of all pike captured were greater than 24.0 inches in length, and the largest pike captured was 36.3 inches in length.  Northern pike have thrived on the high density perch population available for forage.  Walleye management can be effective on winterkill lakes like Midge when fry are introduced opportunistically after a winterkill.  However, regular maintenance stocking is generally not conducted on winterkill lakes.  The small number of walleye (3) captured in the 2010 assessment originated from earlier post winterkill fry stocking events.  Fish captured were large, with an average weight of 3.1 pounds.  Although present, walleye numbers may not be significant enough to warrant targeted fishing effort.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Midge Lake was conducted June 30 - July 1, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 13 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 21st, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Midge Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
