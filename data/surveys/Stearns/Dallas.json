                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike numbers (4.5/gill net) are about average compared to the local median. The predominate age 5 fish showed slower growth than the other four age classes sampled. Walleye abundance is low (0.5/gill net). The one walleye caught was the only one sampled in this watershed during 1983 surveys. Largemouth bass abundance is probably average with a catch of 0.25/trap net and several young of the year were taken by seining. Bluegill numbers are high (264.5 /trap net). The population is dominated by age 3 fish and growth is good. Other sunfish populations are also high in this lake. Black crappies (5/ trap net) are found in average numbers. Age 3, again is the strongest of four ages sampled and growth is good. White crappie numbers (0.25/trap net) are low. Yellow perch abundance (11.5/gillnet) is about average for area lakes. Rough fish species are all present in abundances near their respective local medians. Other species include bowfin, white sucker, common carp, black and yellow bullheads.</p>",
