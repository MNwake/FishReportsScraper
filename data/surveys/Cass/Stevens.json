                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gillnet catch is within the historical range of 2.0 to 7.7 per gillnet.  The northern pike capture ranged from 16 to 28 inches in length.  The trapnet catch of bluegill (24.6/TN) is similar to catches from previous assessments (ranged from 17.2 to 23.3 per trapnet).  The growth rate for bluegill is fairly slow - 8 years to attain a length of 7 inches.  Though few largemouth bass were captured, presumably due to the types of gear used, they exhibited a good length frequency (fish from 5 to 18 inches).The black crappie population appears to be fairly abundant (12.3/TN).  Fair numbers of black crappie have been captured in all previous assessments.  The length frequency of black crappie ranged from 4 to 13 inches with fish present in essentially every inch group.  There was a large number of fish (73% of catch) present in the range of 5.5 to 7.0 inches.  These fish are from the 1986 year class.  The growth rate of black crappie is good.The population of yellow perch appears to be very low; none were captured in the 1968 and 1988 assessments and very few during the 1982 and 1985 assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stevens Lake is an 105-acre lake located east of Longville, MN that has 2.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 63 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southeast shore.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stevens Lake is in Lake Class 32; lakes in this class are large, shallow, turbid, and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie and secondarily for northern pike.    Largemouth bass are present in Stevens Lake and fish up to 20 inches were sampled.  Bluegill are abundant with a mean length of 6 inches.  Of the fish sample, 53% were greater than 6 inches and fish up to 8 inches were sampled.  Black crappie are abundant in Stevens lake when compared to other Lake Class 32 lakes.  However, many of the black crappie were small.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Stevens Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

There is one outlet to Lake Twenty-Six, but the outlet was dry at the time of the survey.  Shoal water soils are: 65% sand, 20% rubble, 10% gravel, 4% muck, and 1% boulder.  Secchi reading was 11 feet.  Total alkalinity was 12.5 p.p.m.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were found; all emergents had a sparse density rating while the submerged plants had various density ratings.Test netting indicated a good fish population of largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegills and yellow bullhead. A fair northern pike population was present.  Fair northern pike spawning habitat exists during high water years.  Good largemouth bass and other centrachid spawning habitat is present.  Black grub (Neascus spp.) was the only parasite found.  Northern pike was the only species infected with Neascus.</p>",
