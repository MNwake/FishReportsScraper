THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE QUALITY INDICES (PSD AND RSD VALUES) OF THE SAMPLES OF BLUEGILL COLLECTED DURING THE VARIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  THE GROWTH RATE F OR BLUEGILL IS SLOW.  THE GROWTH CALCULATED IN 199 0 IS SLOWER THAN THE GROWTH RATE IN 1959.  (SEE SU RVEY IN FILE FOR TABLE). SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE COLLECTED IN FAIR NUMBERS .  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9 TO 19 INCHES.  THE IR GROWTH RATE APPROXIMATES THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED, FAIR NUMBERS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS, FROM 4 TO 14 INCH ES LONG, WERE COLLECTED.  THEIR GROWTH RATE APPROX IMATES THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. THE CPUE'S OF BLACK CRAPPIE WERE HIGHER THAN FROM MANY AREA LAKES, INDICATING AN ABUNDANT POPU LATION.  FISH FROM 4 TO 14 INCHES, REPRESENTING SE VERAL YEAR CLASSES, WERE SAMPLED. THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH OF 1.6 IS WITHIN THE HIS TORICAL RANGE OF 0.4 TO 1.8.

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 704-acre lake with a maximum depth of 69 feet.  It is located seven miles east of Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in lake class 23.  Lakes in this class are generally medium-sized (less than 500 acres), deep, and moderately clear. About 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less deep. The water clarity in Baby Lake was about 10 feet in July 2000, which is similar to other lakes in this part of Minnesota. At the time the lake was checked in July 2000, adequate oxygen for fish was present down to 19 feet.  A DNR-owned public access opened on the east side of the lake in 1997.  Small fishing boats can travel from Baby Lake to Mann Lake through the narrow, low-clearance outlet channel on Baby Lake's east shore.  Baby Lake is well known as a good muskellunge lake.  Muskellunge are abundant. Though most are small, fish up to 50 inches long are caught.  Anglers also have good luck catching walleye and black crappie.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and sunfish such as bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass are moderately abundant.  Northern pike are present but not abundant.  Though walleye have been present in Baby Lake for many years, this is the first survey where a large number of young fish were found.  These fish are the result of both natural reproduction and DNR stocking of Baby Lake in recent years.  The 2000 sampling showed a good  number of 13- to 17-inch walleye.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Baby Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.The Baby Lake shoreline is almost entirely in private ownership.  In 1995, a lake survey crew counted 98 lake homes and 1 resort with 12 cabins around the shoreline. Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 737 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 11.73 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a state owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally deep and very clear lakes.  Baby Lake is managed primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), Northern Pike, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and Largemouth bass are abundant. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 8 to 20 inches and averaged 14 inches.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 5 to 18 inches and averaged 9 inches.  The high abundance of Muskellunge compared to other musky lakes in Minnesota is a major draw of anglers to Baby Lake. In the spring 2012, an intensive sampling effort was undertaken to estimate the size of the Muskellunge population. Muskellunge were abundant and lengths of adult fish ranged from 26 to 44 inches and averaged 36 inches. Walleye numbers are lower than the historic high found in 2006 but are within the average for Lake Class 23 lakes. Two strong year classes of age-4 and age-2 fish were observed. The majority of age-4 fish were at least 15 inches long at the time of this survey.  Overall, the average length of Walleye sampled was 15 inches and fish up to 27 inches were captured. Northern pike catch rates were similar to previous surveys and lengths ranged from 14 to 33 inches. Yellow perch numbers were also similar to previous surveys and lengths ranged from 5 to 10 inches.  Black crappie numbers were low with only 13 fish captured ranging from 7 to 11 inches long. The number of Bluegill caught in trap nets was the second highest on record. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches and averages 5 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Tullibee (Cisco), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Rock Bass.   <br> \n      <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Baby Lake is the rusty crayfish.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Three profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1, 2 and 3).  Based on the average of the three profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 15 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 25.1 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), 27.5 feet in WQ 2, and 25.6 feet in WQ 3, all of which were below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 2 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.4?C (48.9?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a wide range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1988, 1999, and 2001 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 705 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 11.73 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a state owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally deep and very clear lakes.  Baby Lake is managed primarily for muskellunge, smallmouth and largemouth bass, with secondary species being northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, walleye, yellow perch and cisco (tullibee).   <br> \nMuskellunge were specifically targeted during spring 2012. Lengths of fish caught ranged from 17 to 45 inches, with catch rates above the long term goal for Baby Lake.  Using a mark-recapture design, the muskellunge population of 30.0\" and longer fish was estimated to be 2.9 fish per acre.  Abundance of smallmouth and largemouth bass was the highest observed to date.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 9 to 20 inches and averaged 13 inches overall.  Largemouth bass lengths ranged from 5 to 16 inches and averaged 9 inches.  Walleye numbers are lower than the historic high found in 2006, but are within the average for Lake Class 23. Two strong year classes of age-4 and age-2 fish were observed, and the majority of age-4 fish were 15 inches at the time of this survey.  Overall, the average length of walleye sampled was also 15 inches and fish up to 24 inches were captured. Northern pike catch rates were similar to previous surveys and lengths ranged from 16 to 31 inches.  .  Yellow perch numbers were also similar to previous surveys and lengths ranged from 5 to 10 inches.  Black crappie and cisco numbers were very low with only 5 black crappie and 2 cisco sampled in 2012.  Bluegill catch rates and sizes are also on the lower end of the averages for lake class 23.   <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers are bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.        <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Baby Lake is the rusty crayfish.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 704-acre lake located seven miles east of Hackensack, Minnesota in northern Cass County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 69 feet with 33 percent of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Access to the lake is currently gained through private property. In January 1996, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) purchased a parcel of land on the east side of Baby Lake. Plans are to develop a public access at this site, tentatively in late summer, 1996.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in Lake Class 23.  Other local lakes in this classification include Big Deep (7 miles southeast of Hackensack), and Stony (3 miles northeast of Hackensack), and Mule (6 miles southwest of Longville). The walleye catch rate during the 1995 survey was 1.25 fish per experimental gill net.  This catch rate was about average for lakes of this class and similar to earlier surveys.  As in previous Baby Lake sampling, sampled walleye were large. The average weight and length of walleye was 4.0 lbs. and was 22.8 inches.  Average length of these fish at age 4 was 16.2 inches.  Almost all walleye sampled  during the 1995 and previous surveys have been five years of age or older.  This age structure indicates that most Baby Lake walleye are mature fish which have migrated from other waters. Baby Lake has not been stocked with walleye since 1980, yet catch rates in the 1990 and 1995 assessments were similar to rates during the period when it was stocked.Baby Lake is a natural muskellunge lake and is known for its abundant muskellunge population.  Trap netting during the muskellunge spawning period in late April and early May, sampled 61 fish (0.4 muskellunge per net).  These muskellunge ranged from 10 to 43 inches. Thirty-five inches was the most common size sampled.Northern pike were not as abundant in Baby Lake as in other lakes of this type.  Abundance of northern pike in the 1995 survey was similar to that found in earlier surveys.  Northern pike had a large average size; about 27 percent were 28 inches or longer.  Age and growth data indicated fast growth when compared to northern pike in other Class 23 lakes.  The average length at age three was 22.6 inches.    Yellow perch and cisco (tullibee) are available as forage species in Baby Lake. The abundance of both of these species was typical of  lakes in Class 23. Most yellow perch sampled were small, with none reaching 10 inches. The abundance of black crappie was similar to that found in other lakes within this class.  Black crappie sampled during summer netting ranged from 4 to 11 inches, while individuals up to 13 inches were sampled during spring netting.  The average size of  four year old black crappie was 8.9 inches and is similar to other local lakes of this type.The catch rate of bluegill during summer trap netting (17.3 fish/lift) was average for this type of lake and was within the historical range for previous Baby Lake surveys. Bluegill sampled during summer netting ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 inches and had a slow growth rate compared to lakes in this class. The average length of bluegill in Baby at age five was just 4.4 inches.Trap net catch of pumpkinseed during summer trap netting (2.7 fish/net) was average for other lakes of this type but was lower than previous Baby Lake surveys.  Most pumpkinseed sampled in the summer netting were small; out of 49 pumpkinseed measured, the largest three were in the 6-inch category.The catch rate of largemouth bass during July 1995 trap netting (0.8 fish/net) was average for Class 23, and similar to previous years.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged in length from five to 13 inches. Of the largemouth bass 8 inches or greater, 50 percent were 10 inches or longer. During the spring trap netting, largemouth bass up to 18 inches were collected.  Growth of this species was similar to that found in other Class 23 lakes in this area; the average length at age 4 was 11.3 inches.  The catch rate of smallmouth bass in gill nets (1.1 fish/net) was average for this type of lake and similar to previous Baby Lake surveys.  The average length of smallmouth bass at age 4 was 11.3 inches, slightly less than other local lakes in this class.Other species sampled by trap net and/or gill net included:  white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and rock bass. To help maintain quality fish populations in Baby Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Baby Lake watershed is also  needed for maintaining  water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Baby Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 737 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 11.73 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a state owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally deep and very clear lakes. Other Lake class 23 lakes in the Walker Area include Mule (DOW# 11-0200, Man (DOW# 11-028)2, Horseshoe (DOW# 11-0358), Long (DOW# 11-0480, Portage (DOW# 11-0476, and Stony (DOW# 11-0371).  There is a channel between Baby and Man lakes navigable only by canoes, kayaks and small boats. Baby Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. The purpose of this survey was to assess the gamefish populations in Baby Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and Largemouth bass are abundant. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 11 to 18 inches and averaged 14 inches.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 5 to 20 inches and averaged 12 inches.  The high abundance of Muskellunge compared to other musky lakes in Minnesota is a major draw of anglers to Baby Lake. In the spring 2012, an intensive sampling effort was undertaken to estimate the size of the Muskellunge population. Muskellunge were abundant and lengths ranged from 22 to 45 inches and averaged 36 inches. Walleye numbers were lower than the historic high found in 2006 but are within the expected range for Lake Class 23 lakes. Two strong year classes of age-3 and age-5 fish were observed. The age-3 fish averaged 13 inches long and the age-5 fish averaged 17 inches long at the time of this survey.  Overall, the average length of Walleye sampled was 16 inches and fish up to 26 inches were captured. Northern Pike catch rates were similar to previous surveys and lengths ranged from 15 to 34 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were at a historic low and lengths ranged from 6 to 10 inches.  Black crappie numbers were low with only 12 fish captured and ranged from 11 to 13 inches long. Bluegill numbers were near average. Bluegill were small and averaged less than 5 inches long and lengths ranged from 3 to 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Tullibee (Cisco), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Rock Bass.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Baby Lake is the rusty crayfish.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Lake is a 705-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 11.73 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Baby Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally very deep and very clear lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant in Baby Lake and the 2006 catch rate was the historical high for Baby Lake.  The mean length was 14 inches and fish up to 25 inches were sampled.  Muskellunge up to 37 inches were sampled in Baby Lake.  Bluegill are present and their abundance has been near the average for Lake Class 23 lakes.  The mean length was 4 inches and fish up to 8 inches were sampled.  Smallmouth bass catch rate was the historical high and fish up to 17 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch are abundant with 2006 catch rate being the historical high.  However, majority of the yellow perch were small, but fish up to 11 inches were sampled.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), largemouth bass, longear sunfish, rock bass, cisco, and yellow bullhead.      <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Baby Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

A total of fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including 10 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of July 22, 2019 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 93, which is above both the impairment threshold (45) and the exceptional threshold (64) for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
