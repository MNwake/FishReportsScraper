                "narrative": "<p>The 35 surface acres in Surprise Lake have a maximum depth of 9 feet and a median depth of 5 feet. Lake bed soils are divided approximately into 50% gravel, 20% sand, 15% muck, 10% boulder, and 5% rubble. A secchi disc could be seen in the moderately soft-water to a depth of 5.5 feet plus. The lake water was collored a light brown from bog drainage. Submerged and floating-leaved aquatic vegetation in the form of waterlilies and various pondweeds ranged from scattered to lush in density. Emergent plant life consisted of sedge, cattail, cane, and spikerush. Cattail, sedge, and alder lowlands encircle the inlet and outlet. A small lowland area, the same as the above type, is located on the north shore just north of the island.     Test netting of Surprise Lake revealed that good White Sucker and Northern Pike populations were present. White Suckers appeared to be especially numerous. Yellow Perch, Walleye, Pumpkinseed, and Black rappie were caught in numbers that were below the state-wide and watershed maverages (#/net set).     Information relating to the amount of fishing pressure that the lake might have is lacking. Howwever, the absence of resorts, cottages, boats, and easy access would indicate that fishing pressure is light at the very best.     This small, shallow lake appears to be doing quite well for itself in the way of fish populations. It is probably producing and/or holding about all the fish within its capabilities. There would seem to be little need or justification for fish stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black crappie, northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, yellow perch and white sucker were collected in DNR test nets in 2000.Northern pike were the most abundant gamefish in the lake and were sampled in above-average numbers.  Northern pike up to 32.3 inches (7.5 pounds) were collected but most were in the 1.75 to 2 pound range.Black crappie were present but netting results indicated numbers continue to be low.  The only crappie sampled in the assessment was 8.2 inches.Largemouth bass numbers have been increasing in Surprise Lake and the catch in this assessment indicated numbers may be better than average.  Although no trophy size fish were sampled some respectable-size largemouth bass were observed with fish up to 2.3 pounds and several near 1.5 pounds taken.This lake is not managed for walleye; however, there is a small population present that is maintained through natural reproduction.  Only five walleye were sampled in this assessment, but all were larger than 2 pounds, with one individual weighing 4.8 pounds.  Anglers shouldn't expect to catch a lot of walleye in this lake but walleye that are caught could be of quality size.Yellow perch numbers have declined and now are at below-average levels.  The few perch that were collected in this assessment were 6 inches to 7 inches long and probably unacceptable to most anglers.It appears that anglers venturing to Surprise Lake probably would have their best success angling for northern pike or largemouth bass.</p>",

Test nets in 1995 sampled northern pike from 9 inches to 30 inches (7.9 pounds) however two thirds of the northern  pike were smaller than 22 inches (2.5 pounds).     Walleye are present in average numbers compared to similar lakes in its class. The walleye sampled ranged in size from 15.8 inches to 25.6 inches (3.7 pounds) and averaged approximately 18.5 inch. Test nets did not sample any smaller walleye which is probably related to the lakes history of inconsistent natural reproduction.     Black crappie currently are low in numbers and small in size. Test nets in 1995 recorded black crappie from 4.2 inches to 9.2 inches however \"keeper\" size of 8 inches or more are not common.     Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers in test nets but due to their wariness of nets numbers may be under estimated. All the largemouth bass sampled were small, ranging in size from 6.1 inches to 9.2 inches with over 80% less than 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Surprise Lake is 37.7 acres, has a maximum depth of 10 feet, and is located approximately 10 miles northwest of Isabella. There are two access routes to the lake. The first access is a 300 foot carry-down trail to the northwest shore of the lake off of USFS Road #386 (Kelly Loop Road). The second access is a short 50 foot carry-in to the east shore of the lake at the end of a spur road from USFS Road #386. There is a backcountry campsite with picnic table and fire pit at the end of the spur road and start of the access trail.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was near average for similar lakes in the Finland area. A total of 24 pike were caught ranging in length from 12.2 inches to 36.7 inches with an average length of 23 inches. Growth of Northern Pike was fast for the area, and natural reproduction currently sustains the population with eight different ages sampled in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was average compared to similar lakes in the area with a total of seven Walleye sampled. The average length of Walleye was 23.2 inches and weight was 4.6 pounds. The largest Walleye sampled was 27.6 inches and 7.2 pounds. Growth of Walleye was fast for the area, but natural reproduction appears to be sporadic as there were multiple missing year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of nine Largemouth Bass were sampled with the survey gear on Surprise Lake. Length of bass ranged from 5.3 inches to 18.5 inches with an average length of 13.9 inches. Seven of the Largemouth Bass were over 11 inches in length. Young of the year Largemouth Bass were also collected with small mesh trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nStandard trap nets sampled 14 Bluegill with an average length of 4.6 inches. Small mesh trap nets caught an additional 39 Bluegill and had an average length of 3.4 inches. Only one Bluegill was longer than 6 inches; this fish was 7.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of six Black Crappie were caught with the survey nets. The size of crappie was small ranging from 3.9 inches to 6.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nIn the Finland Area, Bluegill and Black Crappie populations tend to have low densities with good growth rates, but sporadic reproduction and recruitment.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and White Suckers are important forage species in the lake and they were captured in normal numbers. Other species sampled during the survey included Pumpkinseed, Blacknose Shiner, Fathead Minnow, and Tadpole Madtom.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Surprise Lake is a 40 acre body of water located approximately 10 miles northwest of Isabella.  Located in the Superior National Forest, the shoreline is undeveloped and surrounding area has little private development.  There are two carry-in access trails to Surprise Lake.  The designated access from USFS Road #386, to the northwest end of Surprise Lake, is a 500 foot trail down a fairly steep slope with parking only on the road at the trail-head.  The second access is a short spur of over-grown logging road to a short trail that hits the east side of the lake; there was enough parking for two vehicles here.  Both accesses are suitable only for small boat or canoe. <br> \n   <br> \nThe fish sampled in 2010 consisted of black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in above average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The size of the walleye sampled was above average at 2.8 pounds (20.1 inches); the largest walleye was 27.6 inches.  One hundred percent of the total walleye catch was greater than 16 inches in 2010.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1985, when aging of walleye samples indicated the stocking was not enhancing the walleye population in the stocked years. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class in 2010.  The northern pike average size was 2.2 pounds (20.6 inches); the largest northern pike was 33.9 inches.  Natural reproduction produces consistent year-classes of northern pike in Surprise Lake, providing good angling for various size fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie sample in 2010 was below average for lake class but within the range previously seen in Surprise Lake investigations.  The average weight was just over 0.1 pound for the three fish collected.    Generally, Surprise Lake samples have consisted of small numbers of large black crappie; however, the 2010 sample was comprised of smaller fish.  Natural reproduction appears to be sporadic and poor, similar to many Finland area lakes were black crappie are present.  The reproduction in Surprise Lake is capable of sustaining a long-term population and occasionally producing a strong year-class of black crappies. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was about average for the lake class in 2010, and similar to samples in previous investigations.  The average length of yellow perch in 2010 was 6.5 inches; the largest yellow perch was 8.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile largemouth bass are difficult to assess in standard sampling gear (gill net, trap net), previous investigations on Surprise Lake often collected low numbers of largemouth bass.  Two largemouth bass were sampled in 2010, one weighed 1.9 pounds and the other 4.8 pounds.  Largemouth bass are able to sustain a long-term population through natural reproduction in Surprise Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSurprise Lake is a lightly fished body of water.  While it is unlikely great numbers of any species will be caught on a single fishing trip, there is a chance that a large walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass or black crappie will bend the rod.   <br> \n</p>",

Crappie cribs were installed in 1976 and appear to be offering needed shelter for small Crappies.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Surprise Lake is a small, remote lake that receives relatively light fishing pressure.  Fish populations are maintained through natural reproduction.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike although other game fish species are present.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2005 compared to the other lakes in this class.  They ranged from 16.3 inches to 24.7 inches (3.8 lbs) and average about 2.5 lb/fish.  Northern pike are the primary species pursued by anglers on this lake.Walleye were sampled in relatively low numbers in this assessment which is normal for this lake.  They ranged in size from 10.7 inches to 28.1 inches (7.9 lbs).  Results of this assessment indicated that walleye reproduction has been poor in recent years and numbers likely will continue to be low.Largemouth bass and black crappie have been collected in this lake in the past; however, only one adult bass and no adult crappies were taken in this assessment.  Largemouth bass are difficult to capture in netting gear and are best sampled by electrofishing equipment.  Access limitations prevent this type of equipment from being used to evaluate fish populations in this lake.  A few young-of-the-year largemouth bass were sampled in this assessment so there are some adult fish present.  Black crappie numbers are likely very low, if they are present at all.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Crappie densities have fluctuated over a period of many years and after the 1985 assesment appeared to have reached their lowest levels. This decline may have been related to an increase in Walleye densities aided by fingerling stockings in 1983 and 1984. Black Crappie numbers recently began to increase probably due to a one time stocking of adults in 1988. Black Crappie densities are still below historical levels, however the discontinuance of the Walleye program may enable them to attain their former levels. Present Walleye levels are near historical highs which is likely a result of the fingerling stocking, as 85% of the aged sample corresponds with stocked years. Walleye densities are expected to decrease as stocking is discontinued.      Northern Pike have demonstrated a small decline over the past two assessments with the 1991 gillnet catch of 4/lift about 1/3 lower than the average for lakes in this classification. Northern Pike size has remained stable over the same period averaging near 21\" in each assessment.     Largemouth Bass were sampled for the first time in 1985, these may have migrated from the watershed above Surprise Lake.</p>",
