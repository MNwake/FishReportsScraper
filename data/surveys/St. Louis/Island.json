                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is located 10 miles southwest of Ely.  There are three public accesses, two of which have concrete ramps, the other is gravel.  This 2,351 acre lake contains four inlets and one outlet, the Bear Island River.  Bear Island Lake has a maximum depth of 62 feet and the water color is brown.  On August 26, 2013 Bear Island was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 75F and a bottom temperature of 46F.  Oxygen levels were 8.6 ppm at the surface and dropped to below 2.0 ppm at a depth of 45 feet.  Shoreline substrates consist of mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse along most of the shoreline.\n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 29 fish/net which is high compared to historic surveys.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were walleye, tullibee, northern pike, rock bass, white sucker, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, and bluegill.  The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 34 fish/net which was also high compared to historic surveys.  Fish species sampled were bluegill, rock bass, black crappie, walleye, northern pike, white sucker, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass.\n\nOne hundred ten walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 9 fish/net which is quite good compared to other similar lakes throughout the state and is the 3rd highest catch rate on record for the lake.  Fish captured in gill nets in the 2013 assessment ranged in size from 7 to 24.5 inches with an average of 13 inches.  The largest fish captured came from a trap net and was 29 inches long.  Average weight per fish caught in gill nets was 1.0 pound.  Growth rates were slow when compared to other investigations of lakes in the Tower area.  Ages of gillnetted fish ranged from 1 to 10.  The 2009 and 2011 year classes were quite strong with over 76% of the aged fish coming from those year classes.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 4 fish/net which is better than 75% of other similar lakes throughout the state and the second highest catch rate on record for Bear Island.  Average weight for gillnetted fish was 2.6 lbs/fish which is average when compared to other similar lakes throughout the state.  Lengths from gillnetted fish ranged from 15 to 35 inches with an average of 22 inches.  Growth rates were somewhat slow when compared to other lakes in the area.  Anglers are encouraged to release these large pike as they take many years to grow larger than 24 inches.  Ages of gillnetted fish ranged from 1 to 9 years old with the 2009 year class being the strongest and containing over 45% of the aged fish.  Of the forty-nine northern pike examined for diseases and parasites, 41 fish or 84% were infested with neascus (black spot).\n\nFourteen smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.2 fish/net which is high when compared to other similar lakes in the state.  The average weight was 1.7 lbs/fish.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 16 inches with an average of 14.5 inches.  Growth was typical of other smallie populations in area lakes.  Ages ranged from 4 to 8 years with the 2006 year class being the strongest.\n\nTwenty three black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 1.5 fish/net which is in the lower 25% of similar lakes throughout the state.  The average weight was 0.3 lb/fish.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 13 inches with an average of 8 inches.  Growth was similar when compared to other area lakes.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9 with 74% of the fish coming from the 2010 year class.  \n\nThe bluegill catch rate was 22 fish/net in 2013 which is well above 75% of other similar lakes throughout the state.  The average weight was 0.4 lb/fish, also above 75% of bluegill lakes throughout the state.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 9 inches with an average of an impressive 7.5 inches.  Growth rates are slightly better than average compared to other lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9 years with the 2005, 2006, and 2007 year classes accounting for 87% of all the sampled fish.  Ninety four percent of the bluegill examined for diseases and parasites had neascus (black spot).\n\nA tullibee catch rate of 5 fish/gill net is right in the middle compared to other similar lakes throughout the state.  Historic gillnet catches of tullibee started high between 1952 and 1978, then dropped to 1 or less fish/net until 2003 where catches then started to rise and have continued rising to the present rate.  Average size was small at 0.1 lb/fish with a length range of 6 to 8 inches and an average of 6.5 inches.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is in Ecological lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Island Lake is mesotrophic, as are most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nBear Island Lake was thermally stratified on 8/25/2008 with a surface temperature of 68 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 37 ft, where the temperature was 58 F. <br> \n <br> \nThe major inlet, Beaver River, has a walleye spawning run in the spring and has rapids and beaver dams, which limit fish movement.  The outlet, Bear Island River, has an old dam that limits fish movement at low water.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Bear Island Lake are mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 7 ft and are sparse along most of the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in 2008 consisted of 15 standard gillnet sets and 15 standard trapnet sets.  Fourteen previous investigations, dating back to 1952, consisted of 2-15 gillnet sets.  Six of these previous investigations, beginning in 1973, used 3-15 trapnet sets.  Trapnetting was done late in the summer in the first four trapnettings, through 1993, but was moved to June in the 1998, 2003, and 2008 investigations because panfish populations are usually more catchable in trapnets early in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnet catches in 2008 were dominated by bluegill sunfish and rock bass.  Gillnet catches were dominated by walleye, northern pike, and cisco.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish were not captured in early investigations on Bear Island Lake, and were low (1-2/trapnet) in subsequent investigations through 1998 (when the trapnetting was done in June).  Bluegill numbers then increased, to 17/trapnet in 2003 and to 35/trapnet in 2008, both of which were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes in 2008 averaged 6.6\" (0.25 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 6.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill captured in 2008 was 9.1\".  Most of the bluegill captured in 2008 were ages 3, 5, and 6.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2008 was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers in 2008 (7.1/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Rock bass numbers were low (1-5/trapnet) through 1993, but increased to 7-14/trapnet in 1998 and subsequent investigations coincident with the change in trapnetting dates to early in the summer.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2008 (5.7/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 6.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2008 averaged 13.8\" (1.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 14.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye were present from a number of year classes in 2008, but many (43%) were age 2, from the 2006 year class.  Walleye growth was faster than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2008 (3.4/ gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2008 averaged 21.5\" (2.5 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 21.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  Most of the pike captured in 2008 (53%) were age 2, from the 2006 year class.  Pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2008 (4.9/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were higher than the median cisco catch of 0.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes averaged 6.9\"; the largest was 9.2\" <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and perch numbers in 2008 were lower than normal for this lake class and were typical for this lake.  Smallmouth bass numbers were higher than normal for this lake class and for this lake.  Anglers targeting bass have become more common in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2003 were infected with Neascus.  Some of the perch had yellow grub, and some of the smallmouth had bass tapeworm.  One of the northern pike had Lymphosarcoma.  Neascus (black spot), yellow grub, and bass tapeworm are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.  Lymphosarcoma is a virus-caused cancer of northern pike and eating fish infected with lymphosarcoma is not recommended although infection of humans by this virus has not been observed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Island Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is deeper than most.Bear Island Lake was thermally stratified on 08/24/98 and retained adequate oxygen (more than 2 ppm) to a depth of 29 ft, where the temperature was 58 F.  The bottom temperature was 48 F.  Bear Island Lake ranks as mesotrophic, which is typical of most lakes in the region.The major inlet, Beaver River, has a walleye spawning run in the spring and has rapids and beaver dams that limit fish movement during low water.  The outlet, Bear Island River, has an old dam or control structure that limits fish movement at low water.  Water levels were low during the summer of 1998.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 7 ft and are sparse along most of the shoreline, with concentrations in bays; the most common plants are sweetgale, water horehound, Nuttall's pondweed, variable pondweed, and claspingleaf pondweed.In 1998 there were 173 homes and cottages on Bear Island Lake, not including 3 resorts with 3 houses, 32 cabins, and 23 campsites.  One of these resorts (Bear Island Resort) was for sale and was not operating in 1998.Fish sampling in 1998 consisted on 15 gillnets, 15 trapnets, shoreline seining, and night electrofishing in the fall.  Twelve previous lake investigations, dating back to 1952, have been conducted on Bear Island Lake.  Gillnets were used during all of these investigations, while trapnets were used in four.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 23 fish/net was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to the average catch of 24 fish/net in all twelve previous gillnettings on this lake.  The total catch by weight of 31 lb/net was normal for this lake class, but was higher than the average catch of 21 lb/net in previous gillnettings.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1998 of 21 fish/net (13 lb/net) was twice as high as the average catch of 8 fish/lb (6 lb/net) in all four previous trapnettings on this lake.  Trapnets were set earlier in the summer in 1998 than in previous investigations, and this may have resulted in the higher catches of rock bass, sunfish, crappies, and northern pike that were observed in 1998.Fish populations in 1998 were dominated by walleye, rock bass, northern pike, and white sucker.  Average numbers of bluegill and crappie were present, while fair numbers of bass were captured by electrofishing and fair numbers of perch were captured in the shoreline seine.  Low numbers of other species were captured.Walleye numbers in 1998 (6.6/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 6.9/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1998 averaged 16\"; the largest was 24\".  Walleye were present from many different year classes.  Growth of walleye captured in 1998 (12\" at age three, 16\" at age five) was normal for the area.Rock bass numbers in 1998 (4.7/gillnet, 11.9/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  The gillnet catch was similar to the average catch of 5.9/net in previous nettings while the trapnet catch was much higher than the average catch of 3.6/net in previous nettings.  The higher catch of rock bass in 1998 may be due to the earlier date of trapnetting.Northern pike numbers in 1998 (4.0/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 2.4/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Pike numbers in the trapnets in 1998 (1.3/net) were higher than the average catch of 0.3/net in previous trapnettings.  Pike sizes in the gillnets averaged 21\"; the largest pike (caught in a trapnet) was 34\".  Pike recruitment was good, and pike growth (20\" at age four) was normal for the area.White sucker numbers in 1998 (4.1/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 4.2/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Numbers of bluegill (2.1/trapnet) and black crappie (2.1/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than in previous trapnettings.  Some large bluegill (up to 10\") and crappie (up to 13\") were present in 1998.  Growth of bluegill (5\" at age three) and crappie (7\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Smallmouth bass numbers in the gillnets (1.4/net) were higher than normal for this lake class, but only one smallmouth was captured in the trapnets and only three were captured in the electrofishing (which was directed at bass).  Smallmouth sizes in the gillnets averaged 13\"; the largest was 17\".  Largemouth bass were absent in the gillnets and trapnets, but some small largemouth bass were captured in electrofishing and in shoreline seines.Most of the fish examined had diseases or parasites that are common to the area.  Infestation rates were 40 percent or lower, except that 92 percent of smallmouth bass examined internally had bass tapeworm and 80 percent of cisco had trianophorus.  All of these diseases and parasites are native to the area, cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

Low numbers of smallmouth bass, yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, and cisco were also observed. The mean lengths of bluegill - 6.7. Trap nets were above average for the area. Sizes of other species were average for the area. Cen populations were dominated by strong 1988 year classes. The walleye population was dominated by a strong 1987 year class. Growth of CEN is faster than average for the area. Walleye growth appears to vary quite a bit from year to year, but is generally average for the first few years, then slows and is below average for the area. </p>",

This popular lake has a long history of walleye management and stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThree separate boat ramps are located around the lake for public access. There are four designated campsites, two of which are on the largest island, for overnight and day use. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve gill nets and 15 trap nets were used to sample fish during the 2018 survey of Bear Island Lake. Overall catch rates of 17.2 fish/gill net and 12.3 fish/trap net were the lowest recorded for this lake since the early 1990's. Twelve species of fish were sampled. Walleye (26%) was the most common species species sampled in the gill nets. Rock bass (23%) and northern pike (15%) were also sampled. Cisco (14%) were sampled in some of the of the deeper gill nets. Sixteen smallmouth bass were also caught in the gill nets in 2018. Rock bass (54%) were the most common species sampled in the trap nets. Bluegill (15%) were also sampled. Black crappie (8%) were sampled from the trap nets in relatively low abundance with some larger individuals present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2018 (4.5/gill net) were below the historic average (6.3/gill net) for this lake and below average (6.2/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. Walleye average length was 13.4 inches which is slightly smaller than the past average length of 14.0 inches. Approximately 56% of the walleye sampled were 12 inches or larger up to a maximum of 23.3 inches. Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years in Bear Island Lake and in 2018 approximately 79% of the walleye aged were from years where stocking occurred. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (2.6/gill net) were similar to the historic average (2.7/gill net) and slightly above average (2.1/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. Pike average length was 23.3 inches which is larger than the  average length of 21.8 inches. Approximately 32% of the pike sampled were 24 inches or larger up to a maximum of 33.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers (1.3/gill net) were slightly higher than the historic average (0.6/gill net) for this lake and slightly higher (0.3/gill net) compared to other area lakes that are similar. Smallmouth average length was 14.8 inches which is larger than the average of 12.5 inches. The largest smallmouth sampled in 2018 was 16.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass abundance in 2018 (6.7/trap net) was similar to the historic average (6.3/trap net) for this lake and much higher than average (0.6/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes. The average rock bass sampled was 6.5 inches long. Rock bass lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2018 (1.9/trap net) were identical to the historic average for this lake and below average (3.2/trap net) compared to other area lakes that are similar. Bluegill average length was 6.5 inches which is similar to the past. The largest bluegill sampled measured 8.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Located 11 miles southwest of Ely, MN, Bear Island Lake is a 2362-acre Canadian Shield lake with a maximum depth of 62 feet. The shoreline has sporadic stretches with high levels of development but the majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped. About 0.5% of the watershed is classified as disturbed. A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted on Bear Island Lake on 5 - 7 August 2013 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Bear Island Lake was selected for repeat sampling in 2013 to assess the variability of sampling gear across the season. This was the second nearshore survey conducted on Bear Island Lake in 2013. Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and quarter-inch trap nets. Seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine was completed at five additional 100-foot sampling sites chosen for their conduciveness to seining and diversity of habitat.  <br> \n <br> \n     During this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and one was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was done at 24 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat. Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including many sensitive species: burbot, Iowa darter, logperch, mimic shiner, mottled sculpin, rock bass, and smallmouth bass. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, creek chub, johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, tadpole madtom, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Fish species information was gathered as part of a project to develop and evaluate a descripton of the arrowhead region fish community as part of an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) project. <br> \n <br> \n     This survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Island Lake is mesotrophic, as are most of the lakes in this lake class.Bear Island Lake was thermally stratified on 08/11/2003 with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Five ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 19 ft, where the temperature was 68 F, and 2 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 46 ft, where the temperature was 50 F.The major inlet, Beaver River, has a walleye spawning run in the spring and has rapids and beaver dams which limit fish movement.  The outlet, Bear Island River, has an old dam that limits fish movement at low water.  Shoal water substrates on Bear Island Lake are mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 7 ft and are sparse along most of the shoreline.Fish sampling in 2003 consisted of 15 standard trapnet sets and 15 standard gillnet sets.  Thirteen previous investigations, dating back to 1952, consisted of 2-15 gillnet sets.  Five of these previous investigations used 3-15 trapnet sets.   Trapnetting was done late in the summer in the first four trapnettings, through 1993, but was moved to June in the 1998 and 2003 investigations because panfish populations are generally more catchable in trapnets early in the summer.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2003 of 38 fish/net (12 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 10 fish/net (8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake, due mostly to higher numbers of bluegill sunfish and rock bass.Bluegill numbers in 2003 (17/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill numbers were low (1-2/trapnet) in all five previous investigations, including the 1998 investigation when the trapnetting was done in June.  Bluegill sizes in 2003 averaged 6.3\" (0.2 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill captured in 2003 was 8.4\".  Most of the bluegill captured in 2003 (64%) were age five, from the 1998 year class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2003 was normal by area standards.Rock bass numbers in 2003 (14/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Rock bass numbers were low (1-5/trapnet) through 1993, but increased to 12/trapnet in 1998 coincident with the change in trapnetting dates to early in the summer.  Rock bass sizes in 2003 averaged 6.7\".The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2003 of 26 fish/net (33 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 23 fish/net (21 lb/net) in previous investigations on this lake, due to more and larger northern pike and larger walleye in the catch.  Northern pike numbers in 2003 (4.2/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 23.9\" (3.3 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  Pike scales collected in 2003 were difficult to read, but six year classes were represented.  Pike growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.Walleye numbers in 2003 (6.0/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 6.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2003 averaged 15.9\" (1.6 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 14.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye were present from 10 year classes, but most walleye (52%) were age two, from the 2001 year class.  Walleye growth was faster than average by area standards.Rock bass numbers in 2003 were higher than normal for this lake class, and were typical for this lake.  White sucker and perch numbers were lower than normal for this lake class and were typical for this lake.  Smallmouth bass numbers were higher than normal for this lake class and for this lake.  Several anglers were fishing for smallmouth during the 2003 assessment.Many of the game fish examined in 2003 had neascus (black spot).  Some of the perch had yellow grub, and some of the smallmouth had bass tapeworm.  Neascus and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are usually removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is located 10 miles southwest of Ely.  There are three public accesses, two of which have concrete ramps, the other is gravel.  This 2,351 acre lake contains four inlets and one outlet, the Bear Island River, which flows out of the far east finger of the lake and over an old dam.  Bear Island has a maximum depth of 62 feet and brown water. <br> \n <br> \nOn August 16, 2021 Bear Island was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 69 F and a bottom temperature of 49 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 44 feet where the water temperature was 50 F.  Shoal-water substrates consist of mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 7 feet and is sparse along most of the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nThis was a targeted survey looking mainly at the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 15.9 fish/net which was tied with two other surveys for the lowest catch rate on record for Bear Island.  Total yield was 19.7 lbs/net which was below average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were walleye, rock bass, northern pike, smallmouth bass, white sucker, yellow perch, cisco, black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nFifty-two walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 4.3 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes and the lowest catch rate since the 1993 survey (3.3 fish/net).  Walleye have been stocked in Bear Island dating back to 1941.  Since 1993 walleye fry have been stocked at the rate of 900,000 fry every other year.  Sizes ranged from 9 to 27 inches with an average of nearly 15 inches.  Nearly 29% of the gillnetted fish were larger than 16 inches.  Growth was slow compared to other walleye lakes in the area.  The average fish took six years to reach 15 inches long.  Ages ranged from 1 to 9 years old with only the 2014 year class missing representation.  The 2018 and 2015 year classes were quite strong with 60% of the fish coming from those two year classes.  Fifty-eight percent of the catch came from stocked years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Island Lake is a 2,351-acre lake that is ten miles southwest of Ely. There are three public accesses with boat ramps on the lake. Bear Island Lake is up to 62 feet deep and has shoreline substrates that are mostly rubble, boulder, and gravel. The lake has brown, bog-stained water with roughly 7 feet of visibility. Aquatic vegetation is sparse along most of the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nBear Island Lake was thermally stratified on August 7, 2023, with a surface temperature of 73 F and a temperature of 44 F near the bottom. Adequate oxygen levels for warmwater fish species were retained to a depth of 45 feet where the water temperature was 45 F.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 7.9 fish/gill net, which was slightly above average for the lake. Walleye sampled in gill nets averaged 14.3 inches in length, and 35% of the fish were over 16.0 inches. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 21 and indicated consistent recruitment. Walleye fry are stocked into Bear Island Lake in odd years, but ages indicated that natural reproduction is also occurring in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 3.9 fish/gill net, which was slightly higher than average for Bear Island Lake. The average length  was 23.8 inches, which was larger than the historical average for the lake. The largest pike sampled in 2023 was 37.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 10.7 fish/trap net, which was higher than the historical average for the lake. The average bluegill was 6.4 inches long, and 28% of the catch was 7.0 inches or larger. The largest bluegill was 9.5 inches in length, and bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 10. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 1.3 fish/trap net, which was similar to the historical average for the lake. Black crappie averaged 7.7 inches in length, and the largest individual was 8.5 inches. Black crappie ages ranged from 2 to 7. <br> \n <br> \nBoth smallmouth and largemouth bass are present in Bear Island Lake, although the gill nets and trap nets are inefficient at catching them. In this survey, 12 smallmouth bass and 3 largemouth bass were sampled. Smallmouth bass averaged 13.5 inches in length and the largest individual was 17.2 inches. Largemouth bass averaged 14.3 inches in length and the largest individual was 19.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included cisco, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",
