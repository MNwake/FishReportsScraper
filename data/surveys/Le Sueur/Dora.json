                "narrative": "<p>Dora Lake in Le Sueur County is a 760 acre lake located north of the town of Kilkenny. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast end of the lake off Le Sueur county road 3. While the Cannon River does not flow directly through Dora Lake, a small tributary runs to the river just 3/4 of a mile away from the lake. The Cannon River is a strong influence on Dora Lake and Dora has a strong influence on downstream waters as the lake can be used as an early season nursery. Dora Lake was surveyed the week of June 7, 2010 to monitor the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch slipped somewhat but mostly maintained the large size structure observed in the 2005 assessment. 36 perch per gill net lift was observed, a value that ranks in the upper quartile for similarly classified lakes. Average perch size was 8 inches and the largest perch caught in the survey was 11.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked into Dora Lake three out of four years. Walleye stocking is done as a benefit to downstream waters as Dora has historically operated as a nursery for young fish. Less than three walleye per gill net were captured, and length ranges were between 9 and 11 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are present in modest numbers in Dora Lake at two fish per gill net lift. Pike ranged between 15 and 31 inches in length. Average length was 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill averaged 26 fish per trap net lift, a value in the upper quartile for similarly classified lakes.  Bluegill were small, averaging 5.6 inches. Two percent of all bluegill captured exceeded 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA small population of pumpkinseed inhabit Dora Lake. About four pumpkinseed were caught in each trap net. Average size is small at 4.5 inches. Only one pumpkinseed was captured in the entire 2005 survey, so the population may be growing. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one black crappie was caught in the assessment. Other fish seen in the survey include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brook stickleback, central mudminnow, common carp, fathead minnow, freshwater drum, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Dora Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dora Lake is a 760 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the town of Doyle. A DNR-owned public access is located on the eastern side of the south end of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 3. The lake has an average depth of 2.2 feet and maximum depth of 6.0 feet. It is placed in Lake Class 43, which includes other Waterville Area lakes such as Circle Lake (Rice County), Crystal Lake (Blue Earth County), Gorman Lake (Le Sueur County), and Pickeral Lake (Freeborn County). Dora Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The management plan calls for stocking Walleye and Northern Pike fry and Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch adults following winterkills, which have occurred frequently in the past. Dora Lake was surveyed the week of June 8, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying eleven trap nets and five gill nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nA total of 20 Black Crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net in 2010 to 6.4/net in 2000 with an average of 3.7/net. Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 6.7 inches with an average of 5.0 inches, indicating small size structure. An additional 10 Black Crappies ranging from 3.6 to 4.9 inches long were sampled with trap nets. Black Crappies from both gears ranged from 1 to 3 years old with three year-classes present. One year old fish accounted for 87% of the sample. After sampling just one fish in 2010, the Black Crappie population in Dora Lake has returned to normal levels and was comprised of small, young fish in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 21 Bluegills were sampled with the trap nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 1.3/net in 2005 to 26.4/net in 2010 with an average of 7.8/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 5.4 inches with an average of 3.7 inches, indicating small size structure. Three additional Bluegills ranging from 3.8 to 4.4 inches were sampled with gill nets. Bluegills from both gears were 1 to 2 years old, with 1 year old fish accounting for 96% of the sample. In 2015, the Bluegill population in Dora Lake was dominated by small, young fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow Perch numbers remained high in Dora Lake with a total of 60 fish sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 12.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 12.0/net in 2015 to 36.2/net in 2010 with an average of 26.5/net. Lengths ranged from 6.3 to 9.2 inches with an average of 8.3 inches, indicating a small, yet fishable size structure. Ages varied from 2 to 4 with three year-classes present. Three year old fish accounted for 75% of the sample. The Yellow Perch population in Dora Lake consisted of many quality length fish and offered the only real opportunity for fishing in 2015. It also showed little sign of the 2013-2014 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nA single 14.4 inch 2 year old Walleye was sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net, indicating very low numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have been low, ranging from 0.2/net in 2015 to 2.8/net in 2005 with an average of 1.9/net. Walleye fry were stocked annually in Dora Lake from 2004-2013 with the exceptions of 2006 and 2011. The primary goal with these stocking events was to use the lake as a nursery for young fish that would eventually migrate into the Cannon River system and provide fishing opportunity elsewhere. It is unknown to what extent this has occurred but our sampling suggests it is unlikely that fry stocking will ever result in a walleye fishery in Dora Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nA total of 37 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 7.4/net, which was the highest ever recorded and indicated moderate to high numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 2.2/net in 2010 to 7.4/net in 2015 with an average of 5.0/net. Fish were small with lengths ranging from 10.0 to 20.6 inches with an average of 14.9 inches. An additional 7 Northern Pike ranging from 13.7 to 19.8 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.6/net. Northern Pike from both gears ranged from 1 to 2 years old with two year-classes present. One year old fish accounted for approximately 93% of the sample. Northern Pike fry were stocked occasionally in the 2000s but ultimately seems unnecessary given recent netting results and a strong connection to the Cannon River. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nA total of 57 Black Bullheads were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 11.4/net, indicating low numbers were present. This was the lowest catch rate since surveying began in 2000. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 11.4/net in 2015 to 43.0/net in 2005 with an average of 24.7/net. An additional 76 Black Bullheads were sampled with trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained high with a total of 30 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 2000, catch rates have varied from 0/net in 2005 to 14.4/net in 2010 with an average of 5.3/net. An additional 16 Common Carp were sampled with trap nets. Overall, Common Carp numbers in Dora Lake have increased in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. Interestingly, Freshwater Drum were completely absent for the first time since surveying began in 2000 and after being common in the 2010 survey. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist  <br> \n</p>",

A survey in June 2000 showed that the habitat of Dora Lake has appeared to have recently stabilized and a diverse fish community was present.  Black crappie, yellow perch, and black bullhead are all abundant in Dora Lake.  Most black crappie were 6 to 10 in. with fish up to 11.5 inches.  Yellow perch were primally 8 to 9 in. with fish up to 11.5 in.  Northern pike (up to 36 in.) and freshwater drum are fairly common.  Other species present include bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, bowfin, carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, walleye , white bass, and white sucker.  </p>",
