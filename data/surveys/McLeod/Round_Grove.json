                "narrative": "<p>Round Grove is a small lake (295 acres) located near the City of Stewart in McLeod County. It has approximately four miles of shoreline and much of the lake is four to six foot deep, with a maximum depth of seven feet. There is a public boat access with a cement plank ramp at the north end of the lake. Round Grove Lake occasionally suffers partial winterkills of fish during harsh winters. Fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on severity and frequency of winterkill. Round Grove was formerly managed as a Walleye rearing pond but was switched to a recreational fishing lake in 2023. Reduced Walleye fingerling production had occurred because of lack significant winterkill. The lake was stocked with Walleye fry in 2023 and will be stocked every other year henceforth, and immediately following substantial winterkills. Summer anglers may need to try new techniques to catch Walleye out of the dense submergent vegetation that is present some years. Ice fishing can be popular at Round Grove Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey (June trap netting) was conducted at Round Grove Lake on June 12th, 2023 to evaluate the current Walleye population. A total of 104 Walleye were netted for a catch rate of 11.6 fish/net, which suggests a moderate-sized population. Walleye were 7.7 to 24.2 inches long with an average length of 11.9 inches. Approximately 19% of the catch was 18 inches or longer, indicating that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. Additional fishes captured included Black Bullhead (513), Black Crappie (12), Brown Bullhead (1), Common Carp (29), Hybrid Sunfish (11) and Orangespotted Sunfish (18). <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
