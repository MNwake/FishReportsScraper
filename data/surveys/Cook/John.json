It appeared that walleye had not produced a strong natural year class since 1987, despite the presence of excellent spawning habitat.  Stocking in Little John Lake has not increased walleye abundance in John Lake.  Catches of northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker were similar to past catches in this lake, but the northern pike and yellow perch catches were well above the normal ranges for lakes of this class.  Several large northern pike were observed, and northern pike growth was about average for the area.  Large yellow perch were also present.  No smallmouth bass were observed; however, they are probably present, since they have been collected in the past in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>John Lake is located completely within the BWCA wilderness near the end of the Arrowhead Trail.  The lake can be accessed via a short portage from Little John Lake (BWCA entry point 69). John Lake is an Ecological Class 12 lake, which is characterized by a shallow maximum depth, complete littoral coverage, and very soft bog-stained water. The lake was last stocked with Walleye fry in 1987, and is currently managed for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey of John Lake was the first of two scheduled in the 2008 lake management plan to determine if long-range goals for the Northern Pike and Yellow Perch populations could be met with no further management intervention. The goal for the Northern Pike population is to maintain a gill net catch of 4.0 fish/net, with a minimum mean weight of 2.5 lb/fish. The Yellow Perch goal is to maintain a gill net catch of 6.0 fish/set with a minimum mean weight of 0.2 lb/fish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant in John lake in 2016, and some larger fish were present.  The 2016 gill net catch of Northern Pike met the long-range catch goal for John Lake, and was considered above average compared to similar lakes in the area. Although the catch was high, it was similar to catches observed in past surveys of John Lake. The size goal for the population was also met in 2016. Northern Pike were sampled in a wide range of sizes, including several fish over 30 inches. Natural reproduction by Northern Pike appeared very consistent in recent years. The sample included one- through seven-year-old Northern Pike, although three- and four-year-old fish comprised a majority of the catch. Growth rates of Northern Pike had been about average; fish reached a mean of 20.6 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of  21.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were also abundant in 2016, although there did not appear to have been as many larger fish present as have been seen in this lake in the past.  The 2016 gill net catch was lower than in prior surveys, but the catch still remained above average for the lake class, and easily met the long-range catch goal for Yellow Perch. Yellow Perch sampled in 2016 were also smaller than those observed in previous surveys. About 19 percent of the Yellow Perch sampled in 2016 were longer than eight inches. While angling opportunities for large perch appeared less abundant in 2016, high numbers of small-medium size Yellow Perch present in this survey suggested an excellent forage base remained for the Northern Pike and Walleye populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches have typically been low in John Lake since 1996, although the mean weight of Walleye has routinely been above average in these surveys. Similar results were seen in 2016; the gill net catch fell below the normal range for Class 12 lakes, but the mean weight was well above average. Natural reproduction by Walleye in John Lake may be limited, or the population may be reliant on immigration of Walleye from connected waterbodies such as McFarland and Pine Lake. The 2016 sample included four year classes of Walleye (three to six years of age), none of which appeared strong. Growth of Walleye had been fairly fast; their mean length at the end their third year was 12.2 inches, compared to 11.1 inches for similar lakes in the Grand Marais area. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1969, Smallmouth Bass have been sampled occasionally in John Lake. This population may also be reliant on immigration of fish from adjacent waterbodies with more robust populations. Although the density may be low, John Lake has shown the ability produce some large Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of White Sucker were sampled in 2016, continuing a trend of declining gill net catches since 1979. Seine hauls were conducted at eight locations in 2016 to examine the near shore fish community in John Lake. Species sampled in these efforts included Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nJohn, Little John, McFarland, and Pine Lake are all infested with Spiny Waterflea, a prohibited aquatic invasive species. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota aquatic invasive species laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",
