Other area lakes in this class include:  Anderson, Belmont, Jim, and Tonseth. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance is below normal for this lake class with a gill net catch rate of 1.0 per lift.  The average weight of individual northern pike was 2.9 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that pike reproduction is limited.   <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of black bullheads was 79.5 per lift, which is 3.6 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Yellow bullhead abundance, as indexed by a trap net catch rate of 11.3 per lift, also exceeded the normal range.   <br> \n     The trap net catch rate of bluegills was 0.8 per lift, and is 8.1 times less than the lower limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance is above normal with a trap net catch rate of 1.3 per lift. There appears to be consistent bass natural reproduction as three consecutive year classes were represented in the age-class distribution (ages II-IV).   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is above normal with a trap net catch rate of 7.3 per lift.  Crappie reproduction appears to be consistent as four consecutive year classes (ages II-V) were represented in the sample.  Strong 1988 and 1990 year classes composed 31% and 38% of the black crappie sample, respectively.  Growth rates of crappies are slightly slower than statewide averages with a mean length at age IV of 7.7 inches.   <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of yellow perch was 4.0 per lift, which is within the normal range.   <br> \n</p>",
