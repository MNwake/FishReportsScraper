                "narrative": "<p>Big is a 507 acre lake with 440 (87%) acres of littoral area and maximum depth of 25 feet.  Big Lake is located 4 miles west of Cloquet, MN just north of Hwy #210.  Big Lake has a public access located on the northwest shore.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1956, 1967, 1972, 1982, 1984, 1990, 1994 and 1998.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.6 per lift in 1998.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of walleye were both excellent.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 21.5 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 16.2 inches.  From a sample of aged walleye, it was shown that 94% were born in years that fingerlings were stocked.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 11.4 per lift in 1998.  This index value was high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of northern pike was poor.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 20.7 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 21.2 inches.  However, 15 sampled norther pike were longer than 28 inches, and one was 38 inches long.       Largemouth bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing assessment conducted on the night of 5/21/1998.  A total of 16 largemouth bass were collected.  Size and growth of largemouth bass were both good.  Mean length of sampled largemouth bass was 13.0 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 12.5 inches.     Black crappie abundance indexed with assessment nets was 6.9 per lift in 1998.  This index value was high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of black crappie were poor.  Mean length was 6.9 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 5.6 inches.  Year classes well represented in the age distribution of black crappie aged from 1998 were 1995 and 1996.     Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish abundance indexed with assessment nets were both typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of bluegill was average.  Bluegill mean length was 5.9 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 4.2 inches.  Size of sampled pumpkinseed sunfish was poor with a mean length of 5.3 inches.  Year classes well represented in the age distribution of bluegill aged from 1998 were 1994 and 1995.     Other fish species sampled during the 1998 population assessment included black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish and white sucker.  Green sunfish are considered rare in the Duluth fisheries management area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 1994 Big Lake population assessment indicate high quality walleye, northern pike and bluegill populations.  Abundance indices for these three species were well above the average when compared to other lakes of similar type.  Quality of size structure was also good, with 100% of the sampled walleye longer than 15 inches, 44% of the northern pike longer than 21 inches and 50% of the bluegill longer 6 inches.  Walleye from Big Lake were growing faster than any other population sampled in the Duluth Area, reaching 17.9 inches at age IV.  Northern pike were reaching 21.8 inches at age IV, while bluegill were 4.2 inches long at age IV.  Stocking of walleye in Big Lake appears to have contributed to their abundance.  Of 33 walleye aged from this sample, 97% were born in years that fingerlings were stocked.     Other fish species documented in Big Lake include yellow perch, brown bullhead, black crappie, pumpkinseed and largemouth bass.  Yellow perch were quit abundant, but small.  Brown bullhead, black crappie and pumpkinseed were of average abundance when compared to lakes of similar type.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed were small, with only 27% of the crappies longer than 8 inches and 16% of the pumpkinseed longer than 6 inches.  Largemouth bass could be an important part of the fish community, but they were not effectively sampled by the gear that was used.  An electrofishing assessment to target bass should be conducted in the future.</p>",

A DNR administered, concrete, back-in access is located off County Road #112.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are the primary management species.  Big was last surveyed in 2013.  Big was surveyed during the summer of 2020 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring Largemouth Bass sampling was suspended during the 2020 due to the pandemic.  Previous spring Largemouth Bass electrofishing assessments have shown a robust Largemouth Bass population in Big Lake.  Largemouth Bass gillnet abundance of 1.4 per lift was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  The proportion of adult Largemouth Bass captured in gillnets that exceeded preferred size (greater than 15 inches) was 38%. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 15.0 per trapnet lift was up from 2013 (6.8) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill average length was 4.5 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  One large specimen over nine inches long was captured in the gillnets.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 12.4 per gillnet lift was up from 2013 (11.4) and above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 20.0 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Northern Pike captured that exceeded preferred size (greater than 28 inches) was 9%, while the proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 34 inches) was 1%.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.2 per trapnet lift was down from 2013 (5.6) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was 7.0 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big is a 507 acre lake with 440 (87%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located one mile north of Sawyer, MN and has a DNR administered, concrete, back-in access located off County #112.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002.  Primary management species from the 2000 management plan were walleye and largemouth bass and secondary management species were black crappie and bluegill.     Walleye abundance of 1.4 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance has declined from 4.7 and 2.6 per gillnet lift in 1994 and 1998.  Of the 13 walleye aged from the 2003 investigation, 8 (62%) were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Investigations conducted in 1994 and 1998 showed that 97% and 94% of the walleye aged from those investigations were born in years that walleye were stocked.  Mean length was 22.6 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age IV of 17.2 inches.     A total of 7 largemouth bass were sampled by gillnets.  Mean length of largemouth bass was 12.6 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 10.5 inches.          Black crappie abundance of 3.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 6.8 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 5.6 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1997 year-class and all year-classes from 1994 through 2001 represented.     Bluegill abundance of 11.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 5.2 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 4.0 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year-class and all year-classes from 1995 through 1999 represented.     Northern pike abundance of 17.7 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 20.2 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 20.5 inches.  Age analysis revealed steady recruitment from 1997 through 2001.     Yellow perch abundance of 3.1 per gillnet lift was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Mean length was 6.3 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 5.2 inches.  Age analysis revealed only 1997, 1998 and 1999 year-classes represented.     Other fish species sampled include black bullhead, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish.     Results of the last three investigation (1994, 1998 and 2003) have shown a declining catch rate for walleye despite stocking of fingerlings every other year.  The exceptionally high abundance of northern pike may be limiting the success of the stocking program.  The stocking program will be more thoroughly examined in the lake management plan to be written in conjunction with the 2003 lake survey.</p>",

A DNR administered, concrete, back-in access is located off County Road #112.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in nine years from 1989 through 2004.  Big Lake is currently stocked only in years with surplus walleye production.  Big Lake was sampled in 2008 to help evaluate walleye management and update information on the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from seven investigations since 1956 have ranged from 0.9 to 4.6 per lift.  The average size of 21.8 inches was considered large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed six year-classes represented from 1998 through 2004. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance of 18.1 per hour of electrofishing was considered average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average size of 14.3 inches was large and growth rate had declined from fast to slow between 1998 and 2008.  Analysis of age distribution revealed relatively strong 2000 and 2003 year-classes and nine year-classes represented from 1997 through 2005. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 16.3 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 21.7 inches was average and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2004 and 2005 year-classes and seven year-classes represented from 2001 through 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 6.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size for yellow perch of 7.1 inches was small. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.4 per trapnet lift was considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 5.2 inches was small and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2005 year-class with five year-classes represented from 2000 through 2005. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 22.0 per trapnet lift was considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.9 inches was small and growth was slow compared to Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2005 year-classes with nine year-classes represented from 1998 through 2006. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the assessment included black bullhead, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big is a 507-acre lake with 440 (87%) acres of littoral area maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located one mile north of Sawyer, MN off County Road #112.  A DNR administered, concrete, back-in access is located off County Road #112.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in eleven years from 1989 through 2013.  Big Lake is currently stocked only in years with surplus walleye production.  Big Lake was sampled in 2013 to help evaluate walleye management and update information on the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.0 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and down from 2004 (0.9).  Prior to this assessment, walleye gillnet catch rates from eight investigations since 1956 had ranged from 0.9 to 4.7 per lift.  One mature individual measuring 23.4 inches was captured in the trapnets.  The specimen was aged to the 2004 year-class, corresponding to a year when 31,904 fingerlings were stocked.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  The high abundance of other top level predators (northern pike, largemouth bass) may be limiting the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance of 104.0 per hour of electrofishing was considered above average compared to other Duluth Area lakes and was considerably higher than 2004 (18.1 per hour).  Average size of 15.0 inches was large and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Twenty-five percent of the sample captured was greater than 16 inches in length.  Age distribution revealed consistent recruitment and relatively strong 2004, 2006 and 2007 year-classes.   Ten year-classes were represented from 2002 through 2011. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 11.4 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type but down from 2004 (16.3 per lift).  Average size of 20.4 inches was small and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  However, quality sized northern pike are available with several captured over 35 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2005 year-class and nine year-classes represented from 2004 through 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 6.8 per trapnet lift was considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.7 inches was small and growth was slow compared to Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2005 year-classes with eight year-classes represented from 2002 through 2010. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 5.9 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size for yellow perch of 6.9 inches was small. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average size was 7.4 inches.  Black crappie abundance has been steadily decreasing over the last four investigations.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the assessment included black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Big Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 9, 2020. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with three sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites and deep, soft sediments or dense woody habitat prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with trap net and gill net data from a 2020 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Big Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the St. Louis River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
