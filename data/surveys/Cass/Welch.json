                "narrative": "<p>Welsh is a 188-acre lake located 8 miles south and 3 miles east of Cass Lake, Minnesota in northern Cass County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 59 feet with 41 percent less than 15 feet deep.  A state-owned access located on the east shore of Welsh may be reached by Chippewa National Forest Road No.2004 (Oak Point Road).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has categorized Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on each lake's physical and chemical characteristics.  Welsh is in Lake Class 31.  Other local lakes in this classification include Child (6 miles west of Longville), May (in Walker), and Ox Yoke (4 miles northeast of Backus).     Similar to the 1991 assessment, the 1995 assessment found Welsh to have an abundant northern pike population, with a catch rate of 10.8 fish/net. About 35 percent of the northern pike checked in the 1995 assessment were 21 inches or longer, and individuals up to 32 inches were sampled.  The average length of northern pike at four years of age was 23.9 inches.The 1995 assessment indicated that the abundance of walleye in Welsh (3.5 fish/experimental gill net) is similar to the average found in other lakes of this type.  Walleye collected during the 1995 sampling had a good size distribution, ranging from 9 to 29 inches.  DNR assessments have commonly found walleye originating from years stocking was not done. This finding indicates walleye naturally reproduce in Welsh Lake. Growth was typical for the area with the average age four walleye was 14.3 inches long.Largemouth bass ranging from 5 to 16 inches in length were sampled by electrofishing, for a catch rate of 36 fish/hr.  The mean length and weight of these fish were 13.2 inches and 1.4 lbs. The average age four largemouth bass in Welsh was 11.9 inches long.Most black crappie sampled in 1995 were collected by electrofishing. Black crappie were sampled at a rate of 40.7 fish/hr and ranged in length from 9 to 11 inches.  At age five, black crappie averaged 10.1 inches long.The 1995 catch of bluegill (8.2 fish/trap net) was near the average for lakes of this type. Bluegill sampled on Welsh during the last two DNR assessments have had a good average size.  In 1995, 40 percent of bluegill sampled were 7 inches or larger.  Growth of bluegill was similar to that found in other local lakes of this type. The average bluegill was 4.4 inches at age four.    Other species captured in the 1995 assessment include bowfin, cisco (tullibee), yellow bullhead, black bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and yellow perch.To help maintain quality fish populations in Welsh Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Welsh Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Welsh Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Welch Lake was conducted on July 7th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (a single Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 17th, 2020 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Welch Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The length frequency distribution shows a good size distribution for the population with quality size fish available.  Natural reproduction appears good.  Gillnet catches indicate a fairly high black bullhead population.  Most of the fish range from 7 to 9 inches in length.  The bluegill net catch was not very high and few fish were above 7 inches in length.  The trapnet catch of largemouth bass was high and made up primarily of fish less than 10 inches.  Bass up to 18 inches were taken.  Fair numbers of black crappie were sampled ranging in size from 4 to 14 inches, indicating that several year classes are present.  The gillnet catch of walleye was fairly low.  The fish sampled were from natural reproduction or emmigration from other lakes.</p>",

Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 82.6 (?4.1) out of 100 possible.

Other Lake Class 31 lakes in the Walker Area include Bowen (DOW# 11-0350), Five Point (DOW# 11-0351), Little Webb (DOW# 11-0387), and Sanborn (DOW# 11-0361). The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill are the highlights for anglers looking to fish Welch Lake. The Black Crappie gill net catch rate exceeded the management goal of one to two fish per net. Black Crappie averaged six inches long and lengths ranged from 4 to 14 inches. A strong 2019 year-class should provide excellent angling opportunities by 2023. Bluegill numbers increased since 2015, though the trap net catch rate of seven fish per net was below management goal of 10 to 20 per net. Bluegill averaged four inches in length and lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches. Northern Pike were abundant. The Northern Pike gill net catch rate increased to near 15 fish per net, which exceeded the management goal of 6 to 10 fish per net. Northern Pike averaged 19 inches long and lengths ranged from 13 to 23 inches. Over 95 percent of the Northern Pike in the sample were less than 22 inches long. Walleyes were moderately abundant. The Walleye gill net catch rate was just over two fish per net which was within the management goal of 2 to 4 fish per net. Walleye averaged 18 inches long and lengths ranged from 11 to 21 inches. Yellow Perch numbers remained near historic lows. The Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of slightly higher than one fish per net was well below the management goal of 20 to 40 fish per net. Yellow Perch are the main forage fish for Walleye. The low Yellow Perch numbers may be limiting the success of Walleye stocking. The evaluation of Walleye stocking success in Welsh Lake is ongoing.  The evaluation of non-stocked years cannot be done with any certainty because fry are stocked into either Cooked or Welsh lakes annually. In order to evaluate stocked versus non-stocked years, stocking should be done in both lakes every other year in the same years. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Welch Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net catch rate increased from 1.2/lift in 1987 to 3.8/lift in 1991.  The 1991 rate falls between the median and the third quartile for lake class 31.  Walleye captured ranged in length from 8 to 24 inches, with no strong modal length group.  The mean length walleye in 1991 was 15.3 inches, which was down from 17.8 inches in 1987.  The PSD was also down in 1991 (55) from 1987 (75).  Growth was good at all ages, with an age 5 fish being 17.6 inches long.  The only stocking year gap in the last six years was in 1987.  Two walleye were aged as age 4 (1987) so it would be difficult to assess the natural reproduction of walleye.Northern pike gill net indices have increased from 3.3/lift in 1957 to 16.5/lift in 1991.  The 1991 rate was above the third quartile (10.50/lift).  The PSD has changed very little from 1957 to 1991, but the mean length of northern pike captured has increased (17.5 inches in 1957; 21.2 inches in 1991).  Growth was good for all ages, with an age 3 fish being 20.8 inches long.  There were some differences in the growth rate between male and female northern pike:AGE\tMALE\tFEMALE\tCOMBINED1\t10.1\t11.4\t10.92\t16.8\t18.5\t17.93\t19.4\t21.5\t20.84\t20.5\t23.5\t22.35\t21.6\t24.2\t22.9Yellow perch abundance in 1991 (68.2/gill net lift) increased by fourfold over 1987 (17.7/lift) and was well above the third quartile.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches with a modal length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.Bluegill trapnet indices have increased from no bluegill found in 1957 to 5.1/lift in 1987 to 16.7/lift in 1991.  The 1991 catch rate falls between the first quartile (11.71/lift) and median (30.63/lift).  The PSD, RSD-7, and RSD-8 and mean length have all increased from 1987 to 1991:\tPSD\tRSD-7\tRSD-8\tMEAN LENGTH (INCHES)1991\t64\t25\t6\t5.91987\t17\t4\t2\t5.3Growth was marginally slow for the first two years and good the ensuing years.  An age 5 bluegill was 7.1 inches long.Black crappie were captured at the same rate in 1991 (0.2/trapnet lift) as they were in 1987 (0.4/trapnet lift).  Ice-out trapnetting could possibly better assess these fish.  The black crappie that were caught showed good growth.Largemouth bass abundance in 1991 (1.7/trapnet lift) was down from 1987 (5.2/trapnet lift).  The 1991 rate was still above the third quartile.  Of the 19 bass that were captured in 1991, none were older than 3 years.  These fish exhibited good growth, with an age 3 fish being 8.9 inches long.All three species of bullhead were captured at low numbers except for black bullhead (11.5/gillnet lift), which exceeded the third quartile (6.33/gillnet lift).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Welsh Lake is a 188-acre lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet.  The lake is within  the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and is located nine miles south of Cass Lake in northern Cass County.  Welsh Lake is connected to Crooked Lake via a navigable channel.  Fish can migrate between the two lakes.  There is a DNR concrete public access on Welsh Lake off of Oak Point Road.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Welsh Lake is in lake class 31. Lakes in this lake class are typically moderate in size, moderately deep, and moderately clear.  Half of the shoreline around the lake is publicly owned.  Approximately 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Most of the watershed around the lake is forested with extensive areas of bog.  Welsh Lake provides good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.Northern pike abundance  was above what you would typically find in a Lake Class 31 lake.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 22.75 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Growth was above average and there were different age groups present.Walleye abundance in 2000 was comparable to what was found in 1991 and 1995, and was typical of other Lake Class 31 lakes.  Young walleye are stocked in both Crooked and Welsh Lake by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Department of Resource Management.  The stocking along with natural reproduction is supporting the abundant walleye population.  Walleye ranged in length from 12 to 20 inches with an average length of 15 inches.Welsh Lake is well known for its panfish such as bluegill and black crappie.  Both species of fish show good quality, however, that quality is being affected by high angler harvest.  To maintain or improve quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger panfish and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Yellow perch and cisco provide food fish for predator fish and are abundant in Welsh Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.The shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive that pure sand      trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

The species of fish most commonly caught are northern pike and walleyes.  Zero to three boats were observed fishing during the lake survey.FISH STOCKING:From the period of 1913 to 1940, walleyes and crappies were stocked, and since then there has been no stocking.DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY:The physical, chemical, and fish population characteristics of Welsh Lake indicate it can best be managed as a walleye lake.Test net catches indicate substantial populations of northern pike and walleyes present in the lake, and the age distribution of these fish indicates good natural reproduction during most years.  A strong walleye year-class should enter the catch in 1958.  Northern pike reproduction was particularly good in 1954 and 1957, and good fishing for this species should continue. Test net catches indicate a low bullhead population, similar to that usually found in walleye lakes of this area.Perch are numerous but of good average size.Growth rates of species checked are satisfactory.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Welch Lake (DOW# 11-0493; Lake Class 31) is a 195-acre lake located near Wilkinson, MN.  <br> \nA DNR owned public access is located on the east shore of Welch Lake. Welch Lake has 2.30 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 59 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Welch Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in the class are generally clear, productive, with moderate depth. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill are the highlights for anglers looking to fish Welch Lake. Black Crappie up to 14 inches were sampled. A large year class from 2011 should provide ample opportunities for anglers. Bluegill were not as abundant as in the past, however Bluegill up to 9 inches were sampled. Additional opportunities exist for anglers targeting Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Neither were abundant however Northern Pike up to 30 inches, and Largemouth Bass up to 18 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Welch Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Welsh Lake (DOW # 110493, Lake Class 31) is a 188-acre lake located about nine miles south of the City of Cass Lake, MN.  Welsh Lake has a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp and is connected to Crooked Lake by a narrow channel navigable by small watercraft.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Welsh Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally hard- water lakes with regularly shaped shoreline (few bays or points).  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill, and secondarily for cisco (tullibee), black crappie, yellow perch, and walleye. Both the number and average size of northern pike in Welsh Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 13 to 31 inches and had an average length of 23 inches.  The largemouth bass population appears to be good, and fish up to 17 inches were found.  Bluegill abundance was good, however many bluegill were small; a few 7-inch bluegill were sampled.  The decrease in average size of bluegill is likely due to anglers keeping too many large bluegill.  Black crappie numbers compared favorably with other lakes in this class and most were in the 8- to 10-inch range.  Yellow perch abundance was similar to other lakes of this type, however most were small.  Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Welsh Lake was similar to the average of other lakes in Lake Class 31.  Fish from 17 to 25 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  Other species present include bluegill, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Welsh Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",
