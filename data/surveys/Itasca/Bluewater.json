                "narrative": "<p>Bluewater Lake is located about 13 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and within the Mississippi River watershed.  The 356 acre lake has 72 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 120 feet, and is connected to the Wabana chain of lakes.  There is moderate development and plant diversity along the 4.6 mile shoreline.  Boat access can be gained through a channel from Wabana Lake.  The lake management plan was last updated in 2010.  Additional near-shore IBI sampling was also conducted and can be referenced in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nBluewater Lake has been primarily managed for Lake Trout since 1967 with yearlings being stocked biennially in odd years since 1991.  All stocked yearlings since 1993 were given a specific fin clip to differentiate between stocked age classes and natural reproduction due to the difficulty of ageing Lake Trout.  Deep-water gill nets sampled 17 fish at a rate of 1.9/net, below the lake management plan goal of 3.0/net.  Catch rates have ranged from 1.3/net in 1991 to 4.1/net in 2009 with an average catch rate of 2.7/net since 1991.  Lengths ranged from 7.4 to 32.5 inches with an average length of 24.0 inches and an average weight of 6.2 pounds.  Field analysis identified one marked fish correlating to age 1 and the 2015 spring stocking.  The remaining fish were likely from natural reproduction except the longest fish (32.5 inches) which potentially predated the fin clip markings.  The length frequency from 2015 was comparable to the 2009 assessment in which ages were determined from otoliths and correlated to the length frequency.  This comparison suggests multiple age classes present with most of the sample at least age 9. <br> \n <br> \nCisco were the most numerous fish sampled in deep-water gill nets (2.9/net).  Catches tend to be variable as the lowest catch rate was 0.1/net in 2007 while the highest was two years later at 5.0/net.  The 2015 catch rate was the second highest observed.  Sampled fish ranged from 6.3 to 18.2 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches, similar to the previous assessment.  Internal examinations conducted on 23 Cisco identified Triaenophorus in 26% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass population can be characterized by low numbers but with a quality size structure.  The catch rate was 0.9/net in deep-water gillnets, above the previous assessment of 0.5/net.  Catch rates have ranged from 0.3/net in 1986 to 1.5/net in 1980.  Lengths ranged from 10.5 to 18.9 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.  Ageing structures were not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 10.6/trap net, near the lake class first quartile (7.7/net).  The previous assessment sampled 8.6/net in 2007 in which trap nets were employed.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding seven inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluewater Lake is located about 13 miles north of Grand Rapids and in the Chippewa National Forest. Fish production is limited due to low fertility associated with oligotrophic conditions. Bluewater Lake has a long history of trout management but has been primarily managed for Lake Trout since 1961. Management has consisted mainly of numerous stockings. Most stocked fish were given a specific fin clip to help differentiate between stocked and natural reproduction since 1990. Stocking was discontinued after 2017 due to poor returns from stocking and because natural reproduction appeared capable of maintaining the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 lake management plan lists Lake Trout as a primary species of management with a deep-water gill net catch rate goal of 3.0/net. Quality size Smallmouth Bass have been sampled in most surveys and are listed as a secondary management species though there is no management goal. The 2022 targeted survey was conducted to evaluate the status of the Lake Trout population as well as a reference for the new Caribou Lake experimental regulation. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout are typically not abundant in any lake due to the nature of the cold, infertile lakes they inhabit. They often occupy deep, open water and can be difficult to sample, so low catches are not uncommon. Catches in deep-water gill nets have ranged from 1.3 to 4.3/net but have typically been near 3.0/net since 1980. The 2022 catch of 2.2/net was less than the management goal. No fin clipped fish were sampled. Captured trout ranged from 10.0 to 30.1 inches with an average length of 19.6 inches. The wide range of lengths suggests recruitment has been consistent. The lack of fin clips indicated these fish originated from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nDeep-water gill nets may not reflect the numbers of other species, but Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike and Tullibee catches resembled previous surveys and have never been high.  The fishery provides good opportunities for anglers to catch large pike and bass.  Both species have traditionally had quality size structure, similar to what was observed in 2022. Largemouth Bass were the only other species sampled in deep-water gill nets. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluewater Lake is located about 13 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and within the Mississippi River watershed.  The 356 acre lake has 72 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 120 feet, and is connected to the Wabana chain of lakes.  There is moderate development and plant diversity along the 4.6 mile shoreline.  Summer access can be gained through a channel from Wabana Lake and through the camp on the north end during winter. <br> \n <br> \nBluewater Lake has been primarily managed for lake trout since 1967, and recently, yearlings have been stocked on an every-other-year schedule.  All stocked yearlings since 1993 were given a specific fin clip to differentiate between stocked age classes and natural reproduction because of the difficulty of ageing lake trout.  As part of a strain evaluation project beginning in 2005, both Gillis Lake and Mountain Lake strain lake trout were stocked at 2.5/acre (910).  Each fish was given a fin clip to distinguish between the strains and assign ages to individuals.  The goal of the project was to evaluate growth and survival of the paired stockings at age 4 across the state, however due to the timing of the 2007 special assessment (which evaluated ages 1 and 3) and the need to increase the statewide sample size, a final special assessment was conducted in 2009 (evaluating ages 1, 3, and 5). <br> \n <br> \nDeepwater gill nets sampled 33 lake trout at a rate of 4.1/net, exceeding the previous assessment (2.8/net), and similar to the highest observed catch rate of 4.3/net (1986) since deepwater gill nets have been employed.  Catch rates may not be directly comparable to previous assessments because of a decreased number set (8 instead of 9) and while the locations were relatively similar the depths were adjusted to better target lake trout.  Lengths ranged from 8.2 to 32.1 inches with a mean length of 21.3 inches and a mean weight of 4.5 lbs.  Field analysis identified five marked fish, all age 1.  Four were marked as Gillis strain and one was Mountain strain.  The remainder of sample, 84% (n=28), had no distinguishing marks and are assumed to be from natural reproduction.  Lengths from unmarked fish ranged from 13.4 to 32.1 inches with a mean length of 21.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOtoliths were collected from 17 of the 28 unclipped fish for ageing.   Lengths ranged from 13.4 to 32.1 inches from the same aged by otoliths.  Age analysis suggests ages 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 27 were present.  Most of the fish sampled were between ages 4 to 6 (65%) with age 5 comprising 30% of the aged non clipped sample (n=5).  It should be noted lake trout otoliths tend to crystallize making it difficult to accurately identify early annuli.  The 2009 Bluewater sample was unique in that there was clear definition between annulus formations creating relatively high confidence in the assigned ages in most samples, which is not typical of lake trout otoliths.  Only one fish was unable to be aged due to crystallization and was 32 inches.  The one fish with less than moderate age confidence was partially crystallized and believed to be age 13.  It is speculated that naturalized fish even with multiple generations removed from the hatchery will still have partially crystallized otoliths.   <br> \n <br> \nGillis Lake strain comprised 80% of the marked evaluation fish in the 2009 assessment.  Combined with the previous assessment, Gillis strain comprised 73% of the sample (8 of 11).  Even though the sample size is relatively small, it would suggest that Gillis Lake strain has performed better in Bluewater Lake.  This is consistent with other area lake trout lakes included in the project.  Combining the 2007 and 2009 special assessments, Gillis Lake strain represented 73% of the marked fish sampled in Caribou (11 of 15) and 83% (10 of 12) in Trout Lake.  It appears Gillis Lake strain has performed better than Mountain Lake in the Grand Rapids area, however Mountain Lake will be the only strain available for inland stocking.  Traditionally, Isle Royale and Gillis Lake strain had been stocked into Bluewater Lake with some convincing evidence of natural reproduction.  It is unknown what effect the shift to Mountain Lake strain will have on the lake trout community. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled in deepwater gill nets at a historically high rate of 5.0/net.  This represents a significant increase over the historical low sampled in the previous assessment (0.1/net, n=1).  It is likely this increase may partially be a function of netting variability due to the schooling, open-water nature of tullibee.  Typically, larger fish are not sampled in Bluewater, however 25% of the sample exceeded 10 inches.  Lengths ranged from 6.1-16.9 inches with a mean length of 9.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for other species in deepwater gill nets are typically low and may not be good indicators of relative abundance.  Other species sampled in deepwater gill nets include one largemouth bass, ten northern pike, four rock bass, four smallmouth bass, seven white sucker, and one yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Trout are the primary management species with a management catch rate goal of 3.0/net maintained through natural reproduction and stocking.  Smallmouth Bass are a secondary management species with no defined goals.  The lake management plan was last updated in 2016.  The 2017 targeted survey was conducted to increase the sample size for Lake Trout genetic testing as well as sex and maturity data. <br> \n <br> \nYearling Lake Trout have been stocked at a rate of 5 fish/surface acre (1,820) in odd years since 1991.  All stocked fish were given a specific fin clip to differentiate between stocked age classes and natural reproduction.  Multiple strains of Lake Trout have been stocked over time.  An evaluation between Gillis and Mountain strains occurred from 2005 and 2009 with Mountain Lake strain exclusivity stocked since. <br> \n <br> \nDeepwater gill nets sampled 21 Lake Trout, at a rate of 2.3/net, exceeding the previous survey (1.9/net) yet below the lake management goal.  Catches have typically been low, averaging 3.0/net since the biennial stocking began.  Lengths ranged from 12.4 to 31.7 inches with a mean length of 24.2 inches.  No distinguishing marks were identified during a field examination, similar to what was observed in past surveys.  The limited number of Mountain Lake strain Lake Trout ever sampled indicates poor performance and survival. <br> \n <br> \nSex and maturity was determined from 10 Lake Trout with the remainder (n=11) being alive and released.  Immature fish were not abundant, one female and two males were sampled, while three mature females and four mature males were sampled.  The male sample appeared to mature around 13 inches, though the sample size is small and may not be an accurate reflection. <br> \n <br> \nNaturally reproduced Lake Trout otoliths sometimes display slight crystallization, especially at early ages, providing only moderately confident age estimation.  Hatchery reared Lake Trout almost always will have some degree of crystallization in the otoliths at early ages and cannot be aged accurately without the aid of a fin clip.  Ages determined through otolith analysis from half of the fish caught were ages 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, and 19 present in the sample.  The wide range of ages is similar to what was observed in the 2009 survey.  Age 4 comprised 30% of the sample, while only one representative for the remainder of the ages was observed.  The average length of age 4 was 12.9 inches, similar to age 4 fish from Caribou (12.6 inches).  The sample size was too small to assess age at maturity, but all age 4 were immature and the remainder were mature.  It appears maturity begins as early as age 5 in some individuals.  The wide range of ages observed in the Lake Trout population indicates a history of natural reproduction and recruitment.  It is unclear if the gaps in the age classes are consistent with a low density population or a representation of high exploitation rate. <br> \n <br> \nGenetic analysis was not finished by the report due date and will be included in the lake management plan. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluewater Lake has been primarily managed for lake trout since 1967, and recently, yearlings have been stocked on an every-other-year schedule.  Because of the difficulty of ageing lake trout, all stocked yearlings, since 1993, were given a specific fin clip to differentiate between stocked age classes and natural reproduction.  Beginning in 2005, as part of a strain evaluation project, both Gillis Lake and Mountain Lake strain lake trout were stocked at 5 fish/acre (910).  Each strain was assigned a fin clip to distinguish between the strains and assign ages to individual fish.  The goal of the project was to evaluate survival and growth of the paired stockings at age-4 across the state. <br> \n <br> \nDeepwater gill nets sampled 25 lake trout at a rate consistent with the previous assessment, and consistent with the lake average since deepwater gill net sets were used.  Captured lake trout ranged in length from 7.4-30.7 inches, with an average length of 18.8 inches.  Field inspection indicated that six of the lake trout sampled had an identifying fin clip.  Five fish were identified as age-1 through fin clip markings, of which three were Gillis strain and two were Mountain strain.  All age-1 fish sampled were from the 2007 spring stocking.  Another fin clipped fish was identified as an age-3 Gillis strain (2005 stocking).  The remaining 76% of sampled lake trout lacked a fin clip and are assumed to be from natural reproduction.  The length frequency of known age fish indicates unclipped fish around 16 inches are age-3.  Scale analysis of non-clipped fish suggests that ages 3-9 were present in the sample.  Caution should be exercised when reviewing back-calculated length-at-age data due to the difficulty of accurately reading lake trout scales.  The mean length at the time of capture of the yearling lake trout was 8.4 inches, while the mean back calculation at age-1 of fish assumed to be from natural recruitment was 5.7 inches.  This is consistent with hatchery-reared fish being longer at age-1 due to diet and growing conditions than fish of natural origins.  Scale analysis along with the length frequency suggests that ages 3-7 average about two inches per year.  Statewide averages are inadequate for growth comparisons due to the naturally slow growth and the variability of trout water productivity. <br> \n <br> \nEvaluating between the strains in Bluewater is difficult due to a limited sample size of the target age in the sample (age-3).  Only one age-3 fish was sampled, a 414mm Gillis strain lake trout.  Five marked yearlings were sampled, three Gillis strain and two Mountain strain.  Other lakes in the Grand Rapids area included in the project were Trout Lake (31-0410) and Caribou Lake.  There was no age-3 fish captured in Trout Lake, however 91% of the yearling sampled were Gillis strain.  There was five age-3 fish sampled in Caribou, of which four were identified as Gillis strain and one Mountain strain.  There was no yearling stocked lake trout sampled in Caribou.  At this time, more Gillis strain lake trout have been sampled in the Grand Rapids area, but more time and a larger sample size is needed to make a definitive answer. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for tullibee can be highly variable due to their open water, schooling nature.  Tullibee were sampled at the lowest rate since deepwater gill nets have been used.  The one tullibee sampled was 7.4 inches.  Larger size tullibee are not typically sampled in Bluewater Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for other species sampled in gill nets set deep to sample lake trout are not very useful as an indicator of species abundance.  Other species sampled in deepwater gill nets in relatively low abundance were largemouth and smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate near the lower end of the expected range, and below the previous two assessments.  Lengths ranged from 3.5-8.1 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate above the expected range, and above the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 5.2-14.7 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled at a rate within the expected range.  Other species sampled in trap nets include green sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluewater Lake is in ecological lake class 23 and is located approximately 10 miles north of Grand Rapids, in the Mississippi River Watershed.  The lake is 364 acres and has a maximum depth of 120 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 7 July, 2015.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at eight of the 10 sites; the 50-foot and 15-foot seine was used at four sites each.  Site conditions prevented the use of seining at two sites.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 16 species; 11 species by seining and 12 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 24 August, 2015, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
