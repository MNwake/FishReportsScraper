WAE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO STOCKING IN 1989 AND 1990.  WAE AVERAGED 4.75/GILL NET COMPARED TO 0.33/GILL NET IN 1989.  WAE SAMPLED WERE DOMINATED BY 2 YEAR OLD WITH FEWER 3 YEAR OLDS PRESENT.  BOTH AGE CLASSES ARE FROM FINGERLING STOCKINGS.  BLC ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-5, WITH 1 AND 4 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS.  BLC HAVE DECLINED FROM 78.75/TRAP NET IN 1989 TO 4.50/GILL NET.  IN 1989, BLC WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-6 WITH 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING.  BLG HAVE INCREASED FROM 34.25/TRAP NET IN 1989 TO 71.25/TRAP NET.  THE BLG SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS FAVORABLE, WITH MOST FISH 7.0-8.9 INCHES.  BLG WERE DOMINATED BY AGES 4-7, WITH A FEW 1-3 YEAR OLDS SAMPLED.  BLG IN 1989 WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 2-4, WITH 3 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING.  TWO OF THE YEAR CLASSES (1984,1985) THAT WERE PRESENT IN 1989 WERE AGAIN SAMPLED IN 1992 AS 6 AND 7 YEAR OLDS.  PMK INCREASED FROM 9.00/TRAP NET TO 39.75/TRAP NET.  PMK HAVE A FAVORABLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, WITH A MEDIAN OF 6.0 INCHES.  PMK ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY AGES 2-6 WITH 3-6 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT.  ELECTROFISHING INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LMB.  ONLY ONE 2 YEAR OLD WAS SAMPLED IN NETTING AND 7 Y-O-Y WERE CAPTURED IN SHORELINE SEINING.  FISHING REPORTS INDICATE A FAIR POPULATION PRESENT.  YEP REMAIN ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 51.75/GILL NET COMPARED TO 44.50/GILL NET IN 1989.  YEP ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY AGES 2-6.  FRD INCREASED FROM 6.00/GILL NET TO 11.50/GILL NET.

Populations for both bluegill and black crappie contain good numbers of smaller individuals which are moving up into the fishery and should contribute substantially to the creel in the near future.  The average bluegill and crappie sampled were 5.7 and 4.9 inches, respectively.  Yellow perch continue to be the primary gamefish in Clear Lake.  Anglers can expect to catch plenty of perch with the average fish being 7.5 inches in length.  Fish up to 12 inches are possible.  Northern pike are abundant with fish ranging between 15 - 31 inches.  Walleye are also present in good numbers with fish distributed between 10 - 24 inches.  Other species present in moderate abundance include pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass and black bullhead.</p>",

IT APPEARS NORTHERNS ARE REPRODUCING WELL IN THE LAKE OR IN THE CO-OP NPSA. THE PRESENT NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY YOUNG FISH WITH A STRONG I AGE CLASS PRESENT AND FEWER II,III AND V AGE CLASSED FISH. WALLEYE CATCH RATES HAVE DE- CLINED FROM 3.00/GILLNET IN '83 TO 0.66/GILLNET IN '87. WALLEYE WERE LAST STOCKED IN '83 WITH YEARLINGS AND IT APPEARS SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY BE TAKING PLACE WITH II, III, AND IV AGE CLASSES APPEARING. CATCH RATES FOR BLACK CRAPPIE HAS DECLINED FROM 79.25/TRAPNET IN '83 TO 46.75/ TRAPNET IN '87. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE NOW DOMINATED BY I AGE CLASS FISH, WITH FEWER II, III, IV AND V AGE CLASSES. BLACK CRAPPIES WERE DOMINATED BY IV AGE CLASS FISH IN '83, WITH FEWER II AND III AGE CLASS FISH CAPTURED. WHITE CRAPPIE CATCH RATES HAVE DECLINED FROM 1.75/TRAPNET IN '83 TO NONE SAMPLED IN '87.

The lake is relatively small at 268 acres with a maximum depth of about 18 feet.  A fishery survey was conducted on Clear Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Black bullhead and black crappie were the most abundant species in the gill net catches.  Most black bullhead were between 5 to 12 inches long with the majority around 7 inches.  Most black crappie caught in the gill nets were around 5.5 to 6.5 inches long.  Walleye were caught in moderate numbers, but were generally large - from 19 to 25 inches long.  Most of these walleye were age 6 from the 1998 year class.  Trap net catches were comprised primarily of bluegill and to lesser extent pumpkinseed sunfish and black bullhead.  Many of the bluegill were around 6 to 7 inches long, the largest was just under 9 inches.  Most pumpkinseed were around 5 to 6 inches.  Northern pike were caught in moderate numbers with most between 20 and 30 inches in length.  A boat launch is located on the west shore adjacent to a county park.  An aeration system is operated on Clear Lake in the winter.  Use caution when traveling on the ice.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 268 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the city of Lexington.  A DNR owned public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Clear Lake is a shallow basin with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake was surveyed the week of June 24, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to assess the fish community.  Bluegill was the most abundant fish species observed in this survey.  Catch rates were 23.0 fish/trap net and 3.0 fish/gill net.  Bluegill lengths from both net types ranged from 2.5 to 8.0 inches and averaged over 6.0 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe average number of black crappies from gill nets in Clear Lake throughout the last 20 years has been over 25.0 fish/net.  However, the 2013 survey yielded only 10.5 black crappies/gill net and less than 1.0 black crappie/trap net.  The length of black crappie in gill nets averaged nearly 8.0 inches and ranged from 4.0 to 10.0 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Clear Lake has produced strong populations of yellow perch through natural recruitment.  In five of the last seven surveys conducted on Clear Lake, yellow perch catch rates were above average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The 2013 survey yielded moderate yellow perch numbers, with gill nets averaging nearly 15.0 fish/net.  The average length of yellow perch was nearly 7.0 inches, ranging from 5.0 to 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been stocked in Clear Lake annually since 2007 to sustain the population.  The 2013 survey averaged 6.0 fish/gill net, which was the highest northern pike abundance ever recorded at Clear Lake.  Northern pike averaged over 23.0 inches and ranged from 19.0 to 28.0 inches.  Ages of northern pike ranged from 2- to 5-years old, but most were from the 2010 year class (3-years old).  With annual stocking and good forage available, Clear Lake should continue to develop into a quality northern pike fishery.    <br> \n <br> \nBased on the 2013 survey walleye abundance remained low in Clear Lake, despite stocking every other year.  Gill net catch rates had been below average compared to similar lakes in the area for the last 2 survey cycles.  Similarly, only 3 walleye were collected among all gill nets during 2013.  With that said, the size of walleye sampled was relatively large with an average total length exceeding 19.0 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance was at a modest level in 2013.  Gill nets averaged 12 black bullheads per set, which was the lowest catch rate on record for Clear Lake.  The size distribution of black bullheads was good with total length averaging nearly 11.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species collected in low numbers included largemouth bass, freshwater drum, white sucker, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nA near shore survey (Index of Biotic Integrity; IBI) was also conducted in Clear Lake the week of June 24, 2013 to assess the populations of nongame species and young-of-the-year game fish using backpack electrofishing and beach seining.  Near shore sampling collected several species of fish including black bullhead (N=23), black crappie (N=31), bluegill (N=325), fathead minnow (N=1), golden shiner (N=6), largemouth bass (N=1), northern pike (N=45). pumpkinseed (N=14), and yellow perch (N=74).  Data collected from near shore sampling will be used to develop an IBI score, which is used to gauge the health of Clear Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 268-acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the city of Lexington.  A DNR owned public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Clear Lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and is classified as lake class 24, based on limnological variables (e.g., basin morphometry, depth, substrate type, water clarity, etc.). <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of June 5, 2018 as part of a regular DNR monitoring program.  A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets as well as electrofishing to assess the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nClear lake has historically produced a high density Black Crappie fishery.  Relative abundance of Black Crappie in 2018 was 16.6/trap net, which was an increase from 2013 (0.8/trap net).  Black Crappie were also sampled very effectively with gill nets, and were captured at a rate of 26.7/gill net. Black Crappie ranged from 3.6 to 11.1 inches and averaged 9.8 inches in trap nets. Gill nets sampled slightly smaller Black Crappie that ranged from 3.7 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill historic relative abundance has been moderate to high in Clear Lake. Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 24.0/trap net in 2018, which was slightly higher than in 2013 (23.1/trap net). Bluegills ranged from 2.7 to 9.1 inches in length and averaged 6.1 inches in 2018. Six year classes of Bluegill were sampled in 2018 (2010, 2012, 2014-2017). The majority of Bluegill aged (94%) were from the 2014-2017 year classes (age 1-4).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have historically been in low abundance in Clear Lake, other than 1989 (33/gill net) the average relative abundance of Walleye is 2.0/gill net.  Relative abundance increased slightly from the 2013 survey, increasing from 0.3/gill net to 0.8/gill net in 2018. One year class of Walleye was present (2014). Although sample size was small, Walleye size structure was good. Walleyes ranged from 15.4 to 21.6 inches and averaged 18.1 inches in gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were assessed using day-time electrofishing. Relative abundance of Largemouth Bass was 1.82/hour run-time, many more fish were seen avoiding the boat as the water was very clear and shallow.  Average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2018 was 13.6 inches and ranged from 12.4 to 14.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically been moderately abundant in Clear Lake and the trend continued in 2018 with a relative abundance of 5.7/gill net. Northern Pike sampled with gill nets ranged from 16.2 to 34.8 inches in length and averaged 24.3 inches.  Five year classes were sampled in 2018 (2013-2017). Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect at Clear Lake. Anglers are allowed two fish per day. All Northern Pike under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch relative abundance (24.8/gill net) increased from 2013 (14.8/gill net). Yellow Perch exhibited small size structure, with no fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.7 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.2 inches. <br> \nBlack Bullhead have historically had a high relative abundance in Clear Lake (average 105/gillnet), but were on a downward trend until 2018 when gillnet numbers were 118.3 per gillnet, or nearly ten times the amount in 2013.  These fish ranged from 4.3 to 13.5 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Many (37%) Black Bullheads were over 10 inches in length and may appeal to commercial fishermen. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, hybrid Sunfish and Golden Shiners were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, specialist <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
