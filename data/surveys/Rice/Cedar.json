                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nCedar Lake is a 902 acre lake located in Rice County west of Faribault. The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet and 673 acres of the lake are classified as littoral area. There are 4 islands on Cedar Lake, the southern 2 islands are designated as an Aquatic Management Area and as a Scientific and Natural Area by the MN DNR. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the north end of the lake. Although portions of Cedar Lake shoreline have been altered for residential development, the lake still offers quality fish habitat, including diverse aquatic vegetation, woody debris, and overhanging limbs. Cedar Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. To maintain the populations, Cedar Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every other year and Northern Pike fry annually. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is designated as an infested water due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil. First discovered in Cedar Lake in 2001, Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake was surveyed the week of August 1, 2016 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 10 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, electrofishing was conducted on June 1, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Cedar Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2019. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in 2016 was 5.8 fish/gill net, which was the highest catch rate on record for Cedar Lake and more than doubled the long-term average (2.2 fish/net). The Walleye were of quality size, as the total length averaged 17.0 inches and ranged from 14.1 to 25.1 inches. Age-2 Walleye (2014 year class) comprised nearly all of the catch (91%), which suggested that the 2014 stocking effort was successful. The oldest individual Walleye from the survey was 16 years old and measured 21.1 inches. The average length at capture was 16.3 inches at age-2 and 20.4 inches at age-3. These growth rates were considerably faster than the statewide average for similar lakes. Walleye fry were recently stocked in Cedar Lake in 2012, 2014, and 2016. The MN DNR will continue to stock Walleye fry on even years. Although the in-lake habitat of Cedar Lake favors panfish and bass, Walleye can provide an additional opportunity for anglers when fry stocking events are successful.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was 5.4 fish/gill net, which was higher than the long-term average for Cedar Lake (2.6 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1 fish/net. Fish from both gear types averaged 23.1 inches in length and ranged from 11.5 to 34.3 inches. The average length at capture was 16.8 inches at age-1, 21.8 inches at age-2, 25.4 inches at age-3, 29.9 inches at age-4, and 32.4 inches at age-5. Northern Pike fry are stocked in Cedar Lake annually in a drainable wetland adjacent to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2016 was 47.5 fish/gill net and 52.8 fish/trap net. Both of these catch rates were above the long-term average for Cedar Lake (31.8 fish/gill net, 20.7 fish/trap net). Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.3 to 12.9 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. The Black Crappie population was generally young, as 96% of the sampled fish were age-3 or younger. However, the growth rates were relatively fast. The average length at capture was 4.6 inches at age-1, 6.3 inches at age-2, and 8.5 inches at age-3. The Cedar Lake Black Crappie population persists through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 79.7 fish/net. This catch rate was higher than the long-term average for Cedar Lake (54.5 fish/net). Bluegill lengths averaged 6.1 inches, while the largest fish measured 9.3 inches. While large fish were generally lacking in this survey, the number of harvestable sized Bluegills was high. Numerous year classes were sampled in the survey, which suggested consistent natural reproduction of Bluegill in Cedar Lake. The average length at capture was 3.4 inches at age-1, 4.6 inches at age-2, 5.6 inches at age-3, 6.7 inches at age-4, and 7.6 inches at age-5. Like all other panfish in Cedar Lake, the Bluegill population is completely self-sustaining.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nSince Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets), targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on Cedar Lake on June 1, 2016 to target Largemouth Bass. The catch rate was 37.3 fish/hour in 2016, which was right at the long-term average for Cedar Lake (37.7 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass were also sampled in gill and trap nets in low abundance (0.1 and 0.6 fish/net, respectively). Lengths of Largemouth Bass sampled electrofishing ranged from 2.9 to 18.9 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. Numerous year classes were present, including schools of larval Largemouth Bass, which suggested consistent successful natural reproduction in Cedar Lake. This can be attributed to the diverse habitat within the lake. Spring electrofishing surveys targeting Largemouth Bass will complement each Standard Survey that is completed on Cedar Lake (every 3 years). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThe 2016 Yellow Perch catch rate was 3.2 fish/gill net, was lower than the catch rate of the previous survey on Cedar Lake (40.3 fish/net) and lower than the long-term average of 11.0 fish/net. Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.1 to 9.6 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. Ages ranged from 2 to 6 years old. The average length at capture was 5.5 inches at age-2, 6.2 inches at age-3, and 8.1 inches at age-5. The Yellow Perch population in Cedar Lake has been cyclical throughout the survey history and is typically comprised of a small fish. However, Yellow Perch serve a very important function as a prey species for predators, such as Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nPumpkinseed were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 3.5 fish/net. Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 7.3 inches and averaged 5.7 inches. Pumpkinseed are members of the Sunfish family and can be distinguished from Bluegill by the bright orange spot at the tip of the ear flap and the lack of a dark blotch on the soft portion of the dorsal fin. Pumpkinseeds are common in Minnesota but are usually smaller in size than the Bluegill. Other fish species sampled throughout the 2016 survey included Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, White Bass, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Bowfin, Freshwater Drum, White Sucker, Golden Shiner, and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nCedar Lake continues to provide quality panfish angling opportunities. Bluegill numbers were strong, with many harvestable sized fish in the population. Although Black Crappie size structure was poor, numbers were strong and anglers have been able to find larger fish. The 2014 year class of Walleye appeared to be successful and should provide quality Walleye angling, especially with continued stocking by the DNR. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \nKip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 902-acre lake located in Rice County west of Faribault. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the north end of the lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet with approximately 75% less than 15 feet deep. Cedar Lake has poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by high nutrient levels. There are four islands located on Cedar Lake with the southern two maintained as public land. Although portions of Cedar Lake shoreline have been altered for residential development, the lake still offers quality fish habitat, including diverse aquatic vegetation, woody debris, and overhanging limbs. Cedar Lake is designated as an infested water body due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil since 2001. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The management plan calls for stocking 100,000 Northern Pike fry in odd years and 673,000 Walleye fry in even years. Northern Pike fry are also stocked in even years when consecutive gill net catch rates fall below 6 fish/net.  <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. The 2019 standard survey was completed the week of July 29, 2019 using 10 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and 71 minutes of boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most abundant fish surveyed in 2019. A total of 866 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 86.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. Since 1996, gill net catch rates have varied from 3.2/net to 109.6/net with an average of 50.0/net. The catch rate in the previous survey in 2016 was 47.5/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 4.1 to 11.9 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Black Crappies were also abundant in trap nets with a catch rate of 20.8/net and lengths ranging from 4.3 to 15.6 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. The 2014 year class was particularly abundant and averaged 9.6 inches at capture. Overall, growth was moderate with fish exceeding 8 inches during their third year. Cedar Lake continues to be a top tier Black Crappie fishery with a consistently abundant population and trophy fish potential. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 548 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets in 2019 for a catch rate of 45.7/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. In five trap net samples since 1996, catch rates have ranged from 35.8/net to 86.1/net with an average of 61.0/net. The catch rate in 2016 was 79.7/net. Fish were mostly small in 2019 with a range of 3.5 to 8.6 inches and an average of 6.3 inches. An additional 135 fish ranging from 4.7 to 8.7 inches were sampled with gill nets. Fish ranged from 2 to 9 years old with 8 year classes present. No single year class dominated the sample and the age-frequency distribution showed consistent annual recruitment. Growth was slow with fish exceeding 6 inches in their fifth year. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers remained similar to the 2016 sample with an electrofishing catch rate of 35.4/hour. Since 2001, catch rates have varied from 56.0/hour to 35.4/hour with an average of 42.8/hour. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 21.1 inches with an average of 12.9 inches. Size structure was good with many fish over 15 inches. Fish were 2 to more than 15 years old with 13 year classes present. On average, fish attained quality length of 12 inches by their fifth year and preferred length of 15 inches by their seventh year. The 2019 survey results reflected the abundant high quality habitat for Largemouth Bass in Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 33 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.3/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Catch rates have decreased from an all-time high of 11.2/net in 2012 to 5.4/net in 2016 to 3.3/net in 2019. Since 1996, catch rates have averaged 3.1/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 20.9 to 30.4 inches with an average of 25.6 inches. The length-frequency distribution indicated good size structure with over half the sampled population exceeding the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Six more Northern Pike ranging from 16.1 to 26.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears were 1 to 7 years old with 72% either 3 or 4 years old. Growth was fast with fish reaching 21 inches by age-3. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers dropped from an all-time high of 5.8/net in 2016 to 2.4/net in 2019, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. Since 1996, catch rates have mostly been low with a range of 0.6/net to 5.8/net and an average of 2.6/net. Lengths ranged from 18.6 to 27.6 inches with an average of 21.9 inches. Most of the fish were over 20 inches. Ages ranged from 5 to more than 15 years old with just 4 year classes present. The 2014 year class accounted for more than 89% of the sample. The same year class made up 91% of the 2016 sample. Although not certain, this year class was most likely the result of fry stocked that year. The 2016 and 2019 surveys sampled zero fish from the fry stocked 2012 and 2016 year class. Cedar Lake remains a difficult lake to manage for Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 4.7/gill net, indicating low to moderate abundance. Since 1996, catch rates have ranged from 0.1 to 40.3/net with an average of 7.5/net. The 2012 catch rate of 40.3/net represents the highest on record and the only time a sample has exceeded 6.0/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 4.5 to 7.8 inches with an average of 6.1 inches. Fish were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year classes present. Growth was slow with 5 inches reached in the third year of growth. Cedar Lake does not support a fishable Yellow Perch population but it remains an important part of the fishery, especially concerning Walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Black Bullhead was sampled in 2019 and the mean catch rate was just 0.8/net in five surveys since 2006. Conversely, Yellow Bullheads were the third most sampled fish in gill nets in 2019 with a catch rate of 12.3/net, indicating high abundance. After a mean catch rate of 0.7 from 1996 to 2008, numbers have increased to 14.5/net in three surveys since. The mean length in 2019 was 12.9 inches. Typically, Yellow Bullheads are more common than Black Bullheads in more stable and less degraded lakes. A third species, the Brown Bullhead, was also sampled in 2019 in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nJust eight Common Carp ranging from 16.2 to 27.8 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. No Common Carp were sampled with gill nets. Overall, Common Carp numbers have remained low in recent years with a likely negligible impact on the fishery. Efforts should be made to keep it this way. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2019 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 7.3 ppm and 76.5 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.0 ppm and 61.3 degrees Fahrenheit at 31 feet. A thermocline was detected between 19 and 22 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 902-acre lake located in Rice County west of Faribault. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the north end of the lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 42 feet with approximately 75% less than 15 feet deep. Cedar Lake has poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by high nutrient levels. There are four islands located on Cedar Lake with the southern two maintained as public land. Although portions of Cedar Lake shoreline have been altered for residential development, the lake still offers quality fish habitat, including diverse aquatic vegetation, woody debris, and overhanging limbs. Cedar Lake is similar to other Waterville Area lakes such as Clear Lake (Waseca County), Frances Lake (Le Sueur County), and Madison Lake (Blue Earth County). Cedar Lake is designated as an infested water body due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil since 2001. Cedar Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The management plan calls for stocking 100,000 Northern Pike fry in odd years and 673,000 Walleye fry in even years. Northern Pike fry are also stocked in even years when consecutive gill net catch rates fall below 6 fish/net.  <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. The 2022 standard survey was completed the week of August 1, 2022, using 10 gill nets, 10 trap nets, and 133 minutes of boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were one of the most abundant fish in the 2022 survey with a total of 717 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 71.7/net. Since 1996, gill net catch rates have ranged from 3.2/net to 109.6/net with an average of 52.4/net. The previous survey in 2019 yielded 86.6/net. Black Crappie ranged from 4.5 inches to 11.7 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Very few Black Crappie over 10 inches were sampled. Black Crappie were also abundant in the trap net sample with a catch rate of 23.5/net and lengths ranging from 5.7 inches to 13.0 inches. Black Crappie were up to 8 years old with most 2 to 3 years old. Black Crappie growth was relatively slow with an average length at 4 years old of 8.1 inches. Black Crappie numbers remain strong, yet growth and size structure could be improved upon. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant fish sampled with the trap nets with a total of 596 and a catch rate of 59.6/net. In six surveys since 1996, catch rates have been consistently high with a low of 35.8/net and an average of 60.8/net. The previous survey in 2019 sampled 45.7/net. Bluegill lengths in 2022 ranged from 4.0 inches to 8.4 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. Most Bluegills were over 6 inches but only about 5% were over 8 inches. Bluegills were also common in the gill net sample with a catch rate of 39.4/net and lengths ranging from 4.0 inches to 9.1 inches. Ages ranged from 2 to 10 years old with 9 year-classes present. Three- to six-year-old fish were well represented, indicating strong and consistent recruitment. Like in 2019, growth was slow with fish exceeding 6 inches around year 5 and 8 inches around year 8. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 68 Largemouth Bass were sampled using targeted boat electrofishing during the spring of 2022 for a catch rate of 30.6/hour. Catch rates have steadily dropped in 5 samples from a high of 56.0/net in 2004. The catch rate in 2019 was 35.4/net. Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.5 inches to 18.8 inches with an average of 10 inches. Largemouth Bass were 1 to 12 years old with 12 year-classes represented suggesting recruitment was consistent year to year. The preferred length of 15 inches was attained by around year 6. Cedar Lake continues to support a strong Largemouth Bass fishery due to plentiful high-quality habitat and forage. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 47 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.7/net, up from 3.3/net in 2019. Since 1996, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net to 11.2/net with an average of 3.3/net. Northern Pike catch rates increased to an average of 6.2/net in four surveys since 2008 after averaging less than 1.0/net from 1996 to 2008. Northern Pike in 2022 ranged from 18.3 inches to 39.5 inches with an average of 24.8 inches. Approximately 45% of the Northern Pike sampled were over the minimum legal length limit of 24 inches. Most Northern Pike were young 2- to 4-year-old fish. Northern Pike growth was fast, with the 24-inch threshold exceeded by year 4.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers remained low in 2022 with a catch rate of 2.3/net and about equal to the 2019 catch rate of 2.4/net. Since 1996, catch rates have averaged just 2.6/net and exceeded 3.0/net just two times in 1996 and 2016. Walleye ranged from 20.5 inches to 28.4 inches with an average of 23.1 inches. A vast majority of the sample was 8 years old with a few 11- and 12-year-old Walley also present. The 8-year-old group comes from 2014 when fry were stocked. Unfortunately, no Walleye were sampled from 2016 and 2018 when fry were also stocked. Walleye remain a difficult species to manage in Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nVery few Yellow Perch were sampled in 2022 with trap and gill net catch rates of less than 1.0/net. Only once since 1996 has the gill net catch rate exceeded 10.0/net. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for predator fish and their scarcity may be partially responsible for the ongoing struggles to improve the Cedar Lake Walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOf the three native bullhead species, the Yellow Bullhead was the most common in 2022 (14.7/gill net) followed by Brown Bullhead (2.5/gill net) and Black Bullhead (0.6/ gill net). Yellow Bullheads averaged 12.4 inches with a maximum of 17.2 inches. Brown Bullheads averaged 14.8 inches with a maximum of 16.9 inches. Cedar Lake offers an excellent opportunity for those targeting large bullheads, if such an angler exists. <br> \n <br> \nNo Common Carp were sampled with gill nets and only 11 were sampled with trap nets in 2022. Since 1996, catch ratches have remained low with an average of just 1.1/net. Negative impacts to lake habitat and water quality are likely negligible at such low levels but their presence remains a concern. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Crappie, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 6.5 ppm and 75.6 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.1 ppm and 70.9 degrees Fahrenheit at 28 feet. A thermocline was detected around 25 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

This is the first occurrence of this non-native plant in south-central Minnesota.  Anglers should make sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving Cedar Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes.  Gill net catches were comprised primarily of bluegill.  Bluegill and black crappie were the most abundant fishes in the trap net catches.  Most bluegill were around 6 to 7 inches and most black crappie were aground 8 to 9 inches.  Walleye up to 24 inches and northern pike up to 27 inches were captured in the survey nets.  Electrofishing in late September caught 78 largemouth bass in two hours of effort.  Largemouth bass ranged up to 17.8 inches, although most were around 13 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 927.0 acre lake located in Rice County near the Town of Warsaw. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Cedar Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. A DNR owned boat ramp is located in the northeast corner of the lake. Cedar Lake is rare in that it supports a diverse and abundant aquatic vegetation community which provides valuable cover and spawning habitat for a number of fish species. White-stem pondweed was observed during largemouth bass electrofishing, and appeared to be abundant, despite the establishment of Eurasian water milfoil and curly-leaf pondweed. White-stem pondweed is a native vegetation that provides valuable habitat for several species of fish.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, white crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye. Northern pike and walleye populations are maintained through stocking. Walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2012, and the current management plan calls for stocking to occur every other year at rate of 673,000 fry per stocking. Northern pike fry are stocked a rate of 100,000/year and have been stocked in 2003, 2010, 2011, and 2012. A population assessment was conducted on 7-30-2012 to monitor the sport fish populations in Cedar Lake using 10 gill nets and 12 trap nets. Largemouth bass were electrofished on 5-16-2012 because other standard gears do not effectively sample them.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were collected on 7-30-2012. Cedar Lake was experiencing an algae bloom as the water appeared green and had a secchi depth of 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 9.9 ppm at the surface to 0.1 ppm at 20.0 feet. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 14.0 and 15.0 feet of depth as evidenced by a drop in temperature from 78.4 to 77.5 degrees Fahrenheit.    <br> \n <br> \nPrimary management species in Cedar Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. The 2012 largemouth bass catch rate (46.1/hour) declined slightly from the 2004 catch rate (56.0/hour), but still exceeded the management goal of 30.0/hour. Size structure of largemouth bass was good as they ranged in length from 2.8 to 18.4 inches and averaged 10.1 inches, but decreased from 2004 when largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.4 to 20.6 inches and averaged 13.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have been highly variable ranging from 3.0/trap net in 1986 to 110.0/trap net in 1991. The 2012 catch rate fell within this range at 57.7/trap net and was moderately high when compared to similar lakes. Age estimates indicated that there were 6 year classes sampled (2006-2011), with age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 fish making up 16%, 22%, 25%, and 32% of the sample, respectively. Bluegill size structure was small, ranging in length from 3.1 to 8.3 inches and averaging 5.9 inches. The average length of bluegill at the time they were sampled indicated good growth of bluegill in Cedar Lake, with lengths averaging 3.9 inches at age-1, 5.0 inches at age-2, 6.0 inches at age-3, 7.3 inches at age-4, 7.9 inches at age-5, and 8.4 inches at age-6.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 black crappie catch rates in trap nets (24.9/trap net) and gill nets (43.7/trap net) both were very high when compared to similar lakes. Both the gill net and the trap net black crappie catch rates were consistent with the last survey. Five year classes of black crappie were sampled including the 2007-2011 year classes. Black crappie size structure was good, and was similar between the two sampling gears. Trap netted black crappies ranged in length from 4.7 to 13.4 inches and averaged 7.9 inches. Growth of black crappies was good, with the average length of black crappies at the time they were sampled being 4.9 inches at age-1, 7.0 inches at age-2, 8.8 inches at age-3, 10.1 inches at age-4, and 11.8 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, walleye have occurred in low numbers in Cedar Lake, as catch rates have not surpassed 5.5/gill net (1996). In 2012, walleye were captured at a rate of 1.2/gill net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Five year classes of walleye were present including 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2011 year classes. Walleye were large, with 67% of the walleye being greater than 21.0 inches in length. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.0 to 26.4 inches and averaged 20.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically occurred in extremely low numbers in Cedar Lake (less than 2.5/gill net; 1981). In 2012, northern pike were very abundant and were captured at a rate of 11.2/gill net, which is very high when compared to similar lakes. Northern pike were small (mean=21.2 inches, min=15.8 inches, max=29.4 inches), but had good growth, averaging 21.6 inches at age-2. Three year classes of northern pike were sampled, including 2008, 2009, and 2010. The 2008 and 2010 year classes correspond with stocking events and the 2010 year class accounted for 70% of the northern pike sampled. The 2009 year class did not correspond to stocking events, therefore indicating some natural reproduction occurs in Cedar Lake. The northern pike catch rate exceeded 3.0/gill net; therefore the management goal was met. <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie were captured at a rate of 2.3/trap net, up from 0.5/trap net observed in the last survey in 2001. White crappie sizes ranged from 6.4 to 11.9 inches in length and averaged 9.4 inches. One white crappie was caught in the gill nets and measured 15.3 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant in Cedar Lake (40.3/gill net), but were small, ranging from 4.9 to 9.3 inches in length and averaging 6.2 inches. Brown bullhead were present and were captured at a rate of 2.7/gill net. The yellow bullhead catch rate (17.4/gill net) spiked from previous surveys, and was the highest catch rate observed on Cedar Lake. Black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, and hybrid sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

IN THE POPULATION ASSESSMENT THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS LOWER THAN THE LAST SURVEY (1.6/GILLNET IN 86 VERSUS 2.54/ GILLNET IN 81). THE NUMBER PER SET FALLS BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS (GILLNET). THE NORTHERNS THAT WERE SAMPLED WERE OF GOOD SIZE RANGING FROM 18.0'-18.9' SMALLEST TO 28.0 - 28.9 BEING THE LARGEST. THE YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED WERE 1983, 1982,1981; 1981 WAS THE STRONGEST. WALLEYES WERE REPRESENTED BY OLDER FISH, WITH THE 1983 CLASS BEING THE STRONGEST. THEY WERE CATCHABLE SIZE, RANGING FROM 14.0 TO 23.9. THE MODAL LENGTH WAS 14.0-14.9 TL. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE APPEARS TO BE UP (1.40/GILLNET IN 86 VERSUS 1.00/GILLNET IN 81.) SLOWER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH WAS NOTED IN AGE-GROWTH ANALYSIS. WHITE CRAPPIES WERE DOMINATED BY A 1983 YEAR CLASS. THEY ARE OF CATCHABLE SIZE WITH 7.5-7.9 BEING THE MODAL LENGTH. THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS UP (30.75/TRAPNET IN 86 VERSUS 4.25/TRAPNET IN 81.)  SLOWER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH IS NOTED AFTER AGE THREE. BLACK CRAPPIES WERE DOMINATED BY A 1983 YEAR CLASS. THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS UP SLIGHTLY (.87/TRAPNET IN 81 VERSUS 1.75/TRAPNET IN 86). THE MODAL LENGTH WAS 6.5 - 7.4 TL. BLUEGILLS RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS DOWN (9.37/TRAPNET IN 81 VERSUS 3.00/TRAPNET IS 86). THE BLUEGILL RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS LOW (3.00/TRAPNET IS 86 COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 15.91/TRAPNET). BLUEGILLS WERE SMALL, WITH A 3.5-3.9 MODAL LENGTH TL; THEY ARE DOMINATED BY A 1985 YEAR CLASS. IN 1984 CEDAR LAKE HAD A PARTIAL WINTERKILL. IT APPEARS TO HAVE AN OLDER PREDATOR POPULATION. THE FORAGE BASE APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PERCH WHICH WERE NOT REPRESENTED IN THIS ASSESS- MENT. THE NON-GAME POPULATION WAS REPRESENTED BY LOWER NUMBERS. CARP WERE 2.75/TRAPNET IN 86 VERSUS 9.75/TRAPNET IN 81. BIGMOUTH BUFFALO WERE .25/ TRAPNET IN 86 VERSUS 2.75/TRAPNET IN 81. BLACK BULLHEAD .50/TRAPNET IN 86 VERSUS 1.87/TRAPNET IN 81. CARP ARE THE ONLY SPECIE HIGHER IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE THAN THE STATE MEDIAN OF 1.68/TRAPNET AND LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.25/TRAPNET.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tCedar Lake in Rice County is an 804 acre lake north of Warsaw. A DNR-owned public access is located on the north shore off Rice County road 38. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2001, the first incidence of EWM in south central Minnesota. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water when leaving Cedar Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. <br> \n\tCedar Lake was surveyed the week of August 4th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Cedar Lake was part of a statewide study on the efficiency of stocking walleye fry, fryling, fingerlings into class 24 lakes. Only gill netting was conducted in this assessment. <br> \n\tBlack crappie gill net abundance increased from 3.2 in 2001 to 60.8 in 2008. White crappie gill net abundance increased from 0.8 in 2001 to 9.1 in 2008. Northern pike gill net abundance increased from 0.2 in 2001 to 1.7 in 2008. Walleye gill net abundance decreased from 2.8 in 2001 to 1.6 in 2008.  Bluegill gill net abundance decreased from 21.2 in 2001 to 5.2 in 2008. Yellow perch gill net abundance decreased from 5.8 in 2001 to 1.1 in 2008. Three largemouth bass were taken from ten gill net sets; gill nets do not reliably estimate bass abundance. <br> \n\tOther fish caught in the survey include golden shiner, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and common carp. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Cedar Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

The population contains mainly black crappie, but some really nice sized white crappies, averaging a half pound, also exist.  Growth for these fish is below the state average but the condition of individual fish is good.The bluegill population continues to be abundant and slow growing, with fish between 6-7 inches.  Removal efforts have been used to try and bolster the growth rate for individuals in this population, but none have been successful.Walleyes are abundant, averaging 5.5/gill net with a mean length and weight 18 inches and 2.5 pounds, respectively.  This population is comprised mainly of fish 14 inches and larger, which is ideal for anglers.Angling reports for largemouth bass are excellent, with fish exceeding 6 pounds.  Extensive shoreline structure provides abundant habitat but in-lake structure will also likely hold fish.  Northern pike are presently low in abundance, but what the population lacks in numbers is made up in size, with the average length and weight being 24.3 inches and 4.7 pounds, respectively.  Fish up to 15 pounds are possible.Other species sampled include white bass, bowfin, carp, smallmouth buffalo, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.</p>",
