                "narrative": "<p>Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff conducted a targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Third Crow Wing Lake on July 9-11th, 2019.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 10 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of July 15th, 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Third Crow Wing Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Third Crow Wing is located in southeastern Hubbard County, eight miles east of the town of Hubbard.  Third Crow Wing has a surface area of 643 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the northwest shore of the lake.  The Crow Wing River flows from Fourth into Third then into Second Crow Wing Lake.  Boating between the lakes is possible with smaller craft.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Third Crow Wing is in lake class 25.  These lakes are generally irregularly shaped and deep and have clear hard water.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, West Crooked, Upper and Lower Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big and Little Mantrap, Little Sand, and Spider. <br> \n <br> \nThird Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfish, as well as supporting good populations of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was similar to recent surveys, with trap net catch rates near the first quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find Bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie abundance was similar to recent surveys and anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 8-10 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant and numbers are similar to previous surveys.  The average size of sampled Walleye was 16.25 inches but fish up to 27.9 inches.  Northern Pike were abundance and similar to previous surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length of 22 inches, with pike measured up to 32 inches.  Third Crow Wing supports a decent largemouth bass fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Greater Redhorse, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Third Crow Wing.  However, faucet snails have been found in Second Crow Wing which is downstream of Third Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Although walleye conditions appear to be adequate, there were no one or two year classes caught, and only one three year class caught.  If a public access were obtained for this lake, maintenance stocking of walleye fingerlings in altermate years should be considered.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Net catches indicate tullibee, sucker, red horse, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, walleye, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie to be above the statewide average.  Brown bullhead, northern pike and largemouth bass are about average.  Rock bass was quite a bit below average.  Growth rate of walleye appeared to be good.  There are good year classes coming up in the panfish species.Management Recommendations:It is recommended that walleye fingerling stocking be continued each year.Comparing the survey with the one conducted in 1975, it would appear that stocking, rather than natural reproduction, is providing more for the walleye fishery.  Stocking should be at the rate of 0.50 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre.  Fingerlings should be at least 50 fish per pound.Some measure of carp control should be considered for the future.</p>",

Experimental netting indicates the lake is supporting good populations of walleye, northern pike and crappie.  All species examined showed normal to rapid growth.There is good spawning facilities for walleye, northern pike and centrarchids; age and size-class distributions indicate successful spawning of these species in recent years.Fish Stocking:Lake survey information indicates good populations of walleye, northern pike, and panfish; and adequate natural spawning facilites for these species.  It is unlikely that additional stocking will significantly improve fishing.Stocking records show that the lake was first stocked with fish in 1909.  Between that date and 1945 northern pike, walleye, bass, and crappie were stocked.  The stocking record for the past 10 years is as follows:Year\t\tSpecies\t\t# and size1946\t\twalleye\t\t240,000\t fry1946\t\twalleye\t\t  7,200 fingerlings1950\t\twalleye\t\t 17,640 fingerlings1954\t\twalleye\t\t  9,180 fingerlings1955\t\twalleye\t\t600,000 fry1955\t\tblack crappie\t  2,068 yearlingsFish Removal:Third Crow Wing Lake appears to be supporting a large population of marketable size bullheads.

                "narrative": "<p>Third Crow Wing Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, eight miles east of the town of Hubbard.  Third Crow Wing has a surface area of 647 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet. There is a state-owned access located on the northwest shore of the lake.  The Crow Wing River flows from Fourth Crow Wing to Third then into Second Crow Wing.  Boating between the lakes is possible with a small craft.  Third Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfishing, as well as supporting good populations of northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Third Crow Wing is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, West Crooked, Upper and Lower Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big and Little Mantrap. Little Sand, and Spider.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Third Crow Wing.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While bluegill abundance was good, size ran small, with few fish over 7.0 inches sampled compared to past surveys.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled during spring electrofishing (32 black crappie/hour) as well as during the summer survey.  Sampled black crappie from the electrofishing survey had an average length and weight of 9.0 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Both bluegill and black crappie exhibited good growth rates when compared to other class 25 lakes. The walleye gillnet catch rate of 6.7/gillnet is above the management goal of 4.0 walleye/net and the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The 1994 survey had a higher walleye catch rate (10.2/net), while earlier surveys were generally near the management goal.  Sampled walleye had a mean length and weight of 17.3 inches and 2.0 pounds.  A strong 1997 year class comprised 42% of the walleye sample.  Assessing walleye natural reproduction in Third Crow Wing is difficult because stocking has occurred in eleven of the past sixteen years.  Since 1995 Third Crow Wing has been stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Prior to 1995, walleye were stocked in three out of four years.  Changing the walleye stocking schedule to every other year will allow for better assessment of walleye natural reproduction.  Important forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were also sampled.  Yellow perch numbers were down from past surveys but still within the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  The yellow perch in Third Crow Wing are not of an acceptable size to provide much of a fishery.Northern pike abundance (11.7 northern pike/gillnet) was the highest for all surveys done on Third Crow Wing since 1956.  Northern pike abundance on Third Crow Wing has generally been lower, ranging from 2 to 6 northern pike/gillnet.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.6 inches and 2.4 pounds, similar to past surveys.  Northern pike up to 33.6 inches were sampled.  Northern pike displayed fast growth rates when compared to other class 25 lakes.Third Crow Wing also supports a decent largemouth bass fishery.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers during spring electrofishing (47 largemouth bass/hour).  Sampled bass had an average length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.9 pounds, with fish measured up to 19.8 inches.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low (9%). Other species sampled include white sucker in high numbers, and bowfin (dogfish), rock bass redhorse and brown bullhead were in moderate numbers.  Yellow and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Third Crow Wing is located in southeastern Hubbard County, eight miles east of the town of Hubbard.  Third Crow Wing has a surface area of 647 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the northwest shore of the lake.  Improvements to the access were made during the summer of 2008.  The Crow Wing River flows from Fourth into Third then into Second Crow Wing Lake.  Boating between the lakes is possible with smaller craft.  Third Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfishing, as well as supporting good populations of northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Third Crow Wing is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, West Crooked, Upper and Lower Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big and Little Mantrap, Little Sand, and Spider. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are highly sought after by anglers on Third Crow Wing.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was down from recent surveys, with trapnet catch rates below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance was up from recent surveys and anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 8-10 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up with the catch rate of 6.2 walleye/gillnet at the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.9 inches and 1.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 27.5 inches.  Present and past surveys have shown substantial contribution to the walleye population from stocking.  Third Crow Wing is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  The yellow perch in Third Crow Wing are generally not an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (6.0 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to recent surveys.  Northern pike abundance was very high in the late 1990's, while earlier surveys had pike numbers at low to moderate levels.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThird Crow Wing supports a decent largemouth bass fishery.  Present and past surveys have sampled largemouth bass in low to moderate numbers when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain, such as Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing.  Good water quality, submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Third Crow Wing.  Smallmouth bass are also found in Third Crow Wing in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nA carp population is present in Third Crow Wing and provides a limited angling and bowfishing opportunity for this area.  Carp abundance (1.0 carp/trapnet) was up from past surveys.  Carp have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, shorthead redhorse, and bowfin (dogfish).  Rock bass and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Third Crow Wing Lake is located six miles south of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Third Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Third Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 643 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  A public access is located on the northwest shore of the lake off of West Island Lake Road.  Boating access is also available through a narrow channel from Fourth Crow Wing Lake, or a shallow channel from Second Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Third Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally deep with clear, hard water and have an irregularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Dead, Eagle, Island, Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Ojibway, Spider and West Crooked. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled in moderate numbers, and a good size for anglers with an average length of 16 inches.  Walleyes ranged from 10 to 22 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers.  Most perch were small at 5 - 7 inches, with just a few over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find a very abundant population of Northern Pike in Third Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.3 pounds, with the largest measured at 34 inches in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nThird Crow Wing Lake supports healthy panfish populations and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  The Black Crappie catch rate was down, and low compared to other local lakes.  Crappie size averaged 8 inches, with fish up to 12.5 inches sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find most Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 3.5 - 8 inch size range, with some up to 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers and sizes of Largemouth Bass were sampled. They were an average length of 12.8 inches, with fish sampled up to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThird Crow Wing Lake was listed in 2011 as infested with faucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

Third Crow Wing has a surface area of 647 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is a state-owned access located on the northwest shore of the lake.  The Crow Wing River flows from Fourth into Third then into Second Crow Wing.  Boating between the lakes is possible with a small craft.  Third Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfishing, as well as supporting good populations of northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types bases on physical and chemical characteristics.  Third Crow Wing is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Belle Taine, West Crooked, Upper and Lower Ojibway, Eagle, Island, Big and Little Mantrap, Little Sand, and Spider.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Third Crow Wing.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  The number of larger bluegill sampled (greater than 8.0 inches) was lower than past surveys.  Black crappies numbers were down slightly when compared to past surveys, however, gillnet and trapnet catch rates were still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Both bluegill and black crappie exhibited good growth rates, similar to other class 25 lakes.Walleye were sampled at their lowest abundance (2.2 walleye/gillnet) for all surveys dating back to 1956.  The 2004 walleye catch rate of 2.2 walleye/gillnet is well below the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance was much higher in the 1990's, when walleye gillnet catch rates ranged from 10.2 walleye/net (1994) to 6.6 walleye/net (1999).  Fingerling stocking by the DNR comprises a large proportion of the walleye population.  Age analysis showed that the majority of the walleye sampled corresponded to stocked years with limited contribution from natural reproduction.  It is hoped that through aggressive walleye fingerling stocking and with a little help from Mother Nature, walleye abundance in Third Crow Wing will increase.  Third Crow Wing is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  The yellow perch in Third Crow Wing are generally not an acceptable size for angling.  Walleye exhibited good growth rates when compared to other class 25 lakes.Northern pike abundance (8.1 pike/gillnet) was at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance was also very high in the late 1990's, while earlier surveys had pike numbers at low to moderate levels.  Size of northern pike was good when compared to other area lakes.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 24.7 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates were fast when compared to other class 25 lakes.Third Crow Wing supports a decent largemouth bass fishery.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low to moderate numbers (19.5 bass/hour) when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain, such as Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing.  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Third Crow Wing. Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and moderate numbers of shorthead redhorse and bowfin.  Brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and carp were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

The average weight was 1.9 pounds with 61% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Natural reproduction is difficult to evaluate due to few non stocked years, however, year classes are absent from two of the three non stocked years since 1980.  Northern pike abundance of 1.9 per set is the lowest for all surveys, however, the mean weight was the highest for all surveys.  The average northern pike sampled in 1994 was 25.7 inches and 4.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass were not sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance, growth, or size structure.  Black crappies sampled were from multiple year classes with 60% greater than 8 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in low numbers with a medium size structure.  Those sampled were mostly (83%) in the 6.0 to 8.0 inch range.  Yellow perch abundance is high with 72.6 per gillnet set and should provide an excellent forage base, however their size structure is rather small for a fishable population.  The tullibee were well sampled during 1994 and have been during previous surveys.  They ranged in length from 7.5 to 17.4 inches and should provide a fishable population as well as an excellent forage base.</p>",
