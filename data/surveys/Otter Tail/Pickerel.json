                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 65-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail county, approximately two miles south of the City of Otter Tail, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of pasture interspersed with hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 73 feet and 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 1.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water clarity, was 16.0 feet.  The only previous survey of this lake was conducted in 1964, at which time the secchi disk reading was reduced to 2.0 feet due to excessive algae.  Heavy algae blooms are often an indicator of excess nutrients.  This change in clarity likely represents an improvement in water quality.  There was a turkey farm present on the lake in 1964.  In addition, the entire north shore was pastured.  Pickerel Lake is included in lake class 30 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.      Lakeshore development is limited as only five residences are present.  A county owned unimproved public water access is located on the east shore. The predominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most common types of emergent vegetation are hardstem bulrush and common cattail.  Stands of these plants are scattered around the entire lake, but they are most abundant at the east end.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northernpike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.     Pickerel Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Pickerel Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike gill net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 30 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 17.8 inches at four years of age.  The extremely low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish,is probably limiting northern pike growth.  Northern pike were stocked periodically from 1971 to 1982.           Test-net catch data suggest that largemouth bass are abundant.  Bass ranged in length from 4.2 to 14.3 inches.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass growth rates are slow with an average length of 6.9 inches at three years of age.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Two percent of the bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill reach an average length of 6.2 inches at six years of age.      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",
