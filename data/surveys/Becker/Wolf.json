                "narrative": "<p>Wolf Lake is a 1,445-acre, shallow, eastern Becker County lake that experiences low dissolved oxygen levels during most winters.  Most recently, severe winterkill occurred in 1996 and moderate winterkill occurred in 1997.  A slight winterkill occurred in 2001.  A pump and baffle aeration system (purchased by the DNR) is cooperatively operated each winter by a local family and sportsmen's club.  The aeration system provides a refuge area for fish when dissolved oxygen levels become critical.  However, when winterkill conditions are extreme, winterkill may still occur.The 2002 northern pike gill net catch rate of 17 per net was higher than that recorded in 1997 (7.7 per net) and was a new record high catch.  The northern pike sampled in 2002 ranged from one to five years old with the majority (97 percent) one to three years old.  Growth rates were above average.  No pike longer than 30 inches were found.  The mean length of sampled northern pike was 19.9 inches.The 2002 walleye gill net catch rate was 3.2 per net.  The catch rate was 5.8 per net in 1997.  The walleye sampled in 1997 were all three or four years old and had survived the 1996 winterkill.  Those sampled in 2002 ranged from one to six years old.  Walleye sampled in 2002 exhibited normal growth rates.  The mean length of walleye sampled was 15.3 inches.  Wolf Lake has little natural walleye reproduction and because it is a winterkill lake is periodically stocked with walleye fry.  The result is somewhat of a boom or bust type of walleye fishery depending on winterkill frequency and severity, and on the success of fry stockings.The gill net catch for yellow perch reached a historic high point in 2002 at 18.1 per set.  The 1997 gill net catch was 12.6 per set.  The mean length of perch sampled was 6.7 inches but perch up to 12 inches were collected.Black crappie and bluegill sunfish had not been sampled in the two surveys prior to 2002.  In 2002, 28.9 crappies and 5.4 bluegills per trap net were collected.  The black crappies were from two to four years old and exhibited above average growth.  They should provide some good angling in a few years.  The majority of the bluegills were only two years old but they exhibited fast growth rates.Trap net catches of black bullheads declined from 395 per set in 1997 to 154 per net in 2002.  Brown bullhead trap net catches increased from 0.9 per net in 1997 to 13.2 per net in 2002.Wolf Lake is a relatively fertile body of water that is often on the threshold of winterkill.  It is important that property owners follow shoreline best management practices to prevent any further decline in water quality.  These practices include retaining natural shoreline vegetation and aquatic plants, and not using fertilizers-or using phosphorus free fertilizers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish communities are dynamic in all lakes and streams, constantly changing due to weather patterns, habitat alterations, stocking, fishing pressure and many other influences.  In Wolf Lake, winterkill greatly increases the intensity of these fish population shifts.  Historically, the lake has been known for \"boom or bust\" fishing, depending upon the amount of time since the most recent fish kill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and black bullhead, two species able to tolerate low dissolved oxygen, have survived and thrived in Wolf Lake.  Pike catch rates were near their all-time high in 2009.  Walleye, on the other hand, were not found in the lake before stocking began during the 1980s.  Walleyes are more vulnerable to winterkill than are pike and bullhead.  The current walleye population is very low despite regular stocking.  Bluegill and yellow perch populations are on the upswing and 2009 catch rates reached their historic highs in Wolf Lake.  Black crappies remain a part of the fishery, but are not as abundant as in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nA state-owned pump and baffle aeration system, maintained and operated by the Aho family and the Wolf Lake Sportsmen's Club has helped to maintain a refuge area for walleye and other susceptible fish during critical periods.  Consequently, some walleyes are able to live long enough to reach \"keeper\" size.  In 2009, participants switched from the old pump and baffle to two new fountain type aeration units.  Two more units were added in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nStocking and aeration can both help to provide or increase a fishery but good habitat is essential to any fish community.  Fish habitat and water quality begins with good land stewardship.  Wolf Lake is currently only lightly-developed but as a marginal fish lake it is even more important to follow best management practices on watershed lands.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish communities are dynamic in all lakes and streams, constantly changing due to weather patterns, habitat alterations, stocking, fishing pressure and many other influences.  In Wolf Lake, winterkill greatly increases the intensity of these fish population shifts.  Historically, the lake has been known for \"boom or bust\" fishing, depending upon the amount of time since the most recent fish kill.Northern pike and black bullhead, two species able to tolerate low dissolved oxygen, have survived and thrived in Wolf Lake.  Walleye, on the other hand, were not found in the lake before stocking began during the 1980s.  Walleyes are more vulnerable to winterkill than are pike and bullhead.A pump and baffle aeration system, maintained and operated by the Aho family and the Wolf Lake Sportsmen's Club has helped to maintain a refuge area for walleye and other fish during critical periods.  Consequently, some walleyes are able to live long enough to reach \"keeper\" size.The average weight of net sampled walleye and northern pike in 1997 was nearly two pounds.  yellow perch were also large enough (half pound average) to be desirable to many anglers.Stocking and aeration can both help to provide or increase a fishery but good habitat is essential to any fish community.  Fish habitat and water quality begins with good land stewardship.  Wolf Lake is currently only lightly developed but as a marginal fish lake it is even more important to follow best management practices on watershed lands.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wolf Lake has suffered partial winterkill in each of the past three years.  A pump-baffle aeration system is operated annually by a local family and sportman's club.  That system provides an oxygenated refuge area varying from several acres to less than two acres depending upon the severity of the winter.  Seasonal oxygen depletion ultimately determines the diversity and strength of fish populations in Wolf Lake.  Obviously, those species with a tolerance for low dissolved oxygen levels (black bullheads) or the characteristic of seeking out oxygenated areas (northern pike) are favored.  Walleyes and centrarchids are more vulnerable to winterkill and populations tend to peak for a short time, then crash.Northern pike abundance has not been significantly affected by recent partial winterkills.  The mean gillnet catch (7.83/GN) is within the normal range for class 40 lakes.  The '88, '89, and '90 year-classes were the best-represented cohorts in the sample.  The oldest fish aged was six years.  Individual growth rates are good.  Current PSD is 30 percent, while RSD(30) is only 2 percent.  This population assessment is the first record of any northern pike larger than 30 inches being caught in test nets in Wolf Lake.  Additionally, the netting crew received a reliable local report of a 15 lb. pike being caught in summer of 1992.  Northern pike have been stocked twice by state fisheries managers; once as fry in 1948 and again as eggs in 1967.  Natural reproduction has been sufficient to maintain the population.  Several thousand pike were also removed for stocking elsewhere during winter rescue projects in the sixties and seventies.The black bullhead population has increased significantly and the mean trapnet catch (1,300/TN) is well above the normal range for similar lakes.  The sample (including gillnets) was composed almost entirely of 4-5 inch, 20-to-the-pound fish.  Yellow bullheads are rare (0.3/TN), but, this is the first evaluation in which any have been caught.  Brown bullheads are average in abundance (3.25/TN) and tend to be considerably larger than black bullheads.  Lengths of sampled browns ranged from 4-11 inches with a large number of 9-10 inch fish.  Bullheads were occasionally removed in conjunction with northern pike \"rescue\" as recently as 1975.Bluegills and black crappies, while never abundant, have completely disappeared from the net catch.  Winterkill and competition/predation from the large bullhead population are likely causes.  Sunfish were last stocked in 1957 as yearlings.  Records indicate removal of 50 lb. of sunfish during winter \"rescue\" operations in 1964.Walleyes were not found in Wolf Lake before the early eighties.  Abundance seems to have peaked in the mid-eighties and is presently significantly lower (0.83/GN) than in 1985 (9.50/GN).  Three age groups-2, 3, and 5 years-were represented in the catch.  Natural reproduction is probably not a factor due to poor spawning habitat in Wolf Lake.  Mean weight of captured walleyes was 1.5 lb.  Growth rates are above-average, typical for lakes that frequently winterkill.  Recent walleye fry stocking (begun in 1983) has provided boom or bust fishing depending upon winterkill frequency and severity.  Artifically-aerated water undoubtedly provided refuge for some walleyes in recent winters, but, could not provide complete coverage for this 1,400 acre lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish communities are dynamic in all lakes and streams, constantly changing due to weather patterns, habitat alterations, stocking, fishing pressure and many other influences.  In Wolf Lake, winterkill greatly increases the intensity of these fish population shifts.  Historically, the lake has been known for \"boom or bust\" fishing, depending upon the amount of time since the most recent fish kill.  The most recent winterkill occurred in the winter of 2013-2014. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Black Bullhead, two species able to tolerate low dissolved oxygen, have survived and thrived in Wolf Lake. Northern Pike catch rates were near their all-time high in 2016 .  Walleye, on the other hand, were not found in the lake before stocking began during the 1980s.  Walleyes are more vulnerable to winterkill than are Northern Pike and bullhead.  The current Walleye population is very low despite regular stocking.  Bluegill and Yellow Perch populations are on the upswing and 2016 catch rates reached their historic highs in Wolf Lake.  Black crappies remain a part of the fishery, but are not as abundant as in 2002.  Average size of sampled fish were 5.9 inches for Bluegill, 6.2 inches for Black Crappie, and 6.8 inches for Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nA state-owned pump and baffle aeration system, maintained and operated by the Aho family and the Wolf Lake Sportsmen's Club has attempted to maintain a refuge area for fish during critical winter periods.  In 2009, participants switched from the old pump and baffle to two new fountain type aeration units.  Two more units were added in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking and aeration can both help to provide or increase a fishery but good habitat is essential to any fish community.  Fish habitat and water quality begins with good land stewardship.  Wolf Lake is currently only lightly-developed but as a marginal fish lake it is even more important to follow best management practices on watershed lands.</p>",
