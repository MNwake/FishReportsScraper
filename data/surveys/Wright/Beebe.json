                "narrative": "<p>The population assessment on Beebe Lake (86-23) revealed some interesting information about the fish population.        The gill net catch rate of Northern Pike (4.3/net) declined from 1988 survey levels (12.5/net,); however, it remained within normal levels for lakes similar to Beebe Lake.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.9-34.7 inches and averaged 25.7 inches.  The average size Northern Pike was quite large (3.8 lbs) for a lake of this type, and increased from the 1988 survey (2.1 lbs).   Growth rates of Northern Pike were fast compared to other lakes in the state, reaching 33 inches in 6 years.       The catch rate of Walleye in gill nets also decreased from the 1988 survey (5.0/net) to the 1993 level of 2.0/net.  However, as with Northern Pike, this remained within expected levels for lakes like Beebe.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.0-28.3 inches and averaged 18.6 inches.  Most fish caught were 2 year old fish from the 1991 stocking.  The average size Walleye caught weighed 3.6 lbs which was similar to the 1988 survey (3.4 lbs).         Largemouth Bass were caught by spring electrofishing to assess the population status.  A total of 49 Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 29.4 fish per hour.  Bass ranged in length from 6.2-19.2 inches, and averaged 12.3 inches.  Fish were sampled fairly consistently from age 1 (1992) to age 8 (1985), with the most common ages  being age 4 (11 inches) and age 6  (14.7 inches).       Bluegill were sampled by trap nets during the summer survey and catch increased slightly from 53.7/net in 1988 to 77.0/net in 1993.  This is about 3 times the state average for lakes similar to Beebe.  Bluegill caught ranged in length from 2.9-8.9 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  The average Bluegill caught weighed 0.2 lbs, exactly the state average for this lake class.        The catch rate of Black Crappie was also measured from summer trap netting and catch rates decreased from 31.3/net in 1988 to 3.0/net in 1993.  Decreases like this are not uncommon for Black Crappie because spawning success and year class strength are highly variable.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 6.5 to 16.3 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  The largest crappie caught (16.3 inches long) weighed 2.5 lbs.          Other interesting fish caught during the survey included relatively high numbers of large Yellow Bullheads (0.9 lbs average weight).  In addition, Yellow Perch (30.7/gill net) were caught at twice the state average for lakes like Beebe.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beebe Lake is a 300-acre recreational development lake located within the City of St. Michael in eastern Wright County.   A day-use park with fishing pier and swimming beach was established by the county.  The lake is popular for all types of recreational use.  Beebe Lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year since 1981.  The lake association supplemented DNR stocking with additional fingerlings in 2005 and 2008.  This was the first survey since 1999.  Also included was an ice-out assessment and population estimates of northern pike and walleye and point-intercept surveys of aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \n The catch of northern pike in 2009 declined statistically from that of 1999, but was above the expected range of values for similar lakes.  The ice-out assessment provided some clue that the catch would be lower as only 28 northern pike were captured and marked.  During summer gill netting, three of these fish were recovered and the population was estimated to be 391 or 1.3 adults/acre.  This seems a little low based on other estimates.  For example, a 2007 estimate for Sugar Lake, was 10.6 adults per acre.  Fish ranged in length from 14 to 37 inches with an average of 25 inches.  Growth was above the statewide average through age five but slowed to within statewide average thereafter.  Female northern pike grew to a length of 25.3 inches by age four whereas males grew to 24.6 inches in the same length of time. The percent of northern pike greater than 24 inches was 58%.  The larger size of pike sampled by gill nets lends credibility to the lower population estimate.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of walleye was similar to that of 1999.  Ninety-six walleye were marked at ice-out and four were recaptured during summer. The population was estimated to be 369 or 1.2 adults/acre. This estimate was somewhat low but similar to Sugar Lake, 1.4 adults/acre.  Walleye ranged in length from 8 to 26 inches with an average of 21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing during the day on May 21, 2009.  A total of 62 largemouth bass were captured in 0.75 hours for a catch rate of 81.3 fish/hour.  This seemed quite good for a daytime effort.  Largemouth bass ranged in length up to 20 inches with an average length of 10 inches.  Largemouth bass grew at a rate similar to the state wide average and grew to a length of 12 inches in five years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of yellow perch increased significantly from 1999.  This was another indication that the northern pike abundance may have declined.  The average length of perch in gill nets was 7.2 inches, which was reached by age five. Growth rates were near statewide averages.  Higher yellow perch numbers should improve the survival and growth of stocked walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were similar to that of 1988 and 1982 and within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Overall, bluegill ranged in length from 2 to 7 inches with an average length of 6 inches.  Bluegill grew at a rate near the statewide average and reached a length of six inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie was below average for similar lakes.   Black crappie have been relatively low in trap net catches over the past three assessments (1999 and 1993).  Just 42 black crappie were taken at ice-out (1.1/trap net). The average length was 8.4 inches during summer trap netting.  Black crappie growth was within the statewide average and fish grew to a length of eight inches by age four.  Beebe Lake seems to have become less of a crappie lake since the 1980's. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow bullhead catch was above the normal range. No sensitive minnow species were recovered during shoreline seining.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo point-intercept vegetation surveys were completed by DNR, Ecological Resources staff.  The first, May 22, 2009, found curly leaf pondweed at 84% of sites (sites deeper than 20 feet were not sampled).  Eurasian water milfoil (EWM) was observed at 3% of sites.  The second survey, July 13, 2009, showed that curly leaf pondweed was growing at 56% of the points, EWM, 33%.  Six other species of native submersed vegetation were noted.  None of these were common.  The lake association and City of St. Michael spend thousands of dollars each year for treatment of invasive species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beebe Lake is a 300-acre recreational development lake located south east of St. Michael in eastern Wright County. Beebe Lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet and the 10 year average water clarity was 6.6 feet. There is a public access located on the north side of the lake and a county park with a fishing pier and swimming beach located on the south side. The lake is popular for all types of recreational use. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Beebe Lake on May 23, 2016. This assessment was conducted to evaluate the size structure of the spawning Bluegills. A total of 670 Bluegills were sampled during this assessment and averaged 6.2 inches long with the largest measuring 8.1 inches. Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\". The PSD of Bluegill from Beebe Lake was 66. So, 66% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\". Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Beebe Lake was 0. These results are lower when compared to other lakes in the Sauk Rapids management area.  <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Black Crappie were also sampled during the assessment. Fifty Hybrid Sunfish were sampled and averaged 6.2 inches long with a maximum length of 7.7 inches. A total of Eighty-three Pumpkinseed were sampled and averaged 5.7 inches long with a maximum length of 7.5 inches. A total of 103 Black Crappie were captured and ranged in length from 4.5 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 8.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 to 8 years. Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill. Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers. The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they restrict reproduction of smaller males, allowing the smaller males to put more energy into growth and less into reproduction. Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on Beebe Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beebe Lake is located in Wright County, five miles east of Buffalo.  The lake is 300 acres in size, with a mean depth of 14 feet and maximum depth of 27 feet.  The lake has several small shallow bays and islands. Many aquatic plants can be found in Beebe Lake, although a few species tend to dominate the plant community.  Curled pondweed, an exotic plant, becomes very abundant in the spring and dies back in early summer.  Eurasian watermilfoil, another exotic species, has also become established in Beebe Lake.  Boaters can help prevent the spread of these species to other lakes by cleaning all plant material from boats, trailers, and live wells before leaving the lake.  Beebe is a popular lake for both angling and other recreational uses.  A county park with a swimming beach is located on the south side of the lake, and a state-owned boat access is located on the north side.Walleye are stocked into Beebe Lake in alternate years to sustain a population for anglers.  Fingerlings are stocked rather than fry, since a high population of Northern Pike is present.  The Walleye population is within the range expected for lakes like Beebe, and the catch rate was more than twice as high in 1999 as it was in 1993.  Walleye caught in the summer of 1999 had an average weight of 2.5 pounds, and ranged in length from 12 to 27 inches.  Walleye captured during early spring sampling were larger, with an average length of 23 inches and some fish as large as 29 inches.  Walleye growth in Beebe Lake is fast compared to statewide averages.  The Northern Pike population in Beebe Lake is high and the catch rate tripled from the 1993 survey.  Northern Pike were stocked regularly from the state-owned spawning area into Beebe Lake prior to 1993, but this is currently not necessary, given the large population.  Pike had an average weight of 2.2 pounds, with most between 16 and 22 inches.  Larger individuals are present, though.  A few Pike sampled during the 1999 survey measured 36 inches.  Growth rates for Northern Pike are average in Beebe Lake.  Yellow Perch numbers are down from 1993, but average size (0.2 pounds) is relatively high.  The Yellow Perch population will probably remain low with a large population of Northern Pike.  Largemouth Bass are abundant in Beebe Lake, and their numbers appear to have increased since 1993.  Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing in 1999 had an average length of 9.4 inches or 0.5 pounds.  Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass (8 inches or greater), 33 percent were larger than 12 inches.  During the netting in early spring, larger Largemouth Bass were caught, with an average length of 16 inches and some fish as large as 21 inches.  Growth rates appear to be slowing for small Largemouth Bass, perhaps due to increased competition.  The catch rate for Bluegill was normal, but the average size was small (0.1 pounds, or 5.1 inches).  Based on shoreline seining, it appeared that Bluegill were very successful spawning in 1999.  Black Crappie catches have declined in each survey since 1982, and are now below the normal range for lakes like Beebe.  The few Black Crappie caught during the 1999 summer survey had an average length of 8 inches, although one crappie over 16.5 inches was seen during the spring netting.  Growth rates for Black Crappie are above average.  Black Bullhead numbers are low in Beebe Lake, whereas the population of Yellow Bullhead is high.  Bullheads of both species averaged more than one pound.  Common Carp and White Sucker are also present in Beebe Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Important gamefish taken in gill nets were: Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. Northern Pike and Walleye have increased significantly while Yellow Perch have declined significantly since 1982. Northern Pike ranged in length from 17-35 inches with an average of 20 inches. The sample was comprised primarily of age 3 fish and growth was good. Ninety percent of the walleye taken in gill nets were females and ranged in size from 18-24 inches, with an average of 20 inches. The Walleye taken in gill nets correspond directly to fingerling stocking in 1983 and 1985. Growth was good, bordering on fast through age 4. \n\nLargemouth Bass were caught by fall electrofishing and the catch rate was 24.1 per hour. Eighty-three percent of Largemouth Bass were age 1 and 2. Five year classes showed Bluegill, Black Crappie and Yellow Bullhead to be abundant. The Bluegill catch was similar to 1982 and twice the local average. All fish were less than age 5 and growth was good. The Black Crappie catch was one-fourth of what was taken in 1982 but still six times the local average. Black Crappie ranged from 5-11 inches, were primarily ages 2-4, and growth was good. Yellow Bullhead up to 14 inches were taken by trap and gill nets making them a size of interest to commercial hoopnetters. Common Carp are known to be present but not thought to be abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beebe Lake is a 300-acre recreational development lake located south east of St. Michael in eastern Wright County. Beebe Lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet and the 10 year average water clarity was 6.6 feet. There is a public access located on the north side of the lake and a county park with a fishing pier and swimming beach located on the south side. The lake is popular for all types of recreational use. Beebe Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year since 1981 with the lake association supplementing the DNR stocking with additional fingerlings in 2005 and 2008. A standard lake was conducted in 2016 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2009. In addition to the standard survey, a Bluegill assessment was conducted in May and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey conducted in July. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was similar from that of 2009 and was above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Pike ranged in length from 20 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 27 inches and 4.7 pounds. Eighty percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and 30% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest Northern Pike under 22 inches and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the success of Walleye stocking and allow Yellow Perch numbers to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Walleye was twice that observed  in 2009 and above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 7 to 26 inches and averaged 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 20, 2016. A total of 91 Largemouth Bass were captured in 1.28 hours of effort for a catch rate of 71.3/hour. This one and a half times greater than our area daytime average of 43.3/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4 to 19 inches with an average length of 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch increased slightly from 2009 and is above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Perch range from 5 to 8 inches with an average length of 6 inches. Higher Yellow Perch numbers should improve the survival and growth of stocked Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were slightly lower than previous surveys, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Overall, Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches.  <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie was similar to previous surveys and are within the lower range of expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 11 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Bullhead catch was above the expected range for similar lakes, and ranged in length from 8.7 to 16 inches with an average of 13.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the surveys include: Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",
