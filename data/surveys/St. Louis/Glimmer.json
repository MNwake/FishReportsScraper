There is one designated USFS campsite located on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGlimmer Lake has a surface area of 15.5 acres and a maximum depth of 7 feet. Glimmer Lake sits over 30 feet above nearby Clark Lake and is surrounded mostly by large pines. Sparse amounts of aquatic  plants can be found throughout the lake. The lake bottom is primarily silt and detritus which in some areas is covering covering the more coarse substrates.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch was the only fish species sampled or observed in this initial investigation. Yellow perch numbers in 2013 (66.0/gill net) were much higher than average when compared to similar lakes in the area. The average perch sampled was 6.6 inches long and the largest perch sampled was 8.3 inches.</p>",
