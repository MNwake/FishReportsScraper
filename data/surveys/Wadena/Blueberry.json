                "narrative": "<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles north of the town of Menahga.  Blueberry is a shallow lake with a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The Blueberry and Shell Rivers enter the lake on the southwest shore.  The outlet of Blueberry Lake is the Shell River.  The water quality in Blueberry Lake can be poor at times, and heavy algae blooms are common during summer months.  A high carp population in the lake also stirs up bottom sediments.  A DNR access is located on the outlet of the lake (Shell River), on the northeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blueberry Lake is in class 41.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids area, however, Portage Lake (2.5 miles northwest of Park Rapids) is in lake class 39 and has similar physical and chemical features to Blueberry Lake and can be used for a comparison.The walleye gillnet catch rate of 4.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 41 and similar to the previous survey in 1992 (3.6/net).  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 1.5/net (1987) to 6.5/net (1963, 82).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.9 to 29.5 inches, with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Natural reproduction of walleye is contributing to the population as 59% of the sample (32 fish) corresponded to years of no walleye stocking.  Blueberry Lake receives walleye fingerling stockings on even calendar years.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other area lakes.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (11.5/gillnet), above the range typical for this lake class and higher than past surveys.  With the exception of 1992 (2.2/net), historical northern pike gillnet catch rates have been constant, ranging from 6.0/net (1987) to 9.2/net (1963).  Large northern pike were present in Blueberry Lake with 17% of the sample (15 fish) greater than 30 inches in length.  Northern pike up to 42.3 inches were measured.  When compared to other area lakes, northern pike exhibited fast growth rates after age 2.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 11.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 41.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have ranged from 5.6/net (1992) to 35.5/net (1963, 82).  The yellow perch in Blueberry Lake not only provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, but are an acceptable size for angling.  Yellow perch were an average length of 8.4 inches with fish sampled up to 11.5 inches.Black crappie were sampled in low numbers (0.3/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 41.  Black crappie trapnet catches have decreased in Blueberry Lake nearly every year since the initial survey was conducted in 1963.  Historical black crappie trapnet catch rates have decreased from 17.1/net in 1963 to 0.3/net in 1997.  Sampled black crappie were large in size ranging from 12.1 to 14.3 inches.Bluegill were also sampled in low numbers (0.3/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 41.  With the exception of 1963 (5.8/net), historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have also been low, ranging from 0.5/net (1992) to 3.8/net (1982).Only two carp were sampled in the 1997 survey, similar to past surveys.  Blueberry Lake has a high carp population and many carp were observed by the survey crew during field work, especially in the inlet areas (Shell and Blueberry Rivers).  Carp can be difficult to catch with standard survey gear.Brown, black, and yellow bullhead are all present in Blueberry Lake.  Brown bullhead were the most abundant of the three species, followed by black then yellow bullhead.  Brown bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers (3.2/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers (0.8/gillnet & trapnet), lower than past surveys.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.Rock bass and pumpkinseed were sampled in low numbers similar to past surveys.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Blueberry Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles northeast of Menahga.  Blueberry is a shallow lake with a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15.0 feet.  The Blueberry and Shell Rivers enter the lake on the southwest shore.  The outlet of Blueberry Lake is the Shell River.  The water quality in Blueberry can be poor at times, and heavy algae blooms are common during summer months.  A high carp population in the lake also stirs up bottom sediments.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore at the outlet channel (Shell River).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blueberry Lake is in lake class 41.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids management area, however, Portage Lake (3 miles north of Park Rapids) is in lake class 39 and has somewhat similar physical and chemical features to Blueberry and can be used for a comparison.Anglers can expect to find good populations of walleye and northern pike in Blueberry.  Walleye abundance was up in 2002 with the gillnet catch rate of 10.3 walleye/net the highest recorded on Blueberry.  The current management goal for walleye in Blueberry is 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Good numbers of walleye in the 16-18 inch size range are present, with larger fish up to 28.5 inches sampled.  The abundant walleye population in Blueberry is the result of an aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR.  Starting in 2000, Blueberry was identified as a lake that would benefit from increased walleye stockings and  could support more walleyes.  Blueberry has a good forage base of yellow perch that is needed to support high walleye numbers.  The walleye stocking rate was doubled in 2000 and the lake is stocked during even numbered years.  Natural reproduction is contributing to the walleye population in Blueberry, however, age analysis showed the high numbers of walleye currently present in Blueberry correspond to stocked years.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (11.1 pike/gillnet), similar to the previous survey in 1997.  Anglers will find northern pike in the 20-24 inch, 2-4 pound size range are common with opportunities of pike up to 40 inches.  Blueberry was identified as a lake with the potential to produce and sustain a large-sized pike population.  Starting in the spring of 2003, all northern pike between 24 and 36 inches (24-36 inch protected slot) must be released.  Blueberry Lake has good populations of important northern pike forage species such as white sucker and shorthead redhorse.  An abundant food supply and resulting good northern pike growth rates are needed for the production of large-sized pike.  While not known as a panfish lake, Blueberry does provide fishing  opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  Low numbers of panfish are found in Blueberry and the lake is known more for quality than quantity of panfish.  Black crappie in the 12-13 inch range and bluegill in the 8-9 inch range were sampled.  Growth rates of black crappie and bluegill were fast when compared to other area lakes.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow and brown bullhead, while black bullhead and bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in moderate numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (3.60 fish/set and 11.32 lbs/set) increased from a low year in 1987 to settle within the normal ranges for lake class 40.  Mean weight of individual walleye in 1992 was 3.14 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=78, RSD-P=50, RSD-M=11, RSD-T=6) is also indicative of a large-sized walleye population.  Because walleye fingerlings are stocked in the lake, variability is great in length-at-age, both within and among year classes.  Growth is generally slow after age 1, with walleye reaching a mean length of 13.90 inches at age 4.  Some natural reproduction is occurring in Blueberry Lake, as indicated by the 1982 and 1989 year classes which accounted for 24% of the sampled fish.Northern pike catch rates have been decreasing since 1963; however, the 1992 gillnet catch rates (2.20 fish/set and 10.70 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for lakes of this class.  Mean weight of individual northern pike was 4.86 pounds.  Similar to the walleye population, northern pike size structure is large (PSD=73, RSD-P=36, RSD-M=27).  Northern pike exhibit good early growth, averaging 18.49 inches at age 3.  However, growth rates decline as the fish age, and by age 9 mean length are well below the state average.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests low recruitment.Rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch catch rates were all below the first quartile for this class of lakes.  These species have been within the normal ranges or above during past surveys, but have steadily declined.  A large decrease occurred in the yellow perch population, which fell from 33.50 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 5.60 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Yellow perch are also small (PSD=4).  The one largemouth bass sampled was enough to put the catch rates (0.10 fish/trapnet and 0.41 lbs/trapnet) in the normal range.  No age and growth analysis is available for the panfish.Catch rates of bowfin, black bullhead, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were within the normal ranges, catches of common carp were below the first quartile and catches of white sucker and shorthead redhorse were above the third quartile for lake class 40.  Rough fish were removed from Blueberry Lake until 1981.  Removal appears to have effectively reduced bullhead densities.  Large white suckers currently dominate the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles northeast of Menahga. Blueberry is a shallow lake that is 532 acres with a maximum depth of 15 feet. A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore at the outlet of the Shell River off Blueberry Bridge Road.  There is also a winter access on Blueberry Lake on the East shore off of East Blueberry Drive.  Blueberry provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Walleye and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Blueberry Lake is in lake class 41.  Class 41 lakes are very large, shallow, irregularly shaped lakes, with very hard and turbid water.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids management area.  Class 39 lakes are the most similar lake class and include First and Fourth Crow Wing Lakes, Paine, Peysenski, and Portage.  <br> \nBlueberry Lake has a special regulation for Northern Pike.  All pike 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released, with a possession limit of three, and only one over 36 inches.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike with an average size of 23 inches and 3 lbs.  Northern Pike were sampled in good numbers up to 32 inches, with a few larger fish up to 41.5 inches. <br> \nWalleye abundance was good, with a very large average size of 19 inches and 2.5 pounds.   Most fish sampled were a preferred size for anglers, ranging from 14-21 inches.  <br> \nBlueberry has been a popular lake for panfish, especially for ice fishing.  Angling opportunities include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Black Crappies were sampled in all sizes, up to 12.5 inches in length.  Most Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were from 4-7 inches, with some fish exceeding 9 inches.  <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Blueberry Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

The maximum depth is 15 feet with a median depth of 5 feet.This lake has 2 inlets, the Shell and Blueberry Rivers.  The Shell River flows out of the lake on the northeast shore to Upper Twin Lake and then to the Crow Wing River.There are no dams on the outlet since the lake has a past history of very limited water fluctuations.  The lakes immediate watershed consists of 40% agricultural land, 30% forest, 20% marsh, and 10% developed area.  At the time of this survey Blueberry Lake had a total of 20 homes and cottages with 7 rental and 28 private boats.  The bulk of the test netting catch consisted of suckers, bullheads, perch, and crappies.  Good numbers of northern pike, walleyes, and sunfish were also found in the lake.The species of fish most commonly caught in recent years have been northern pike and bluegills.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles northeast of Menahga.  Blueberry is a shallow lake with a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15.0 feet.  The Blueberry and Shell Rivers enter the lake on the southwest shore.  The outlet of Blueberry Lake is the Shell River.  The water quality in Blueberry can be poor at times, and heavy algae blooms are common during summer months.  A high carp population in the lake also stirs up bottom sediments.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore at the outlet channel (Shell River).  Blueberry Lake provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, panfish, and carp. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Blueberry Lake is in lake class 41.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids management area.  Portage Lake (3 miles north of Park Rapids) is in lake class 39 and has similar physical and chemical features to Blueberry and can be used for comparison. <br> \n <br> \nBlueberry supports good populations of northern pike and walleye.  Northern pike abundance (12.3 pike/gillnet) was the highest recorded for all surveys on Blueberry.  Northern pike abundance was also high in the two previous surveys in 1997 and 2002.  Sampled NOP had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.6 inches.  A special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2003 that requires the release of all northern pike from 24.0 to 36.0 inches (protected slot length limit).  Future surveys are planned on Blueberry to evaluate the effectiveness of this regulation.  Walleye abundance (1.8 walleye/gillnet) was down from recent surveys and below the current management goal of 5 walleye/gillnet.  Blueberry Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry in the spring.  Special fall electrofishing sampling has shown good survival of stocked fry.  Blueberry Lake is shallow and fertile and provides a good forage base of yellow perch and other minnow species for the walleye and northern pike populations.  A few yellow perch are an acceptable size for angling, with perch measured up to 11.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Blueberry does provide fishing opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  Low numbers of panfish are found in Blueberry and the lake is known more for quality than quantity of panfish.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range and bluegill in the 7-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nBlueberry Lake is one of the very few lakes in this area that has a carp population in high enough numbers to provide bowfishing and angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and shorthead redhorse and moderate numbers of brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  Black bullhead and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Blueberry Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 13, 2020. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with five sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four sites, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at six sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native and one non-native (Common Carp) species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Logperch) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Yellow Perch (40%), Bluegill (28%), and Pumpkinseed (11%) were the most dominant species by numbers in the trap nets, but they only comprise 4%, 10%, and 1% of the biomass, respectively. Of the 45 Bluegills sampled, 18% were between 5 and 7 inches, 60% were over 7 inches and 7% of the Bluegills sampled were over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe targeted survey of the nearshore fish community data were combined with the concurrently sampled summer trap net survey and gill net data from a June 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Blueberry Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles northeast of Menahga.  Blueberry is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore on the outlet of the Shell River off Blueberry Bridge Road.  There is also a winter access on the east shore off of east Blueberry Drive.  Blueberry provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Walleye, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Blueberry Lake is in lake class 41.  Class 41 lakes are very large and shallow with hard and turbid water.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids management area.  Class 39 lakes are the most similar lake class and include First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, and Portage. <br> \n <br> \nBlueberry has a special regulation for Northern Pike.  All pike 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released, with a possession limit of three, and only one over 36 inches.  Anglers will find an abundant population of Northern Pike, with an average length and weight of 23.3 inches and 2.9 lbs with fish measured up to 33.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were down slightly from previous surveys.  Multiple year classes of Walleye were sampled and ranged in length from 10.0 to 27.3 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class.  Sampled Yellow Perch were small in size with an average length of 6.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlueberry has been a popular lake for panfish, especially during the ice fishing season.  Angling opportunities include Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  Good numbers of Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range were sampled and moderate numbers of Black Crappie with fish measured up to 13.8 inches.  Growth of panfish was very fast when compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBlueberry Lake is one of the very few in the area that supports a Common Carp population and provides bowfishing and angling opportunities.  A low to moderate Common Carp population is present in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) has been identified in Blueberry Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

I have been informed that the lake will under go commercial rough fish removal in the fall of 1975.Management Recommendations:This lake should continue to have rough fish removal by contract fishing.  Northern Pike need not be stocked, as the spawning facilities are very adequate.  Walleye fingerlings should be stocked to help maintain the fishereis.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on August 3, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at twelve sites. Backpack electrofishing was done at twelve sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish such as Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on June 5, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Blueberry Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Blueberry Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",
