                "narrative": "<p>Sand Hill is a 510-acre, class 39 lake located in southeastern Polk County approximately four miles south of Fosston.  A dam on the outlet maintains the water level a few feet higher than would otherwise be the case.  Available information indicates this dam was originally constructed in the late 1940's by the Division of Water Resources.  Wildlife managers viewed the proposed dyke and dam as a good thing in 1947 because it would preserve the lake's water level during droughts.  In fact, the lake's level was more than three feet below the crest of the dam at that time and it was viewed as an excellent waterfowl lake, especially for diving ducks.  The Division of Game and Fish repaired or rebuilt the dike and dam in the 1950's and again in the mid 1980's when it was in poor condition and in danger of washing out.  There are plans to replace the dam with a rock arch rapids in 2018.  Sand Hill Lake is late mesotrophic with a trophic state index in the upper forties and is considered a marginal fish lake. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 1980's when the dam was rebuilt, the area fisheries manager recognized the limitations of Sand Hill Lake as a fishing lake.  Fish and Wildlife managers explored the option of lowering the dam and managing the lake for waterfowl rather than rebuilding the dam at its existing level.  There was strong opposition by some property owners and this option was not chosen.  The Sand Hill Lake Bible Camp on the east shore uses the lake seasonally for swimming and other water-based recreation.  No DNR fish stocking has occurred since 1982. <br> \n <br> \nSand Hill Lake's fishery has never been more than a temporary and subject to frequent winterkills.  With few exceptions, most historical stocking has apparently not resulted in creating fishing opportunities because stocked fish rarely survived long enough to recruit to the fishery.  Consequently, bullheads and Northern Pike have been the most consistent survivors. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough they were found in both of the two previous fisheries surveys and were reported as present in the game lake surveys before that, no Northern Pike were found in 2005.  However, relative abundance of Northern Pike was extremely high just twelve years later in 2017 at 37.5 fish per gill net.  The previous highest catch rate was 2.0 fish per net.  The population of Northern Pike in 2017 ranged 13.8 to 32.7 inches in length.  The average length of sampled Northern Pike was 21.9 inches.  As would be expected in this bust-to-boom scenario, the Northern Pike population was young with age 3 fish far and away dominating the catch.  Only one fish each age 5 and 6 were captured. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and White Sucker were first captured in Sand Hill Lake in 2005.  In 2017, catch rates for these species were 23.5 and 10.5 fish per net, respectively.   Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.1 to 12.6 inches, averaging 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Black and Brown Bullheads and Black Crappie.  Only five Black Crappie we caught, thus making any judgments upon the status of the population difficult.  The fish that were captured were adult fish, averaging 8.7 inches in length, and may have been the result of an unpermitted stocking.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the Standard Survey that was completed in 2017 to evaluate the biological condition of Sand Hill Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.   <br> \nTen sites within Sand Hill Lake were sampled during this survey, using a backpack electrofishing unit and seines.  The fish community sampled during this assessment was not diverse, dominated by Fathead Minnows, Golden Shiners, and Yellow Perch.  Many large schools of Black Bullheads were observed, yet few were sampled.  Other species sampled included White Sucker, Iowa Darter, and Fathead Minnow.  No Bluegills or other sunfish species were observed.  No species intolerant of poor habitat conditions were found.  The results of this survey suggest that the fish population in Sand Hill Lake does not meet expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, suggesting that this lake is likely biologically impaired.  </p>",
