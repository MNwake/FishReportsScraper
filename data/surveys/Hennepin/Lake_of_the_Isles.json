                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Isles is a 109 acre lake in Minneapolis.  It is between Cedar Lake and Lake Calhoun and connected to both by navigable channels.  There are several carry-in canoe or kayak locations at multiple points along the shore, although larger boats will need to access through Lake Calhoun (has a boat ramp & limited on-street parking) or Cedar Lake.  Motor use is restricted to electric only.  In 2014, a population assessment was conducted to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye are not stocked into Lake of the Isles, several were sampled in the 2014 assessment.  More than likely, they immigrated via channels from either or both Cedar and Calhoun (both regularly stocked).  The relative abundance of Walleye (2.5 per gill net) is higher than average for this type of lake.  The fish are also of good size; they averaged 19.3 inches and 2.49 pounds.  Walleye grow fast in Lake of the Isles, reaching 16.2 inches by age 3.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant and of good size.  The fish averaged 24.9 inches and 3.67 pounds, with the largest fish measuring 30.4 inches in length.  Eighty-six percent of the sampled Northern Pike exceeded 21 inches, and 19% exceeded 28 inches.  These fish grew fast, reaching 24.3 inches by age 3 and 27.2 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Isles has a history of small-sized panfish, and 2014 was no different.  Bluegill are present in above average numbers (32 per gill net), with the majority below angler-preferred sizes.  Only 1% of the sampled Bluegill exceeded 7 inches.  Six percent of Black Crappie in trap nets exceeded 9 inches; trap-net abundance was near the Lake-Class median.  The average size of trap netted Crappie was 7.3 inches and 0.19 pounds.  Yellow Perch were sparse (gill net sample below the Lake Class' first quartile) and small; most were in the 6-inch size class, with none larger.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in low abundance included Tiger Muskellunge (last stocked in 2007; Calhoun and Cedar were last stocked in 2009 and 2007, respectively), Largemouth Bass, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Bowfin.   <br> \n</p>",

Storm water runoff impairs water quality.  Numerous water quality improvement projects have been implemented, minimizing impacts.  Motor restrictions on the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes prevent Lake of the Isles from experiencing heavy surface use.  Use of gas motors is not allowed, but boats can operate trolling motors without a permit.  Shore fishing is very popular on Lake of the Isles. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance is within the average range for this type of lake.  All sampled fish were larger than 18 inches, average length was 21.4 inches.  Walleye are not stocked into Lake of the Isles.  Fish likely migrate to Lake of the Isles from Cedar Lake or Lake Calhoun.  Both are stocked with walleyes.   Northern pike were sampled in low numbers.  Mean length for northern pike was 23.9 inches.  Hybrid muskellunge, also called tiger muskie, are stocked into Lake of the Isles every three years.  Three tiger muskie were sampled in this survey.  All were larger than 36 inches.  Black crappie averaged 7.6 inches in length.  Abundance is just above average for a class 38 lake.  Some large individuals were sampled.  Bluegill numbers are above average.  Only 11% of sampled bluegill measured greater than 6 inches.  No individuals were larger than 6.67 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Common carp abundance remains low and no bullhead were sampled in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the Metro area, stunting in size is likely due to overpopulation and size selective harvest by anglers.  Overpopulation reduces the amount of food available to all fish, thus reducing growth rates.  Harvest of larger (keeper size) fish by anglers reduces the number of quality fish in a lake.  Harvesting large fish also removes the spawning stock and reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish remain in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large which promotes big fish genetics.      </p>",

Lake of the Isles is located between and connected to Cedar Lake and Lake Calhoun via shallow canals.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, tiger muskellunge, walleye, and yellow perch.  Lake of the Isles has been stocked every third year with tiger muskellunge since 1994.  Tiger musky, northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass were sampled in varying numbers.  One age-3 tiger musky measuring 30.5 inches and one age-5 tiger musky measuring 31.6 inches were sampled in gill nets.  The age-3 musky probably came from the 2002 Calhoun fingerling stocking while the age-5 musky likely originated from the 2000 Lake of the Isles fingerling stocking.  Although low numbers of pike were sampled, size was good.  Four northern pike averaging 27.3 inches and 4.8 pounds were caught in gill nets.  All pike were over 26.0 inches.  Twelve sampled walleyes averaged 16.1 inches and likely originated from past Lake Calhoun stockings.  Although trap and gills nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, three largemouth bass averaging 11.8 inches and 1.2 pounds were sampled by gill nets.  The largest bass was nearly 15.0 inches in length.  Lake of the Isles has a panfish community consisting of bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Bluegills were moderately abundant and no fish exceeded 6.5 inches.   Black crappies were also moderately abundant.  Of the 69 crappies sampled, only 9% of the sampled crappies were over 8 inches.  One crappie measured approximately 11.5 inches.  Averaging 7.0 inches, seven sampled perch did not exceed 8.5 inches.  Although 18 pumkinseeds and 6 hybrid sunfish were additionally sampled, none exceeded 6.5 inches.  Bowfin (dogfish), bullheads, and common carp were sampled in varying numbers.   One 13.0 inch black bullhead was caught in a gill net while one 10.8 inch yellow bullhead was captured in a trap net.  Three bowfin (mean length = 23.6 inches) and five carp averaging 24.9 inches and 7.4 pounds were also sampled.  </p>",

BLUEGILL SIZE IS STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE WITH MOST FISH BEING 5-6 INCHES IN LENGTH.  TWO YEAR CLASSES OF WALLEYE ARE PRESENT AT SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN ARE PROBABLY IMMIGRANTS FROM LAKE CALHOUN (WHICH IS STOCKED).  YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE SINCE 1980 FIELD DATA.  BLACK CRAPPIES, HOWEVER, HAVE EXHIBITED A NOTICEABLE DECLINE WITH AVERAGE SIZE REMAINING FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE EXHIBITED A DECLINE IN NUMBERS SINCE 1980 AND WERE ABSENT TRAPNETS.  NORTHERN PIKE CATCHES HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE SINCE 1980, BUT SAMPLED FISH HAVE INCREASED IN AVERAGE SIZE. DISCONTINUATION OF NORTHERN PIKE STOCKING, WHICH WAS DONE ANNUALLY FROM 1977 THROUGH 1984 FOLLOWING A SEVERE WINTERKILL IN 1976-77, IS THE PROBABLE MAJOR CAUSE OF THIS DECLINE. HYBRID MUSKIE CATCHES INDICATE STOCKED FISH HAVE SURVIVED WELL.  LARGEMOUTH BASS, CARP, WHITE SUCKER, YELLOW BULLHEAD AND PUMPKINSEED WERE SAMPLED AT OR BELOW MEDIANLEVELS.  BOWFIN WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS AT ABOVE-MEDIAN LEVELS.</p>",

Northern Pike, while being of low abundance, were above average size. Hybrid Muskellunge are stocked triennially to provide a potential for trophy catches periodically and to supplement the predator population. Largemouth Bass also provide some quality angling opportunities and appear to be at normal levels of abundance. Walleye are also in Lake of the Isles even though they are not stocked. Walleye stocked in Lake Calhoun migrate throughout the entire chain of lakes and populate some of the connecting waters. The yellow perch population has been stable since 1985 and individuals average 6.6 inches in length. Bluegill were sampled at record levels of abundance and average 6.3 inches in length. Bluegill up to 8.2\" were captured in this survey of the fish population. Black crappie average small in size and their abundance has been relatively stable since the mid 1980's. Other species present include that can provide some shore angling excitement (even though relatively low in abundance) include black bullhead, yellow bullhead, carp and bowfin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Isles is located in the heart of urban Minneapolis, connected to the Chain of Lakes.  The lake receives considerable fishing pressure because of it's location.  Shore fishing is popular due to the city park that surrounds the lake, but boat anglers can also access the lake from Lake Calhoun via a connecting channel.     Anglers will find large numbers of bluegill and black crappie, but average size is small.  Bluegill average 4.7 inches, with only 9 % over 6 inches.  Black crappie average 6.3 inches, with less than 1 % over 8 inches.  Northern pike are not very abundant when compared to other lakes of this type, but average size is good.  Pike averaged 29.0 inches, and 67 % were over 28 inches.  Yellow perch are not very abundant for this type of lake, and they average only 6.4 inches.  Anglers can also target largemouth bass and hybrid, also known as tiger, muskellunge.  Hybrid muskies are stocked every third year in the lake.  Bowfin (dogfish), carp, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead are also present in low numbers.</p>",

The entire lake lies within the City of Minneapolis, and its entire shoreline is owned and maintained by their parks department.  The lake has several surface use restrictions, one of which is electric motors only. In 2019, a standard survey was conducted to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked into Lake of the Isles; however, several were sampled in this assessment. These fish most likely migrated into the lake from Cedar and Bde Maka ska. Lake of the Isles Walleye abundance was below average compared to similar lakes. Fish ranged between 18.5 and 24.0 inches, and the average size was 20.9 inches and 3.16 pounds. Five year-classes were sampled; the oldest was age nine. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased considerably from the 2014 survey (15.5 fish per gill net compared to 3.17 fish per gill net), which is well above average. With the higher number of Northern Pike caught, the average length and weight both decreased compared to the 2014 survey (21.2 average length and 2.1 pounds). \t <br> \n\t <br> \nPanfish numbers are similar to previous surveys; catch was high, size structure was small. Bluegill abundance was well above average compared to similar lakes and the average size was 5.46 inches. Only 5% of the sampled Bluegill exceeded 7 inches. Black Crappie abundance was well-below average compared to similar lakes. The average size of trap netted Black Crappie was 7.2 inches and 0.56 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in low abundance included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Isles is a 109-acre lake located in the Minneapolis chain of lakes near downtown Minneapolis.  Lake of the Isles is located between and connected to Cedar Lake and Lake Calhoun via shallow canals.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, tiger muskellunge, walleye, and yellow perch.  Lake of the Isles has been stocked every third year with tiger muskellunge since 1994.  Northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass were low in abundance.  Northern pike size was good.  Eighteen northern pike averaging 24.7 inches and 3.83 pounds were caught in both gill nets and trap nets.  Approximately 39% of sampled pike were above 25.0 inches.  One age-6 walleye (23.0 inches and 4.8 pounds), originating from a 1997 Lake Calhoun fingerling stocking, was caught in a trap net.  Although trap and gills nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, two largemouth bass averaging 14.0 inches and 2.0 pounds were sampled by gill nets.  The largest bass was approximately 18.0 inches in length.  Lake of the Isles has a panfish community consisting of bluegill, black crappie, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Bluegills were moderately abundant and no fish exceeded 6.5 inches.   Black crappies were also moderately abundant.  Of the 57 crappies sampled, 78% were below 7.0 inches.  If allowed to mature, age-3 and age-4 crappies could provide consistent action the next couple of years.  Of the 33 yellow perch sampled, 85% were below 7.0 inches.  Although 21 pumkinseeds, one green sunfish, and 12 hybrid sunfish were additionally sampled, none exceeded 6.5 inches.  Bowfin (dogfish), black bullheads, common carp, and white suckers were sampled in varying numbers.  Nine carp averaging 26.4 inches and 8.7 pounds and three white suckers averaging 19.4 inches and 2.7 pounds were caught in trap nets.  Additionally, two bullheads and three bowfin were caught in both gill nets and trap nets.  </p>",
