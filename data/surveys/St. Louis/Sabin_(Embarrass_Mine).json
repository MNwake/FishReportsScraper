There is a public access on the north shore of the lake with a steep concrete boat ramp. The lake has a maximum depth of 465 feet and extremely clear water. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 20, 2023, Embarrass Pit was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 69 F and a temperature of 39 F at a depth of 100 feet. Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the top 100 feet of the water column. Six gill nets were used to sample gamefish in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout were sampled at a rate of 2.3 fish/net, which was slightly lower than the historical average for the lake. The average length of lake trout sampled was 15.0 inches, and the largest individual was 22.0 inches long. Lake trout were initially stocked into Embarrass Pit in 1985 and have not been stocked since, indicating that the lake supports a naturally reproducing population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in gill nets included cisco, creek chub, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are an aquatic invasive species that are present in Embarrass Pit. It is important for anglers and boaters to follow regulations when moving between lakes because these species can survive in or on boats, trailers, and equipment for some time. Be sure to drain all water from bait containers, live wells, bilge, and watercraft, dispose of any unused bait, and carefully inspect and remove any plants or animals attached to the watercraft, trailer, anchor, or other equipment before leaving the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabin Lake (69-0429) better known as Embarrass Mine Pit is a designated stream trout lake located two miles east of Biwabik.  The access is via a steep concrete ramp in the middle of the lakes north shore.  It is a 156 acre clear water lake with a maximum depth of 465 feet.  This pit was originally operated from 1943 to 1964 as an iron ore mine.  After abandonment, the mine was allowed to fill with water.  There are no inlets or outlets and the mine walls are generally very steep with some sloughing gravel areas.\n\nOn June 6, 2013 the water temperature ranged from 62 F at the surface to 38 F at 100 feet.  Oxygen levels were good throughout the entire measured water column.  This population assessment consisted of three shallow gillnet, three deep gillnet, and no trapnet sets.    \n\nFrom 1984 to 2010 various sizes and strains of rainbow trout, brook trout, lake trout, and even Atlantic salmon were stocked.  Lake trout adults were only stocked in 1984 and 1985.  After 1985, only rainbow trout and brook trout have been stocked.  From 1990 to 2010, rainbows and brookies were stocked in alternating years.\n\nThe shallow gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 16.7 fish/net which is slightly higher than the historical average for the lake.  The deep gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 4.0 fish/net which is below the historical average for the lake.  Only four fish species were sampled: lake trout, white sucker, bluegill, and a chub species.  \n\nA total of 40 lake trout were sampled between all the nets.  A catch rate of 9.7 fish/net in the shallow sets is the highest catch on record.  The catch rate for deep nets was 3.7 fish/net which is just below the average of 4.1 fish/net.  Average lengths were 16.0 inches for shallow caught fish and 14.0 inches for deep caught fish.  Maximum lengths were 20.5 and 20.0 inches respectively.  Average weights per fish were 1.4 and 1.0 pounds for shallow and deep caught fish.  Ages ranged from 8 to over 15 years with the 2000 and 2005 year classes contributing heavily to the population.   \n\nEighteen white suckers were captured in shallow sets for a catch rate of 6.0 fish/shallow gillnet.  This rate is bested only by the 2000 survey which had 12.7 fish/net.  Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 20.5 inches with an average of 12.0 inches.  Sizes have remained similar throughout the historical netting.\n\nOne bluegill was sampled in the shallow nets and was nearly 9.0 inches long.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Embarrass Mine Pit (also known as Lake Mine) was a natural iron ore mine that was operated from 1943 through 1964.  During its operation in the late 1940's the southern portion of Wynne Lake was filled in and the Embarrass River, which used to flow over the Embarrass Mine area, was diverted into a channel to the west.  After abandonment, the mine was allowed to fill with water and in 1992 the water surface area was 156 acres and the maximum depth was 465 ft.  There are no inlets or outlets to Embarrass Mine Pit.  Mine walls are generally steep with sloughing gravel and dirt in areas.  Aquatic vegetation is extremely limited.  Shallow water gillnet investigations in 1978 and 1983 showed that water quality was excellent and that white sucker, northern pike, walleye, and bluegill sunfish were present.  All of these species had likely been stocked by the public. Trout stocking began in 1984, and included lake trout stockings in 1984 and 1985.  Lake trout were not stocked after 1985.  Since 1998, large (1/3 lb each) rainbow trout and brook trout yearlings have been stocked in alternate years.The water quality observed on 04/28/2005 was similar to previous investigations on this lake.  The water was very clear (Secchi = 24 ft), and quite hard (total alkalinity = 112 ppm).  The surface temperature was 45 F and the temperature at the end of the probe cable at 150 ft was 39 F.  Oxygen levels were greater than 8 ppm to the end of the probe.  Previous investigations done later in the summer consistently showed oxygen levels above 6 ppm to depths of 150 ft.The three shallow gillnets in 2005, set in depths of 8-21 ft, caught 23 lake trout, 5 rainbow trout, and 8 white sucker.  The three deep gillnets, set in depths of 30-100 ft, caught 20 lake trout and 3 white sucker.  Lake trout sizes in shallow and deep gillnets were very similar, with average lengths of 15\" in each depth range.  The largest lake trout was 23.6\".  Nine of the eleven lake trout stomachs that were examined contained daphnia, while one contained unidentified invertebrates and one was empty.   Ageing of lake trout by scales and otoliths differed dramatically.  Otolith ageing was confirmed by Paul Hauck (Lake Superior Area ageing technician), and showed that the lake trout in Embarrass Mine Pit are quite old and growing extremely slow.The rainbow trout were 13-14\" and had been stocked as 9\" yearlings the previous spring.  All of the four rainbow trout stomachs that were examined contained daphnia, while one also contained caddisfly larvae.Notable by their absence in this assessment were brook trout or rainbow trout older than the most recent rainbow stocking in 2004.  Although none of the lake trout stomachs examined in this assessment contained trout, previous investigations and angler reports have found trout in the stomachs of lake trout and northern pike.Recent angler reports indicate that mostly lake trout are caught.  One angler who regularly fishes the lake said that many anglers take limits of just-stocked trout shortly after stocking each spring.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Embarrass Mine Pit (also known as Lake Mine) was a natural iron ore mine which was operated from 1943 through 1964.  During its operation in the late 1940's the southern portion of Wynne Lake was filled in and the Embarrass River, which used to flow over the Embarrass Mine area, was diverted into a channel to the west.  After abandonment, the mine was allowed to fill with water and in 1992 the water surface area was 156 acres and the maximum depth was 465 ft.  There are no inlets or outlets.  Mine walls are generally steep with sloughing gravel in areas.  Aquatic vegetation is extremely limited.Investigations in 1978 and 1983 showed that water quality was good, and that white sucker, northern pike, walleye, and bluegill sunfish were present.  All of these species were likely introduced by the public.  Trout stocking began in 1984.  Five subsequent gillnet investigations were conducted through 2000.The water quality observed during this assessment was similar to previous investigations.  The water was extremely clear (Secchi = 26 ft) and quite hard (total alkalinity = 129 ppm).  Oxygen levels on 05/30/2000 remained above 10 ppm to the end of the probe cord at 140 ft.Three shallow gillnets set in depths of 8-20 ft and three deep gillnets set in depths of 30-93 ft captured a total of 2 brook trout, 6 rainbow trout, and 27 lake trout.  The brook trout and rainbow trout were all caught in the shallow nets, while most of the lake trout were caught in the deep nets.  The brook trout were 13\" and were likely from most recent yearling stocking in May, 1999.  One brook trout stomach was empty, the other contained minnows and insects.  The rainbow trout were 10-12\" and were from the most recent yearling stocking on May 11, 2000, nineteen days prior to this investigation.  Two rainbow trout stomachs were empty, three contained insects, and one contained plankton.The lake trout were 8-22\" and ranged from age 4 through age 9.  All were naturally produced and were the descendants of lake trout stocked by the IRRRB in 1984 and 1985.  Twenty percent of the lake trout stomachs were empty, the rest contained insects (41%), plankton (18%), fish remains (6%), minnows (6%), crayfish (6%), and white sucker (3%).Notable by their absence in this assessment were brook trout or rainbow trout older than the most recent stocking of each species.  Some predation by lake trout is occurring; although no trout could be identified among the lake trout stomach contents in this assessment, anglers have reported larger lake trout with trout in their stomachs.  Two of the three northern pike captured during this assessment had trout in their stomachs.  It is uncertain where these pike are spawning, but enough are probably present to impact populations of stocked stream trout.Fishing pressure in Embarrass Mine Pit is probably light-to-moderate, but does attract some regular visitors.  One angler in 1997 reported catching limits of rainbow trout over 16\" using cowbells.  Another angler who often fishes Embarrass Pit said that many anglers take limits of just-stocked trout shortly after stocking each spring.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>One shallow and five deep gillnets were set in this special assessment for trout.  No trapnets were set due to the steep dropoff of the shoreline.  The water quality observed during this assessment was similar to previous measurements.  The water was extremely clear, and good oxygen was present to the depth of the meter cable (100'), where the temperature was 39 F.  The water was mineralized, but previous investigation showed that biological productivity is limited by a lack of phosphorus and the small amount of nearshore shallow area.Low numbers of sucker were caught in this assessment.  Absent in this assessment were northern pike, walleye, and bluegill - all of which have been present in low numbers in previous assessments.  These species are probably still present, but more than one shallow gillnet is needed to assess their abundance.High numbers of brook trout were captured, but the total weight (biomass) of brook trout and lake trout was below the average for natural lakes stocked with trout in the Ely Management Area.  All of the brook trout captured in this assessment had been stocked as yearlings during the previous month.  All the lake trout appeared to be the result of natural reproduction - the first such occurrance observed in four mine pits stocked with lake trout in the Ely Management Area.  Lake trout adults were stocked in Embarrass Pit in 1984 and 1985.  Brook trout were in good condition and lake trout were in fair condition.  Most trout had been eating insects and zooplankton, although a few had eaten minnows.Notable by their absence in this assessment were brook trout stocked as yearlings in 1991 and 1993, and rainbow trout stocked as yearlings in 1992 and 1994.  Some predation on trout by lake trout is occurring; although no trout were observed in the stomachs of lake trout during this assessment, an angler reported a 9\" trout in the stomach of a 14 lb lake trout he caught in 1993.  Predation by northern pike is also likely; pike ranging in size from 1-14 lb were caught in every assessment prior to 1995, and pike have also been observed during winter creel surveys.  Although the stomachs of these pike were not examined for trout, pike captured in other Ely Management Area stream trout lakes (Gilbert Pit, Jammer Lake, Cedar Lake, Conchu Lake) have contained trout.  Annual fishing pressure in Embarrass Pit is probably light.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabin Lake, locally known as Embarrass Lake Mine or Embarrass Mine Pit, is a designated stream trout lake located two miles east of Biwabik.  Being a designated trout lake means that angling can only occur when trout season is open, requires anglers to have a valid trout stamp, permits only one line to be used regardless of the season, and prohibits the use of live minnows.  The access is via a steep concrete ramp in the middle of the lake's north shore.  It is a 156 acre clear water lake with a maximum depth of 465 feet.  This pit was originally operated from 1943 to 1964 as an iron ore mine.  After abandonment, the mine was allowed to fill with water.  There are no inlets or outlets and the mine walls are generally very steep with some sloughing gravel areas.\n\nOn August 28, 2017 the water temperature ranged from 66 F at the surface to 41 F at 100 feet.  Oxygen levels were good throughout the entire measured water column.  This population assessment consisted of three shallow and three deep gillnet sets.  \n\nFrom 1984 to 2010, various sizes and strains of rainbow trout, brook trout, lake trout, and even Atlantic salmon were stocked.  Lake trout adults were only stocked in 1984 and 1985.  After 1985, only rainbow trout and brook trout were stocked.  From 1990 to 2010, rainbows and brookies were stocked in alternating years, but survival was low and stream trout stocking was discontinued. When it became evident that the lake trout population was reproducing and surviving, management changed to lake trout. In 2015 cisco were stocked in an effort to create a more abundant food source for the lake trout population.  \n\nThe five fish species sampled in 2017 were lake trout, white sucker, bluegill, creek chub, and common shiner.  \n\nForty-eight lake trout were sampled in deep gill nets for a catch rate of 16 fish/net which was the highest catch rate on record for Embarrass Pit and a very good catch rate compared to other trout lakes in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 8 to 21 inches with an average of just over 13 inches.  Sizes were small but comparable to past surveys.  For their size, some fish were quite old, up to 21 years.  Growth was slow with the average trout taking eight years to reach 18 inches.  \n\nSeven white sucker were captured in deep sets for a catch rate of 2.3 fish/deep gill net, which was the highest catch rate on record for the pit.  Fish up to 18 inches were sampled with an average of 12 inches.  Sizes have remained similar throughout past surveys.\n\nCisco were stocked in 2015 however none were sampled in this survey.  Examination of trout stomachs showed no sign of cisco as well.  Future stocking events will hopefully be successful at establishing a viable population.\n\nBluegill, creek chub, and common shiner were also sampled.  </p>",
