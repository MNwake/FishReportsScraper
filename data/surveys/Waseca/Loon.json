                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake in Waseca County is a 122 acre lake located in the city of Waseca. A public access is located on the north side of the lake, off U.S. Highway 14. No gasoline motors are allowed on Loon Lake. A fishing pier is located next to the public access. City parks on the north and south shores provide ample shore-fishing locations. Shoreline restoration projects in the parks have established diverse native plant communities and reduced goose usage of these parks. The lake is aerated in the winter; use caution when traveling on Loon Lake and obey signs marking thin ice areas. <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake was surveyed the week of June 8th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Black bullhead dominated trap and gill net catches. Black bullhead abundance was 276 fish per trap net lift and 80 fish per gill net lift. Nearly all bullheads ranged between 6 and 8 inches. Black bullheads in Loon Lake show characteristics of a stunted population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the next most abundant species, overwhelming trap nets at 111 fish per net and gill nets at 53 fish per net. Bluegill size ranged between 4.5 and 6 inches. Bluegills show characteristics of a stunted population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were the third most abundant fish species. Black crappies totaled 45 fish per gill net and 70 fish per trap net. Size ranged between 5.5 and 7.5 inches; 1% of fish exceeded 8 inches and no fish exceeded 10 inches. Black crappies show characteristics of a stunted population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike averaged 4.3 fish per gill net lift. Pike ranged between 21 and 33 inches and were in good condition in the midst of overabundant forage. Largemouth bass are present at low levels and provide another angling option; two bass were caught in survey nets (bass are best sampled using electrofishing). <br> \n <br> \nThree walleye were caught in the 2009 population assessment. These fish were transported and released by citizens; the DNR has not stocked walleye into Loon Lake. Other fish sampled in the survey at trace levels include yellow perch, white crappie, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Loon Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake of Waseca County is a 122 acre lake located within the city of Waseca. A city-managed public access is located on the south side of the lake. A fishing pier is available for use next to the public access. Additional shoreline fishing opportunities are available on the north and south sides of the lake. Loon Lake is closed to gasoline-powered motors, making it a good option for canoeing and kayaking. Loon Lake is aerated throughout the winter to help prevent winterkill of the fish population; use caution when traveling on the ice and obey signs marking thin ice areas. Loon Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 9.0 feet. Based on lake characteristics, Loon Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Other lakes with this classification include Crystal Lake (Blue Earth County), Gorman Lake (Le Sueur County), and Pickerel Lake (Freeborn County). Loon Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Channel Catfish. Stocking plans include stocking managed fish species after winterkills or as otherwise warranted. Loon Lake was surveyed the week of July 27, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying three gill nets and nine trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, a night electrofishing survey was also conducted on June 1, 2015 to assess the Largemouth Bass population.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 1.3 fish/gill net, which was less than the catch rate of the previous survey conducted in 2009 (4.3 fish/gill net) and the long-term average for Loon Lake (4.4 fish/gill net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 2.8 fish/net, which was slightly below the long-term average catch rate for Loon Lake (3.2 fish/net). The size structure of Northern Pike was small, with an average length of 16.1 inches and a maximum length of 20.9 inches. Most of the catch (93%) were age-2 fish and were likely the result of the Northern Pike stocking that took place in 2014 (N = 360 adults).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappies were not present in the 2015 survey and were not stocked after the reclamation of Loon Lake in the fall of 2012. Prior to the 2012 reclamation, Black Crappies averaged 34.8 fish/trap net and size structure was generally small. The average length of Black Crappie was 4.5 inches in 2000, 7.9 inches in 2004, and 6.6 inches in 2009. According to the current management plan for Loon Lake, Black Crappie will be stocked as soon as adult fish are available.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill catch rate was 4.6 fish/trap net, which was far below the long-term average for Loon Lake (60.1 fish/trap net). Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.4 inches, indicating a good size structure. Pre-spawn Bluegill adults were stocked in 2013 and 2014 following the reclamation of Loon Lake in the fall of 2012. The presence of age-1 Bluegill in 2015 indicated that the population was naturally reproducing. Adult Bluegill will continue to be stocked in Loon Lake as needed. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled in 2015 at a rate of 1.7 fish/gill net. This was the first survey that Channel Catfish showed a presence in Loon Lake since 1995, when one individual was sampled (0.3 fish/trap net). The average length of Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 18.1 inches. These fish were likely the result of the 2013 stocking event, when yearling Channel Catfish (N = 3000) were stocked following the reclamation of 2012. The Channel Catfish appeared healthy and were growing well. Channel Catfish are efficient at predating on young Black Bullheads, which were abundant in Loon Lake at the time of this survey. Adult Channel Catfish are planned to be stocked in Loon Lake to continue predating on overabundant Black Bullheads and to provide a recreational fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nAn electrofishing survey was conducted on the night of June 1, 2015 to assess the Largemouth Bass population in Loon Lake. Largemouth Bass (N = 30) were sampled at a rate of 23.2 fish/hour. The size structure of Largemouth Bass was small, ranging from 10.1 to 11.8 inches and averaging 10.7 inches. All aged Largemouth Bass were age-3, with the exception of one age-4 individual. These fish were from the 2013 stocking event, when Largemouth Bass were stocked at fingerling and adult life stages. The lack of fingerling-sized Largemouth Bass in the 2015 survey suggests that natural reproduction was limited. However, many of the adult Largemouth Bass appeared mature and ready to spawn at the time of this survey. Targeted electrofishing surveys on Loon Lake will continue in an effort to monitor the Largemouth Bass population and determine when additional stocking is necessary.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nFour Walleyes were sampled in gill nets in 2015 for a catch rate of 1.3 fish/net. Walleyes averaged 16.7 inches in length and were all from the same year class (age-2). Loon Lake does not have the characteristics of a sustainable Walleye fishery, so Walleye are not a managed species in Loon Lake and are not stocked by the DNR. Any Walleyes present in the lake were likely illegally transported and released.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack Bullheads have a history of being overabundant to nuisance levels in Loon Lake. Numerous reclamation events (i.e. intended fish kills using rotenone) have taken place in an effort to reduce Black Bullhead abundance in Loon Lake, but with limited success. The 2015 survey produced a catch rate of 183.3 fish/trap net, which was less than the previous two trap net catch rates (276.1 fish/net in 2009 and 564.6 fish/net in 2004). However, the 2015 gill net catch rate of 122.0 fish/net was greater than the 2009 gill net catch rate (79.7 fish/net) and greater than the long-term average for gill nets in Loon Lake (92.8 fish/net). Most of the Black Bullheads sampled in 2015 were small, as 90% of the overall catch was less than 7.0 inches in length. Predator species that are efficient at consuming Black Bullheads, such Channel Catfish and Largemouth Bass, will continue to be stocked in Loon Lake in an effort to biologically control the nuisance Black Bullhead population.  <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nAlthough Bluegill abundance was low compared to the historic average, Loon Lake had a Bluegill population with good size structure. Also, the young Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Channel Catfish populations will continue to improve as overall size structures increase. All of these gamefish species can be targeted from the ample shoreline available and from the fishing pier on the south side of Loon Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a small water located on the west side of the City of Waseca.  City parks on the north and south shores provide ample shore-fishing locations.  Shoreline restoration projects in the parks have established diverse native plant communities and reduced goose usage of these parks.  A fishery survey was conducted on Loon Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Small black bullhead around 5 inches long were by far the most abundant species in both gill net and trap net catches.  Loon lake was chemically reclaimed in Fall 1996.  No bullhead were captured in 1998, 1999, or 2000.  One black bullhead was captured in 2001, with increasing yet low catches in 2002 and 2003.  In the 2004 survey black bullhead number have increased to a high abundance.  Low oxygen resulted in winterkill in early 2000 and probably contributed to the increase in black bullhead abundance.  High numbers of 14 to 18 inch long northern pike were also abundant in both the gill and trap nets.  Northern pike fry were stocked in 2001 and appear to have had high survival, yet rather slow growth compared to other area lakes where the 2001 year class of northern pike were around 20 to 30 inches long by summer 2003 or 2004.  Bluegill and black crappie were caught in moderate numbers.  The bluegill were relatively large with most between 7.5 and 8 inches with the longest at 8.8 inches.  An aeration system is operated on Loon Lake to maintain winter oxygen levels.  Use caution when traveling on the ice as they may be areas of open water.  No gasoline motors are allowed on Loon Lake.  Boats may be launch at the park on the south shore.</p>",

THE CITY OF WASECA PROPOSED TO DRAWDOWN LOON LAKE IN 1983 TO EXPOSE TH BOTTOM TO CONSOLIDATE THE SEDIMENTS AND EXIDIZE THE SOILS SO INTERNAL CYCLING OF PHOSPHOUS WOULD BE DISRUPTED. DNR FISHERIES WATER- VILLE DEVELOPED A FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLAN CALLNG FOR REMOVAL OF THE RESIDENT FISH WITH ROTENONE, INSTALLATION OF AN AERATION SYSTEM AND STOCKING WITH LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLUEGILL FOLLOWING RE- CLAMATION. SINCE 1975, LOON LAKE HAS BEEN USED AS A WALLEYE FINGERLING REARING POND. FOLLOWING THE WINTERKILL OF 1979-1980, LOON LAKE HAS NOT SUFFER- ED OXYGEN DEPLETION UNDER ICE COVER. AS A RESULT WALLEYE IN THE LAKE HAVE EXHIBITED SLOW GROWTH. FOR EXAMPLE, AGE 3 FISH IN LOON LKE AVG 6.4' TL, AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION , WHEREAS, AVG GROWTH IN WALLEYE MANAGED LAKES IS 11.2; TL. AT ANNULUS 3. BLACK BULLHEADS CENTERED AROUND A MODAL LENGTH INTERVAL OF 6.5-6.9' TL. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL BULL- HEADS WERE OF SIMIALR SIZE IT IS ASSUMED THESE FISH ARE THE 1980 YEAR CLASS.  A FEW 1981 YEAR- CLASS BLACK CRAPPIES WERE PRESENT IN THE LAKE. THESE FISH ARE THOUGHT TO BE AN INTRODUCTION BY THE PUBLIC. ON OCTOBER 29,1983 LOON LAKE WAS CHEMICALLY RECLAIMED WITH ROTENONE. ESTIMATE OF THE FISH KIL- LED AMOUNTED TO 77,500 PDS OF BULLHEADS, 10 PDS OF WALLEYE AND 10 PDS OF CARP. DETAILS OF THIS OPERA- TION ARE FOUND IN A MEMO TO JAMES GRUEBNER, FISH HABITAT AND DEVELOPMENT COORDINATOR, DATED 1/9/84.</p>",

BLACK BULLHEADS ARE DOMINATED BY LARGE FISH, 8.0- 10.4 INCHES, WHICH MAY INDICATE ONE DOMINANT AGE CLASS SAMPLED. THE 1986 NETTING WAS DOMINATED BY 5.0-5.9 INCH BULLHEADS WITH FEWER LARGE BULLHEADS SAMPLED.</p>",

THOUGH PANFISH DENSITIES DECREASED AND AVERAGE SIZES INCREASED AFTER THE REMOVAL, THESE CHANGE MAY BE THE RESULT OF NORMAL MORTALITY, GROWTH, AND EXPLOITATION.  THE EFFECT OF REMOVAL CANNOT BE CLEARLY DETERMINED.  BLG NUMBERS DECREASED FROM 285.30/TRAP NET AND 563.00/ GILL NET IN 1990 TO 210.00/TRAP NET AND 114.00/ GILL NET.  MOST BLG WERE 6.0-6.9 INCHES IN LENGTH, AN INCREASE OVER THE MOST COMMON LENGTHS OF 5.0- 6.4 INCHES IN 1990.  GROWTH IS NORMAL.  BLG ARE NOW OF ACCEPTABLE SIZE TO ANGLERS, HAVING INCREASED IN WEIGHT FROM 6.8 FISH/LB. IN 1990 TO 4.5 FISH/LB.

THE MOST COMMON LENGTH GROUP INCREASED 1/2 5.5-6.4 INCHES IN 1990, 6.0-6.9 INCHES IN 1991, AND 6.5-7.4 INCHES IN 1992.  THE 1987 YEAR CLASS CONTINUES TO SHOW UP STRONGLY IN THE NETTING, AGAIN FOLLOWED BY A FAIR NUMBER OF 1988 YEAR CLASS FISH.  ANNULI WERE CROWDED IN THE OLDER FISH, AND CHECKS WERE DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE FROM TRUE ANNULI.  FOR THESE REASONS, AND BECAUSE ONLY 1 1986 YEAR CLASS BLG HAS BEEN SAMPLED IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS, THE NUMBER OF AGE 6 BLG IN THE SAMPLE SHOULD BE VIEWED WITH CAUTION.  MOST OF THESE FISH MAY, IN FACT, BELONG TO THE DOMINANT 1987 YEAR CLASS.  AGES 1-6, WITH NO AGE 3 BLG, WERE CAPTURED.  GROWTH IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THAT MEASURED IN THE 1991 AND 1990 ASSESSMENTS, AND IS NEAR THE STATE AVERAGE.  BLC TRAP NET DECREASED SIMILARLY; 144.70/NET IN 1990,96.00/NET IN 1991, AND 60.25/NET IN 1992.  THIS CATCH IS ABOVE THE IQR FOR CLASS 43 LAKES.  THERE WERE REGULAR INCREASES IN BLC LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION AND MODAL LENGTH RANGE, AS WITH BLG.  RANGES WERE 6.0-7.4 INCHES IN 1990, 7.0-8.4 INCHES IN 1991, AND 7.5-8.9 AND 4.5-6.4 INCHES IN 1992.  MODAL LENGTH RANGES WERE 6.5-7.4 INCHES IN 1990, 7.5- 7.9 INCHES IN 1991, AND 8.0-8.9 INCHES IN 1992. BLC AGE 1-6, EXCEPT FOR AGE 4, WERE CAPTURED. AGES 1 AND 2 DOMINATED THE SAMPLE, AND THE 1987 YEAR CLASS CONTINUES (FROM 1991 AND 1990) TO BE STRONGLY REPRESENTED.  GROWTH IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS YEARS, AND IS SLOWER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE AFTER AGE 2.  ONE LMB, AGE 5, WAS SAMPLED. LENGTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE.  ONE WAE WAS SAMPLED. AS WITH THE SINGLE WAE CAPTURED IN THE 1990 ASSESSMENT, ORIGIN IS UNKNOWN SINCE WAE HAVE NOT BEEN STOCKED SINCE THE 1984 RECLAMATION.  BLB TRAP NET CATCH, AT 16.25/NET, CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE 22.50/NET OF 1991.  NET CATCH IS WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 43 LAKES.  PREVIOUS BLB LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS WERE UNIMODAL, BUT THE 1992 DISTRIBUTION IS BIMODAL, WITH 4-6 INCH BLB APPEARING IN THIS YEAR'S CATCH.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED WERE PMK, YEP, CCF, AND WTS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The recreational value of the Loon Lake fish community continues to be significant, largely a result of the abundant bluegills and black crappies.  Although numbers continued their steady decline from the 285.3/trap net captured in 1990, bluegills remained very abundant at 71.3/trap net.  Approximately half of the fish caught were 7-8 inches in length, an attractive combination of abundance and size.  Black crappies were caught at 89.5/gill net, a large number for lakes of this type but similar to the 97/gill net captured in 1992.Largemouth bass were captured at 22.5/gill net, a remarkably high number.  Most of these fish were 5-6.5 inches in length.Black bullheads increased from 35/gill net in 1992 to 267.5/gill net in 1993.  Many of these fish were 4-5.5 inches, suggesting that a large cohort has recently formed.</p>",
