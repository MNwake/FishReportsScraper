                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during late June of 2015 in Monson Lake. Monson is a small sized (208 acres), shallow (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Residential development is limited to 5 homes and 2 recreational vehicles along the south, north and west shore areas. The public access and shore fishing pier are located on the east side in the state park. A park sticker is required if driving a motor vehicle on to the access site. Usage of Monson State Park and the corresponding public access is generally low compared to nearby Sibley State Park on Lake Andrew. The surrounding watershed is comprised of mostly agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland, grassland, pasture, and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small to moderate areas of wetlands, row crops, and grassland. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient inputs into Monson. Nutrient levels were high in Monson during 2015. There are three small sized inlets (northwest, northeast, and south shores) that flow into Monson. The Monson outlet connects to West Sunburg Lake, which is a shallow, productive and sometimes susceptible winterkill lake. Fish movement is possible between West Sunburg and Monson during high water levels, which has resulted in excellent growth and fishing for large sized sunfish following periods of mild winters. Water levels were below normal during the early spring and fall, but normal during the summer of 2015. Water clarity (secchi reading) was good (7.0 feet) during early June, but poor (2.1 feet) by early August of 2015. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent vegetation is dense and diverse with northern milfoil, various pondweed species (flat-stem, curly-leaf, clasping-leaf, leafy, sago pondweed), coontail, water moss, and filamentous algae present in Monson. Emergent vegetation is also abundant and diverse consisting of various bulrush species, cattail species, duckweed species, burreed, arrowhead, and reed canary grass scattered throughout the bay, shoreline, and island areas. Shoalwater substrates are varied with sand, silt, boulder, gravel, rubble, muck and clay. Monson can be a popular winter fishery when the Walleye or panfish angler catch is good. There are also good Northern Pike spearing prospects during the winter. Largemouth Bass fishing opportunities for large fish are often excellent during the early summer months.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2015 (11.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (5.14 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was small (2.52 pounds and 22.0 inches) from gillnets. There were low numbers of Northern Pike greater than 28.0 inches in the survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2015 (0.33 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie average size was small (0.04 pounds and 4.2 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant (21.50 fish/gillnet), but the average size was small (0.09 pounds, 5.8 inches) in 2015. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.79 fish/gillnet for Monson Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2015 (70.78 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (18.45 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.1 inches) from trapnets. Most of the Bluegill captured from the survey nets were from the 2012 year class. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of large Bluegill captured in the previous 2010 survey (2.67 fish/trapnet 10.0 inches or larger), however no fish over 8.0 inches were captured in the 2015 survey. The largest Bluegill captured was 11.8 inches (about 2 pounds) in the 2010 survey, but only 7.3 inches in the 2015 survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2015 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (4.48 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.10 pounds and 14.0 inches) from gillnets. Large sized Walleye (5.39 pounds average) were caught in the 2015 trapnets (1.22 fish/trapnet). Walleye growth rates are excellent in Monson. Walleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults (200-450 pounds per stocking year) have been stocked in recent years. Walleye were last stocked into Monson during 2014 (100 fingerlings, 10 pounds; 1,472 yearlings, 339 pounds; 219 adults, 94 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers overall were low (17.29 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. However, there were abundant numbers (16.27 fish/hour) of Largemouth Bass 15.0 inches and larger captured in the spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was large (3.07 pounds and 17.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates are excellent in Monson. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2015 (0.56 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (23.86 fish/trapnet). The Black Bullhead average size was large (1.61 pounds and 14.06 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Monson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Monson fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

PER FISH IN 1987).  COMMERCIAL BULLHEAD REMOVAL HAS OCCURED ON MONSON FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BUT IN 1987, 23,900 LBS. WERE REMOVED WHICH EASILY THE HIGHEST REMOVAL TOTAL SINCE 1980.  BASED ON THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY OF MONSON (TOTAL PHOSPHORUS IN 1982 WAS 0.071 PPM AND 0.301 PPM IN 1987), IT APPEARS THAT EITHER THE SURVEY UNDERSAMPLED THE FISH BIOMASS OR THE LAKE IS CURRENTLY BELOW CARRYING CAPACITY (NO INDICATIONS OF RECENT WINTERKILL OR SUMMERKILL; HOWEVER SHOALWATER SEINING IN 1987 AND 1989 SHOW VERY LOW YOY GAMEFISH NUMBERS).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer assessment of the fish population was conducted on Monson Lake in June of 2001. Monson is a small lake located in Swift County. The maximum depth is 21 feet. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Monson is a popular fishing lake for local residents and state park visitors. Water quality and clarity is fair to moderate in Monson. Aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant within the lake. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural row crops. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Monson Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye.Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2001 (5.7 fish/gillnet), but above the historical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was moderate in 2001 (0.24 lbs. and 7.2 inches from gillnets). Black crappie growth rates in Monson were generally above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 9.2 inches.Bluegill numbers were low in 2001 (3.6 fish/trapnet), but above the historical average (2.3 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.10 lbs. and 4.6 inches from trapnets). However, moderate numbers of larger bluegill (0.24 lbs and 6.0 inches average size) were captured in gillnets (9.7 fish/trapnet) compared to trapnets during the 2001 summer assessment. Bluegill growth rates in Monson were above average for fish 3 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 8.0 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (73.1 fish/hour) and above the Monson Lake historical average (39.1 fish/hour). The 2001 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.18 lbs. and 12.0 inches) from the 2001 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates in Monson were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 17.5 inches.Northern pike numbers were high in 2001 (13.0 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (4.0 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was moderate (2.58 lbs. and 22.4 inches). Northern pike growth rates in Monson were average compared to other Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in 2001 assessment was 30.7 inches.Walleye numbers were low to moderate in 2001 (4.3 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historical average (4.9 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.85 lbs. and 16.7 inches). Walleye growth rates in Monson were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 26.8 inches. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 2000 (13,750 fingerlings), 1997 (3,975 fingerlings), and 1995 (8,931 fingerlings). Yellow perch numbers were high in the 2001 (27.7 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (7.6 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.16 lbs. and 6.7 inches). The largest yellow perch captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 10.1 inches.Other notable fish species captured in the 2001 summer assessment included moderate numbers of black bullhead (28.7 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of yellow bullhead (1.3 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 142.9 fish/gillnet for black bullhead and 0.3 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead. The 2001 black bullhead average size was large (1.28 lbs., 12.6 inches). The largest black bullhead captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 15.2 inches.Current fish management activities on Monson include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. The entire Monson Lake fishery will be surveyed again in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Monson during September 24, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Monson is a small sized (208 acres), shallow (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation species are abundant within Monson. Shoalwater substrates are varied with sand, silt, boulder, gravel, rubble, muck and clay. There are abundant numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike during most years in Monson.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys and standard analysis. Although past Walleye fingerling/yearling stockings have been successful, a less expensive Walleye fry stocking was attempted in 2018 (231,135 fry). Additional fry stockings will occur in the near future (2020 and 2022), in order to evaluate a change in Walleye stocking strategies for Monson and several other area lakes (Games, Florida, Andrew and Eagle). Walleye fingerling/yearling stockings are contingent the same year if the fry stocking is unsuccessful as documented by fall electrofishing. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults (200-450 pounds per stocking year) have been stocked in recent years including 2014 and 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY or Yearling Walleye were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye were stocked into Monson shortly after the 2018 fall electrofishing survey (411 pounds total: 28 fingerlings, 1.5 pounds; 1,441 yearlings, 370.5 pounds; 30 adults, 39 pounds) in response to the fry stocking failure. Low (< 8 YOY/hour) or no YOY Walleye numbers were documented due to natural reproduction on Monson during fall electrofishing surveys conducted in 1995, 1997 and 1999. <br> \n  <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (6.00 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles for (25th=3.00, 50th=4.33, 75th=5.00 fish/gillnet) Monson and Lake Class 38 lakes (75th=3.75 fish/gillnet) in the most recent 2015 standard summer gillnet survey. The 2015 Walleye average weight and length were 1.10 pounds and 13.97 inches from gillnets. Large sized Walleye (5.39 pounds average) were caught in the 2015 trapnets (1.22 fish/trapnet). The 2013 and 2006 year classes each comprised 22% of the 2015 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Monson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Monson fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey was conducted during late June of 2005 in Monson Lake. Monson is a small sized (152 acres), moderately deep (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Residential development is limited to 3 homes and 1 recreational vehicle site along the south, north and west shore areas. The public access is located on the east side in the state park. The surrounding watershed is comprised of mostly agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland, grassland, pasture, and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small to moderate areas of wetlands, row crops, and grassland. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Monson. Nutrient levels were low to moderate (total phosphorus=0.028 ppm) during 2005 in Monson. There are three small sized inlets (northwest, northeast, and south shores) that flow into Monson. The outlet connects to West Sunburg Lake. Water levels have been high in Monson during recent years. Water clarity was good (secchi= 7.83 feet) during the June 2005 resurvey. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent vegetation is dense and diverse with northern milfoil, various pondweed species (flat-stem, curly-leaf, clasping-leaf, leafy, sago pondweed), coontail, water moss, and filamentous algae present in Monson. Emergent vegetation is also abundant and diverse consisting of various bulrush species, cattail species, duckweed species, burreed, arrowhead, and reed canary grass scattered throughout the bay, shoreline, and island areas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, gravel, and silt. Monson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill. Walleye fingerlings or yearlings are generally stocked into Monson every other year. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2005 (4.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.08 fish/gillnet for Monson. The 2005 northern pike average size was moderate (2.87 pounds and 23.7 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.55 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches and larger) northern pike was moderate (3.75 fish/gillnet) for Monson. Northern pike growth rates in Monson were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2000 northern pike year class comprised 30% of the 2005 northern pike resurvey catch. The largest northern pike captured was 32.2 inches from the 2005 assessment.Black crappie numbers were moderate to abundant in 2005 (3.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.90 fish/trapnet for Monson. The 2005 black crappie average size was small (0.14 pounds and 5.4 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in Monson were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2004 and 2003 black crappie year classes comprised 41% and 37% respectively of the 2005 black crappie resurvey catch.Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2005 (25.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 10.18 fish/gillnet for Monson Lake. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.2 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in Monson were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2003 year class comprised 82% of the 2005 yellow perch resurvey catch.  Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2005 (14.11 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 3.94 fish/trapnet for Monson. The 2005 bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.6 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) bluegill was moderate to high (6.44 fish/trapnet) in Monson. Bluegill growth rates in Monson Lake were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2000 and 2003 bluegill year classes comprised 28% and 32% respectively of the 2005 bluegill resurvey catch. The largest bluegill captured was 9.1 inches from the 2005 assessment.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2005 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but low compared to the Monson historical average catch rate (4.48 fish/gillnet). The 2005 walleye average size was large (3.09 pounds and 19.1 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.97 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates for Monson were generally within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2001 walleye year class comprised 33% of the 2005 walleye resurvey catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. The largest walleye captured was 25.5 inches from the 2005 assessment.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in the 2005 spring electrofishing survey (52.94 fish/hour) compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.20 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 41.83 fish/hour for Monson. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was large (2.44 pounds and 16.0 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight and length were 1.92 pounds and 13.8 inches from spring electrofishing for Monson. The 2005 catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches and larger) largemouth bass was high (39.71 fish/hour) and above the Monson historical average (14.27 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates in Monson Lake were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 1997, 1998, and 1999 year classes comprised 22%, 23%, and 20% respectively of the 2005 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. The largest largemouth bass captured was 18.9 inches from the 2005 spring electrofishing survey.Black bullhead numbers were moderate in 2005 (39.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 128.10 fish/gillnet for Monson. The 2005 black bullhead average size was large (0.90 pounds and 11.11 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.67 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Monson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Monson fishery will be sampled in the 2010 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during mid-June of 2019 in Monson Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nMonson is a small sized (208 acres), shallow (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Residential development is limited to 5 homes and 2 recreational vehicles along the south, north and west shore areas. The public access and shore fishing pier are located on the east side in the state park. Usage of Monson State Park and the corresponding public access is generally low compared to nearby Sibley State Park on Lake Andrew. The surrounding watershed is comprised of mostly agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland, grassland, pasture, and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small to moderate areas of wetlands, row crops, and grassland. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Monson. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.063 ppm, Chlorophyll a=53.5 ppb) during 2015 in Monson. There are three small sized inlets (northwest, northeast, and south shores) that flow into Monson. The Monson outlet connects to West Sunburg Lake, which is a shallow, productive and sometimes susceptible winterkill lake. Fish movement is possible between West Sunburg and Monson during high water levels, which has resulted in excellent sunfish growth and good fishing after several mild winters in both lakes. A winterkill probably occurred in the connected West Sunburg Lake in February of 2019. Water levels were above normal during the 2019. Water clarity (secchi reading) was good (12.0 feet) on June 19, 2019. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent vegetation is dense and diverse with northern milfoil, various pondweed species (flat-stem, curly-leaf, clasping-leaf, leafy, sago pondweed), coontail, water moss, and filamentous algae present in Monson. Emergent vegetation is also abundant and diverse consisting of various bulrush species, cattail species, duckweed species, burreed, arrowhead, and reed canary grass scattered throughout the bay, shoreline, and island areas. Shoalwater substrates are varied with sand, silt, boulder, gravel, rubble, muck and clay.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2019 (4.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.03 fish/gillnet for Monson. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.25 pounds and 24.58 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.65 pounds from gillnets. There were no fish over 30.00 inches caught in the 2019 survey nets. Northern Pike growth rates were fair. The 2014 and 2015 year classes each comprised 36% of the 2019 Northern Pike gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Monson in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were absent in 2019 survey nets. The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 0.70 fish/trapnet and 1.30 fish/gillnet for Monson.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (6.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.26 fish/gillnet for Monson Lake. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.05 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were uncharacteristically low in 2019 (0.44 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 16.65 fish/trapnet for Monson. The 2019 Bluegill average size was small (0.05 pounds and 4.24 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of large Bluegill captured in the previous 2010 survey (2.67 fish/trapnet of 10.00 inches or larger). The largest Bluegill captured was 11.81 inches (about 2 pounds) in the 2010 survey, but only 6.42 inches in the 2019 survey. Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2017 year class comprised 83% of the 2019 Bluegill gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2019 (3.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the Monson historical average catch rate of 4.38 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Walleye average size was large (3.68 pounds and 21.69 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.24 pounds from gillnets. Low numbers of small sized Walleye (0.85 pounds, 11.16 inches) were caught in the 2019 trapnets (1.78 fish/trapnet). Walleye growth rates were good. The 2018 year class comprised 35% of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. It appears that a 2018 Walleye fry stocking contributed to the fishery. Walleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Walleye were recently stocked into Monson during 2012 (54 fingerlings, 3 pounds; 1,252 yearlings, 498 pounds), 2014 (100 fingerlings, 10 pounds; 1,472 yearlings, 339 pounds; 219 adults, 94 pounds), 2016 (504 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 640 yearlings, 320 pounds; 112 adults, 155 pounds) and 2018 (231,135 fry; 28 fingerlings, 2 pounds; 1,441 yearlings, 371 pounds; 29 adults, 39 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2019. A 2015 Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing survey sampled low numbers (17.29 fish/hour). The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was large (3.07 pounds and 17.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2015 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger) Largemouth Bass was high (16.27 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass growth rates were above average in Monson. The 2008 year class comprised 28% of the 2015 Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were moderate in 2019 (23.50 fish/gillnet), but below the Monson historical average catch rate of 92.37 fish/gillnet. Black Bullhead abundance in the 2019 trapnets (5.67 fish/trapnet) was also below the historical average (22.04 fish/trapnet). The 2019 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.13 pounds and 12.50 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.86 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Monson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Monson fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Monson is a small and shallow lake located four miles southwest of Sunburg, MN in Monson Lake State Park. There is an abundance of submergent vegetation in addition to flooded stumps and downed hardwoods along the shoreline for fish habitat. Largemouth bass were abundant at 47 fish/hour. About 78% of the largemouth bass were less than 10 inches in length. However, about 11% of the largemouth bass were greater than 17 inches. Largemouth bass are the most commonly caught fish by anglers in Monson. Bluegill recorded catch in 1993 (3.4 fish/trapnet) was slightly above the historical average (2.0 fish/trapnet), but were well below normal for similar lakes. Stunted adult bluegill were stocked into Monson in 1990 and 1992, but it does not appear to have made a noticeable difference in population density. Walleye abundance was the highest recorded in 1993 at 11.0 fish/gillnet and above normal for similar lakes. The average size of walleye was 1.2 lbs. The best fishing for eating size walleye (13-18 inches) is from opening season to mid June. In September, larger walleye (>20 inches) are more frequently caught in Monson. The walleye population is a result of stocking with minimal to no contributions from natural reproduction. Black bullhead abundance greatly declined in 1993 (6.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (203.4 fish/gillnet). High walleye abundance combined with commercial fishing and fish eating birds (cormorants, pelicans) appear to have reduced black bullhead numbers. Northern pike abundance of 0.3 fish/gillnet was below normal for similar lakes. Also, black crappie abundance in 1993 was below normal for similar lakes.     Priority management should be focused toward working with area landowners to reduce nutrient inputs and implement better land use practices to halt water quality degradation. A swinging finger barrier may be pursued for the outlet to prevent carp immigration into the lake. If water levels drop, winterkill may become a problem thus a bubbler aerator will be needed. Otherwise, the lake must be managed as a \"boom and bust\" type fishery with walleye fry stockings and adult broodfish of other species to be stocked after winterkill. Other management activities on Monson include allowing commercial removal of black bullhead when they are over abundant, walleye fingerling stocking at 137 lbs every odd year, assessing yearling and young of year walleye by fall electrofishing every odd year, stocking quality size bluegill if necessary and available, assessing largemouth bass by spring electrofishing every two to three years, and conducting lake survey/assessments every five years. Once sufficient data is collected concerning the largemouth bass population in Monson, special regulations may be an option for maintaining a long term quality largemouth bass fishery if over exploitation is a problem.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Monson is a small, shallow lake located in Monson Lake State Park, Kandiyohi County. Thewater clarity was excellent on June 22, 1998. Aquatic vegetation densities were in 1998. Thewater quality was moderately productive. Water levels are currently high on Monson. Highwater has created flooded timber areas along the east shore and connected Monson to severalwetlands along the west and north shores. There are three small inlets that drain intoMonson. The outlet drains into a shallow lake (West Sunburg). There are no barriers for fishmovement during high water between Monson and West Sunburg. A variety of shoal watersubstrates (sand, gravel, detritus, rubble, boulder, muck, silt) are present in Monson. Theshoreline is mostly undeveloped hardwoods along the east and south shores with agriculturalrow crops along the west and north shores. Monson Lake State Park borders the east shoreline.The surrounding watershed is primarily a mix of agricultural row crops, woodlands, andmarshlands. A variety of fish spawning habitat is available in Monson for various species(northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, black bullhead).Minimal walleye natural reproduction was documented by fall night electrofishing in 1995 (7.1young of year \"YOY\"/hour, 6.9 inches). Walleye natural reproduction success in Monson isprobably sporadic with most spawning occurring along the gravel and rock shoal water pointareas.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 1998 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normalrange (0.75 - 3.75 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The 1998 walleye average length (17.1inches, gillnets and trapnets combined) was large and slightly above the Monson historicalaverage (16.4 inches). The 1998 walleye gillnet average weight was 2.44 lbs. The 1996 yearclass comprised 47% of the 1998 survey catch. The 1996 walleye year class was due solely togood natural reproduction. Walleye yearlings (93 fish) and fingerlings (8,821 fish) werestocked in 1995. In 1997, there were 3,975 walleye fingerlings stocked into Monson.     Northern pike were abundant in 1998 (7.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the Monsonhistorical average (2.17 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average size was 20.7 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets combined. Approximately 57% of the northern pike captured wereinfected with a parasite called neascus.     Largemouth bass were moderately abundant in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (26.0fish/hour). The 1998 largemouth bass average length (13.5 inches) and weight (2.18 lbs.) fromthe 1998 spring electrofishing survey was excellent. The largest bass captured during the1998 spring electrofishing survey was 18.2 inches.     Bluegill numbers were low in 1998 (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range (3.51- 57.13 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to the Monson historical average(1.99 fish/trapnet). The 1998 bluegill average length was large (6.6 inches). The largestbluegill captured was 7.8 inches. Poor bluegill natural reproduction (9.3 fish/seine haul,average length=1.1 inches) was documented in the 1998 shoreline seine hauls. Bluegill werestocked into Monson during 1990 (1,525 fish, 212 lbs.) and 1992 (9,426 fish, 1,014 lbs.) toboost population numbers.     Black crappie numbers were low in the 1998 gillnets (0.67 fish/gillnet). However, localanglers reported good winter fishing success for black crappie, thus our summer survey netsdid not accurately reflect the true population abundance in Monson. Yellow perch numbers weremoderately abundant in 1998 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the Monson historical average(3.60 fish/gillnet). The 1998 yellow perch average length was 8.0 inches (gillnets). Blackbullhead numbers were low in 1998 (15.00 fish/gillnet) compared to  the Monson historicalaverage (165.70 fish/gillnet). The 1998 black bullhead average length (10.1 inches, gillnetsand trapnets combined) was large. The largest black bullhead captured in the 1998 survey was15.0 inches.     Monson Lake offers a variety of fishing opportunities. In recent years, local anglershad good success for walleye, bluegill, northern pike, and black crappie. Bluegill numbershave been historically low in Monson even though adequate spawning habitat appears available.Largemouth bass numbers appear to be adequate, especially for fish greater than 15 inches.Walleye fingerling stocking is currently scheduled every odd year if natural reproduction islow or nonexistent during the potential stocking year. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office willcontinue to monitor adult fish population numbers by summer test netting every four years andwalleye natural reproduction every other year by fall night electrofishing in order toevaluate the effectiveness of current management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted during late June of 2010 in Monson Lake. Monson is a small sized (152 acres), moderately deep (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Residential development is limited to 3 homes and 1 recreational vehicle site along the south, north and west shore areas. The public access is located on the east side in the state park. The surrounding watershed is comprised of mostly agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland, grassland, pasture, and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small to moderate areas of wetlands, row crops, and grassland. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Monson. Nutrient levels were low to moderate (total phosphorus=0.028 ppm) during 2005 in Monson. There are three small sized inlets (northwest, northeast, and south shores) that flow into Monson. The outlet connects to West Sunburg Lake. Water levels have been high in Monson during recent years. Water clarity was fair (secchi= 3.3 feet) during June of 2010. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent vegetation is dense and diverse with northern milfoil, various pondweed species (flat-stem, curly-leaf, clasping-leaf, leafy, sago pondweed), coontail, water moss, and filamentous algae present in Monson. Emergent vegetation is also abundant and diverse consisting of various bulrush species, cattail species, duckweed species, burreed, arrowhead, and reed canary grass scattered throughout the bay, shoreline, and island areas. Monson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill. Walleye fingerlings or yearlings are generally stocked into Monson every other year.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (6.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Monson and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.41 fish/gillnet for Monson. The 2010 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.82 pounds and 22.86 inches) from gillnets.

Walleye growth rates for Monson were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2005 and 2003 walleye year classes comprised 33% and 28% respectively of the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults (200-450 pounds per stocking year) have been stocked into Monson during recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate in the 2010 spring electrofishing survey (40.91 fish/hour) and similar to the Monson historical average (41.68 fish/hour) and Spicer Area average catch rate (46.04 fish/hour).
