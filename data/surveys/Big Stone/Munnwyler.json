                "narrative": "<p>Munnwyler Lake is a 28 acre lake located near Ortonville, MN.  Like many lakes in the region, its depth increased substantially during the 1990s.  Munnwyler Lake was only 4 feet deep in 1972, whereas in 1998 its depth was 22.5 feet.     No gamefish were caught during the 1998 population assessment.  However, forage fish, including white sucker, fathead minnow, and brook stickleback were abundant.  The lack of suitable public access prohibits development of a recreational fishery.  No fisheries management activities are planned for Munnwyler Lake.</p>",
