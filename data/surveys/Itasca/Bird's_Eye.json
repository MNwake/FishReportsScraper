The Bird's Eye netting consisted of three trap nets set for a single night.  Data should be viewed cautiously given the limited amount of effort. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 bluegill were caught resulting in a catch of 5.0/ trap net.  Size structure was moderate as bluegill ranged from 4.8 to 8.4 inches in length.  The proportional stock density of individuals exceeding a quality size of 6 inches was 73 and the density of individuals exceeding the preferred size of 8 inches was 13.  Age analysis identified three year classes with most fish belonging to the 2007 year class.  Growth was faster than the lake class average with bluegill typically achieving 6 inches by age 4 and 7.5 inches by age 5.  Good angling opportunities for bluegill should exist in Birds Eye Lake, given the moderate size structure and good growth. <br> \n</p>",

There is not a lake management plan for the lake. Bluegill were sampled in the lake for the first time.  The trap-net catch was 2.3 fish/net which is below the 1st quartile of 5.7 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.2 to 8.4 inches with a mean length of 5.5 inches.  Bluegill have never been aged from Birdseye Lake.  Northern pike gill-net catches have increased from 5.3 fish/net in 1978 to 9.3 fish/net in 2002.  The 2002 catch rate exceeded the 3rd quartile of 8.7 fish/net for class 28 lakes.  Size structure was poor with all but one fish less than 19.0 inches.  Age and growth structures were not collected in 2002 but based on the high density and poor size structure, it is likely growth was slow.Walleye gill-net catches have been low in all three assessments; only one walleye was sampled in 2002, three in 1987, and two in 1978.  Walleye may move into the lake and inlet creek in the spring but during the late summer when these assessments were conducted, the walleye numbers have been low.Yellow perch gill-net catch rates have always fallen within the lake class median and 3rd quartile of 6.5 and 23.0 fish/net, respectively.  In 2002, the gill-net catch was 14.3 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 11.4 inches and had a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Yellow perch have never been aged.Other species sampled in 2002 included black bullhead, black crappie, bowfin, golden redhorse, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",
