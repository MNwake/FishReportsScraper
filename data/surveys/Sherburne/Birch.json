                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 151 acre lake located four miles northeast of the City of Big Lake in Sherburne County. It has a maximum depth of 18 feet and a small watershed. Land use in the watershed is primarily forest and wetlands. Birch has a history of winterkills, but winter aeration has been used in recent years to prevent winterkill. A public access is located on the west side of the lake. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. The last survey was in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating-leaf vegetation were widespread, primarily cattail and waterlilies. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed in 2019 but was abundant. Water clarity was moderate; Secchi depth was 7.0 feet on June 10. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 16 feet. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were the highest recorded and just above the expected range of values for lakes similar to Birch. Northern Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 32.1 inches with an average length and weight of 23.9 inches and 3.1 pounds. Nineteen percent of pike were 26 inches or longer and seven percent were 30 inches or more. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day-time electrofishing on May 23. The catch rate (58/hour) was well above 2004 results (21/hour), and above the Sauk Rapids average of 43/hour. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 21.7 inches with an average length of 12.5 inches. Forty-four percent of Largemouth Bass were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Walleye was sampled during the survey. Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2004 due to poor fry survival and low net catches after fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were above the expected range of values for similar lakes, but well below 2004 results. Bluegill were small; lengths ranged from 2.7 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches. Black Crappie numbers were within the expected range of values, but lower than 2004 results and the long term average. Black Crappie were small; lengths ranged from 4.5 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches. Only two percent of crappies were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included: Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye catch rate significantly increased from the 1989 fish assessment and reached normal levels for this lake type.  Walleye caught ranged in size from 16.2-22.3 inches and averaged 22.3 inches in length.   The average weight of walleye caught (2.2 pounds) also did not change significantly from the 1989 assessment and remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Birch Lake.  One to four year old walleye were caught and all fish corresponded to years when walleye fry were stocked.  Natural reproduction of walleye does not appear to occur in Birch Lake.  The growth rate of walleye was average when compared with other populations in the state.     The northern pike population did not change from the 1989 assessment and remained within normal levels for this lake type.  Northern pike caught ranged in size from 19.5-29.0 inches and averaged 22.7 inches in length.  The average weight of northern pike sampled was 2.5 pounds, which is in expected levels for this lake type.  One to six year old fish were caught with no dominant year class appearing.  The growth rate of pike was fast for one and two year old fish and average for three to six year old fish.     The catch of yellow perch in gill nets significantly decreased from the 1989 assessment.  Yellow perch sampled ranged in length from 4.5-5.6 inches and averaged 5.2 inches in length.  Two and four year old fish were the dominant year classes sampled and the growth rate of yellow perch was average.     The catch rate in trap nets of bluegill appeared to increase from the 1989 assessment and rose above expected levels for this lake type.  In addition, the trap net catch of pumpkinseed sunfish also appeared to increase and reached the highest level observed thus far.  Bluegill caught ranged in length from 3.0-7.3 inches and averaged 5.1 inches in length.  One to six year old fish were sampled and no dominant year class was observed.  The growth rate of bluegill was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets appeared to decline slightly from the 1989 assessment but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Black crappie caught ranged in size from 5.4-10.3 inches and averaged 7.2 inches in length.  Growth rate of black crappie were average and no dominant year class appeared in the sampling.     The largemouth bass population was assessed by spring electrofishing.  No bass were caught during this sampling, nor were any caught during the summer netting.  It appears form our sampling data that the largemouth bass population in Birch Lake is low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is relatively shallow, and is susceptible to winterkill.  A partial winterkill occurred most recently in 1997.  Adult bluegill, black crappie, and bass have been stocked since the most recent event, and walleye fry have been stocked five times.  Aeration equipment is now available to prevent future winterkill.  A re-survey was conducted in 2004 to assess the fish community now that populations have begun to recover.The northern pike catch rate in 2004 was higher than average for lakes similar to Birch.    Mean weight (2.6 pounds) was also above the median.  Growth rates appeared fast compared to state averages.Attempts at walleye fry stocking in recent years have only had minimal success.  A low number of walleye were sampled in 2004.  The mean length of all walleye sampled was 21 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled at relatively low numbers.  Previous surveys have also reported low perch abundance.  Perch sampled in 2004 were slow, and growth was slower than average.The largemouth bass population appeared to still be recovering from winterkill losses.  Bass were sampled at a rate of 21/hr (on-time) by electrofishing, less than half the median rate for lakes in this part of the state.  Nearly all of the fish sampled were less than 12 inches, and most were age 4 or younger.  As more of the population becomes mature, numbers are expected to increase.  In 1994, no bass were sampled by electrofishing, or during the summer netting.Black crappie abundance appeared high in 2004, although mean weight (0.18 pounds) was relatively low.  The sample was mostly comprised of age 2 and age 3 individuals.  Growth rates appeared similar to state averages.The catch rate of bluegill in 2004 was very high, but average size was low. Few bluegill were greater than 6.5 inches at the time of the survey, although size structure should improve in coming years.  As the bass population expands, the proportion of small bluegill may decrease.</p>",

A standard summer survey was completed in 1989 to update fisheries data last collected in 1984.\n\nManaged species sampled in gill nets included Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. \n\nNorthern Pike catch rate (3.8/lift) was similar to 1984 and the local median. Pike ranged in length from 19.2 - 32.7 inches. The modal length for pike was 23.0 - 23.9 inches and were primarily age four fish. Growth for females was good.\n\nYellow Perch abundance had increased significantly from 1984. Median length was 5.5 - 5.9 inches.\n\nManaged species sampled in trap nets included: Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Brown, Black, and Yellow Bullhead. \n\nBluegill numbers were similar to 1984 and well below the local median of 26.6/lift. Average length of Bluegill was 4.5 - 4.9 inches. \n\nThe most abundant bullhead was the Yellow Bullhead and the modal length group was 6.0 - 6.4 inches.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 151-acre lake located four miles northeast of the City of Big Lake in Sherburne County. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and a small watershed. The lake is shallow and has a history of periodic winterkills with the last occurrence in 1976-1977. A public access is located on the west side of the lake. A standard survey was completed in 1984 to update fisheries data last collected in 1978. \n\nWalleye abundance is just below the local median at 1.67/gill net. Ninety percent of the Walleye sampled were that of fry stocked following a winterkill in 1976-77. Walleye growth was good.\n\nNorthern Pike were sampled in average numbers compared to the local median (4.7/gill net). The population was primarily older fish age five to eight. \n\nBluegill were sampled in low numbers (2.2/trap net) relative to state and local medians. Almost the entire sample was comprised of age four fish and growth was good. Additionally, young-of-year Bluegill were sampled in good numbers during shoreline seining. \n\nBlack Crappie were eight times the local median for trap nets at 32.4/net. Black Crappie sampled were ages one to five with age two being the most dominant age class. Growth was good for all ages.\n\nCommon Carp abundance (6.2/trap net) has decreased since 1978 (18.0/trap net) and fish size has increased.\n\nBlack Bullhead abundance (46.0/trap net) has decreased since 1978 (87.7/trap net).\n\nOther species in the survey included: Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. \n</p>",
