                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu, located on the northern outskirts of Alexandria, is connected by navigable water to the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and offers a vast array of recreational opportunities.  Water quality is good with a mid-summer secchi reading of 7.0 feet.  Abundant vegetation can be found around the majority of the lake with hardstem bulrush stands located on Government Point and along the southeast shoreline.  A well defined weedline exists around the lake.  Protection of the aquatic vegetation is very important to preserving the water quality and quality fishery.A high quality, multi-species fishery exists on Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Walleye net catches and size structure are good with the fish averaging 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 28 inches.  Anglers have good luck fishing in-lake structure to the southwest of the northwest public access.  Very good success has been had in the fall by trolling floating Rapalas along Government Point at night.  These fish are also caught by shore anglers adjacent to the swim beach on the south side off highway 29.Northern pike are abundant and should be readily caught by trolling the weedlines.  Although the average size is 21 inches, a 35.5 incher was sampled.Panfishing opportunities are great on Lake Le Homme Dieu.   Bluegill numbers are extremely high and should provide excellent opportunities for young and old alike to partake.  The average size is on the small size (6 inches) but the numbers are present for some fast action.  Black crappie numbers are up with good average size.  Eighty-nine percent of the sampled fish were over 8 inches with the largest fish going 11 inches.  Summer and winter panfish angling can be excellent in the same locations. Target the weedlines along the south side of the Wharf Bay and on the flats out from Three Havens Store.Largemouth bass fishing can be phenomenal.  Bass are extremely abundant with a spring electrofishing survey resulting in a catch of 115 bass per hour.  This is a numbers lake with the average size of the fish going around 14 inches.  The weedlines around the lake are good producers as is the hump out from the northwest access.  Don't forget to try along the dropoff by the swimbeach on the southeast side.  The Chain is well known to the bass tournament circuit which holds several large tournaments here each year.Walleye were implanted with radio transmitters in 1996 to evaluate spawning activities and success in Lake Le Homme Dieu.  It was discovered that the majority of spawning activities occurred at inlet sites and in other lakes in the Chain.  Unfortunately, the primary spawning site was decimated by a new development.  As a result, the DNR and Lake Le Homme Dieu Association acquired the property and established an Aquatic Management Area (AMA) in order to protect this area from further degradation.  The DNR and Le Homme Dieu Association will be posting this AMA and attempting to restore the spawning site to its original level of productivity.The Alexandria Chain draws a diversity of recreational interests due to its navigable connection to over 6,000 acres of water.  From pleasure boating to jet and water skiing to swimming and angling.  If the fishing slows down at your hot spot, or you just feel adventurous, try exploring the scenery and fishing opportunities throughout the Chain. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1744-acre basin located on the northeast edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels.  The lake is very popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  A public swimming is located in the southeast corner of the lake off State Highway 29.   Much of the shoreline has been residentially developed.  The immediate watershed has seen a significant increase in residential development over the past decade.  Shoreland alterations and development activities in the immediate watershed have the potential to degrade water quality and fisheries habitat.  Thus far, water quality and clarity are considered good.  Secchi disk transparency averages about 9 feet during summer months.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.  Unfortunately, permit requests to remove aquatic vegetation have increased in recent years.  Lake Le Homme Dieu supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike are usually abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities.  The lake is well known to bass anglers.  The Alex chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments throughout the year. Panfishing can be good during both open water and ice fishing seasons.  Local anglers target Le Homme Dieu for early season crappie shortly after ice-out.       Walleye gill net catches averaged 5.2 fish/net in 2004, which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Age-2 and age-3 fish comprised 66% of the fish captured in gill nets.  Walleye of various sizes were stocked in 8 of 9 years between 1995 and 2003.  Natural reproduction is also known to occur.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1,800-acre basin located on the northeast city limit of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Navigable connections exist to Lake Carlos and Lake Geneva.  The shoreline and most of the watershed area are well developed.   Water quality is very good.  Water transparency measurements average 10 feet during summer months.  Because of its clear water and close proximity to Alexandria, the lake is popular with anglers and recreational boaters.  Boating pressure can be high on weekends during the summer.  Two well maintained accesses are available to the public.  Rotary Beach Access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 42.  Krueger's Creek Access is located along the northeast shoreline.  The City of Alexandria maintains a public swimming beach on the southeast shoreline.  Boaters should be cautious of marked navigation hazards on the lake.  A shallow rock bar is located in the middle of the lake off the west shoreline.  Shallow rock areas are also present off both points leading into the west bay (Bugaboo Bay).   <br> \n <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu offers diverse and quality fishing experiences.  Largemouth bass densities have decreased in recent years, but bass continue to be abundant.  Largemouth bass grow slowly due to their high abundance and intense competition for a limited food supply.  Fortunately they live for many years and with time can grow large.  Bass captured during the 2012 electrofishing survey averaged 11.3 inches in length.  The largest caught during the survey measured 16.8 inches.  Larger bass are commonly caught by tournament anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill density has also decreased with loss of very strong year classes established in the late-90s.  This temporary decrease in abundance has resulted in improved growth.  Even so, it takes a long time for bluegills to grow to 8.0 inches.  Those large bluegills are at least 12 years of age.  Average size of bluegills captured during the 2012 survey was 5.5 inches. <br> \nBlack crappies are presently abundant.  Age and size distribution of the 2012 population sample describe a quality fishery.  Eight age classes were documented in the gillnet catch.  Most crappies captured were relatively young fish, thus average size was 7.5 inches.  Due to the extended age distribution, 19% of all 5.0-inch and larger crappies measured exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  The largest crappie caught was 12.1 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches among the two most recent surveys have been lower than usual.  Gillnet catches averaged approximately 6.0 fish/net.  Lower abundance is desirable to improve predator/prey balance and productivity.  Average size of pike caught during the 2012 survey was 22.4 inches.  It is probable that the population sample under-represented numbers of larger pike.  Northern pike is a cool water gamefish with limited tolerance of water temperatures exceeding 70 F.  Lake Le Homme Dieu was thermally stratified at time of the August 2012 survey.  It is projected that many larger pike were in deeper, cool water near the thermocline at approximately 29 ft. in depth.  These fish were not very vulnerable to capture in gillnets.  The largest pike captured measured 31.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked every year to supplement natural reproduction and increase abundance and fishing success.  DNR stockings have been augmented with walleye fingerlings since 2007.  These additional walleye were purchased and stocked by the Lake Le Homme Dieu Association and Viking Sportsmen, Inc.   Gillnet catches during the 2012 survey averaged 8.6 walleyes/net.  This catch rate was greater than that of the preceding survey, but well within the range of expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Age distribution of the 2012 population sample was skewed towards young walleye, which suggests combined stockings have been successful in increasing numbers of small fish that may grow to a harvestable-size in the near future.  It is also probable that contributions of stocking were enhanced by low, stable northern pike numbers and a significant decrease of largemouth bass density.  Survival rate of young stocked walleye improved with less competition and predation.  Size distribution of captured walleye ranged from 7.5 to 23.3 inches and averaged 14.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu is not as fertile nor does it have as great a carrying capacity as many other lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Popular gamefishes such as bluegill, northern pike, and largemouth bass are abundant but they don't grow fast enough to optimize annual sustainable yields.  At present, Lake Le Homme Dieu is top heavy with predators.  Yellow perch abundance is too low to support high  numbers of larger bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Medium-size bluegills are too large to be consumed by most predators.  Due to slow growth, many young predators are lost to natural mortality before growing large enough to harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest surplus numbers of small- to medium-size bass, northern pike, and bluegills to improve predator/prey balance and productivity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels were discovered in Lake Le Homme Dieu in 2009.  They have since reproduced and colonized on aquatic plants and hard surfaces throughout the lake.  Zebra mussels filter green alge and nutrients from the water.  Their filtering of chlorophyll may result in an increase in water clarity.  Loss of primary productivity and reduced zooplankton abundance and diversity may also disrupt the food chain and diminish gamefish production.  Please comply with statewide regulation and practices to prevent spread of zebra mussels to un-infested waters. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1,744-acre basin located on the northeast edge of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and connected to Lake Carlos and Lake Geneva via navigable channels.  Residential development surrounds the entire lake.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Secchi disk transparency averages about 9.0 feet during summer months.  Because of it's clear water and close proximity to Alexandria, this lake is a very popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Boating pressure can be extremely high, especially on weekend days during summer months.  Because of its popularity, two relatively large public accesses are present.  Rotary Beach access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 42.  Krueger's Creek access is located along the northeast shoreline.  The City of Alexandria maintains a public swimming beach on the southeast shoreline.  Another popular beach area is located along the northwest shoreline adjacent to the connection to Lake Carlos.  Boaters should be cautious of marked navigation hazards on Lake Le Homme Dieu.  A shallow rock bar is located in the middle of the lake off the west shoreline.  Shallow rock areas are also present off both points leading to the west bay.  Two protected fish spawning areas are posted on Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Fishing in these areas is prohibited from April 1st through June 30th. <br> \n   <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu supports a well-balanced fish community and provides diverse angling opportunities.  The 2008 lake survey revealed a fish community typical of many bass-panfish lakes found throughout west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass are abundant and provide a very popular fishery.  In fact, the Alexandria Chain of Lakes is host to several bass tournaments throughout the year.  Although rare, bass anglers might also encounter smallmouth bass.  This species was first sampled in 2000 and continued presence is likely due to migration from connected basins.  Panfishing is also popular  during both open water and ice fishing seasons.  Anglers can expect good numbers of both black crappie and bluegill.  Larger crappie are relatively common, whereas most bluegill tend to be small.  Harvestable-size yellow perch are also present but abundance is low.  Northern pike are abundant.  Larger pike are present but \"hammer handles\" (i.e., small pike) comprise the majority of this population.  Walleye anglers can expect low to moderate numbers of harvestable-size fish.  Average size of 2008 gill net captures was 15.9 inches and 1.7 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the 2008 survey included the following: black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in improving fish community and predator/prey balance.  There are excess numbers of small largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill. Harvest is necessary to reduce competition for food and increase gamefish productivity. <br> \n</p>",

The Northern Pike age and length frequencies are well distributed and provide a quality fishery. Despite the high Northern Pike numbers, Yellow Perch are also abundant. Gillnet catches for Walleye are low which is contrary to angling reports. Inadequate sampling may be a problem. Bluegills are extremely abundant and are of a quality size. Rock Bass, Black and Yellow Bullheads are also present in large enough numbers an sizes to contribute to the creel. It appears the carp population has shifted from a population of small fish to a population of a few large fish. Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass are also present..</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A trap net survey was conducted on Lake Le Homme Dieu on August 2-5, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was near the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 22 lakes and the average length was 5.2 inches, with 4% over seven inches.  Bluegill, Northern Pike and Walleye comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.    <br> \n <br> \nThe fish data collected in this trap net survey were combined with data from an August 2020 gill net survey and July 2020 survey of nearshore fishes to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g.  Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g.  Black Bullhead and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.    <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides evidence that the fish community in Lake Le Homme Dieu is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1,800-acre basin located on the northeast city limits of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Navigable connections exist to Lake Carlos and Lake Geneva.  The shoreline and most of the watershed are well developed.  Water quality is good.  Water transparency was 11 feet during the 2020 survey.  Because of its clear water and close proximity to Alexandria, the lake is popular with anglers and recreational boaters.  Boating pressure can be high on weekends during the summer.  Two well-maintained accesses are available to the public.  The City of Alexandria maintains a public swimming beach on the southeast shoreline.  A public beach is also available on the northwest shoreline.  Boaters should be cautious of marked navigation hazards on the lake.  A shallow rock bar is located in the middle of the lake off the west shoreline.  Shallow rock areas are also present off both points leading into the west bay.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n\nLake Le Homme Dieu sustains a modest Walleye fishery, which is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings by the MN DNR and private user groups.  Gill net catches declined in 2020 to 2.0 Walleye/net.  Average size of Walleyes caught during the survey was 15.6 inches.  \n\nLake Le Homme Dieu supports abundant populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and moderate to high abundance of these fishes, growth rates can be slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Le Homme Dieu live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  An 8-inch Bluegill, which was the largest caught in the survey, may be 8 to 10 years old.  Few Black Crappie are caught during summer surveys since larger fish move off shore and are less vulnerable to capture.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect crappie abundance and size structure.  Lake Le Homme Dieu does support good crappie fishing.  Black Crappie over 12 inches have been caught in past surveys.  Largemouth Bass are abundant and have been shown to live up to at least 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  The largest bass caught during the 2020 survey was 17.9 inches in length.  The Alexandria Chain of Lakes is a popular destination for bass tournaments.  Many of the Northern Pike caught in this survey were smaller, but several fish over 30 inches were observed.  Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low.  Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. \n\nAdditional species sampled include hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Le Homme Dieu fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Le Homme Dieu was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Eurasian watermilfoil was also discovered in 2012.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species.\n</p>",

The one-year-olds correspond to a fry stocking and the three-year-olds correspond to a fingerling stocking. The two year olds are the result of natural reproduction and/or a natural run from another lake in the chain. The median weight of the walleye is low because of the numbers of young walleyes in the lake. It appears the 1984 survey did not adequately sample the walleye population. This was probably due to the time of the year and the severity of the weather during the 1984 survey. Northern Pike numbers have decreased since the 1984 survey. The decrease should benefit the Northern Pike fishery as the 1984 index was high. The Northern Pike population is well distributed on the length frequency sheet. Bluegills are extremely abundant and the average size is small. There are enough large Bluegills to provide a quality fishery if they can be found. The Yellow Perch population appears to be low. Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass also contribute to the sport fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet indices have increased to 10.9 fish/gillnet. This increase may be partly due to rescheduling the assessment to occur in August rather than June. Survey timing was changed after the 1984 survey. Mean size of the Walleyes sampled was 1.10 lbs. PSD has been relatively stable since the 1966 assessment with a high of 76.0 percent and a low of 44.0 percent. PSD was calculated at 53.0 percent in the 1989 assessment. Growth rate is good with age IV fish averaging 15.9 in. In total length. Despite not being completely vulnerable to gillnets, 44 walleye were age I. These fish probably stem from a fry stocking or natural reproduction. The 1987 year-class is likely natural reproduction. The strong 1986 year class may be the result of fingerling stockings or natural reproduction. Although the ljung slough Northern Pike spawning area is no longer used, the Northern Pike are obviously capable of adequate natural recruitment. Gillnet catches rates exceeded 9.0 fish/net. This catch is similar to previous surveys. Mean weight of the Northern Pike captured was 2.34 lbs. PSD was 43.0 percent growth rates of the Northern Pike are typical for the chain of lakes with age III Northern Pike averaging 19.1 in. In total length. Growth rates appear to increase after fish get through a bottleneck of 17-21 in. In length. Yellow Perch relative abundance has decreased dramatically since 1984/ twenty fish per gillnet were caught in 1984, as compared to only 0.8 fish/ gillnet in 1989. Bluegill abundance remains high. Over 65.0 fish/trapnet were captured in 1989. Structural indices show a shift in size distribution towards smaller fish. PSD exceeded 60.0 percent in 1966, 1979 and 1984 assessments, but dropped to 36.0 percent in 1989. This decrease in PSD could also be the result of shifting the survey time from June to August after the 1984 survey. Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass populations were not adequately sampled with the lake survey gear; however net catches and angling reports would indicate good populations. Largemouth Bass appear to grow quite slow. Age II bass averaged only 7.4 in. Black Crappies averaged 7.4 in. In total length at age III.</p>",

The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similarchemical and physical characteristics is 4.0 - 9.6 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996was 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike catches averaged 6.8 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range ofmean catch rates from similar lakes (3.0 - 7.9 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have ranged from 4.9 to14.3 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1984.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.1 pounds. Largemouth bass are abundant and provide quality angling opportunities.  Daytime, DC electrofishingyielded 83.5 stock-size fish per hour.  A similar catch rate was recorded in 1992.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 1.3 pounds.  Approximately 77% of the fish captured were 12 inches or greater and 18%exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches decreased from 66.7 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 11.0 fish/trapnet in1996.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 55.6 to 84.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1984. Despite the apparent decrease in abundance, size structure is unchanged.  Only 25% of the fish capturedwere 6.0 inches or greater.  The decrease in abundance is likely related to poor reproduction duringthe cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Cohorts of these year classes were poorly represented in the ageclass distribution.  Black crappie were not captured in adequate numbers to evaluate the population. Gillnet catches averaged 0.6 fish/net and trapnet catches averaged 0.2 fish/net.  Catches have neverexceeded 2.3 fish/net for either gear.  A MDNR Research Project investigating impacts of angler harveston black crappie and bluegill populations was completed in 1996.  Yellow perch catches averaged 1.9fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 5.4 fish/net in 1992 and 0.8 fish/net in 1989.  The normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 7.1 - 33.9 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish capturedwas 0.2 pounds.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Le Homme Dieu Lake was conducted on August 7-10, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eighteen sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due soft sediments and vegetation. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seventeen stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-four species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Pugnose Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured thirteen species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). Bluegill, Common Carp, and Bowfin comprised a majority of the biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nThese results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lake Le Homme Dieu was conducted on July 30-August 3, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 17 stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 25 species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net data from an August 2016 survey and gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coverage of submergent and emergent vegetation documented during the lake survey in 1992 is similar to the results from the aquatic vegetation survey completed as part of the 1979, despite extensive shoreline development around Lake Le Homme Dieu, emergent and submergent vegetation to provide ample habitat for the sportfish.  Walleye catches averaged 6.3 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes within lake classification 27 is 3.7 to 9.7 fish/gillnet.  Catch rates have ranged from 1.3 to 10.9 fish/gillnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The highest catch rate (10.9 fish/gillnet) was recorded during the 1989 population assessment.  A long range goal of 10 fish/gillnet is stated in the lake management plan.  The mean weight of Walleye captured in gillnets was 1.2 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 37.9% and 5.2%, respectively.  The population was dominated by fish ages 2 through 4.  Cohorts of these year classes comprised 80% of the fish captured.  Both fry and fingerling stockings appear to have been successful.  There is also evidence of natural reproduction.  The back-calculated mean growth rate of Walleye ages 1-4 is poor, however growth rates improve after age 5. Age 3 fish average 11.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The abundance of younger fish classes is likely suppressing growth. Daytime, ac electrofishing yielded an average of 77.3 stock-size Largemouth Bass per hour.  Sub-stock CPUE averaged 6.7 fish per hour.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 53.4% and 13.8%, respectively.  The catch rate and size structure recorded during the electrofishing sampling exceed the long range goals for the Largemouth Bass population established in the lake management plan.  The large number of bass fishing tournaments held on the chain of lakes and the reported catches of Largemouth Bass from Lake Le Homme Dieu attest to the quality of the Largemouth Bass population. Growth of Largemouth Bass in Lake Le Homme Dieu is less than the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass in other area lakes within lake class 27, but similar to the growth rate observed for other lakes within the Alex Chain.  Age 5 fish average 12.9 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Northern Pike catches declined from 9.1 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 4.9 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lake class 27 is 3.1 to 8.4 fish/ gillnet.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.8 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 51.0% and 16.3% in 1992, compared to PSD and RSD-P values of 42.8% and 4.4% in 1989.  Northern Pike growth in Lake Le Homme Dieu is similar to mean growth of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 27. Age 7 fish average 28.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The lake management plan prepared after the 1989 survey suggested that revising the daily bag limit from three to six fish may be warranted to reduce density and improve the size structure of the Northern Pike population. However, low water levels during the late 1980's and 1990 in addition to blocking the Northern Pike spawning runs at Krueger's and ljung's sloughs appears to have produced the desired shift in the Northern Pike population.  Bluegill catches averaged 66.7 fish/ trapnet in 1992.  This CPUE value is almost identical to the catch rate of 65.3 fish/trapnet recorded in 1989.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes within lake class 27 is 3.3 to 52.9 fish/trapnet.  PSD declined from 36.0% in 1989 to 25.1% in 1992.  There were no fish captured during the two most recent surveys that exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  Gillnet CPUE averaged 28.6 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates (0.9 to 7.9 fish/net) for lakes within lake class 27.  PSD of fish captured in gillnets was estimated at 39.3%. Other lakes within the Alex Chain also experienced high catch rates in gillnets.  Bluegill growth is poor, similar to other lakes within the Alex Chain.  Age 5 fish average 5.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Size specific harvest may be limiting the number of large Bluegill (over 8.0 inches).  Lake Le Homme Dieu has been chosen as a study lake in a Minnesota DNR research project to determine the effects of angler harvest on Bluegill size structure. Yep CPUE averaged 5.4 fish/gillnet which is below the normal range of 8.2 to 49.3 fish/gillnet for lake class 27 and below the long range goal of 15.0 fish/gillnet stated in the lake management plan.  Yep catch rates had declined steadily from 33.8 fish/net in 1979 to 0.8 fish/net in 1989. Predator densities reached a maximum in 1989 when Walleye and Northern Pike catch rates averaged 10.9 and 9.1 fish/gillnet, respectively.  The yep population was dominated by small individuals in 1992.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds and PSD was calculated at 1.9% Black Crappie were not captured in sufficient numbers to evaluate the population. Gillnet CPUE averaged 0.7 fish/net and no fish were captured in trapnets.  Catch rates never exceeded 2.5 fish/trapnet in previous surveys. Angling success for Black Crappie appears to be good. Angling pressure is especially high during late winter and early spring after ice out.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1,800-acre basin located on the northeast city limit of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Navigable connections exist to Lake Carlos and Lake Geneva.  The shoreline and most of the watershed are well developed. Water quality is good.  Water transparency was 16 feet during the 2016 survey.  Because of its clear water and close proximity to Alexandria, the lake is popular with anglers and recreational boaters.  Boating pressure can be high on weekends during the summer.  Two well-maintained accesses are available to the public.  Rotary Beach Access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 42.  Krueger's Creek Access is located along the northeast shoreline.  The City of Alexandria maintains a public swimming beach on the southeast shoreline.  Boaters should be cautious of marked navigation hazards on the lake.  A shallow rock bar is located in the middle of the lake off the west shoreline.  Shallow rock areas are also present off both points leading into the west bay (Bugaboo Bay). <br> \n <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu sustains a modest Walleye fishery, which is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings by the DNR and a cooperative arrangement by the Lake Le Homme Dieu Association and Vikings Sportsmen Club, Inc.  Gill net catch rates declined in 2016 to 2.9 Walleye/net.  Average size of Walleyes caught during the survey was 16.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and moderate to high abundance of these fishes, growth rates can be slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Le Homme Dieu live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  Seventy percent of the Largemouth Bass surveyed during the spring were 12.0 inches or longer.  Some were estimated to be up to 17 years old.  An 8.0-inch Bluegill may be 10 years old.  Few Black Crappie are caught during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size.  Lake Le Homme Dieu does support good crappie fishing.  Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Le Homme Dieu fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Le Homme Dieu was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Eurasian watermilfoil was also discovered in 2012.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n</p>",
