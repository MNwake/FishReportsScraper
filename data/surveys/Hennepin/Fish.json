GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE THROUGH AGE THREE, AVERAGE FOR AGE FOUR, AND BELOW AVERAGE AFTER THAT.  YEP WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 2.9 AND 1.9 TIMES THE GILLNET LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN TRAPNETS, YEP WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  LMB WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SEINE HAULS, WITH 17 YOY AND FOUR OTHERS CAPTURED.  ELECTROFISHING SAMPLED AN ADDITIONAL 41 LMB, WITH A CATCH RATE OF 18.2 FISH PER HOUR. FISH RANGED IN AGE FROM 1-5, WITH OVER HALF AGE 1. GROWTH WAS AVERAGE FOR THE SPECIES.  YEB WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS AND 2.9 TIMES THE GILLNET LOCAL MEDIAN. WTS WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS EQUAL TO THE GILLNET LOCAL MEDIAN AND TWICE THE TRAPNET LOCAL MEDIAN. BOF,CARP, AND HSF WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS ABOVE THE TRAPNET LOCAL MEDIAN, BUT WERE NOT SAMPLED IN GILLNETS.  PMK WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS BELOW THE GILL AND TRAP NET LOCAL MEDIANS.  GSF, WERE SAMPLED ONLY IN TRAPNETS, IN NUMBERS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled during the 1997 survey. When compared to similar lakes, the bluegill population is considered above average in abundance. The average length of bluegills measured was 5.5 inches. Only 25% exceeded 6 inches. Other sunfish species sampled were pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish. The average lengths of these three species was less than that of the bluegills.Both black and white crappies were sampled in Fish Lake. Black crappies were found in normal ranges for this type of lake. White crappies were not as abundant as black crappies, but were still within normal ranges. Neither species average length exceeded 8.0 inches. A total of 4 walleyes were caught during the survey. The ages of these fish did not correspond with the DNR stocking records, and therefore came from an outside source. The average length of the four walleyes was 21.5 inches.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers for this type of lake. The average size of pike in Fish Lake was found to be 21.2 inches long and weighed 2.3 pounds. The largest northern pike caught was 30.2 inches in length, and 22% of the pike sampled were larger than 25 inches. Largemouth bass were also sampled during the survey but not in abundant numbers. The types of gear used do not effectively catch large numbers of bass. The largest individual captured was 16.5 inches in length. Anglers have reported the lake has a good largemouth bass population. Yellow perch and white suckers were both sampled in normal ranges. Both species provide a good forage base for the high northern pike population. Young of the year yellow perch were moderately abundant in the sein hauls. Only two golden shiners were sampled during the survey.Carp numbers are still within the normal range, but have dropped slightly since 1992. The bowfin (dogfish) population has increased since 1992 and is three times higher than similar types of lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a productive, 223-acre lake located in Maple Grove, Hennepin County.  Public access is obtained through the Fish Lake Regional Park on the south shore.  The park, which provides a concrete boat ramp and parking lot, is operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  A pass is required to park boat trailers at the boat launch. <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth is 33 feet and water clarity in mid-July was 8.0 feet.  At this time, the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 14 feet.  The water level was high due to record June rainfall.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately low in abundance at 2.7/gill net, which is below the median when compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Common in lakes with low pike density, average size was relatively large at 26.8 inches and 4.7 lbs; ranging from 21.5 to 35.0 inches.  Sixteen pike were sampled; 6 were 28 inches or longer (37.5%) and 3 were 30 inches or longer (18.8%).   <br> \n <br> \nDespite the lowest catch since the 1972 survey, Bluegill were still moderately high in abundance (35.1/trap net) when compared to other similar lakes.  Bluegill numbers in Fish Lake have varied considerably over time, ranging from 3.3 to 126.8/net.  In the 2014 survey, size structure was small where Bluegill averaged 6.2 inches and 0.16 lbs with the largest measuring 7.4 inches. Seventy-two percent were longer than 6 inches, but only 5% were 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have always maintained a low to moderate abundance in Fish Lake. In 2014, abundance was considered low (3.3/gill net), although mean weight (0.21 lbs) was near the median (0.20 lbs) compared to other similar lakes.  Not many Black Crappie grew to a favorable size; 90% were between 7 and 8 inches and the largest was 8.4 inches.   <br> \n  <br> \nFew Yellow Perch were netted in the survey.  Abundance has been sporadic over time and has ranged from 0 to 15.0/ gill net since 1987.  The 2014 catch of 0.83/net is low and considerably lower than the 12.3/net found in 2009.  The 5 perch sampled averaged 7.1 inches and 0.17 lbs.      <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the numbers from the 2014 assessment are not necessarily representative of the entire population.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.  Though, anecdotal evidence suggests a quality Largemouth Bass population may exist in Fish Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, White sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n1,872 Walleye fingerlings were stocked by permit to the Fish Lake Area Residents' Association in October 2013; none of these were sampled during the 2014 survey. Often, even if survival is good, walleye aren't sampled well until they're at least 3 years old.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a productive, 223-acre lake located in Maple Grove.  Public access is obtained through the Fish Lake Regional Park on the south shore of the lake.  The park, which provides a concrete boat ramp and parking lot, is operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  A pass is required to park boat trailers at the boat launch from April 1 through November 30.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill relative abundance has historically been high in Fish Lake; however mean size has been small.  Over the previous 6 assessments, dating back to 1977, catch has averaged 111.3/trap net and mean weight has averaged 0.11 lbs.  In 2009, catch was moderately high at 48.2 /trap net and mean weight was moderately low at 0.15 lbs.  Mean length of bluegill was 5.9 inches, 61% were 6 inches or larger, 2% were 7 inches or larger, and the largest measured was 7.4 inches and 0.24 lbs.  Growth was slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area as bluegill were 3.9 inches at age 3.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie relative abundance has historically been low with the exception of the occasional strong year class that contributes to the fishery.  In the 2009 assessment, both gill-net (3.5/net) and trap-net (1.8/net) catches were moderately low and low, respectively.  The 2006 year class was relatively strong, where 45% of sampled black crappie were age 3.  Growth was slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area as crappie were 6.3 inches at age 3.  Only four year classes were sampled; ages 1 through 4.  Mean length and weight from both gear types was 6.8 inches and 0.15 lbs.  The largest measured was 8.9 inches and 0.36 pounds, and only 5% were 8 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch relative abundance in gill nets has been rather inconsistent over the previous 6 assessments.  No perch were sampled in the previous survey in 2003; however catches were moderate in 1997 and 1992, then were low in 1987 and 1982, then perch were absent in 1977.  Currently, yellow perch are moderately abundant in Fish Lake (12.3/gill net).  Mean size has not fluctuated to the degree that abundance has.  The average weight of a yellow perch since 1982 has been 0.11 lbs, ranging from 0.09-0.13 lbs.  In 2009, the average size was 6.4 inches and 0.13 pounds, with the largest measuring 7.8 inches and 0.19 lbs.  Two percent were 8 inches or greater.  Growth was slower than average compared to similar lakes in the West Metro Area as yellow perch were 4.9 inches at age 3. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike relative abundance was moderately high (5.7/gill net); however the catch rate was the lowest it has been since 1977 (mean over the previous 6 assessments = 8.3/net).  Conversely, in 2009, average size of northern pike was the highest on record at 26.5 inches and 4.26 lbs, the largest measuring 33.9 inches (mean over the previous 6 assessments = 3.48 lbs, range=1.50-3.96 lbs).  All northern pike sampled were 21 inches and longer, and 21% were 28 inches or longer.  Growth was slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area as pike were 12.9 inches at age 3.  <br> \n <br> \nFive largemouth bass were sampled (mean length  and weight, 13.9 inches and 1.85 lbs), however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected in lesser abundance were white sucker, bowfin, common carp, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white crappie, and black, brown, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 238-acre lake with a maximum depth of 49 feet. Fish is located in Maple Grove, in northern Hennepin County. Three Rivers Park District owns and maintains a public access ramp (subject to Three Rivers Park District rules and hours) located off of Bass Lake Road on the south shore of the lake. Fish is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, but includes catchable populations of Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Privately purchased Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in odd-numbered years since 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing) was conducted on Fish Lake during the week of 7/15/2019 to assess the fishery. Fish Lake had moderate water clarity, measured at 5 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 14 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil was found in Fish Lake in 1995 and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (9.5/net) -- above the expected cate rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 57 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 25.5 inches and the largest measured at 34.5 inches. Northern Pike are maintaining a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Growth was fast compared to the statewide average, indicated by an average length of 22.3 inches by age 4. Despite high numbers, Fish Lake is one of few lakes in the metro that has the potential to produce Northern Pike greater than 34\"+ and should provide excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2019 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the second time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were high, with 49.3 fish/hour. 82 total bass were sampled, with an average length of 11.4 inches and the largest measured at 19.7 inches. Despite a lack of the largest individuals (20\"+), Fish Lake supports a healthy bass fishery with over 45% of the total catch greater than 12 inches. Results from the 2019 survey show significant increases in numbers and sizes from the previous nighttime electrofishing survey in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Fish Lake were sampled with gill nets (2.0/net) near the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 12 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 14.5 inches and a maximum length of 21.3 inches. Walleye growth in Fish was typical compared to the statewide average, indicated by an average length of 16.3 inches by age 4. Privately stocked Walleye have created a low-abundance fishery - a typical result for regional lakes with abundant Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass -- with all three of the previous stockings (2013, 2015, and 2017) present in age analysis. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (68.7/net), above the expected cate rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 618 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 6.4 inches and the largest measured at 8.2 inches. High numbers of Bluegill likely limit growth potential, creating a population mainly composed of small individuals. Less than 15% of Bluegill sampled were greater than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (3.5/net) and trap nets (1.1/net). There were 31 Black Crappie sampled during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 7.0 inches and the largest measured at 10.2 inches. Despite low numbers, growth is likely above average based on the presence of 10\"+ fish in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 223 acre lake in Maple Grove, Minnesota.  The lake is nutrient rich, resulting in a turbid, green color during summertime.  At the time of the survey in mid-July, the lake lacked oxygen below 13 feet, limiting fish shallower waters.  Eurasian water milfoil was first discovered here in 1993, and quickly became the dominant aquatic plant. Northern pike and largemouth bass are the primary management species.Northern pike averaged 11.3 per gill net.  Catch per net has exceeded 10 per net only twice in 7 previous surveys.  The upper end of the range that is typical lakes of this type is 7.3 per net.  This survey found a mean weight was 3.2 pounds, which is also near the upper end typically found in similar lakes (3.5 pounds).  The largest pike measured just under 34 inches.  This is consistent with previous surveys, which have all found pike size to be above average, and highlights the ability of Fish Lake to grow quality-sized northern pike.  Good growth rates and large average size are likely related to the prevalence of small panfish that serve as forage for smaller pike, as well as a modest population of white suckers and black bullhead that are good prey for larger individuals.Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on the evening of May 22, 2003.  A total of 19 fish were captured (20.6 per hour).  The catch is similar to the area average (23 fish per hour) for spring electrofishing.  Mean length was 12.1 inches, and 16% of the sample exceeded 15 inches.  The largest fish measured 17.5 inches.  These results suggest that Fish Lake has an average density of largemouth bass with decent size, but the lack of fish over 18 inches suggests that the lake may not have potential as a trophy fishery.Bluegill averaged 110.7 per net in 2003, well above the upper end of the range typically seen in similar lakes (62.5).  Bluegill catches have been in the vicinity of 100 per net in the majority of surveys on Fish Lake.  As is typical in situations where bluegill are highly abundant, the mean size was small (4.8 inches).  Less than 1% of the sample exceeded 7 inches.  Condition of bluegill sampled was poor, with a prevalence of skeletal anomalies that may be related to a poor diet.Black crappie reached the highest catch seen in Fish Lake, averaging 15.0 per net.  The previous high was 9.5 per net in 1982.  Aging of the sample revealed that a strong year class from 2001 (77% of the sample) was responsible for the increase.  That year class averaged 5.7 inches at capture, resulting in a mean size for the sample as a whole of only 6.0 inches.  However, crappie from 5 other year classes were sampled, with the 1999 class occurring in decent numbers (12% of sample).  Overall, 10% of the sample exceeded 8 inches.  The largest measured 12.7 inches.Black bullhead catch in 2003 was the highest found on Fish Lake, at 14.0 per net.  However, this is barely above the average for this lake type (10.5 per net).  Yellow bullhead averaged 3.8 per net.Also captured in low numbers in this survey were bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, common carp, yellow perch, and 3 turtle species.</p>",
