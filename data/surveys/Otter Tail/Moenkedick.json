Eighty percent of the pike were greater than 26.0 inches in length with an average individual weight of 4.6 pounds.  Northern pike natural reproduction appears to be limited, which is probably due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.   <br> \n     None of the bullhead species were sampled in this survey.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is relatively high with a trap net catch rate of 100.7 per net.  No bluegills 7.0 inches or greater in length were sampled and growth rates are slower than statewide averages with a mean length at age-V of 5.3 inches.   <br> \n     The largemouth bass trap net catch rate was also relatively high at 11.7 per net.  Size structure of largemouth bass appears good, with 38% of the sample 12.0 inches or greater in length.  Bass recruitment is excellent as five consecutive year classes were represented in the sample.  Growth rates approximate statewide averages with a mean length at age-IV of 11.7 inches.   <br> \n     The trap net catch rate of black crappie was 2.3 per net.  Black crappie reproduction appears to be inconsistent as the entire sample correlated to the 1988 year class. Crappie growth rates are above average in comparison to statewide averages with a mean length at age-IV of 9.0 inches.   <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of yellow perch was 20.5 per net with 95% of the sample between 6.0 and 8.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     One walleye weighing 4.8 pounds was sampled. <br> \n</p>",
