In this assessment, trapnetted bluegills were caught atnormal rates for this type of lake, averaged 6.5 inches long and ranged up to 8.7 inches long.Growth rates were normal and 5, 6 and 7 year old fish were well represented. As these fish growin the next couple of years, the number of larger bluegills should increase and provide qualityangling for a few years. Black crappies were also caught at normal rates for this type of lake. The 1988 year class wasstrong and the fish were mostly between 7.0 and 8.5 inches long. The other year classes wereonly moderately represented in the net catches. The largest black crappie sampled was only 8.7inches long. Slow growth of larger black crappies will hinder the growth of this abundant yearclass into preferable size. The gillnet catch index for northern pike was low for lakes of this type, as it has been inpast surveys. Northern pike grow fast enough to produce an occasional memorable fish. One 34.6inch northern pike was caught in the trap net. Any increases in northern pike abundance wouldreduce growth and decrease the potential to produce larger northern pike.Largemouth bass were not well represented in this survey. The 1991 electrofishing effortsdocumented that Bear Lake can produce memorable-sized bass in addition to a fair abundance ofbass over 12 inches long. Forage may be limited at times by year class failures in both thebluegill and black crappie populations. The seining conducted during this assessment collectedan abundance of young-of-year largemouth bass and young-of-year bluegills, but no minnows.Largemouth bass recruitment probably fluctuates, partially in response to a fluctuating preybase for young-of-year largemouth bass.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake offers anglers a variety of species to fish for such as, bluegill, northern pike, black crappie and largemouth bass. Bluegill dominated the trap net catches in the 2004 survey with a catch rate of 20 fish per trap net, which is slightly above average for this type of lake. The mean length of bluegill was nearly 6 inches and individuals up to 8.5 inches were sampled. Fifteen percent of all bluegill caught in the trap nets were 7 inches or larger. Good year classes produced from 1998 through 2000 should provide some decent bluegill fishing for the next few years.Black crappie abundance has remained stable over the years and was above the 50% quartile for this lake class for both gillnet and trap net catches.  Black crappie growth was slow in Bear Lake and therefore individual fish seldom reach large size. The largest crappie caught in 2004 was 12.1 inches long, however only 10% (6 of 56) were over 8 inches in length. Historically, northern pike net catches have been low in bear lake and remained low again in the 2004 survey at 1.8 fish per gillnet, which is below the first quartile for lake class 21.  Although northern pike numbers remain low in Bear Lake, there is a good chance of catching a quality size fish.  The average size was nearly 26 inches and the largest individual caught was 32.5 inches, a reasonable number for a lake this size.Largemouth bass are present in the Bear Lake fishery but were not well represented in the 2004 survey due to sampling gear limitations.  One individual bass was sampled which was 15.9 inches long. An electrofishing survey conducted in the early 1990?s did reveal fair numbers of bass greater than 12 inches.  Recruitment is likely variable dependent on available forage and environmental conditions.  Historical reports have documented the presence of an occasional trophy bass.</p>",
