THE TOTAL BLB CATCH WAS COMPOSED OF 47% FISH LESS THAN 6.0 INCHES IN 1992, 0% IN 1987, AND 48% IN 1984.  CCF WERE FIRST CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS IN 1992 (3.33 PER GN, 5.19 LBS PER GN). PREVIOUSLY, CCF HAS BEEN CAUGHT ONLY IN THE TRAPNETS OF THE 1987 SURVEY.  YEARLING CCF WERE STOCKED INTO SCHOOL GROVE IN 1989 AND 1986.  MUE WERE STOCKED INTO SCHOOL GROVE IN 1985.  MUE WERE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPNETS OF THE 1987 SURVEY, BUT WERE NOT CAPTURED IN THE 1992 SURVEY.  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (0.11 PER TN, 0.06 LBS PER TN) WAS BELOW THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX, AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE INDEX (17.32 PER TN, 5.45 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 BLC TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (4.56 PER TN, 2.53 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX, BUT ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE INDEX (3.30 PER TN, 1.32 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 BLC GILLNET CATCH INDEX (0.33 PER GN, 0.02 LBS PER GN) WAS BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO BOTH THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX AND THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE INDEX (0.65 PER GN, 0.21 PER GN).  BLC GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES COMPARED TO LOCAL LAKES.  THE 1992 WAE CATCH INDEX (40.00 PER GN, 95.25 LBS PER GN, 15.22 PER TN, 42.12 LBS PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 43 INDEX AND THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE INDEX (21.89 PER GN, 47.02 LBS PER GN; 6.63 PER TN, 17.55 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 WAE GILLNET CATCH INDEX IN SCHOOL GROVE LAKE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RECORDED VALUES FOR A LAKE IN THE SPICER FISHERIES AREA.  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF WAE CAUGHT WAS 2.38 LBS FROM THE GILLNETS AND 2.77 LBS FROM THE TRAPNETS IN THE 1992 SURVEY.  THE WAE PSD WAS 100 IN 1992, 60 IN 1987, AND 51 IN 1984 (PSD HISTORICAL AVERAGE=70).  THE 1992 PSD VALUE WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-60) OF A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE RSD-P WAS 10 IN 1992, 45 IN 1987, AND 5 IN 1984 (RSD-P HISTORICAL AVERAGE=20). TAPEWORMS WERE PRESENT IN THE GILLS OF 29 OF 257 WAE CAUGHT IN 1992 SURVEY.  WAE GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-2 BUT BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 3-11 COMPARED TO LOCAL LAKES.  SCHOOL GROVE LAKE HAS NOT WINTER KILLED SINCE THE AERATION SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN THE 1984-1985 WINTER.  PERIODIC WINTER KILLS (EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS) OFTEN STIMULATES GROWTH OF FISH (FORAGE AND PREDATORS) THE YEAR FOLLOWING A WINTER KILL.   HOWEVER, PARTIAL WINTER KILLS USUALLY FAVOR THE DOMINANCE OF FISH SPECIES SUCH AS BLB WHICH CAN TOLERATE LOWER DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS THAN SPECIES LIKE WAE.  WAE FRY ARE STOCKED EVERY OTHER YEAR INTO SCHOOL GROVE LAKE.  THE DOMINANT WAE YEAR CLASS WAS FROM A FRY STOCKING IN 1986.  NO STRONG YEAR CLASSES ARE APPARENT AFTER 1986.  THERE APPEARS TO BE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF PREDATORS (CCF, WAE, BLB) AND AN ABSENCE OF A SUFFICIENT FORAGE BASE (YEP, PANFISH) TO OPTIMALLY SUPPORT A BALANCED WAE POPULATION FOR A LONG TIME PERIOD.  ALTHOUGH, SMALL BLBS MAY PROVIDE A LARGE FORAGE BASE FOR WAE AND CATFISH, IT APPEARS THAT OPTIMAL GROWTH RATES FOR WAE ARE NOT OBTAINED WHEN BLB IS THE PRIMARY FORAGE SPECIES.  IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE BLB POPULATION MAY HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY ABUNDANT PREDATOR POPULATIONS, HOWEVER, THE INCREASE OF SMALL BLH IN 1992 MAY SIGNAL THE RETURNED DOMINANCE OF BLH IN SCHOOL GROVE LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of School Grove Lake was conducted during early July of 2002. School Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. An aeration system (surface aerators) was installed in 1984-85 and operated to prevent the winterkill of gamefish. Winter oxygen levels have been good the last several years with minimal use required of the aeration system. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into School Grove during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. Nutrient levels were high in School Grove during 2002. Water levels in the early 2002 spring were normal, but below normal during the resurvey due to drought like conditions. Submergent vegetation densities and species (sago pondweed, filamentous algae, and water moss) were limited in School Grove during the 2002 summer. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cane, cattails) densities were rare to common adjacent to shoreline areas in 2002. Water clarity was poor during the 2002 resurvey. Intense blue-green algae blooms were present in School Grove during the late summer and early fall of 2002. Residential development is limited to three farm sites, 2 lake homes, and 1 cabin along or near the School Grove shoreline. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2002 (5.0 fish/gillnet), but the highest historical recorded value for School Grove. The 2002 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.20 lbs. and 7.35 inches) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.7 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Yellow perch growth rates fast in School Grove for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. Approximately 72% of the yellow perch captured in the 2002 resurvey were hatched in 2000.Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2002 (51.8 fish/trapnet) and the highest recorded value for School Grove. The 2002 black crappie average size was small (0.10 lbs. and 5.0 inches) from trapnets. The largest black crappie captured was 11.9 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Black crappie growth rates above the normal ranges for ages 1-4 in School Grove compared to area lakes. Approximately 96% of the black crappie captured in the 2002 resurvey were hatched in 2001.Channel catfish numbers were moderate in 2002 (3.0 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average catch rate (1.7 fish/gillnet) for School Grove. The 2002 channel catfish average size was small (1.08 lbs. and 13.7 inches) from gillnets. The largest channel catfish captured was 16.3 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Channel catfish yearlings (4,332 fish) were last stocked into School Grove during 2000. Walleye numbers were moderate to abundant in 2002 (10.7 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (18.3 fish/gillnet) for School Grove. The 2002 walleye average size was moderate (1.58 lbs. and 16.1 inches) from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 18.4 inches in the 2002 resurvey. Walleye growth rates were below the normal ranges for ages 1-6 in School Grove compared to area lakes. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was high (8.7 fish/gillnet) in School Grove during 2002. Walleye natural reproduction in School Grove is generally insignificant; however there were moderate numbers represented from a non-stocked year (1999) in the 2002 resurvey catch. School Grove was stocked with 238,320 walleye fry in the spring of 2002. The 2002 walleye fry stocking was moderately successful based on results of the 2002 fall electrofishing survey (60.0 fish/hour, 6.0 inches average length). Prolonged cold and cloudy weather during May and early June of 2002 limited forage (zooplankton) production, which contributed to poor walleye fry survival in most other area lakes.Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2002 (236.1 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average catch rate (258.7 fish/trapnet) in School Grove. The 2002 black bullhead average length was large (9.1 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. The largest black bullhead capture was 10.6 inches in the 2002 resurvey.Carp numbers were abundant in 2002 (39.3 fish/gillnet) and the highest recorded value for School Grove. The 2002 carp average size was small (0.25 lbs. and 7.6 inches) from gillnets. The largest carp captured was 27.5 inches in the 2002 resurvey.Less desirable sunfish species captured in 2002 resurvey included low numbers of orangespotted sunfish (0.4 fish/trapnet) and green sunfish (0.4 fish/trapnet). The 2002 orangespotted sunfish and green sunfish average lengths were small (3.4 inches and 4.9 inches respectively). Bluegill were not captured in 2002 resurvey. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 8.7 fish/trapnet. Bluegill adults (860 fish) were last stocked into School Grove during 1996.Current fish management activities on School Grove include assisting the Cottonwood Sportsman's Club in the operation of the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, stocking walleye fry every other year, and stocking other species as needed. The School Grove Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted during June 21, 2016 on School Grove Lake. One measure of a lake's health is the community of fish, plants and aquatic life it sustains. Certain species can't survive without clean water and a healthy habitat while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions. Examples of fish that require clean water are Tullibee, Rock Bass, and Bluegill. Species that are tolerant to degraded habitat are Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish. The more intolerant fish to degraded habitat you have in the sample, the higher the score will be. An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSchool Grove is a small (349 acres), productive, aerated and shallow (11 feet maximum) lake with low submergent vegetation located in Lyon County. A significant winterkill last occurred during February of 2010. Seine hauls were conducted at 5 IBI stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. A 15 foot wide and 1/8 inch bar mesh bag seine was used at 5 IBI stations. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 10 IBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 10 IBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 7 different fish species (4 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 6 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Walleye), panfish (Green Sunfish), large non-gamefish (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead) and small non-gamefish (Orangespotted Sunfish, Johnny Darter and Fathead Minnow). Young of year species captured included Walleye and Black Bullhead in seine hauls. Fish species captured only from electrofishing included Green Sunfish. The few fish species captured in School Grove is indicative of species present in shallow and winterkill susceptible Spicer Area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>School Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. A population assessment of School Grove was conducted during late June of 2007 for the fish population. Water quality and clarity conditions are often poor in School Grove due to agricultural runoff. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid summer. Water clarity was poor (1.8 feet) on June 29, 2007. School Grove is a popular local lake for shore fishing and boat fishing of various species (walleye, black crappie, channel catfish, black bullhead). Channel catfish fingerlings/yearlings have been stocked periodically since 1986. The most recent channel catfish stocking occurred in 2006 (3,213 fingerlings, 17 pounds). A fall electrofishing survey was also conducted to evaluate a 2007 spring walleye fry stocking (245,453 fry). Walleye fry are stocked into School Grove every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in School Grove after successive fry stocking failures. School Grove has a history of commercial fish removal of black bullhead in the past. School Grove is managed primarily for walleye, channel catfish, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in the 2007 trapnets (70.89 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the School Grove historical average (19.03 fish/trapnet). The 2007 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.42 pounds and 9.16 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average length is 8.02 inches from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie (67.11 fish/trapnet) in the 2007 trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area trapnets for ages 3-6, but above the normal ranges for ages 1-2. The 2002 and 2001 year classes comprised 55% and 29% respectively of the 2007 total black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers were high in 2007 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the School Grove historical average (2.05 fish/gillnet). The 2007 channel catfish average size was moderate (1.82 pounds and 15.73 inches) from gillnets. The channel catfish historical average length is 18.10 inches from gillnets. The largest channel catfish captured in the 2007 assessment was 25.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2007 (18.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the School Grove historical average (174.69 fish/gillnet). The 2007 black bullhead average size was small to moderate (0.20 pounds and 7.24 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average length is 7.45 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2007 (47.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the School Grove historical average (12.43 fish/gillnet). The 2007 carp average size was small (1.54 pounds and 14.80 inches) from gillnets. The carp historical average length is 11.22 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in the 2007 gillnets (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the School Grove historical average (15.81 fish/gillnet). However, walleye numbers were moderate to high in the 2007 trapnets (4.89 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes, but comparable to the School Grove historical average (5.25 fish/trapnet). The 2007 walleye average size was small to moderate (1.04 pounds and 13.38 inches) from trapnets. The walleye average length is 17.16 inches from trapnets. Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2004 year class comprised 67% of the 2007 total walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2005 and 2002 year classes comprised 16% and 18% respectively of the total walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of small young of year \"YOY\" walleye (8.00 YOY/hour, 4.65 inches average length) were present in the 2007 fall electrofishing survey. There were abundant numbers of YOY walleye (72.00 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches average length) captured in the 2005 fall electrofishing survey. The 2004 electrofishing survey results were 12.00 YOY/hour and 3.94 inches average length. The fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 30.38 YOY/hour and 6.01 inches respectively for School Grove. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 71.24 YOY/hour. Walleye fry (approximately 200,000 to 300,000 each year) have been stocked into School Grove during 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for School Grove occurred in the 2005 fry stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the 2008 fall for YOY walleye.  <br> \n</p>",

The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). School Grove is a small (349 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. A significant winterkill last occurred during February of 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in School Grove is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. School Grove is scheduled for Walleye fry stocking every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure or a winterkill occurs, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fry were recently stocked into School Grove (200,000 to 350,000 fry) during 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. Approximately 351,000 Walleye fry were stocked in School Grove during 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (324.0 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches average length) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (>80.0 YOY/hour) were captured in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. The highest YOY Walleye catch rate (353.3 YOY/hour, 5.7 inches) occurred for School Grove in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nThe School Grove Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2017 for all fish species.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of School Grove was conducted during mid-June of 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nSchool Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. School Grove is a popular local lake for shore fishing and boat fishing of various species (Walleye, Black Crappie and Black Bullhead). The watershed and shoreline are predominately agricultural row crops with a narrow fringe of hardwoods or cattails. There are only 6 homes/farm sites in addition to several recreational vehicles located near the lake. A public access and rest area is located on the northwest side. Water quality and clarity conditions are often poor in School Grove due to agricultural runoff. There are 9 inlets (tile and marsh connections) and an outlet that eventually connects to the Redwood River. School Grove can potentially connect to Lady Slipper Lake via a north shore wetland during extreme high water events. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid-summer. Water clarity was poor (2.0 feet) on June 21, 2022. Sago pondweed was the most commonly occurring submergent vegetation species in 2022. Emergent vegetation consisted mostly of cattail species and bulrush species along the north and northeast shore areas. Other aquatic vegetation species present included filamentous algae and water moss. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, boulder, silt, gravel, and rubble. School Grove has a history of commercial fish removal for Black Bullhead, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. <br> \n <br> \nA winterkill of Black Crappie, Walleye, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish occurred during February of 2010. The winterkill was not complete, but numbers of all fish species were significantly reduced. Low numbers of Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were captured in the 2010 ice out trapnets. A significant winterkill occurred on nearby Cottonwood Lake during January of 2013, but not on School Grove or Lady Slipper. A significant winterkill of Common Carp occurred during the 2018-19 winter on School Grove. An intense blue-green algae bloom was present during the late fall just prior to ice up. Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period. Dissolved oxygen levels decreased rapidly to less than 1 ppm even though open water was present at the aeration site (not running) in early December of 2018. The aeration system was unable to be used due to open water at the site for signage during early December of 2018. The aeration system was on by January 3, 2019. There were low numbers of distressed and dying fish of all species near an inlet southwest of the nearby access on January 3, 2019. We observed numerous dead floating Common Carp during early May 2019 netting, but no Walleye or other gamefish. We caught one Black Crappie, three Yellow Perch and 3 Black Bullhead in the three 2019 May trapnets. Nearby Lady Slipper had low numbers of dead fish visible with a few Yellow Perch and abundant Black Bullhead and small Common Carp in the 2019 spring trapnets. No winterkills were observed in other nearby lakes such as Cottonwood, Wood Lake, and Tyson. Lake Elizabeth (shallow aerated lake) in Kandiyohi County had a similar 2019 winterkill result consisting of mostly dead Common Carp and lesser amounts of gamefish to that of School Grove. Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period.  <br> \n <br> \nOxygen levels were low during February of 2023 due mostly numerous heavy snowfall events. The aeration system (northeast bay) was turned on January 3, 2023. It was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due to late ice out and snowfall events. There were reports of winterkill (Common Carp and Walleye) in the spring of 2023. We caught abundant numbers of Black Bullhead (all sizes) from ice out trapnets during late April of 2023. Low numbers of Common Carp (all sizes), White Sucker (adults) and Bigmouth Buffalo (adults) were also caught in the ice out trapnets. No gamefish (Walleye, Yellow Perch or Black Crappie) were captured in the trapnets. Winterkill was more prevalent in southern and western Minnesota shallow lakes in 2023 than during other years. The 2022 summer survey results are no longer valid due to significant winterkill in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo abundance was low (1.00 fish/gillnet and 0.33 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rates are 2.43 fish/gillnet and 0.06 fish/trapnet. The average sizes were small from gillnets (1.65 pounds and 14.1 inches), but large from trapnets (10.56 pounds 25.4 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were abundant (212.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 159.08 fish/gillnet. Black Bullhead numbers were also high in the 2022 trapnets (168.89 fish/trapnet, 7.3 inches average). The 2022 Black Bullhead average size was small (0.18 pounds and 6.7 inches) from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average lengths are 7.7 inches and 8.0 inches respectively from gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was moderate (3.67 fish/trapnet) in 2022 compared to similar lakes. The historical catch rate is 14.01 fish/trapnet. No Black Crappie were caught in the 2022 gillnets. Black Crappie numbers were moderate in 2017 (3.22 fish/trapnet), but absent in the 2012 resurvey nets. Black Crappie were abundant in the 2007 (70.89 fish/trapnet) and 2002 (51.78 fish/trapnet) surveys, however the 2010 winterkill significantly reduced the Black Crappie population. The 2022 Black Crappie average size was large (0.77 pounds and 10.8 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average length is 8.2 inches from trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were excellent for ages 1-6. The 2020 and 2016 Black Crappie year classes comprised 30% and 36% respectively of the 2022 Black Crappie survey catch. The largest Black Crappie captured was 13.0 inches in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were absent in 2022, 2017 and 2012 survey nets due to the 2010 winterkill. Channel Catfish were abundant in 2007 (6.00 fish/gillnet). Channel Catfish fingerlings/yearlings had been stocked periodically from 1986 to the last stocking in 2006 (3,213 fingerlings, 17 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance was low (0.50 fish/gillnet and 1.44 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rates are 9.35 fish/gillnet and 1.87 fish/trapnet. Common Carp average weights were small from gillnets (0.92 pounds), but moderate from trapnets (5.50 pounds). The historical average weights are 1.35 pounds and 4.23 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Sunfish (0.11 fish/trapnet, 6.3 inches average length) was the only sunfish species captured in the 2022 survey nets. Abundant Green Sunfish numbers were captured in 2012 (5.11 fish/trapnet). <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker abundance was moderate (2.50 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The historical average catch rate is 1.32 fish/gillnet. The 2022 average size was large (2.31 pounds and 17.7 inches). The historical average weight and length are 1.77 pounds and 14.7 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 5.00 fish/gillnet. The 2022 average size was large (0.51 pounds and 10.1 inches) from gillnets. The historical average weight and length are 0.34 pounds and 8.6 inches from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent for ages 1-6. Yellow Perch adults were stocked in 2015 (1,785 fish, 357 pounds) and 2019 (1,110 fish, 180 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis for School Grove. Walleye fry (approximately 200,000 to 350,000) have been stocked into School Grove recently during 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022. Walleye adults/yearlings (362 fish, 228 pounds) and fingerlings (134 fish, 33.5 pounds) were in 2010. In 2019, Walleye adults (826 fish, 793 pounds) and fingerlings (1,820 fish, 61 pounds) were stocked in School Grove. Walleye adults and yearlings were stocked in 2020 (33 adults, 65 pounds; 264 yearlings, 132 pounds).   <br> \n <br> \nLow young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers (12.00 YOY/hour, 8.1 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye from spring fry stockings were present in the 2017 (186.00 YOY/hour, 4.4 inches average length) and 2014 (324.00 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. The fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 93.26 YOY/hour and 5.82 inches respectively for School Grove. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for School Grove occurred in the 2012 fry stocked year (353.33 YOY/hour). No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted from 2020-2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant (42.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 survey. The historical catch rate is 18.02 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Walleye average weight and length were 2.18 pounds and 17.6 inches respectively from gillnets. The historical average length is 14.87 from gillnets. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) Walleye was high (34.00 fish/gillnet). The 2022 catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches plus) Walleye was also high (13.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were excellent for age 1-8. The 2017 Walleye year class (fry and adult stockings) comprised 56% of the 2022 Walleye survey catch. The 2021 and 2019 Walleye year classes comprised 24% and 12% respectively of the 2022 Walleye survey catch. It is unclear how many pre 2019 Walleye year classes survived the 2019 winterkill due to restocking of adults and fingerlings in 2019-2021. Local anglers reported catching a variety of Walleye sizes in the 2022 summer and fall. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the summer of 2027 for all fish species and in the fall of 2023 for YOY Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

School Grove is a popular local lake for shore fishing and boat fishing of various species (walleye, black crappie, channel catfish, and black bullhead). A resurvey of School Grove was conducted during late June of 2012. The watershed and shoreline is predominately agricultural row crops with a narrow fringe of hardwoods or cattails. There are only 6 homes/farm sites in addition to several recreational vehicles located near the lake. A public access and rest area is located on the northwest side. Water quality and clarity conditions are often poor in School Grove due to agricultural runoff. There are 9 inlets (tile and marsh connections) and an outlet that eventually connects to the Redwood River. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid-summer. An intense blue-green algae bloom was occurring during the vegetation survey on July 10, 2012. Water clarity was poor to fair (2.6 feet) on June 22, 2012. Aquatic vegetation consists of abundant densities of blue-green algae with moderate densities of filamentous algae, water moss, sago pondweed and narrow leaf pondweed species. Emergent vegetation consists mostly of cattail species and bulrush along the north and northeast shore areas. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, boulder, silt and rubble.  <br> \n <br> \nA winterkill of black crappie, walleye, carp, black bullhead and channel catfish occurred during February of 2010. The winterkill was not complete, but numbers of all fish species were significantly reduced. Low numbers of black bullhead, carp, yellow perch and white sucker were captured in the 2010 ice out trapnets. Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2010 and 2012. In addition, walleye adults (99 fish), yearlings (263 fish) and fingerlings (134 fish) were also stocked in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are generally stocked into School Grove every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake may be stocked again with fry the following spring. School Grove has a history of commercial fish removal for black bullhead, carp and bigmouth buffalo. School Grove has been managed primarily for walleye, channel catfish, and black crappie in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and channel catfish were absent in the 2012 resurvey nets due to the 2010 winterkill. Channel catfish fingerlings/yearlings have been stocked periodically since 1986. The most recent channel catfish stocking occurred in 2006 (3,213 fingerlings, 17 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were abundant in 2012 (137.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 169.98 fish/gillnet for School Grove. The 2012 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.38 pounds and 8.46 inches). The black bullhead historical average length is 7.62 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp abundance in the 2012 trapnets (3.33 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (1.21 fish/trapnet). The 2012 carp average size was moderate to small (3.61 pounds and 16.83 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo abundance (12.00 fish/gillnet) was high in 2012 compared to the historical average (2.67 fish/gillnet), but the average size was small (0.49 pounds and 9.16 inches). White sucker abundance (9.00 fish/gillnet) was also high in 2012 compared to the historical average (1.21 fish/gillnet). The 2012 white sucker average size was moderate (1.90 pounds and 15.63 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nSunfish species such as green sunfish (5.11 fish/trapnet, 5.73 inches average length) and hybrid sunfish (1.22 fish/trapnet, 5.77 inches average length) were abundant in the 2012 trapnets. No bluegill or pumpkinseed sunfish species were captured in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant in 2012 (19.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average (3.00 fish/gillnet). The 2012 average size was moderate (0.30 pounds and 7.81 inches). The historical average weight and length are 0.25 pounds and 7.58 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was moderate (6.00 fish/gillnet). Yellow perch growth rates were above Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2010 yellow perch year class comprised 67% of the 2012 yellow perch survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant in the 2012 gillnets (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. Walleye were abundant in the 2012 trapnets (8.89 fish/trapnet). The 2012 walleye average size was small from the gillnet (0.49 pounds and 11.56 inches) and trapnets (0.56 pounds and 11.91 inches). The historical average lengths are 14.10 and 16.30 inches from gillnets and trapnets respectively. There were no walleye greater than 15.0 inches captured in the 2012 survey nets. Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal range for age 1, within the normal range for age 2 and above the normal ranges for ages 3-4. The 2010 walleye year class (fry stocking) comprised 98% of the 2012 total walleye catch. The 2008 walleye year class (adult stocking) comprised 2% of the 2012 total walleye gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye from spring fry stockings were present in the 2010 (192.00 YOY/hour, 5.71 inches average length) and 2012 (353.33 YOY/hour, 5.72 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. The fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 79.72 YOY/hour and 6.01 inches respectively for School Grove. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 81.31 YOY/hour. Walleye fry (approximately 200,000 to 300,000) have been stocked into School Grove during 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for School Grove occurred in the 2012 fry stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2014 for YOY walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>School Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), and productive lake. Itis located about 3.5 miles southeast of Cottonwood, MN in Lyon County. A public access islocated along the northwest shore. An aeration system has been operated since 1983 to preventthe winterkill of gamefish. Recent walleye fry stockings were done in 1992 (317,760 fry),1994 (316,910 fry), and 1996 (343,680 fry). In addition, walleye fingerlings were stocked in1994 (16,584 fish) and 1996 (28,378 fish) due to poor survival of walleye fry. Channelcatfish fingerlings were stocked in 1994 (7,872 fish) and 1997 (21,622 fish).     Moderate walleye numbers (12.7 fish/gillnet) were present in School Grove Lake during1997. The walleye average size was 2.5 lbs. The 1994 year class accounted for 68% of thetotal catch in the 1997 survey. The largest walleye captured was 25.8 inches (6.1 lbs.). In1997, moderate walleye natural reproduction was documented in School Grove. However, priorwalleye natural reproduction has been sporadic and insignificant. Fishing success has beengood for walleye in recent years especially during May-June and early December     Channel catfish numbers (1.2 fish/trapnet) were low in 1997, but the average size waslarge (23.9 inches). The largest channel catfish captured in the survey was 26.3 inches (9.7lbs.). It appears that channel catfish natural reproduction in School Grove is limited.     Black bullhead numbers were high (266.7 fish/gillnet) in 1997. The black bullheadaverage size was moderate (7.4 inches). The largest black bullhead captured was 13.9 inches. Black bullheads provide an important forage base for walleye and channel catfish. Anglershave good success fishing from the public access shoreline area for large black bullheads.     Panfish species such as black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill numbers were low ornot present in the 1997 survey. In 1996, 820 adult bluegills were stocked into School Grove,however no bluegills were captured in the 1997 survey.     The MNDNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to manage School Grove for walleye andchannel catfish as the primary species. Management priorities for School Grove includemaintaining the present aeration system, stocking walleye and channel catfish as necessary,maintaining an adequate forage base, encouraging local landowners to implement bestmanagement practices in the watershed (i.e., conservation tillage, planting buffer strips,restoring wetlands, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers, updating non conforming septicsystems, proper manure/feedlot management), and protecting important habitat such as hardstembulrush.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on School Grove on September 4, 2019. School Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. School Grove can potentially connect to Lady Slipper Lake via a north shore wetland during extreme high water events. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid-summer. A significant winterkill of all fish species (i.e. Common Carp, Walleye, Black Crappie, etc.) occurred during the 2018-2019 winter. This was due in part to an intense 2018 fall algae bloom resulting in dying/decaying algae and subsequent declining dissolved oxygen just after ice up in December of 2018. Ice out trapnets caught only 3 Yellow Perch, 1 Black crappie and 3 Black bullhead in the 2019 spring. A significant winterkill of nearby Lady Slipper also occurred in 2019. Although floating dead fish (i.e. Common Carp) were less apparent on Lady Slipper than School Grove Lake in the 2019 spring. We saw moderate numbers of small sized Common Carp, Mud Minnows and YOY Black Crappie in School Grove during the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2019, a winterkill of Black Crappie, Walleye, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish last occurred during February of 2010. The winterkill was not complete, but numbers of all fish species were significantly reduced. Low numbers of Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were captured in the 2010 ice out trapnets. A significant winterkill occurred on nearby Cottonwood Lake during January of 2013, but not on School Grove or Lady Slipper.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys for School Grove. Walleye fry (approximately 240,000 to 351,000) have been stocked into School Grove recently during 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. Approximately 200,000 Upper Mississippi Strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Walleye fry stocking result was poor. Low YOY Walleye numbers (12.00 YOY/hour, 8.07 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Additional Walleye age groups stocked included adults (754 fish, 777 lbs.), yearlings (72 fish, 16 lbs.) and fingerlings (1,820 fish, 61 lbs.) during the 2019 fall due to low YOY numbers in the fall electrofishing survey. In addition, 1,110 adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye from spring fry stockings were present in the 2017 (186.00 YOY/hour, 4.38 inches average length) and 2014 (324.00 YOY/hour, 5.50 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for School Grove occurred in the 2012 fry stocked year (353.33 YOY/hour). No yearling Walleye were captured during the 2019 or 2017 fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the summer of 2022 for all fish species and in the fall of 2021 for YOY Walleye. The 2020 scheduled Walleye fry stocking will be postponed until 2021 due to no egg take/fry availability because of the Corvid-19 pandemic in 2020. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on School Grove during September 11, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Three stations were sampled for a total of 30 minutes at dusk. Water temperature was 71 F. Water clarity varied from 6-18 inches. Sago pondweed was rare. We saw abundant numbers of Black Bullhead (3-5 inches). Moderate numbers of adult Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo were also observed in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nSchool Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. School Grove can potentially connect to Lady Slipper Lake via a north shore wetland during extreme high water events. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid-summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA winterkill of Black Crappie, Walleye, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish occurred during February of 2010. The winterkill was not complete, but numbers of all fish species were significantly reduced. Low numbers of Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were captured in the 2010 ice out trapnets. A significant winterkill occurred on nearby Cottonwood Lake during January of 2013, but not on School Grove or Lady Slipper. A significant winterkill of Common Carp occurred during the 2018-19 winter on School Grove. An intense blue-green algae bloom was present during the late fall just prior to ice up. Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period. Dissolved oxygen levels decreased rapidly to less than 1 ppm even though open water was present at the aeration site (not running) in early December of 2018. The aeration system was unable to be used due to open water at the site for signage during early December of 2018. The aeration system was on by January 3, 2019. There were low numbers of distressed and dying fish of all species near an inlet southwest of the nearby access on January 3, 2019. We observed numerous dead floating Common Carp during early May 2019 netting, but no Walleye or other gamefish. We caught one Black Crappie, three Yellow Perch and 3 Black Bullhead in the three 2019 May trapnets. Nearby Lady Slipper had low numbers of dead fish visible with a few Yellow Perch and abundant Black Bullhead and small Common Carp in the 2019 spring trapnets. No winterkills were observed in other nearby lakes such as Cottonwood, Wood Lake, and Tyson. Lake Elizabeth (shallow aerated lake) in Kandiyohi County had a similar 2019 winterkill result consisting of mostly dead Common Carp and lesser amounts of gamefish to that of School Grove. Winter oxygen levels were low in February of 2023 on School Grove due in part to heavy snowfall events. Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period. Ice out occurred in mid-March of 2023. There were reports of winterkill (Common Carp and Walleye) in the spring of 2023 in both School Grove and Lady Slipper. Nearby Sham Lake (Walleye rearing pond) also had a significant winterkill in 2023. Three trapnets were set in early May of 2023 to assess winterkill. Abundant numbers of Black Bullhead and low numbers of other species (White Sucker, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo) were captured in the trapnets. No gamefish were captured. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys for School Grove. Walleye fry (approximately 200,000 to 350,000) have been stocked into School Grove recently during 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Approximately 175,800 Walleye fry were stocked in 2023. Walleye fry are currently scheduled for annual stockings. Walleye adults/yearlings (362 fish, 228 pounds) and fingerlings (134 fish, 33.5 pounds) were in 2010. In 2019, Walleye adults (826 fish, 793 pounds) and fingerlings (1,820 fish, 61 pounds) were stocked in School Grove. Walleye adults and yearlings were stocked in 2020 (33 adults, 65 pounds; 264 yearlings, 132 pounds).   <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2023 (84.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches). Low YOY Walleye numbers (12.00 YOY/hour, 8.07 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye from spring fry stockings were present in the 2017 (186.00 YOY/hour, 4.38 inches average length) and 2014 (324.00 YOY/hour, 5.50 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. The fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 93.68 YOY/hour and 5.72 inches respectively for School Grove. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for School Grove occurred in the 2012 fry stocked year (353.33 YOY/hour). No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted from 2020-2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in the 2022 survey (42.50 fish/gillnet) on School Grove. The historical catch rate is 18.02 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Walleye average weight and length were 2.18 pounds and 17.56 inches respectively from gillnets. The historical average lengths were 14.87 and 16.21 inches from gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) Walleye was high (34.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for age 1-8. The 2017 Walleye year class (fry and adult stockings) comprised 56% of the 2022 Walleye survey catch. The 2021 and 2019 Walleye year classes (fry, fingerling, yearling, and adult stockings from 2019-2021) comprised 24% and 12% respectively of the 2022 Walleye survey catch. It is unclear how many pre 2019 Walleye year classes survived the 2019 winterkill due to restocking of adults and fingerlings in 2019-2021. Adult Walleye numbers may be significantly reduced as of 2023 due to partial winterkill during the 2022-2023 winter. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the summer of 2027 for all fish species and periodically for YOY Walleye by fall electrofishing.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>School Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 ft. maximum depth), productive lakelocated about 3.5 miles southeast of Cottonwood, MN in Lyon County. Nutrient loading isprimarily from agricultural runoff via several tile/culverts which enter the lake. Highconcentrations of dissolved solids (1340 ppm) and sulfate ion (750 ppm) were documented on6/26/92 which are indicators of possible untreated animal/human waste leeching/entering intothe lake. Lady Slipper Lake outlets into the north shore of School Grove Lake through a marsharea. The outlet (lift station) connects to Judicial Ditch #3 which eventually connects tothe Redwood River. Periodic winterkill was a common occurrence prior to the installation ofan aeration system (3 helixors) during the 1984-85 winter. Submergent vegetation is oftensparse with sago pondweed the most commonly occurring species. Filamentous algae is oftenabundant on the shoalwater substrates. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common during thesummer months. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, reed canary grass, threesquare) isabundant in the northwest and northeast bay areas. The shoalwater substrates are composedmostly of sand, gravel, and silt. The surrounding shoreline is composed mostly of uplandgrass and a narrow strip of hardwoods on steep to moderate slopes. There were 2 homes and 2recreational vehicles located adjacent to the lake in 1992. Prior to aeration, fish stockingwas limited to adult bluegill and black crappie, after partial winterkills. Walleye fry wasfirst stocked in 1977. In 1985, 1000 yearling tiger (hybrid) muskellunge were stocked intoSchool Grove Lake. Channel catfish were first stocked in 1986. Presently, School Grove Lakeis managed for walleye and channel catfish as primary species with bluegill and black crappieas secondary species. School Grove is a typical boom and bust walleye fishery. Anglers hadexcellent walleye angling success in 1992-93. School Grove is also a popular shore fishinglake for large black bullhead.     Walleye abundance in 1995 (20.7 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (2.3 - 18.1fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to the historical average (21.6fish/gillnet). The 1995 average size (14.6 inches) was below the historical average (16.4inches). The largest walleye caught in 1995 was 25.0 inches. About 5% of the walleye hadtapeworm in their gills. Growth rates appear good to excellent for ages I-V and slow toaverage for ages VI-VII. A strong 1994 year class (fry and fingerling stocking) was apparent(58% of total catch) in 1995 summer survey nets. In addition, fair numbers of fish werepresent in the survey nets from 1992 (19% of total) and 1990 (9%) fry stocking years. Therealso appears to be some limited natural reproduction occurring based on scale analysis fromsummer survey net catches.     Channel catfish abundance in 1995 (1.7 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historicalaverage (1.3 fish/gillnet), but below the previous survey in 1992 (3.3 fish/gillnet). The1995 average size (19.2 inches) was above the historical average (14.2 inches). The largestcatfish caught in 1995 was 20.7 inches. Channel catfish yearlings (7,872 fish) were stockedinto School Grove during the fall of 1994.     Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (42.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (30.3 -150.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (193.7 fish/gillnet).Black bullhead numbers have steadily declined since the onset of aeration in 1985-85. The1995 average size (6.4 inches) was slightly below the historical average (6.7 inches). Thelargest black bullhead caught in 1995 was 11.2 inches. Commercial fishermen removed 400 lbsin the 1960's, 42,000 lbs in the 1970's, 110,746 lbs in the 1980's, and 59,000 lbs during theearly 1990's.     Black crappie abundance in 1995 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.2 -20.5 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (2.6 fish/trapnet).The 1995 average size (4.8 inches) was below the historical average (7.9 inches). All of thefish captured in the 1995 survey nets were from the 1994 year class.     Bluegill were abundant in the 1984 (29.7 fish/trapnet) and 1987 (22.2 fish/trapnet)surveys, however few or no bluegill were caught in 1992 (0.1 fish/trapnet) and 1995 (0.0fish/trapnet). The average size of bluegill was 5.3 inches in 1984, 8.3 inches in 1987, and7.8 inches in 1992.      Orangespotted sunfish dramatically increased in 1995 (47.6 fish/trapnet) compared toprevious surveys (0.0 fish/trapnet in 1984 and 1987, 0.8 fish/trapnet in 1992). Orangespottedsunfish were actively seen building nests on the gravel shoalwater substrates during the 1995survey. Orangespotted sunfish rarely attain lengths greater than 4 inches, thus they havelittle value for sport fishing. Small orangespotted sunfish may be important forage forspecies such as bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie.     Green sunfish abundance in 1995 (9.2 fish/trapnet) also increased dramatically comparedto previous surveys (0.0 fish/trapnet in 1984 and 1987, 0.3 fish/trapnet in 1992). Theaverage size captured in 1995 (4.7 inches) was below the previous survey (6.3 inches).     Common carp abundance in 1995 (0.8 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (0.2fish/trapnet). There were no carp documented in the 1984 or 1987 surveys, however carp weredocumented in the 1970's from hoopnet and trapnet assessments. The 1995 average size was 16.0inches, however 71% of the fish were less than 14 inches.     Tiger muskellunge were not documented during 1995, however two fish were caught (0.3fish/trapnet) during 1987. The tiger muskellunge is a hybrid of northern pike and muskellungethat grows fast, but is sterile.     School Grove Lake is both a popular shore and boat fishing lake for walleye and largeblack bullhead. Walleye numbers were moderate to abundant in 1995. A strong 1994 walleye yearclass is present within the lake. The walleye forage base of black bullhead appeared low in1995 compared to previous surveys. Other forage such as fathead minnows appeared abundantthroughout the shallow shoreline areas based on observation by the survey crew. Otherimportant walleye forage species such as yellow perch have never been abundant within SchoolGrove Lake despite a stocking attempt in 1987 (18,000 yearlings). Although forage speciesabundance is presently low, abundant small walleye fingerlings (from frequent fry stockings)may be providing supplemental forage for larger walleye. Supplemental yellow perch stockingand/or the temporary reduction of predator stocking (less frequently or smaller densities)may be necessary in the future if walleye growth and survival significantly decreases withinSchool Grove Lake. Future, channel catfish stockings are presently on hold in order tomonitor natural reproduction and the affect of present catfish population on the fishery.There have been few reports of angler success for tiger muskellunge in School Grove. Stockingmay be the best option at improving bluegill population numbers. Stocking stunted adultbluegill into shallow productive waters such as School Grove is often successful instimulating rapid growth of these fish and potentially providing an excellent fishery forseveral years. Other management priorities include protecting stands of emergent vegetation,and encouraging the implementation of best management practices (i.e. conservation tillage,planting buffer strips, shoreline management, restoring wetlands) within the watershed inorder to reduce nutrient inputs into the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of School Grove was conducted during mid-June of 2017. A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye was conducted on School Grove during late August of 2017. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nSchool Grove is a small (318 acres), shallow (11 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Lyon County. School Grove is a popular local lake for shore fishing and boat fishing of various species (Walleye, Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, and Black Bullhead). The watershed and shoreline are predominately agricultural row crops with a narrow fringe of hardwoods or cattails. There are only 6 homes/farm sites in addition to several recreational vehicles located near the lake. A public access and rest area is located on the northwest side. Water quality and clarity conditions are often poor in School Grove due to agricultural runoff. There are 9 inlets (tile and marsh connections) and an outlet that eventually connects to the Redwood River. School Grove can potentially connect to Lady Slipper Lake via a north shore wetland during extreme high water events. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid-summer. Water clarity was poor (2.0 feet) on June 19, 2017. Aquatic vegetation consists of abundant densities of blue-green algae with moderate densities of filamentous algae, water moss, sago pondweed and narrow leaf pondweed species. Emergent vegetation consists mostly of cattail species and bulrush along the north and northeast shore areas. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, boulder, silt and rubble. School Grove has a history of commercial fish removal for Black Bullhead, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. <br> \n <br> \nA winterkill of Black Crappie, Walleye, Common Carp, Black Bullhead and Channel Catfish occurred during February of 2010. The winterkill was not complete, but numbers of all fish species were significantly reduced. Low numbers of Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were captured in the 2010 ice out trapnets. A significant winterkill occurred on nearby Cottonwood Lake during January of 2013, but not on School Grove or Lady Slipper. School Grove is managed primarily for Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie. There are presently good fish opportunities for Walleye, large sized Black Crappie and Yellow Perch based on the 2017 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2017 (19.00 fish/gillnet, 8.96 inches). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 153.20 fish/gillnet for School Grove. Black Bullhead numbers were also low in the 2017 trapnets (22.22 fish/trapnet, 10.96 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2017 (3.22 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. Black Crappie were absent in the 2012 survey nets. Black Crappie were abundant in the 2007 survey (70.89 fish/trapnet, 9.16 inches), however the 2010 winterkill significantly reduced the Black Crappie population. The Black Crappie average size was 9.81 inches from the 2017 trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were above Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2015 and 2012 Black Crappie year classes comprised 57% and 17% respectively of the 2017 Black Crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were absent in 2017 and 2012 survey nets due to the 2010 winterkill. Channel Catfish were abundant in 2007 (6.00 fish/gillnet). Channel Catfish fingerlings/yearlings have been stocked periodically since 1986. The most recent Channel Catfish stocking occurred in 2006 (3,213 fingerlings, 17 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were abundant in 2017 (5.00 fish/gillnet, 7.56 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp historical average catch rates are 10.33 fish/gillnet and 1.91 fish/trapnet for School Grove. The 2017 Common Carp average weights were 1.72 pounds and 4.95 pounds respectively from gillnet and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2017 (25.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 5.44 fish/gillnet. The 2017 average size was large (0.35 pounds and 9.04 inches). Yellow Perch growth rates were above Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2015 Yellow Perch year class comprised 96% of the 2017 Yellow Perch survey catch in School Grove. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2015 (1,785 fish, 357 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and historical data review for School Grove. The Walleye population is due mostly to fry stockings in School Grove. Walleye fry (approximately 240,000 to 351,000) have been stocked into School Grove recently during 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. Walleye adults/yearlings (362 fish, 228 pounds) and fingerlings (134 fish, 33.5 pounds) were last stocked in 2010. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" Walleye from spring fry stockings were present in the 2017 (186.00 YOY/hour, 4.38 inches average length) and 2014 (324.00 YOY/hour, 5.50 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in the 2017 gillnets (17.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2017 Walleye average size was moderate (1.68 pounds and 16.71 inches). There were abundant numbers of 15.00 inches and larger Walleye (14.00 fish/gillnet) in School Grove. Walleye growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2014 Walleye year class (fry stocking) comprised 81% of the 2017 total Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2012 Walleye year class (fry stocking) comprised 19% of the 2017 total Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on School Grove include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the sportsman's club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The School Grove fishery will be sampled in the summer of 2022 for all fish species and in the fall of 2019 for YOY Walleye.  <br> \n</p>",
