It is connected to Northern Light Lake by its outlet channel, and there are no permanent barriers to movement of fish between the lakes.  Merganser Lake was last assessed in 1978. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for all species in 2012 were roughly similar to catches seen in this lake in 1976 and 1978, and there was apparently little or no change in the composition of the fish community.  The 2012 assessment was the first to use a gear (0.25-in-mesh trap nets) capable of sampling small fish, and added blacknose shiner and central mudminnow to the list of species known to be present in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class; however, northern pike collected in gill nets in 2012 were unusually large, both for a lake of this class, and compared to fish taken in the 1970s in this lake.  Several age classes, all naturally produced, were represented in the 2012 catch.  Northern pike growth had been about average for the area; fish reached an average length of 23.8 inches by the end of their fifth year. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch was also within the normal range for the lake class.  From the length frequency distribution it was apparent that several year classes contributed to the 2012 catch.  There were enough larger perch present to provide some sport fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were present, but probably not abundant.  A few may have been large enough to have been of some interest to anglers, but it was unlikely that their numbers were high enough to provide good fishing. <br> \n   </p>",
