A low population was indicated for brown bullhead and yellow perch, while netting indicated an average population of largemouth bass. Ages two thru seven were represented among the northern pike sampled with all ages exhibiting average growth rates. Length-frequency ranged from 16 to 29 inches with balanced distribution. Bluegills sampled indicated slow growth rates although individual size was average for comparable lakes. Length frequency ranged from 3 to 6 inches with the 4-inch group representing 64% of the sample. A low population of yellow perch was indicated by the test netting. Average growth rates are exhibited by the fish sampled and aged. A high population of yellow bullheads was present with average individual sizes.</p>",
