                "narrative": "<p>Six Mile Lake is located six miles east of Tower and approximately one mile south of Hwy 169.  The lake is surrounded by county tax forfeited land however, there is no improved access on the lake. A trail connects the lake with the Six Mile Lake Road to the north.  This trail crosses county land but starts on private land. Six Mile Lake Road was at one time located on land owned by U.S. Steel but has since been sold and is in private ownership.\n\nThere is considerable confusion over the names of this waterbody and the smaller one to the north. Local residents refer to the north water body as Six Mile Lake and the south basin as Needleboy Lake.  These basins are also labeled this way on the USGS topographic map.  The State of Minnesota's Division of Waters however, officially designated the south basin as Six Mile Lake and the north basin as Needleboy Lake.  The 2012 fisheries survey was conducted on the south basin (officially known as Six Mile Lake).\n\nSix Mile Lake is approximately 108 acres in size with a maximum depth of 22.0 feet.  Most of the lake, however, is less than 12.0 feet deep and contains large areas of water less than six feet in depth.  Aquatic plants, both submerged and floating, are common. The water in Six Mile Lake is moderately stained (secchi disk visibility = 6.0 feet) and productive for this area of the State. Substrates are dominated by fine-grained sand, silt and detritus.  The shoreline however, has a greater composition of rubble and boulder.\n\nEight fish species were present in the catch during the 2012 fisheries investigation.  Northern pike was the primary predator species with a gill-net catch rate of 6.0/net.  This catch rate was similar to that of the two previous investigations (1977 and 1990).  The catch rate was above average for this lake classification.  Northern pike in the catch ranged from 12.8 to 38.6 inches but the average length was 21.2 inches.  Thirteen percent of the pike caught exceeded 30 inches in length.\n\nOther species present at relatively low densities included largemouth bass, bluegill, rock bass, white sucker and yellow perch.  Two of the three largemouth bass caught exceeded 14 inches in length.  </p>",
