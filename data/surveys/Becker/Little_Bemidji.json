                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji is a lightly developed, 293-acre lake in north central Becker County, within the Ottertail River Watershed.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest, with light development.  There is a resort on the northwest shore and a public access on the west central shore.  Boat access is also available from Elbow Lake via the Otter Tail River.  On 07/17/2023, a standard survey of the Little Bemidji fish community was conducted.  The primary gamefish species sought by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers have increased slightly since the previous assessment that was conducted in 2018.  In 2023, Walleyes ranging in size from 11 inches to 30 inches long were captured, with the average length being nearly 20 inches.  Northern Pike sampled ranged from 14 to 35 inches, with an average length of 24 inches.  Catch rates were down in 2023 compared to record high numbers of Northern Pike sampled during the 2018 assessment.  Bluegills in Little Bemidji Lake are relatively abundant, and generally small.  Fish over eight inches were not captured in 2023.  The vast majority of the population of Bluegill is between 3.5 and six inches.  Only ten Largemouth Bass were sampled during this survey.  Bass had an average length of 12 inches, but fish just over 17 inches were observed.  The Yellow Perch population has been declining in Little Bemidji since 1983.  Just under 20 perch were sampled during the 2023 survey, and those fish averaged seven inches in length.  Though the statewide trend for Tullibee (Cisco) is declining, the population within Little Bemidji is doing well.  Abundance in 2023 was the highest ever recorded.  Cisco ranging from seven inches to nearly 17 inches were sampled during this assessment.  Cisco are a high protein forage species and are likely sustaining the forage base in this lake in the absence of Yellow Perch.  Other species sampled during this assessment included Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic habitat near the shoreline in Little Bemidji Lake includes many areas of dense Chara, a native aquatic plant.  Some areas of emergent vegetation also exist.  These plants provide nesting and rearing areas for fish, as well as help stabilize shorelines and protect water quality.  Preservation of the integrity of these vegetation stands are crucial for the long-term health of the aquatic life assemblage in Little Bemidji Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji is a lightly developed, 275 acre lake in north central Becker County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  There is a resort on the northwest shore and a public access on the west central shore.  Boat access is also available from Elbow Lake through the Otter Tail River.The primary gamefish species sought by anglers in this lake include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  The walleye fishery is dependent upon fingerling stocking although some natural reproduction or immigration occurs.  Walleye stocking rates were doubled in 1999 after two consecutive surveys showed historically low catch rates.  In 2003, walleye test net catch rates increased to a level just above the lake's historical average.  However, most of the walleyes caught were attributed to 1995 and 1997 year classes, when walleye fingerlings were being stocked at a lower rate.  Walleyes averaged over two pounds each.Yellow perch, a primary forage species for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass, have become extremely rare in Little Bemidji during the past ten to fifteen years.  It is not clear what has caused this decline, but relatively high net catches of northern pike during the 1980's may help explain.  Walleye growth rates have not appeared to decline from the lack of perch, however.  Walleye growth was average and similar to past studies in this lake.  Growth rates will be monitored in future assessments to ensure that increased walleye stocking rates are not causing a decline.Northern pike and bluegills are relatively abundant and small in size.  However, a few larger fish of each of these species are present.  Both of these species tend to be somewhat slow growing in Little Bemidji and the voluntary release of a portion of mid-sized or larger fish would help achieve a balanced fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji is a lightly-developed, 275-acre lake in north central Becker County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  There is a resort on the northwest shore and a public access on the west central shore.  Boat access is also available from Elbow Lake via the Otter Tail River. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary gamefish species sought by anglers in this lake include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  The walleye fishery is dependent upon fingerling stocking although some natural reproduction or immigration occurs.  Walleye stocking rates were doubled in 1999 after two consecutive surveys showed historically low catch rates.  In 2003, walleye test net catch rates increased to a level just above the lake's historical average.  However, most of the walleyes caught were attributed to 1995 and 1997 year classes, when walleye fingerlings were being stocked at a lower rate.  Five years later, with the higher stocking rates, walleye catch rates actually declined slightly, though the difference was not substantial.  Walleyes averaged just under three pounds each in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a primary forage species for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass, have become extremely rare in Little Bemidji during the past ten to fifteen years.  It is not clear what has caused this decline, but relatively high net catches of northern pike during the 1980's may help explain.  Walleye growth rates have not appeared to suffer from the lack of perch, however.  Walleye growth was average and similar to past studies in this lake.  Growth rates will be monitored in future assessments to ensure that increased walleye stocking rates are not causing a decline.  The recently increased abundance of tullibee (cisco) may be helping to sustain growth rates of predator fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and bluegills are relatively abundant and small in size.  However, a few larger fish of each of these species are present.  Both of these species tend to be average to somewhat slow growing in Little Bemidji and the voluntary release of a portion of mid-sized or larger fish would help achieve a more balanced fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Bemidji Lake was conducted on June 29th, and July 5th, 2023, by Detroit Lakes Fisheries Staff.  The survey consisted of 10 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake.  All stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, and nine were sampled with a 50-foot seine.  One station was not sampled with a seine due to dense vegetation (Chara) which made it impossible to effectively use a seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of native fish, which included seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).  The three most common species captured during the nearshore survey in order of abundance were: Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with the standard survey data from July 2023 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Bemidji Lake is located in the Otter Tail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji is a lightly-developed, 293-acre lake in north central Becker County, within the Ottertail River Watershed.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest, with light development.  There is a resort on the northwest shore and a public access on the west central shore.  Boat access is also available from Elbow Lake via the Otter Tail River.  On 07/09/2018, the fish community of Little Bemidji Lake was sampled using six gill nets and nine trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary gamefish species sought by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and recently Muskies.   <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye numbers have decreased since the previous assessment that was conducted in 2014.  In 2018, Walleyes ranging in size from 13.2 inches to 26.3 inches long were captured, with the average length being nearly 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike sampled ranged from 13 to 33 inches, with an average length of 22 inches.  Record high numbers of Northern Pike were sampled during this assessment.  Muskies are present in Little Bemidji, as they have migrated upstream from Many Point Lake.  No muksies were sampled in 2018, although anglers and lakeshore residents report catching them.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population has been declining in Little Bemidji.  Only one perch was sampled in the gill nets during this assessment.  Though the statewide trend for Tullibee (Cisco) is declining, the population within Little Bemidji is doing well.  Cisco ranging from seven inches to nearly 19 inches were sampled during this assessment.  Cisco are a high protein forage species, and are likely sustaining the forage base in this lake in the absence of Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills in Little Bemidji Lake are relatively abundant, and generally small.  Fish over eight inches are present, but the majority of the population is between five and seven inches. <br> \n <br> \nOnly a small number of Largemouth Bass were sample during this survey.  Bass had a mean length of 8.2 inches, but fish up to 17 inches were observed.  Other species sampled during this assessment included Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic habitat near the shoreline in Little Bemidji Lake includes many areas of dense chara, a native aquatic plant.  Some areas of emergent vegetation also exist.  These plants provide nesting and rearing areas for fish, as well as help stabilize shorelines and protect water quality.  Preservation of the integrity of these vegetation stands are crucial for the long term health of the aquatic life assemblage in Little Bemidji Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji, a small, scenic bass/panfish lake, is located in the heavily wooded region of north central Becker County.  The lake and its immediate watershed fall within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.Yellow perch populations have experienced steady declines over the past 38 years.  The 1998 yellow perch catch rate of 1.17/set represented a historical low and was a 70-fold decrease from those reported in 1960.  Increases in both northern pike and walleye abundances through the 1970s and 1980s may have contributed to the perch decline and the subsequent explosion in bluegill numbers.The bluegill catch rate of 14.40/set fell within the normal range for its lake class and was a three-fold decrease from those reported five years earlier.  Though growth rates appeared to be normal, the size structure of the bluegill community has changed little over the past 30 years.  Mean length and weight of the sample were 5.0 inches and 0.12 pounds, respectively.  Northern pike catch rates  (7.17/set), though down from historical highs of the mid 1980s, remained within the normal range for lake class 23.  Lengths of sampled pike ranged from 13 to 25 inches with a mean of 19.4 inches.  Growth rates appeared to be near normal at younger ages but slightly slower at ages beyond four years.The 1998 walleye catch rate of 2.67/set was the second lowest reported over the past forty years and nearly equaled the lake class median of 2.37/set.  Walley have been stocked in these waters with varying degrees of success since the early 1940s.  The most recent lake management plan called for biennial walleye fingerling stocking of one pound per littoral acre (60 pounds).  Though little preferred walleye spawning habitat exists, there was evidence that a moderate amount of natural reproduction or immigration took place.  Nearly fifty percent of aged walleye were from non-stocked years.  Lengths of sampled walleye ranged between 11.6 and 21.7 inches with a mean length of 17.3 inches.  Nearly 75 percent of sampled walleye were age four or younger.  Growth rates mirrored statewide averages.Both largemouth bass and black crappie appeared to be maintaining a presence in Little Bemidji Lake.  However, an inadequate sample precluded an accurate assessment of their status.  Yellow bullhead catch rates have steadily declined from historical highs of the early 1980s.  The trap net catch rate of 1.30/set was the lowest reported since 1960.  Yellow bullhead continued to be the most abundant of the bullhead species in Little Bemidji.  This is often an indication of good water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji is a lightly-developed, 293-acre lake in north central Becker County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  There is a resort on the northwest shore and a public access on the west central shore.  Boat access is also available from Elbow Lake via the Otter Tail River. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary gamefish species sought by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  The Walleye fishery is dependent upon fingerling stocking although some natural reproduction or immigration occurs.  Walleye stocking rates were doubled in 1999 after two consecutive surveys showed historically low catch rates.  In 2003, Walleye test net catch rates increased to a level just above the lake's historical average.  However, most of the Walleyes caught were attributed to 1995 and 1997 year classes, when Walleye fingerlings were being stocked at a lower rate.  Five and 10 years later, with the higher DNR stocking rates and some additional private stocking in the past decade, Walleye catch rates actually declined during each of the past two studies.  Walleyes averaged just under two pounds each in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a primary forage species for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass, have become extremely rare in Little Bemidji during the past 15 to 20 years.  It is not clear what has caused this decline, but relatively high net catches of Northern Pike during the 1980's may help explain.  Walleye growth rates have not appeared to suffer from the lack of perch, however.  Walleye growth was similar to past studies in this lake.  Future assessments will be used to ensure that increased Walleye stocking rates are not causing a decline in growth rates.  The increasing abundance of Cisco (Tullibee) may be helping to sustain growth rates of predator fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Bluegills are relatively abundant and small in size.  However, a few larger fish of each of these species are present.  Pike grow at average rates in this lake and Bluegills are slow growing.  The voluntary release of a portion of mid-sized or larger fish may help achieve a more balanced fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations in Little Bemidji have undergone several changes during the past 34 years.  It is difficultto determine which changes are due to natural cycles and which are due to the influence of stocking, angling orhabitat changes.     At 10.3 per gillnet, the northern pike net catch is higher than the normal range for similarly classed lakesand has been since 1983.  Northern pike numbers seem to have been increasing since the early eighties.  Small pikedominate the current population.  An average Little Bemidji pike weighs 1.5 lb. and is between 18 and 19 incheslong, though pike up to 29 inches were captured.  Growth rates are considered normal.     Bluegill abundance (47.0 per trapnet) is presently the highest of five assessments since 1960.  There hasbeen a very significant increase and the trapnet catch is well above normal for similar lakes.  With the increasein number has come a decrease in average size.  The mean length of sampled bluegills is 5.8\".  Quality bluegillsare still present, some up to 9\" long were netted, but are vastly outnumbered by the \"silver dollar\" size fish. Growth rates appear slow during the first few years of life but increase to \"normal\" after age five, probably afactor of competition for smaller invertebrates due to frequent, successful bluegill recruitment.  A large numberof bluegill were stocked in 1981.  This stocking was undertaken following a low net catch in 1976.  Reasons forthe subsequent population explosion are not clear.     Hybrid sunfish and pumkinseed tend to mirror the success of bluegill in Little Bemidji.  Both species haveincreased and are relatively high in number.  Largemouth bass and black crappie are difficult to assess duringnormal summer test netting.  About all that can be said with confidence about them is that both species arepresent in the lake.     Bullhead species and numbers have remained stable since the sixties.  No black bullhead have been sampled,only yellow and brown.  Those species are \"normal\" in abundance for class 23 lakes.  Mean length for each speciesis about 12\" while mean weight is approximately a pound.     Yellow perch, the primary forage for the lake's northern pike and walleye populations, have decreasedconsiderably and are currently less abundant than any previous survey since 1960, although they remain within the\"normal\" range for similar lakes.  High walleye and northern pike populations during the late eighties may havecropped perch numbers heavily.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.2\" to 9.1\" long with the average about six inches long.     Walleye numbers have decreased significantly since the previous high in 1988.  However, current abundanceremains within the normal range for class 23 lakes.  Average walleye size is about 18 inches in length weighingnearly two pounds.  No fish younger than age four were captured.  Year classes 1987 through 1989 were bestrepresented.  As in past surveys, this year's data appear to indicate sporadic natural walleye spawning success. One non-stocking year class (1988) was  well represented in the catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Bemidji Lake was conducted on July 16-17, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Little Bemidji Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bemidji Lake is a 277 acre, hard-water lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet and a median depth of 29 feet.  Approximately 25 percent of the area, or 69 acres, is less than 15 feet deep.  Most of the shoreline has an abundant aquatic plant growth.  Shoal water soils are mostly of a sandy muck nature with some gravel.  The Otter Tail River serves both as the inlet and outlet to the lake.Test netting results when compared with regional medians show above-normal numbers of northern pike, walleyes, dogfish, pumpkinseeds, bluegills, and rock bass.  Common sucker, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, green sunfish, and black crappie populations are below the respective medians (#/net).  An average redhorse population for the area was present while a high number of perch and hybrid sunfish exist.It would appear that only a moderate amount of fishing pressure occurs.  Eight cottages, eight boats, and one resort were noted during the survey.  There is a public access on the west shore.</p>",
