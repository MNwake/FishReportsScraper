                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, on the Hubbard - Cass County line.  Crystal Lake has a surface area of 197 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Crystal Lake has excellent water quality and fish habitat.  The southeast shoreline is undeveloped and in state ownership.  Crystal Lake provides fishing for walleye, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Crystal Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Middle Crooked, Frontenac, Pickerel, and Waboose.Walleye abundance in Crystal Lake declined from past surveys.  The walleye gillnet catch rate of 1.67 walleye/net is the lowest for all surveys dating back to 1980.  Past walleye gillnet catch rates have fluctuated from 3.50 walleye/net (1986) to 11.33 walleye/net (1990).  All of the walleye sampled had ages corresponding to years of walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR.  Crystal Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  Walleye growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Yellow perch, an important forage specie for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance has been declining since 1980.Northern pike abundance is low in Crystal Lake, however, the pike are large-sized.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 2.00 pike/net is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike catch rates.  Sampled northern pike had an average length of 28.8 inches, with fish sampled up to 38.8 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were fast when compared to other area lakes.Crystal Lake supports good numbers of largemouth bass, though size tends to run small.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during spring electrofishing (109 bass/hour). The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown black crappie abundance to fluctuate from low to high numbers.  Average length of sampled black crappie was near 10.0 inches.Crystal Lake has an abundant bluegill population, though size of fish is small.  Bluegill trapnet catch rates were above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Average size of bluegill was small (5.3 inches).  A few larger bluegill are present, with fish sampled up to 8.5 inches.  Bluegill growth was slow when compared to other area lakes.Other species sampled include pumpkinseed and white sucker in moderate numbers, and yellow bullhead in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tCrystal Lake is located five miles southeast of Akeley on the border of Cass and Hubbard Counties. Crystal has a surface area of 190 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet. A state owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake. The access is shallow and sandy which might be difficult for larger boats. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Crystal Lake is in lake class 35. Class 35 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), with very irregularly shaped shoreline. Other class 35 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Frontenac, Middle Crooked, Pickerel and Waboose. <br> \n\tWalleye abundance has been consistent in previous years, and well above similar lakes. Many Walleyes are a great size for anglers of 14-18 inches, with a number of smaller fish for the future. The average length was 13 inches, with the largest sampled at 24 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and the numbers were in line with similar lakes. Perch had an average size of 8.5 inches and fish sampled up to 10.5 inches. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass were sampled in comparable numbers to previous years, but much higher than other similar lakes. Most fish were small at 8-10.5 inches but fish up to 17.5 inches were sampled. <br> \n\tAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie numbers were in line with similar lakes, and most fish were 7.5-9 inches. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in higher numbers than recent years, and most fish were 5.5-8 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Crystal. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 21, 2020 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, ten sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites.   Nearshore sampling captured seven species of fish including one species intolerant of disturbance; Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 14, 2020, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Crystal Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Crystal Lake is located in the Leech Lake River Watershed.</p>",

Crystal Lake has a surface area of 197 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Crystal Lake has excellent water quality and the southeast shore is undeveloped and in state ownership.  Crystal Lake provides fishing opportunities for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Crystal Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Middle Crooked, Frontenac, Pickerel, and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (8.0 walleye/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14 to 16 inch size range.  Crystal Lake is currently stocked with walleye during even numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find that Crystal Lake has a low northern pike population composed of large-sized fish.  Northern pike abundance has been below the range \"typical\" for this lake class for all surveys conducted on Crystal Lake.  Crystal Lake has abundant sandy shorelines, but lacks the vegetated shallow water marsh areas that pike need for spawning.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 27.6 to 30.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during spring electrofishing (76 bass/hour).   Anglers will find lots of smaller bass in the 12-14 inch size range.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was very low when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are abundant in Crystal and anglers will find good numbers of black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range and bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is located five miles southeast of Akeley on the border of Hubbard and Cass Counties.  Crystal has a surface area of 190 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Crystal has excellent water quality and the southeast shore is undeveloped and in state ownership.  Crystal provides fishing opportunities for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Crystal is in lake class 35.  Class 35 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), with very irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 35 lakes in the Park Raids management area include: Frontenac, Middle Crooked, Pickerel, and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in good numbers for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find most Walleye in the 14 to 18 inch size range.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 25.2 inches.  Yellow perch, and important forage for Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class.  Sampled Yellow Perch had an average length of 8.5 inches with fish measured up to 11.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find an abundant Largemouth Bass population in Crystal, dominated by smaller bass in the 10 to 14 inch size range.  The number of larger bass (>15 inches) sampled in past surveys has been low when compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown the panfish population in Crystal to fluctuate from moderate to abundant numbers.   Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 to 8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 8 to 10 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.7 to 32.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Crystal.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, on the Hubbard and Cass County line.  Crystal Lake has a surface area of 197 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Crystal Lake has excellent water quality and fish habitat.  The southeast shore is undeveloped and in state ownership.  Crystal Lake provides fishing opportunities for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Crystal Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Middle Crooked, Frontenac, Pickerel, and Waboose.Walleye abundance was up from recent surveys with the gillnet catch rate of 8.1 walleye/gillnet above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 15 to 16 inch size range.  The walleye population in Crystal Lake is the result of an aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR.  Age analysis showed that 84% of the walleye sample corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Crystal Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerling during even years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  A few yellow perch were an acceptable size for angling with perch measured up to 11.1 inches.Anglers will find that Crystal Lake has a low northern pike population composed of large-sized pike.  Northern pike abundance has been below the range \"typical\" for this lake class for all surveys conducted on Crystal Lake.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 26.6 to 41.6 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were fast when compared to other area lakes.Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during spring electrofishing (113 bass/hour).  Anglers will find lots of smaller bass in the 12-14 inch size range.    The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes. Panfish are abundant in Crystal Lake and anglers will find good numbers of black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  While bluegill are abundant, anglers will find that size tends to run small, with most bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range.  Bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleyes were sampled in moderate numbers with a catch of 4.8/gillnet.  Walleye were small in size, with an average length and weight of 13.4 inches and 0.8 lbs.  Only 14% of the sample was greater than 14.0 inches, with the largest measuring 23.7 inches.  A strong 1992 walleye year class is present, which accounted for 79% of the walleye sample.  These three-year-old fish are between 12.0 and 13.0 inches in length and in future years will grow larger to provide more of an acceptable size to the angler. Historical walleye gillnet catches have fluctuated: 11.3/net (1990), 3.5/net (1986), and 8.0/net (1980).  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Crystal Lake during even calendar years.  The walleye population in Crystal Lake is maintained through stocking as was evident since only one fish was sampled from non-stocked years.  Crystal Lake has had a history of a low northern pike population, and the 1995 survey showed no difference with a gillnet catch of 0.7/net.  Usually when the northern pike population is low the size of the northern pike is large, and such is the case on Crystal Lake, with an average weight of 5.9 lbs.  Northern pike ranged in length from 21.7 to 31.2 inches.  Preferred northern pike spawning habitat on Crystal Lake is limited, so population levels are low. The abundant white sucker population (10.7/gillnet) provides an excellent forage base for the northern pike.Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (25.1/trapnet).  The size of bluegill was good, with an average length of 6.5 inches and with 28% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill were measured up to 8.1 inches.  Historical bluegill trapnet catches have been higher, ranging from 35.6/net (1986) to 70.3/net (1980).Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers in the trapnets (7.8/net).  Size of the black crappie was fair, with an average length of 7.7 inches, and with black crappie measured up to 10.7 inches.  The previous survey in 1990 had a similar trapnet catch of black crappie.Largemouth bass usually require special sampling to assess their population status, however some general conclusions can be made.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (1.9/net), with fish sampled up to 15.7 inches.  Historical largemouth bass catches have been similar.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (5.8/gillnet) and average size was small (6.3 inches), with the largest fish measuring 7.6 inches.  The yellow perch population provides a forage base for the walleye population but perch are not an acceptable size for angling.  The previous two surveys have had similar yellow perch gillnet catches.Pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
