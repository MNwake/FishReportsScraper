                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is located 3.5 miles northeast of Melrose in Stearns County.  It has an area of 90 acres, an average depth of 8.1 feet, and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  Principal game fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, and bullheads.  A public access is located on the east side, but fishing pressure appears to be low.  Cedar Lake has relatively good water quality and is largely undeveloped due to extensive cattail stands and large areas of shallow wetland.Northern pike are abundant, grow slowly, and are relatively small.  Most pike captured were 4-6 years old, average length was 17 inches, and the largest pike caught was 22.3 inches.  The catch rate in trap nets for pike was typical for lakes similar to Cedar and their growth was slow compared to statewide averages.  A few small yellow perch were captured during the survey, but pike probably lack enough suitable prey to grow quickly in Cedar Lake.Largemouth bass sampled in Cedar Lake were mostly small and grew slowly.  The catch rate was near the average for the Montrose management area, but the average length was only 8.1 inches.  Most bass were 2-5 years old and 5-11 inches long.  The largest bass captured was 17.2 inches long and estimated to be eight years old.Bluegill were the most abundant species caught in the survey, although their catch rate was within the expected range for this lake type.  Bluegill growth was average, but average size (5.1 inches) was smaller than expected, although a few large bluegill (over 8 inches) were captured as well.  Few black crappie were caught, but the average size (8.3 inches) was high and the largest crappie was 12.1 inches. Bullhead catch rates were typical, as was average size.  Yellow bullheads were more numerous and averaged 0.47 pounds, whereas black bullheads averaged 0.65 pounds.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were also caught during the survey, as were brown bullhead and bowfin.Anglers can help improve the fishery by selectively harvesting smaller gamefish and releasing larger ones.  There are currently too many smaller sunfish and pike and too few larger pike and bass.  Harvesting smaller fish may allow the others to grow faster; larger predators help prevent the smaller fish from overpopulating the lake and becoming stunted. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 90 acre lake located 3.5 miles northeast of Melrose in Stearns County. It has an average depth of 8.1 feet, and a maximum depth of 36 feet. Cedar Lake supports a diverse aquatic vegetation community, and much of the shoreline is protected by emergent plants.  Principal game fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  A public access is located on the east side, but fishing pressure appears to be low. Cedar Lake has relatively good water quality and is largely undeveloped due to extensive cattail stands and large areas of shallow wetland.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike in 2010 (6.7/gill net) was consistent with lakes of similar characteristics.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10 to 30.5 inches, with an average length and weight of 22 inches and three pounds.  Seven year classes of northern pike were sampled, however, most of the pike were age 5 or younger.  Growth rates for both male and female pike were faster than statewide averages.  Forty-five percent of northern pike sampled in gill nets were greater than 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nA local sportsman's club stocked walleye fingerlings in Cedar Lake (1,000 fingerlings in both 2004 and 2005, and 2,200 fingerlings in 2008).  The success of these stocking efforts appears limited as no walleye were caught during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of yellow perch in 2010 (2.7/ gill net) was similar to previous surveys and remained below the expected range.  Yellow perch averaged about six inches in length and growth rates were consistent with statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass sampled in Cedar Lake were mostly small and grew slowly. The catch rate was about half the average for the Montrose management area.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5 to 20 inches and averaged 11 inches in length. One 18 inch largemouth bass was determined to be 11 years old. Even though the catch rate of largemouth bass in Cedar Lake was less than other lakes in the area, previous electrofishing performed at night have yielded high catch rates.  Given their small size and relatively slow growth rates it is thought that largemouth bass are still abundant in Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species caught in the survey.  The catch rate was within the expected range for this lake type.  The average size (6.5 inches and one quarter pound) was near the expected, and a few large bluegill (over eight inches) were captured as well.  Bluegill grew relatively slow, taking between seven and eight years to reach six inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nAs in previous surveys, few black crappie were caught; but the average size (ten inches) was high.  The largest crappie sampled was eleven inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly one yellow and one black bullhead were sampled by gill nets in 2010 compared to relatively higher catches in the past.  Similar declines in bullhead catches were also seen in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers included brown bullheads, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help to preserve the fishery in Cedar Lake by selectively harvesting smaller gamefish and releasing larger ones. Harvesting smaller fish may allow the others to grow faster; and larger predators help prevent the smaller fish from overpopulating the lake and becoming stunted.</p>",

However, the fish were generally small and showed below average growth. Age classes 2-5 were well represented. Yellow Bullheads (many of which were over 10 inches) were sampled at a rate of 16.8/trap net, nearly 4 times the local median. Black and Brown Bullheads were also sampled during this assessment. None were found in the 1979 survey. All panfish, (Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Black Crappie) appeared to be much more abundant than in 1979 and all, except Black Crappie, far exceed the local median. Bluegills up to 9 inches long were sampled. One Largemouth Bass was sampled. Yellow Perch and Bowfin (dogfish) are also present. No Common Carp were sampled in 1985.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The most important species taken by gill nets were Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  There were no significant changes in abundance from the last survey.  The numbers and size of Northern Pike sampled were average (for lake class 33); catch rate was 6.0/gill net and average weight was 1.9 pounds.  Pike ranged in size from 16 to 26 inches with a median length in the 18.0-18.9 inch length group.  Ages 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were present.  The sample was dominated by females, with 14 females and 3 males sampled.  Growth was average.  Yellow Perch numbers and average size were below average. Yellow Perch were caught at a rate of 1.7/ gill net and average weight was 0.1 pounds. Lengths of the fish ranged from 5.0-6.4 inches. Important species sampled in trap nets were Black, Yellow, and Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Catch rates and weights were average for all three species of bullhead.  Length ranges of bullheads were 8-10.9 inches for Black Bullhead, 5.0-11.4 inches for Yellow Bullhead, and 10.0- 12.9 inches for Brown Bullheads.  Trap net catches of Green Sunfish and Pumpkinseed indicated high numbers of small fish for both species.  Green Sunfish had a catch rate of 3.0/trap net, and Pumpkinseed were caught at a rate of 19.3/trap net, twice the third quartile value for this species.  Modal length was 3.5-3.9 inches for Green Sunfish and 3.0-3.4 inches for Pumpkinseed.  The catch rate for Bluegill was 43.3/ trap net, with an average size of 0.2 pound.  Length distribution was bi modal, with highest numbers at 4.5-4.9 inches and 6.5-6.9 inches.  Age 2-7 were present, and growth was average.  Black Crappie had a catch rate of 2.0/trap net and an average weight of 0.25 pound.  Lengths from trap nets ranged from 6.0-9.4 inches, although smaller and larger Black Crappie were sampled in gill nets.  Three age groups (2-4) were found, and growth was average.</p>",
