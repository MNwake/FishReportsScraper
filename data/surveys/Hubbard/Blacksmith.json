Blacksmith Lake is a designated trout lake and is stocked annually with 5,600 rainbow trout fingerlings.  Blacksmith Lake is open to fishing during the summer trout season only.  No winter-time angling is allowed.  A unimproved county access is located on the west shore of the lake.  The entire shoreline is county tax-forfeited land with two leased cabins on the lake.Good numbers of rainbow trout were sampled during the 2005 survey (10.5 trout/gillnet).  Sampled rainbow trout ranged in length from 10.9 to 18.5 inches, with an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Rainbow trout gillnet catch rates in previous surveys have ranged from 4.0 trout/gillnet (1984, 1995) to 17.5 trout/gillnet (1987). </p>",

I think the main reason is that there has been no developed road to the lake until recently.  This lake is located within Hubbard County tax forfeit land.  There is one hunting lease located on the west shore of the lake, which has a cabin located on it.  The fellow who has the lease said he would be happy to make a good landing on the southwest shore with a bulldozer which he owns.  The road that goes to the lake now ends at a steep decline to the lake.  I have talked to the County Commissioners in regards to this project, and they are 100% in favor of it.  The only thing that will have to be done is to get a permit from the Hubbard County Board of Appeals in order to make an access and parking lot.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blacksmith Lake is a small, 37 acre coldwater lake located seventeen miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Blacksmith is a designated trout lake and is stocked each fall with 5,600 rainbow trout fingerlings.  Blacksmith is open to fishing during the summer trout season only, no winter-time angling is allowed.  An unimproved county access is located on the west shore of the lake.  The entire shoreline is county tax-forfeited land with two leased cabins on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout abundance was down, with the gillnet catch rate of 2.0 trout/gillnet the lowest recorded for all surveys since 1984 and well below the current management goal of 10.0 trout/gillnet.  Rainbow trout abundance was higher in the two previous surveys in 2000 (17.0 trout/gillnet) and 2005 (10.5 trout/gillnet).  Sampled rainbow trout ranged in length from 4.9 to 15.7 inches.  Golden shiner were sampled in very high numbers (29.0 golden shiner/trapnet).  Golden shiner have been sampled in low to moderate numbers in past surveys, but their abundance has increased substantially since the 2005 survey.  There is a concern that the abundant golden shiner population could be impacting the trout population by competing for food with fingerling trout. <br> \n</p>",
