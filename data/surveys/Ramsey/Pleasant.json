                "narrative": "<p>The most abundant species captured above state and local medians were black crappie, walleye, and carp.  A significant decrease appears to have occurred in the bluegill and yellow perch population since 1981.  No black bullhead and low numbers of northern pike and white crappie were found, but since the 1981 survey their numbers didn't appear to have changed significantly.  Black bullhead have declined dramatically since 1976.  Golden redhorse, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are believed to be present but in low abundance.  Two adult (age II) smallmouth bass were taken in trapnets; growth of these fish was fast.  Young-of-the-year smallmouth were sampled in high numbers by shoreline seine.  Shorthead redhorse numbers were up significantly from 1986 in trapnet sets.  The redhorse, catfish, and smallmouth bass were probably introduced with water pumped from the Mississippi River by the St. Paul Water Utility.  Natural reproduction of the redhorse and catfish has not been documented.  Northern pike numbers are low.  Significant numbers of channel catfish were taken in gillnets; none were seen in the 1986 assessment.  White crappie numbers appear relatively stable as do the numbers for black crappie.  Bluegill numbers are nearly the same as in 1986.  Walleye numbers appear stable, and self-sustaining as six year-classes were represented.  Only the 1985 year-class could have been the result of stocking.  Walleye growth is above average for the area.  Muskellunge numbers were similar to 1986.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This lake is located within the City of North Oaks, a gated community. North Oaks was initially the summer retreat of railroad baron James J. Hill.  Most of the land surrounding the lake was developed as upscale, single family housing by the North Oaks Association, which retains ownership of the land.  The immediate shoreline of the lake is owned by the St. Paul Water Utility, which uses the lake as part of the water supply system for the City of St. Paul and suburbs.  Large volumes of water are pumped from the Mississippi River and flow through Pleasant on the way to water utility treatment and distribution facilities.  The source of zebra mussels was believed to be via the aquifer. The presence of Eurasian water milfoil was confirmed in 2010. The water utility currently operates two hypo-limnetic type helixor aeration units in the lake into which they inject ferric choride to remove phosphorus. Pleasant Lake is a legislative fish reserve set aside for the purpose of fish propagation purposes in 1941. The lake has been closed to angling since that time. The lake's use as a source of fish for distribution to other waters outside the watershed is prohibited by DNR rules to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species present in the lake. The lake has also been used as an egg source for Muskellunge propagation. The St. Paul Water Utility pumps water for household use from the Mississippi River through Pleasant Lake and then downstream to other lakes. This pumping has transported fish that are normally riverine species into Pleasant Lake. Several species of fish common in the Mississippi - Channel Catfish, White Bass, and Silver Redhorse were noted in this system of lakes in 1992.  It was believed these fish entered the lake via the water utility aquifer. Zebra mussels were confirmed present in the lake in 2007.  Pleasant is regularly used as a source of display fish for use in the Minnesota State Fair live fish exhibit. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>By comparison with the range of the first and third quartiles of the local median for the appropriate gear, Pleasant Lake's relative fish population status can be judged.  A judgment as to the change of the fish population since the 1976 netting cannot be precisely made.  Netting in both years was done at similar times and with the same number of sets, but the net locations for the 1976 assessment is not available.  General changes can be assured.Population levels of white sucker, northern pike, bowfin, and pumpkinseed are lower than expected for Metro Region lakes.  Oppositely, yellow perch, walleye, and black crappie populations are high.  The walleye catch of 7.4 fish per gillnet lift is slightly over twice the state average.  Carp, black and yellow bullhead, bluegill, and white crappie populations fall within the expected (or average) range for local lakes.  Spring netting to remove panfish indicates the muskellunge populations as being well established in good numbers.Two year-classes of stocked walleye are present.  The 1979 year-class is dominant due to a heavier stocking in that year and a greater vulnerability to the gear.  Compared to statewide averages the growth at II annulus was fast for these stocked fingerlings.  Four age-classes  (II, IV, V, and VI annulus) of bluegill are present in approximately equal proportions.  Growth of the younger two ages was fast and that of the older two, average.  Black crappie of age classes I through V annnulus are well represented with I and II annulus fish being most abundant.  Growth at I, II, and III is fast for black crappie and average for IV and V annulus fish.  Compared to statewide averages, growth of both the Wisconsin and Shoepac strains of muskellunge at both I and II annulus must be considered fast.  The most abundant age classes for white crappie were II and III annulus with substantial numbers of I annulus fish also present.  Compared to local growth rates, I and II annulus growth was fast and at II annulus, average.Gillnet catches for yellow perch and northern pike probably indicate no major change in the respective populations from 1976 to 1981.  There does appear to be a shift to larger size perch from 1976 to 1981.  Length-frequency comparison shows a slight change in the modal length group and a substantial increase in the catch of perch 8.5 inches and larger.  Walleye population levels may safely be assumed to have substantially increased during this period due to stocking activities.Trapnet catches of white crappie indicate no particular change in levels from 1976 to 1981 (1.8/lift vs. 2.2/lift).  While many large white crappie were found in both years, the 1981 catch showed a greater number of smaller younger fish than that of 1976.  Black crappie catches were approximately twice the numbers per set in 1981 than in 1976.  This is also probably no significant change in population levels.  A slight change in the length frequency distribution from 1976 to 1981 was evident with an increase in large fish.  Bluegill catch rates in 1981 were nearly 3 times as high as the 1976 catch.  As opposed to the 1976 netting, the 1981 work caught no bluegills less than 6.0 inches long.</p>",

NO TAGGED WALLEYES WERE CAPTURED IN THIS NETTING, SO EVEN A ROUGH POPULATION ESTIMATE WAS NOT POSSIBLE. AN ADDITIONAL 116 TAGGED WALLEYES WERE RETURNED IN FALL 1985 FOR A TOTAL OF 241 TAG- GED WALLEYES.

A significant decrease appears to have occurred in the bluegill and yellow perch population.  Low numbers of black bullhead, northern pike, and white crappie were found, but since the 1981 survey their numbers didn't appear to have changed significantly.  No adult smallmouth bass were captured, but young-of-the-year were observed in a seine haul as well as four species of shiners, log perch, johnny darter, northern hog sucker, fathead minnow.  Increasing numbers of shorthead redhorse have been observed in this and recent spring trapnettings.  Predator populations of walleye and muskellunge have increased due to fisheries stockings of fish dating back to 1978.  These increased populations along with other factors may have caused the collapse of bluegill and yellow perch, two primary prey species.  At this point, the Pleasant Lake walleye population condition via the length/weight relationship is poor.</p>",
