The bluegill population in Diamond lake is average compared to other lakes of the same classification. Their weight is considered slightly less than average. Over half of the bluegills measured were between 4 and 5.5 inches in length. Black bullheads were sampled in average numbers, and their weight was low. The population of green sunfish was slightly above average, as was their mean weight. Only one black crappie was captured during the survey. Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were captured in low numbers. They were also found to have mean weights lighter than the average. Carp were sampled in relatively high numbers, and had a large mean weight of 2.6 pounds. Golden shiners were of average abundance and average weight.</p>",
