The Yellow Perch index was 103.5 fish/gillnet in 1959.  No Yellow Perch were sampled in the 1990 assessment.  No Bluegill were observed in trapnets in 1959.  In 1990, Bluegill were captured in trapnets at an average of 23.1 fish/net night.  Bluegill exhibited slow growth and PSD was only 6.0%.  Northern Pike abundance has increased significantly (2.75 fish/gillnet to 16.00 fish/gillnet), and correspondingly mean weight has decreased from 3.32 to 1.33 pounds each.  PSD decreased from 73.0% to 19.0%.  No Walleye were captured in either survey.  Largemouth Bass and Black Crappies were sampled in both surveys in numbers too small due to sampling inefficiency to show any definite population shifts.</p>",
