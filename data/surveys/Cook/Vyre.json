                "narrative": "<p>Vyre Lake is located 23 miles north and east of Isabella MN off of Cook County Road 3.  Vyre Lake has an area of 22 acres with a maximum depth of 4.0 feet.  Hog Creek is the primary inlet and only outlet, it flows into the south end of the lake and out the northwest end of the lake; there are also three small spring source inlets.  There are two ways to access the lake.  There is a road pull-off on the north side of County Road 3 between the second and third crossings of Hog Creek (coming from the west), from this pull-off a canoe can be carried 250 yards through bog along an old winter road to the lake.  The lake can also be accessed by parking at the third crossing of Hog Creek (coming from the west) and paddling 0.25 miles downstream to the lake, there may be beaver dams between County Road 3 and the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA lake survey was conducted on Vyre Lake during June 2016 to assess the state of the fish populations and habitat in the lake.  All but a small area in the middle of the lake was covered in emergent or floating vegetation.  Substrates were assessed during this survey with muck and decaying organic matter dominating offshore areas; harder substrates such as boulder, rubble, and gravel were observed near upland portions of the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch rate was near average when compared to other similar lakes.  The average weight of Northern Pike sampled was just over 2 pounds, above average when compared to similar lakes.  The average length was 18.5 inches with fish up to 31.5 inches long sampled; 28 percent of the catch was longer than 24 inches.  Natural reproduction appears to be consistent, nine year classes were observed during the survey with the 2014 year class making up 35 percent of the catch.  Northern Pike growth was fast when compared to other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was very low compared to similar lakes with a total of two sampled.  Average weight was 0.16 pounds and the lengths were 6.9 and 7.3 inches.  Growth was fast when compared to other area lakes.  White Sucker catch was average, but weight was high relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nVyre Lake is a small, scenic, remote lake.  Access is difficult, but the lake does provide a decent opportunity for Northern Pike with average numbers and slightly above average size.  Yellow Perch are also present in the lake, but at the time of the survey were not abundant enough to be worth targeting.  The lake is heavily vegetated and a many waterfowl were observed during the survey.   <br> \n</p>",
