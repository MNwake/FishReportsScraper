Stocking was not done in 2009 because the YOY catch of walleyes was 27.0 fish/hour in fall electrofishing.  In 2010, fryling walleyes were stocked at a rate of roughly 75 fish per littoral acre (58,955 fish).  The lake was electrfished on 10/6/10.  The catch rate of YOY walleyes in 2.0 hours of sampling was 47.0 fish/hour, the highest catch rate since electrofishing began in 1999.  The catch rate of walleyes age 1 and older was 2.5 fish/hour.  The YOY fish ranged from 6.1-7.2 inches, averaging 6.1 inches.  Ages 1-3 and 5-6 were each represented by one fish each.  These fish ranged from 6.5-19.0 inches.  Based on the apparent success of the 2010 stocking, we are hopeful that the proposed 2012 fryling stocking will be as successful.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Eighteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 25-26, 2022, with all 18 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 8 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 4 stations. Twenty three species were sampled, including seven species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Banded Killifish, Logperch, Smallmouth Bass, and Rock Bass. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of August 9th, 2021, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This special assessment in 2017 was done to evaluate the stocking of walleye frylings (approximately 1-2 inches long).  Although walleye numbers were the second highest ever recorded (3.8/gill net) they were still below average for this type of lake.  Average length was 17.8\", with 98% measuring 12\" or larger.  Of note is that natural reproduction can be significant in some years and 48% percent of all aged fish came from non-stocking (i.e. natural reproduction) years, including 27% from 2013; these fish averaged 16.2\". <br> \n <br> \nAs noted earlier, this survey was evaluating the success of walleye fryling stocking in Washburn Lake.  Statewide fryling (not fry or fingerling) production has ended because there was no overall improvement in walleye populations stocked with frylings during an extensive multi-year statewide study.  Future walleye stocking strategies will be formulated as part of the lake management planning process in 2018-2019. <br> \n <br> \nEven though we were evaluating walleye, data from other fish species was recorded.  Northern pike numbers were average (3.3/gill net), with an average length of 21.3\" and 24% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Although bass are normally sampled by night electrofishing, both largemouth and smallmouth were captured and recorded in this 2017 targeted survey, with smallmouth being slightly more numerous (0.9/gill net) than largemouth (0.5/gill net).  Average size of the largemouth bass was only 10.5\", while the smallmouth were considerably larger with an average length of 15.3\".  These results should be used with caution as it can be difficult to conclude much about the bass populations from the gill net results due to their tendency to avoid nets.  A similar statement can be said about black crappie, as gill net results are typical combined with trap net results for this species.  Black crappie were caught in good numbers (1.1/gill net), with an average length of 7.8\" and 41% measuring 8\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washburn Lake is comprised of three distinct basins totalling 1554 acres.  The maximum depth is 111 feet and roughly 42% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Development is moderate with 16.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile, based on the 1993 lake survey.  The Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground is located at the south end of the eastern basin.  A public lake access is co-located here also.  Soils in the shallow water are mainly sand and gravel with muck, marl, boulder and rubble also present.The aquatic plant community is diverse and provides important habitat for fish as well as other species.  Extensive beds of bulrush and wild rice were present in the eastern basin in 1993.  Bulrush fringes were common along many shoreline areas in the north and west basins.  Many conspicuous gaps in bulrush beds along the shoreline were noted in front of developed lots.  The remaining bulrush beds need to be protected because they provide erosion control, help regulate nutrients and provide quality spawning habitat for various fish species like black crappies, bass, sunfishes and perch.Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and tullibee were all present in numbers considered \"average\" for lakes similar to Washburn.  The catches were within historical ranges for Washburn, except for tullibee, which was present in larger numbers than in past nettings.  Black crappie numbers were in the \"high\" category when compared to both similar type lakes and to previous catches in Washburn.  Catches of walleye, yellow perch and yellow bullhead were in the \"low\" category when compared to similar type lakes but were typical catches for Washburn Lake.  About 44% of the walleyes sampled in 1998 gillnets were from the 1995-'96 year classes; years when walleye stocking was not done.  All species examined exhibited good growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washburn was stocked with 57,005 walleye frylings on June 6th, 2012.  Fryling stocking began in Washburn in 2010 and this strategy is scheduled to continue in alternate years through at least 2014.  Night electrofishing to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes was done on September 27th, 2012. The total sample time was 1 hour and 34 minutes, resulting in a YOY walleye catch rate of 32.6/hr run-time.  Since night electrofishing began in 1999, catches have ranged from 0 to 47.0 fish/hr.  The fish ranged in size from 5.8\" to 7.7\", with a mean length of 6.7\".  Since the frylings were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC), they were checked for OTC marks with a total of 17 marked (37%) and 29 unmarked (63%), suggesting both frylings and natural reproduction contributed to the 2012 year class.  Walleyes that were age 1 and older were captured at a rate of 25.5/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 7.9\" to 23.0\" and had a mean length of 12.7\".  </p>",

Average size of the pike was 19.9\" and most of the fish (74%) were below the 22-26\" protected slot.  Electrofishing would have given us a better idea of bass size and numbers in Washburn, but it was not done in the 2021 survey.  Both Largemouth (1.1/gill net) and Smallmouth bass (1.0/gill net) were sampled.  Smallmouth size was a little better than Largemouth, with an average length of 14.2\" and 67% measuring 12\" or larger.  Fish up to 18.9\" were sampled.  Largemouth averaged 10.2\" and 24% were 12\" or larger.  The largest fish measured was 15.0\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary management species, and various life stages have been stocked over the years, fingerlings being the most recent in 2021.  The 2021 catch of 2.9/gill net was below average for this type of lake.  Average length was 19.9\" and 93% of the fish were over 12\".  Aging the fish revealed that 58% of the fish came from stocking years. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this type of lake.  Black Crappie (0.9/gill net) and Bluegill (11.5/trap net) both offer opportunities for anglers, but it may be harder to find a meal of fish at this time with a higher proportion of smaller fish.  Average length for Crappies was 8.3\", with 28% measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill average length was 6.5\", with 39% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

The total sample time was 47 minutes, which resulted in a YOY walleye catch rate of 6.4/hr. run-time.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 47.0/hr. run-time.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 4.3\" to 6.7\", with a mean length of 5.6\".  Walleyes age 1 and older were captured at a rate of 5.1/hr. run-time.

The lake reaches depths of 111 feet, with 48% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk average reading of 11 feet.  A 31 site DNR forestry campground is located on the south end of the east basin.  A public access is also located there.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked in to Washburn Lake since the 1940's.  Since that time walleye fry, fingerlings, and now since 2010 frylings (1-2 inch long fingerlings stocked in early summer) have been stocked.  Washburn also has substantial natural reproduction of walleyes documented by an annual fall electrofishing survey.  The 2013 (a non-stocked year) electrofishing survey captured YOY (young of year) walleyes at 35.7/ hr. run-time.  The 2013 gillnet survey catch of 3.5/net was below average compared to similar lakes.   Despite being stocked and have natural reproduction Washburn's walleye gillnet catch has been in the low category for all surveys except in 2003.  Average size was 17.3 inches and 2.0 lbs, with the largest walleye captured being 25 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers at 4.9/gillnet.  Most northern pike were quite small with an average size of 19.8 inches and 1.8 lbs, with 14% at least 24 inches in length.   <br> \nAlso sampled in the survey were yellow perch in low numbers.  Black crappies were sampled in average numbers, but the size was small with an average of just 5.8 inches.  Two species also sampled in average numbers in this survey were tulibee (cisco) and burbot.  Both species are an indicator of good water quality since they need cool well oxygenated water.  Burbot were captured for the first time since 1951. <br> \n <br> \nWashburn Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of Eurasian watermilfoil.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike population was good.  The black crappie, bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass were present, with large bluegill sunfish and black crappie present in the netting.The brown bullhead net catches indicate above average populations since the catch rates exceeded the third quartile of the Brainerd area median for lakes in Group 8 with areas of >1,074.The northern cisco, northern pike, white sucker, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye levels are average as indicated by the net catch rates with net catches falling between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd area median for similiar type lakes.The bowfin and black crappie net catches indicate low population levels with catch rates below the first quartile of the area median.The northern pike population levels is up compared to the 1983 survey.  The 1988 gill net catch of 5.4/lift is compared to 3.6 in 1983.  The length-frequency range was excellent with fish from 10.9-33.9 inches in the net catches.  The bulk of the population were small in the 15-16 inch size classes.  They exhibited slow to average growth rates.The northern cisco and white sucker population levels showed a decrease in population in comparison to the 1983 survey.  Northern cisco were 1.25 in 1983 and 0.9 in 1988.  White sucker was 1.5 in 1983 and 0.7 in 1988.The largemouth bass population level remained about the same in 1988 and in 1983 with < 1/lift in both gill and trap nets.The black crappie population remained average with a few nice fish in the 11 inch range.  The black crappie exhibited average to fast growth rates.The yellow perch population level was average with a slight decrease shown in comparison to the 1983 survey in gill net catch rates.  It ws 5.3/lift in 1983 and 4.1 in 1988.  They also exhibited very slow growth rates.The walleye population level shows an increase over the 1983 gill net catches.  It was 1.83/lift in 1983 compared to 2.8 in 1988.  The management objective after the 1983 survey was to get the walleye numbers per gill net lift to at least the statewide average of 3.60.  The length-frequency range being excellent with sizes from 9.5 thru 25.9 with the bulk of the population in the 18.0 thru 20.9 inch range.  The year classes present showed average growth rates as compared to statewide averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Washburn was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff beginning 26 June 2023.  Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites with three sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 14 sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 24 native species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 26-28 June 2023 by IBI Program Staff.  Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bowfin, Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was near the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 22 lakes and the average length was 7.0 inches, with 65% over 7 inches and 20% over 8 inches.  The number of Black Crappie sampled per net was near the 75% quartile for Lake Class 22 lakes and the average length was 8.7 inches with 11% (3 out of 27) over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Washburn Lake on October 4, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 79 survey sites evenly spaced every 400 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 72.8 (? 2.4) out of 100 possible. A score of 72.8 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderate (70-80). Approximately 50 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 56.8 (?3.1) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Poor (50-66), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 89.2 (? 0.7) with High (85-92) habitat quality. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates an exceptional fish community is present in Washburn Lake and it is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washburn is a 1554 acre lake which includes three distinct basins.  Maximum depth is 111 feet.  About 42% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet, including a majority of the acreage found in the easternmost basin.  Development is moderate, with nearly 300 homes/cabins present along almost 18 miles of shorelime.  The Clinton Converse DNR Forestry campground is located at the public access on the eastern basin.  Soils in shallow water areas are mainly sand and gravel.  Areas of muck, marl and detritus, as well as boulder and rubble (3-10\") rock areas are present in scattered locations.  The aquatic plant community is diverse and provides important habitat for the lake's fish population.  Extensive beds of bulrush and wild rice were present in the eastern basin in 1993.  Bulrush fringes were common along many shorelines areas in the north and west basins.  Also conspicuous were numerous gaps in bulrush beds along shorelines with developed lots.  Bulrush beds provide some protection against shore erosion by reducing wind/wave action and they also provide important spawning habitat to fish species like bass, sunfishes, crappies and perch.Compared to similar type lakes, there were no fish species found to have \"high\" abundances in 1993.  Black crappies, bluegills, rock bass, tullibees, white suckers and brown and yellow bullheads were present in \"average\" numbers.  Growth of bluegills and crappies was good.Species caught in \"low\" numbers in 1993 included northern pike, walleyes, yellow perch and largemouth bass.  Both northern pike and walleyes had several age classes sampled and had good growth.  Yellow perch were slow growing.  Largemouth bass are poorly sampled in stationary nets.  Only one was taken in 12 trapnets.  However, many young bass were caught in shoreline seine hauls, suggesting good reproductive success.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washburn Lake is a 1,554 acre lake located about three miles northwest of Outing in Cass County.  The lake is comprised of 3 distinct basins.  A public access is co-located at the Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground at the south end of the eastern basin.  Based on 1993 data, development is considered moderate with 16.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  The maximum depth is 111' and about 48% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders, and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 39 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline, however just as common are numerous gaps in these beds along shorelines with developed lots.  The remaining emergent plants should be protected as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2003 walleye catch of 5.3/gill net was the highest catch to date, but is average when compared to similar lakes.  Twelve different year classes were represented with natural reproduction accounting for at least 54.7% of all walleyes sampled in gill nets.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 16.9\" and 2.0 lbs in 1998 to 18.5\" and 2.2 lbs in 2003.Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2003 at 5.3/gill net, which is the second highest catch to date.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 17.7\" and 1.2 lbs in 1998 to 19.4\" and 1.5 lbs in 2003.  Growth was average with 7.6% of these fish measuring at least 24\".The largemouth bass abundance of 1.1/gill net and 1.3/trap net was the highest to date and is relatively high compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 20.2/hr with an average length of 11.6\" and 53.3% measuring at least 12\". Bluegill abundance was also the highest to date at 18.9/trap net.  Growth was relatively slow.  Black crappies were present in low numbers (0.1/gill net and 0.3/trap net) when compared to similar lakes and were near the lowest catches to date on this lake.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The 2003 tullibee catch was the highest to date at 3.7/gill net and is comparable to similar lakes while yellow perch abundance has been low for the last 5 nettings, including this one.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washburn is a 1,554 acre lake located about three miles northwest of Outing in Cass County.  The lake is comprised of three distinct basins.  A public access is co-located at the Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground at the south end of the eastern basin.  Based on 2009 data, development is considered moderate, with17.2 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  The maximum depth is 111 feet and about 48% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline, however just as common are numerous gaps in these beds along shorelines with developed lots.  The remaining emergent plants should be protected as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and providing essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The invasive plant, eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in the lake near the public access in late summer of 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye catch (3.67/GN) again dropped into the \"low\" category, where it has been in eight of the nine nettings, 1951-date.  Fourteen year classes were sampled, with 33% being from recent years with stocking (2005, \u001906, \u001908) and 56 % from years with no stocking, values similar to those from 2003.  Average size was 17.5 inches and 2.08 lbs. compared to 18.5 inches and 2.2 lbs. in 2003.  Growth remained in the \"average\" category.  Fall electrofishing produced a catch of 27.0 young per hour, the first time since 1999 the catch has exceeded 20/hr. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch (3.07/GN) also declined compared to 2003 (5.27/GN).  Pike size increased slightly to 20.1 inches and 1.95 lbs.  Growth was in the \"average\" category.  Eleven percent of pike from gill nets were at least 24 inches long and four percent were at least 30 inches long.  Young pike continue to dominate the gill net catch, with ages 2 and 3 being most abundant in the 2009 catch. <br> \n <br> \nLaargemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 13.20/hr in spring electrofishing, down from 20.2/hr in2003.  Of bass at least 8.0 inches long, 43% were at least 12 inches long and 14% were at least 15 inches long.  Bass averaged 11.97 inches and had \"average\" growth.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets for the first time in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was unchanged compared to 2003.  Fish up to 9.8 inches long were sampled and 16% were at least 7.0 inches long.  Bluegill growth was in the \"average\" category.  Black crappie abundance rose to be in the \"average\" category.  For a combined sample from gill and trap nets, 94% of the fish were at least 8.0 inches long.  Crappie growth was also in the \"average\" category in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was similar to 2003 and remained well below the first quartile value for the lake class, where it has been since 1968.  Four age classes were sampled and growth was in the \"slow\" category.  The tullibee catch increased to the \"high\" category in 2009 but was statistically similar to 2003.  Two age classes were present among fish aged and most were age 1+.  Growth was \"average.\" <br> \n</p>",

Most fish species were caught in average numbers, with enough edible sized fish and trophies to keep things interesting. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish looks like the best bet for a fun outing.  Black crappie numbers were average to high, with an average size of 8.3\" and 65% measuring 8\" or larger.  Blue gill numbers were average (7.1/net), with an average length of 6.7\" and 42% measuring 7\" or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nGamefish numbers were mixed.  Walleye numbers were below average at 2.4/net.  Average size was 16.6\" and 72% were 12\" or larger.  Walleye are currently stocked as fryling size (1-2 inches long) in even numbered years.  An encouraging thing to note is that 56% percent of all aged fish came from non-stocking years, including 28% from 2013; these fish averaged 11\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (4.3/net).  With an average length of 18.3\" and only 5% measuring 24\" or larger, they don't offer much of a fishery.  Fish up to 32.6\" were captured however. <br> \n <br> \nWashburn has both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Catch rates were average and some good size fish were observed.  Largemouth up to 17.1\" and smallmouth up to 18.2\" were captured.  <br> \n</p>",
