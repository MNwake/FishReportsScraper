The lake is located east of County Road 4 and has two user-developed access locations off of the Northeast Grade.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1989, 1991, 1995, 1999 and 2002.  The primary management species is walleye.   \tWalleye abundance of 1.7 fish/gillnet was below the average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance declined from 4.5 fish/gillnet in 1991.  Sixty-five percent (11) of the fish aged were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Mean length was 14.8 inches.  Growth was relatively fast with the length at age 4 of 16.2 inches. \tNorthern pike abundance was low, 0.5 fish/gillnet, but similar to the catches of 1996 (0.3 fish/gillnet) and 1991 (0.5 fish/gillnet).   \tYellow perch abundance was 2.8 fish/gillnet and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.   \tBluegill abundance was 12.4 fish/trapnet and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill abundance has decreased over the past three assessments (39.0 fish/trapnet in 1991 and 22.0 fish/trapnet in 1996).  Mean length of bluegill was  4.9 inches.  Growth was average with a length of age 4 bluegill at 4.4 inches.  Forty-nine percent of the bluegill aged were age 5 with ages 2-4 also present in large numbers. \t  </p>",

Walleye were sampled in 1996 at a rate of 2.5 per lift, which is above the median for lakes of similar type.  However, the catch rate declined from the 1991 value of 4.5 per lift.  The small walleye mean length of 11.0 inches documented in 1996 was influenced by strong representation of age I fish.  All but one aged walleye was born in 1995.     Other species sampled include northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Catch rate for all but yellow perch and bluegill remained relatively stable compared to the 1991 assessment.  Yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 0, but they were sampled by trapnets, while bluegill trapnet catch rate declined from 39.0 in 1991 to 22.0 in 1996.  Size structure was fair for bluegill with 37% of sampled fish longer than six inches and fair to poor for yellow perch with 24% longer than eight inches.  Bluegill exhibited slow growth and strong year classes in 1994, 1991 and 1988.</p>",

Yellow perch have declined with each assessment.  Recent walleye fingerling stocking (1989) was very successful, showing excellent growth.  89% of the walleyes caught represented year class 1989.  This stocking (1 lb/littoral acre) was sufficient to establish a quality stock (15\") of walleye.  Future stocking should reflect this rate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harris Lake is a 67 acre lake within Superior National Forest with 44 (65%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  The lake is located east of Whiteface Reservoir.  The lake is accessible by a rugged 3/4 mile long trail off of the Northeast Grade.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in odd years since 2003.  Harris Lake was last assessed in 2003.  Harris was surveyed during 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 3.7 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (1.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented except 2004, 2005 and 2006.  One exceptionally old individual was captured from the 1989 year-class.  Seventy percent of the walleyes aged were from the 2007 year-class.  Ninety-three percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (0.5) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the northern pike CPUE has been low in Harris and has ranged from 0.3 (1996) to 4.0 (1974).  Average length was good at 28.6 inches and growth was very fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Growth rates of northern pike from Harris are currently the fastest documented in the Duluth Area.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2007 were represented, with one exceptionally large fish (45 inches) from the 2000 year-class sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 23.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (12.4) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 4.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented.  Special 1/4\" trapnets captured 1 YOY bluegill with a length of 1.0 inch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 37.3 per gillnet lift was up substantially from 2003 (2.8) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.4 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Perch from all year-classes from 2003 through 2009 were represented, except 2008.  The 2005 and 2006 year-classes were strong, contributing to 92% of the overall sample size.  Special 1/4\" trapnets captured 1 YOY yellow perch with a length of 1.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included blacknose shiner, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Twenty-three aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Bushy pondweed, large-leaf pondweed and sweetgale were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by floating-leaf pondweed, ribbon-leaf pondweed and the sedge group (80% of transects).  The most common substrate types were boulder, rubble and detritus which were identified along 100%, 80% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Harris is an alkaline, moderately soft water lake with low fertility.   <br> \n <br> \nHarris Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harris Lake is a 67 acre lake within Superior National Forest with 44 (65%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  The lake is located east of Whiteface Reservoir.  The lake is accessible by a rugged ? mile long trail off of the Northeast Grade.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in odd years since 2003.  Harris Lake was last assessed in 2010.  Harris was surveyed during the summer of 2018 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 3.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 17.5 inches and all fish aged corresponded to stocked year-classes, suggesting poor natural reproduction of Walleye in Harris Lake.  However, anglers should expect decent fishing for Walleye in Harris Lake with many stocked year-classes contributing to the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was small at 19.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 13.0 per trapnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but size was small and growth is slow.  Bluegill average length was 4.9 inches, but a few fish over 8 inches were captured.  Bluegill size structure should improve as the strong 2014 and 2015 year-classes mature.  Yellow Perch abundance was average but size was small.</p>",
