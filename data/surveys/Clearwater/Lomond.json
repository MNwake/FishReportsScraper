                "narrative": "<p>Lomond Lake is a 91-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The lake lies within the city limits of Bagley.  There is a city-owned public access in the Bagley City Park off state highway 92.  DNR Fisheries management focuses mainly on bluegill, northern pike and walleye.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lomond Lake is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Little Buzzle, Bungo, Deep, Falk, Johnson, Lone, Peterson, Pickerel, Second and Walker Brook Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are hardwater lakes with regular shaped shorelines.Anglers have a variety of fish that they can have success angling for.  The most abundant fish sampled in the 2003 assessment were bluegill.  Their abundance was lower than what was found in the 1993 assessment, but still more abundant that what you would typically find in a class 28 lake.  There was a wide range of lengths, indicating consistent reproduction, with 52% of the fish greater than seven inches in length.  There has been no change in quality size composition from the previous assessment (1993).  At five years old, Lomond Lake bluegill are almost seven inches long.  This is much faster than normal growth for this lake type, generally around 5.6 inches at age 5.In terms of size and abundance, northern pike are the top predator in Lomond Lake.  Northern pike abundance in 2003 more than doubled from 1993, and are more abundant than other lake class 28 lakes.  Not surprisingly, the size of pike decreased in 2003.  Only 8% of the pike sampled were greater than 28 inches compared to 18% in 1993.  In 2003 the average length and weight were 23 inches and 2.8 pounds.  In 1993 they were 23.6 inches and 3.6 pounds.  To maintain or improve good quality, anglers need to use some restraint when selecting the size of pike for harvesting.  Quality size pike have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  Releasing the larger pike and keeping the smaller ones for eating will help protect the quality of the pike fishery.Walleye are abundant for a lake in this class, and are of quality size.  Fifty-eight percent of the walleye sampled were more than 15 inches long.  Lomond Lake is stocked with fingerling every other year, but there also appears to be contribution from natural reproduction.Since no yellow perch sampled was more than nine inches in length, they are probably of little interest to anglers.  However, smaller perch are very abundant and provide an important food source for predators such as northern pike and walleye.  Another source of food especially for the bigger predators are white sucker.As with many lakes in the Bagley area, there has been much development which has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lomond Lake is a 91-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The lake lies within the city limits of Bagley in Clearwater County.  There is a public access within Bagley City Park, just off of State Highway 92.  DNR fisheries management focuses mainly on bluegill, northern pike, and walleye.  Water quality measurements taken in July, 2013 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to a depth of fifteen feet, with a Secchi disc reading of 9.3 feet.  The 2013 bluegill catch rate of 10.67 fish per trap net (10.67/TN) falls within the typical range for Lake Class 28 (5.69/TN to 40.45/TN).  Bluegill up to 9.1 inches in length were captured during the assessment, with 14% of the catch (gill nets and trap nets combined) exceeding 8 inches in length.  Northern pike abundance in the 2013 fish population assessment exceeded the range of values considered typical of this lake type.  High numbers of small northern pike have been persistent in Lomond Lake over much of its management history.   The average size of northern pike was 21.1 inches in length and 2.0 lbs.  Pike up to 30 inches in length were captured in the assessment, although only 15% of the catch exceeded 24 inches in length.  The 2013 walleye catch rate of 3 fish per gill net (3/GN) is near the upper end of the normal range for Lake Class 28.  Walleye up to 29 inches in length were captured in the assessment, with an average size of 15.7 inches in length and 1.99 lbs.  Fifty percent of the walleye captured were young fish from recent stockings (age-2).  These fish should grow to a size preferred by anglers in 2015.  Black crappie abundance has increased since the previous assessment in 2003.  Catch rates for both gill nets (4.75/GN) and trap nets (1.67/TN) were the highest recorded for Lomond Lake.  Black crappie from six consecutive year classes were identified in the 2013 assessment.  Age-2 and age-3 black crappie comprised 62% of the catch, which bodes well for crappie fishing in Lomond Lake in the near future.  Black crappie in Lomond Lake average approximately 9 inches in length at age-5.  Other species documented in the 2013 assessment were pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lomond Lake is a 95-acre lake, located within the City of Bagley in Clearwater County. A targeted survey was completed on Lomond Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during August of 2023 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. All 7 sites were sampled with a seine and all 10 were completed with backpack electrofishing. A total of 10 species were sampled, which included 1 species (Iowa Darter) captured that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2023 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lomond Lake. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nIn coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Clearwater River Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lomond Lake is a 95-acre, moderately developed lake located in central Clearwater County within the city of Bagley, MN. Lomond has a water clarity of 9 feet and a maximum depth of 45 feet. Emergent vegetation is abundant along the shoreline of this moderately productive lake. The public access is in Bagley City Park and has a concrete ramp with room for 10 to 12 vehicles with trailers. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Lomond Lake in 2023 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased from 2013 and was within the normal range for this lake. Bluegill lengths averaged 7 inches, with a few over 9 inches present. The Bluegill population appears healthy with ages ranging from 2 to 13 years old. It is recommended to keep smaller sunfish and release the majority of larger sunfish to maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remain abundant and above the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 10 to 37 inches and averaged 22 inches. Thirty-eight percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 22 inches, with multiple fish over 30 inches. This gives anglers a good opportunity to catch harvestable sized fish with a chance at larger sized fish. Northern Pike ages ranged from 1 to 12 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance increased from the previous survey in 2013 and was the highest recorded for the lake. Black Crappie ranged from 3 to 12 inches in length and averaged over 9 inches. Black Crappie growth is above average compared to similar lakes in the Bemidji area. <br> \n <br> \nOnly three Walleye were captured and ranged from 18 to 21 inches in length. Walleye abundance decreased from 2013 and was below the lake's historical average. Walleye fingerlings and yearlings are stocked on even numbered years to account for little to no natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance appears low with a few medium sized fish in the population. The small sample size was expected based on previous standard surveys. From the few Largemouth Bass captured, lengths ranged from 12 to 15 inches and averaged about 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance decreased from 2013 and was less than the historical average for the lake. Yellow Perch are an important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Other species sampled during the survey included Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, Lomond Lake is infested with Zebra Mussels, an aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

The only Walleye captured were large fish probably from early stockings. Northern Pike were captured in moderate numbers with most fish being larger than two pounds. Two pike were more than 36 inches in length.Largemouth Bass are present but capture rates were well below expectations. Bluegill of quality size were captured during the survey. Lomond received a lot of pressure by young  shore fishing anglers, though most fish taken from shore are small.</p>",
