The northern pike growth rate is near the statewide average.The bluegill trapnet catch was 23.8.  The sample collected exhibited fair quality indices - PSD=54; RSD-7=19; RSD-8=2.  Their growth rate is not fast.Presumably due to the types of sampling gear used, few largemouth bass or black crappie were collected.  Angling for these species is reportedly good to excellent.The yellow perch gillnet was very low.</p>",
