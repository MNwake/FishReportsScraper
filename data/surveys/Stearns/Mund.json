Yellow Perch numbers are relatively low (0.5/trap net). None were caught in gill nets. Hybrid sunfish is the only centrarchid species found in the netting. The hybrid sunfish population is low (0.5/lift) for this area. Common Carp numbers are average (0.8/trap net) in Mund Lake. Both Black and Brown Bullheads were found in Mund Lake. Black Bullheads have an extremely high population (94.8/lift), are relatively small and of little or no commercial value. Brown Bullheads also have a high population (9.8/lift) of small fish.</p>",
