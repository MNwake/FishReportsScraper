                "narrative": "<p>Colby Lake is a class 40, 70-acre located in Colby Lake Park in the city of Woodbury at the intersection of Lake Rd and County Rd 19.  It has been managed by the FiN program since 2002 with the goal of providing shore fishing opportunities in the city of Woodbury.  Some of the amenities to found at Colby Lake Park are an open-air shelter with 2 picnic tables plus access to a handicap accessible playground and walking trail and tennis courts and a fishing pier. Although Canada Waterweed, Coontail, Flat-stem Pondweed, Narrow-leaf Pondweed and Duckweed were encountered during the survey, Curly-leaf Pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil were the dominant plant species.  Colby Lake has experienced frequent winter kill during its inclusion in the FiN program.  Although winter aeration has been practiced since the last survey and has provided better winter oxygen conditions most years, winter kill has occurred even with the aeration system operating in in 2010 and 2014. The fish community reflects the recent winter kill events and consists mostly of Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid sunfish, Channel Catfish and Yellow Perch.  According to the 2003 creel survey, Colby Lake had relatively low fishing pressure when compared to other East Metro FiN lakes.   <br> \nBlack Bullheads dominated the catches in both gill (43.0/net) and trap (36.0/net) nets, Black Bullhead average size was over 8.0 inches. Recent stockings (2001-2014) of adult Bluegill and Black Crappies, Channel Catfish and Yellow Perch have contributed to Colby's present fish community.  Of the 84 Bluegill captured in trap nets, approximately 71% of the fish sampled were below 6.0 inches, with only a few exceeding 6.0 inches.  Only one of 18 Black Crappies sampled exceeded 8.0 inches. Yellow Perch (N=38) relative abundance (38.0/gill net) was significantly up from the 2007 assessment (0.50/gill net).  Yellow Perch sampled averaged 6.8 inches with the longest fish being 9.61 inches. The increase in perch abundance may be due to the recent decline in the number and composition of the large predator populations that are currently found in Colby Lake. Additionally, nine Channel Catfish averaging 14.5 inches were sampled along with five Pumpkinseed, one Green, one Hybrid Sunfish and one Golden Shiner.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The Fishing in the Neighborhood program (FiN) has been managing it since 2002 with the goal of providing shore fishing opportunities in the City of Woodbury. Black crappie, bluegill northern pike and channel catfish have all been stocked in this lake. The City of Woodbury and the South Washington Watershed District installed an aeration system in 2012 to prevent winterkill. The City of Woodbury and the Minnesota DNR are partnering to bring a fishing pier to this lake in 2013. The current fish community is dominated by black bullheads with other species present such as bluegill, black crappie, white sucker, yellow perch, largemouth bass, channel catfish and northern pike. <br> \nThe 2012 netting assessment was conducted at ice-out and was targeting the northern pike population to determine how successful the stocking of this predator has been. Northern pike abundance was low in the 2007 summer survey and again this year it was found to be quite low, with only three fish sampled that measured between 21 inches and 25 inches in length.  <br> \n</p>",

It has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2002 with the goal of providing shorefishing opportunities in the city of Woodbury.  Black crappies, bluegills, and northern pike were stocked from 2002 to 2005 to establish fishable populations.  In addition, Colby Lake Park provides an open-air shelter with 2 picnic tables plus access to a handicap accessible playground and walking trail.  Colby Lake has a fish community consisting of black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and largemouth bass were sampled in relatively low numbers during the 2007 survey.  Five sampled pike averaged an impressive 28.0 inches and 5.2 pounds.  All sampled pike were individuals from the initial adult northern pike stockings in 2004 and 2005.  A lone largemouth bass measuring nearly 17.0 inches was sampled by trap net.  In order to properly sample largemouth bass, spring electrofishing should be performed.         <br> \n <br> \nPast stockings (2002-2004) of adult bluegill and black crappies have contributed to Colby's present panfish community.  Of the 559 bluegills captured in both gill and trap nets, approximately 92% of the fish sampled were below 6.0 inches, with none exceeding 6.5 inches.  Only one of 219 black crappies sampled exceeded 8.0 inches. The lone sampled perch measured 6.2 inches and weighed 0.1 lb.  Additionally, twenty hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish averaged approximately 4.7 and 5.2 inches respectively.       <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads dominated the catches in both gill (142.0/net) and trap (175.0/net) nets.    <br> \nWhite suckers, measuring between 11.0 and 18.0 inches, were also present in good numbers when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
