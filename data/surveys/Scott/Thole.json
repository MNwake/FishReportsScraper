Before development, all three lakes were broadly connected but are now divided by paved roads.  Thole has a maximum depth of 12 feet and early-August water clarity of 2.5 ft.  During open-water months, a fishing pier, integrated into the DNR-owned public access, is maintained for use.  During the winter, an aerator is operated by the O'Dowd Lake Chain Association.  Thole is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil.  A standard survey consisting of gill nets, trap nets, and boat electrofishing was conducted in 2023 to characterize the gamefish community.   <br> \n <br> \nThole is managed for its naturally reproducing Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass populations, and both species were abundant in 2023.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 17.6 to 29.7 inches, with an average of 23.3 inches and 2.81 pounds.  Forty-two percent of the Northern Pike sampled in 2023 exceeded 24 inches, so good harvest opportunity is available.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 6.8 to 19.9 inches, and 33% of the catch exceeded 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant in the 2023 survey, but size tended to be small.  Only 23% of the catch exceeded 6 inches, and the largest fish 7.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was lower than average, but good sized fish were found.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.8 to 11.2 inches, and 15% of the population exceeded 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Thole Lake was conducted on June 20-22, 2023 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured seven species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 28 lakes and the average length was 5.7 inches, with 21% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Thole Lake has a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Thole Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

It is believed that these were fish that migrated into Thole Lake from O'Dowd Lake through the connecting culvert during the present high water period. Lack of smaller sized walleye in the catch indicates that recent fry stockings have not contributed significantly to the present population. Northern pike abundance and size is normal for this type of shallow, rural southern Minnesota basin. Average size of northern pike sampled was 23.1 inches with about one-third of the fish being 25.0 inches or larger. Growth rate for northern pike is good. Bluegill were very abundant with the average size being 6.1 inches in length. Approximately 7.4 percent of the bluegill present in the sample were 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappies averaged 7.3 inches in length and pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 6.2 inches. Both species were observed in normal abundance. Largemouth bass are present but the largest individual sampled was only 12.0 inches long. Black bullhead were also present and in very high abundance with an average length of less than 7.5 inches.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1984, but this has not created a very good population. Only one walleye was sampled during this survey. Black bullhead are the most abundant species present in the lake. Their numbers are high even for such a shallow eutrophic lake. Bluegill and black crappie are also abundant for this type of lake, but they have low average lengths. Bluegills average 5.3 inches and black crappies average approximately 6.5 inches. Northern pike are currently slightly above average abundance for this lake. Over 20% of the pike sampled were larger than 25 inches in length. Largemouth bass are present, but in low numbers.</p>",

A fish population assessment was due as the last survey was in August of 1999.Black bullhead are extremely abundant in Thole Lake and are the dominant species as measured by biomass.  The catch of 72.8 per gill net is near 75th percentile levels for lakes of this type.  Black bullheads averaged 11 inches and 0.10 pounds.  Brown bullheads are also present in the population.Northern pike are less abundant larger and older than they were in the 1999 survey.  The catch of 5.2 per gillnet is just above median levels for this lake type.  Mean length and weight is 23.2 inches and 2.52 pounds.  Relative weight averaged 79.    A relative weight value of 100 indicates 75th percentile condition or plumpness, above average condition, for the species.  Pike average age is 4.3 years due to a strong 2001 year-class (constituting 54% of the sample).The catch of 12.2 black crappie per gillnet is just below the 75th percentile level.  The crappie gillnet sample averaged 6.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  All crappies sampled were from the 2001 year-class (age-IV).  The largest individual caught was 7.6 inches.  Growth rates were below average.Walleye fry stocking was discontinued after the 1999 survey reaffirmed past evaluations indicating walleye were not surviving in Thole.  Only 3 walleye were sampled in this survey, 1 from the 1999 year-class and 2 from the 2000 year-class-the last year fry were stocked.  The catch of 20.9 bluegill per trapnet is just below 75th percentile and levels.  Most of the population originates from the 2001 year-class (71%).  Bluegill averaged 5.76 inches and 0.17 pounds.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.5 inches.  Growth rates were below average for this lake class.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets.  However, data from a small sample indicate that bass abundance is near median levels and size structure is good.  Bass averaged 1.41 pounds with the largest bass sampled being 18.7 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Relative weight averaged 102.  Growth rates were about average.Yellow perch are historically not abundant in Thole and none were sampled in this survey.  Golden shiner were present in 75th percentile levels.  White sucker, pumpkinseed, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish are also present in Thole Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thole is a shallow, productive 105-acre lake located south of Shakopee in Scott County.  It is bordered to the east by Lake O'Dowd and to the south by Schneider Lake.  Before development, all three lakes were broadly connected; as of this survey, connections are through culverts under paved roads.  Thole has a maximum depth of 12 feet and early-August water clarity of 1.0 ft.  During open-water months, a fishing pier, integrated into the DNR-owned public access, is maintained for use.  During most winters, an aerator is run by the O'Dowd Lake Chain Association.  Thole is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil.  A standard survey consisting of gill nets and trap nets was conducted in 2018 to characterize the gamefish community.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant in 2018, and a broad range of sizes were present in the sample.  Lengths ranged from 17.6 to 33.5 inches, with an average size of 23.8 inches and 3.12 pounds. In 2018, a new regulation for Northern Pike took effect.  As part of the Southern management zone, anglers are allowed to harvest up to two Northern Pike, with a minimum size of 24 inches.  Thirty-eight percent of the Northern Pike sampled in 2018 exceeded 24 inches, so good harvest opportunity is available.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were also abundant in 2018, and harvestable fish are present.  Twenty percent of the sampled fish exceeded 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough boat electrofishing was not conducted in 2018, Largemouth Bass were present in the gill net and trap net samples.  Gill netting and trap netting does not effectively sample Largemouth Bass; however, an 18.5-inch bass was caught.  There is likely a healthy Largemouth Bass population in the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thole is a shallow, productive 105-acre lake located south of Shakopee in Scott County.  It is bordered to the east by Lake O'Dowd and to the south by Schneider Lake.  Before development, all three lakes were connected and undivided by paved roads.  Thole has a maximum depth of 12 feet and early-August water clarity near 2.5 ft.  The oxygen-temperature profile taken then reflected reasonable mixing and moderate oxygen for 2/3 of its depth.  During open water months, a fishing pier, integrated into the DNR-owned public access, is maintained for use.  During most winters, an aerator is run by the O'Dowd Lake Chain Association.  A standard population assessment consisting of gill nets and trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high.  Gillnet catch averaged 7.4/net, which is slightly higher than the 75th percentile value based on similar lakes.  Size ranged from 14.6 to 30.5 inches, averaging 21.8 inches and 2.3 lbs.  Size structure appeared to be balanced with desirable numbers of larger and smaller fish.  Most pike (72 percent) were from the 2008 and 2009 year classes (ages 4 and 5).  Ages ranged from 3-10.  Growth was average when compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Management Area.  Northern Pike were 19.0 inches at age 3 and 23.6 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance (13.4/gill net) was moderately high and near the 75th percentile value (14.7/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes.  Size structure was small.  The majority (75 percent) of Black Crappie were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  The average size was 5.9 inches and 0.1 lbs; size ranged from 4.3-10.5 inches.  The 2011 year class (age 2) dominated the sample (81 percent), however, crappie up to age 7 were in the population.  Growth through age 3 was slightly better than average when compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Age-3 crappie averaged 7.5 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets yielded 22.8 Bluegill per set, which is moderately high compared to other similar lakes statewide.  The size structure was skewed toward larger individuals.  A large proportion (58 percent) of Bluegill were between 6.5 and 7.5 inches.  The average fish was 6.7 inches/0.2 lbs, with a length range of 3.4-8.5 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9.  The most abundant year class was 2007 (age-6) and comprised 32 percent of the sample.  Growth was consistently slow for all ages of Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the 6 total bass sampled this assessment under-represent lake's abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for  <br> \nLargemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were moderately abundant (42/gill net).  They averaged 9.1 inches and ranged from 5.2 to 12.0 inches.  Other species sampled in low-to-moderate abundances were Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \nSummer gillnet sampling turned up one peculiar catch-  one 27.7-inch Shovelnose Sturgeon.  This fish was most likely introduced through illegal stocking and the DNR has no reason to believe sturgeon populations are established in Thole Lake. <br> \n</p>",
