                "narrative": "<p>Gander Lake is a relatively small, remote lake approximately 8 miles northwest of Isabella.  Most of the lake is surrounded by Federal land however there is no developed public access.  There are a number of locations on the lake where there is private access.  The lake supports a natural population of northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish.Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  The average size was about 2.5 pounds with fish up to 4.5 pounds.  Historically northern pike numbers in this lake have been above average and the average size has remained fairly consistent ranging between 2.3-2.8 pounds per fish.Yellow perch were sampled in  below average numbers in 2005 and the catch was much lower than in previous assessments.  Low abundance and the relatively small size of yellow perch in Gander Lake at this time makes this a poor choice for anglers pursuing this species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gander Lake is a 112 acre, moderately soft-water lake in the Kawishiwi River Watershed. The lake is accessible by a nearby logging road, and most of the surrounding land (forest and marsh) is federal forest land. The maximum depth of Gander lake is 5 feet, and there are two outlets and one inlet. Shoal soils are mostly muck or gravel, but limited areas of sand, rubble and boulder are also present. After 20 feet from shore, the bottom is nearly all muck.     At the time of the survey, moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were present at all depths. The only gamefish taken in the test netting were Northern Pike, which was abundant. The nature of the lake (shallow, mucky with moderate vegetation) and the low White Sucker catches suggest partial winterkill conditions.     Spawning areas are rated \"good to excellent\" for Northern Pike, \"poor to fair\" for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, and centrarchid panfish, and \"poor\" for Largemouth Bass.     There are local reports of good Northern Pike fishing, but the lake is only occasionally fished.     Indications of previously lower water levels (1 to 2 feet) were noted.</p>",

The lake has a history of supporting an abundant population of northern pike,  and the 1994 assessment indicated northern pike numbers continue to be high. Northern pike up to 7.7 pounds were sampled with 39% of the fish exceeding 2 pounds, and 22% exceeding 3 pounds.     Yellow perch are very abundant and provide a good forage base for for northern pike, however their small size (6 inch average) and scarcity of fish over 9 inches makes them undesireable to anglers.</p>",
