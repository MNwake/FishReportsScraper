                "narrative": "<p>Eagle is a 113 acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 7.8 feet.  The lake is located six miles north of Duluth, MN with public access via county land along Emerson Road (CR 246).  Prior to this survey, Eagle had never been surveyed by DNR Fisheries.  Eagle was surveyed during the summer of 2016 to gather baseline information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nThe best angling opportunity in Eagle Lake currently appears to be for Northern Pike, but they tend to be small.  Northern Pike abundance of 5.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of gillnet captured Northern Pike was 20.9 inches.  Northern Pike trapnet abundance of 1.3 per lift was also average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and mean length was 18.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead are currently very abundant in Eagle Lake.  Black Bullhead abundance of 202 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  The Black Bullhead trapnet abundance of 488.1 per lift was also well above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Eagle Lake is reflective of a lake that is subject to winter oxygen stress.  The lake likely experiences hypoxic (< 2 ppm dissolved oxygen) conditions during moderate to severe winters, limiting game fish populations.</p>",
