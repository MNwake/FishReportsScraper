                "narrative": "<p>James Lake (69-0734), better known as Jammer Lake, is a designated stream trout lake located 11 miles north of the city of Virginia.  Its access is via a concrete ramp off of old Hwy 53, now Co Rd 106.  This 17 acre lake has a maximum depth of 33.0 feet and the water color is typically clear.\n\nOn June 10, 2013 the water temperature ranged from 62F at the surface to 44F at the bottom.  Adequate oxygen levels for trout were retained to a depth of nearly 20 ft.  The lake contains no inlets or outlets and its shoreline substrates are mostly muck and sand.  Aquatic vegetation is generally quite sparse.  \n\nThis population assessment consisted of two gill nets, eight trap nets, and eight quarter inch trap nets.  Jammer Lake has been stocked with stream trout since 1954.  Rainbow and brook trout were both stocked until 1965; from 1966 to present, only rainbow trout fingerlings have been stocked annually in the fall.    \n\nThe 2013 rainbow trout gillnet catch rate was 10.0 fish/net or 6.5 pounds of fish/net.  This catch rate is on par with previous assessments and slightly better than the average for other stocked trout lakes in the area.  The average fish weighed 0.7 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 9 to 21 inches with an average 11 inches.  The 21 inch fish captured in this assessment is the largest individual rainbow trout that has been netted throughout all of the surveys on Jammer Lake.\n\nForty six largemouth bass were captured in trap nets for a rate of 5.75 fish/net which is well above the normal catch rate of similar lakes throughout the state.  Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 10.0 inches with an average of 7.5 inches.  The largemouth were relatively small with an average weight of 0.2 pounds/fish.  All largemouth sampled were sent to the PCA in St. Paul for VHS testing.  Results were negative so the largemouth from Jammer Lake may be used as a source for largemouth bass stocking in other lakes in the future.  Largemouth are an unwanted species in stream trout lakes.\n</p>",

Its access is via a concrete ramp off of old Hwy 53, now Co Rd 106.  This 17 acre lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet and very clear water.\n\nJammer Lake has been stocked with stream trout since 1954.  Currently, approximately 1500 rainbow trout are stocked every fall.  Due to unwanted species introductions, the lake has been poisoned four times in the past.  \n\nThe 2018 rainbow trout gillnet catch rate was 2 fish/net with a yield of 4.5 pounds/net.  The yield was comparable to other assessments of Jammer Lake.  Sizes were good with the average rainbow measuring 17 inches long, and a few fish over 18 inches sampled.  The average weight was over 2 pounds per fish.\n\nForty seven largemouth bass were captured in trap nets for a catch rate of 11.8 fish/net which was high compared to other similar lakes and higher than most past surveys on Jammer Lake.  Sizes were small with lengths ranging from 6 to 12 inches.  Growth was slow with fish up to 11 years old present.\n</p>",

Jammer Lake is smaller, more bowl-shaped, and has clearer water than most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nJammer Lake was thermally stratified on 05/22/2007 with a surface temperature of 59 F and a bottom temperature of 45 F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 19 ft, where the temperature was 50 F.  Winter oxygen checks in six years from 1955 through 1986 showed that oxygen levels dropped to a maximum of 3-4 ppm in four of these years. <br> \n <br> \nJammer  Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly muck and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are floatingleaf burreed and wild celery. <br> \n <br> \nJammer Lake has been stocked with stream trout since 1954.  It was poisoned four times, in 1954, 1966, 1980, and 1989 to remove fish species (northern pike, black bullhead, white sucker, yellow perch, black crappie) that were interfering with trout management. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 trout population assessment consisted of two standard gillnet sets, four standard trapnet sets, and four small mesh (1/4\" bar mesh) trapnet sets.  Seventeen previous trout assessments, dating back to 1973, consisted of 1-4 standard gillnet sets.  Standard trapnets were also used during 15 of these investigations and small mesh trapnets were used during 13 of these investigations.  All but the earliest two of these investigations were done in late May or early June. <br> \n <br> \nTwo rainbow trout, 17.0\" and 18.4\", were caught in the gillnets in 2007.  These trout had been eating snails and midges.  Scales were not taken from these trout for ageing, as previous collections from this lake had been very difficult to read and we had little confidence in the results.  No trout were captured in the trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of trout by weight in the gillnets in 2007 of 2.5 lb/gillnet was lower than the median trout catch of 6.0 lb/gillnet in all investigations on Jammer Lake, and was lower than the median catch of trout (all trout species combined) of 3.7 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nTen largemouth bass were captured in the standard trapnets in 2007.  These bass ranged in size from 8.0\" to 14.5\".  Aging the scales of these bass was difficult, but they appeared to range from age two to age six and their growth appeared to be faster than normal for age two and three bass, and slower than normal for age six bass. <br> \n <br> \nOne yearling bass, 3.3\" long, was caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2007.  No fish species other than rainbow trout or largemouth bass were caught in any of the sampling nets in 2007.</p>",

Jammer Lake stratifies in the summer and has poor oxygen below about 20'.  Jammer Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1989 to remove all fish, and has been stocked annually since 1990 with rainbow trout.  Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by rainbow trout and largemouth bass.  The trout catch of 24 lb/gillnet was well above the average catch of 12 lb/gillnet for other stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area, which includes Jammer Lake.Two size groups of rainbows were caught in the gillnet.  The smaller group had been stocked as 6\" fingerlings the previous fall and grew to an average length of 10\" when recaptured during this assessment seven months later.  The second group was stocked as 6\" fingerlings in the fall of 1993 and grew to an average length of 15\" when recaptured 17 months after stocking.  All trout were in good condition and had been eating crustaceans (Cladocerans and scuds) and a variety of insect larvae (mostly Chaoborus and Chironomids).  One trout had eaten three cigarette butts.The trapnets captured high numbers of largemouth bass, all of which appeared to be age two.  Growth of these bass was fast by area standards.  The origin of these young bass is unknown since no adult bass were captured, no bass nests were observed, and no bass were present in the 1992 assessment.  Many of the bass were infested with Neascus, also known as \"black spot\".  Also captured in 1995 was a large adult bluegill sunfish and two golden shiner, the first appearance of these species in Jammer Lake since the 1989 reclamation.</p>",

The access is via a concrete ramp off of old Hwy 53, now Co Rd 106.  This 17 acre lake has a maximum depth of 33.0 feet and green water at the time of this survey due to a heavy pollen load. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 1, 2021 Jammer Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 67 F and a bottom temperature of 44 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for trout to a depth of 19.0 feet where the water temperature was 49 F.  The lake contains no inlets or outlets and its shoal-water substrates are mostly muck and sand.  Aquatic vegetation is generally quite sparse.   <br> \n <br> \nPresently, rainbow trout fingerlings are stocked annually in the fall at a rate of around 90/surface acre or 1,500 fish.   <br> \n <br> \nFifty-three rainbow trout were caught in one gill net for a catch rate of 53.0 fish/net with a yield of 28.9 pounds/net.  Both were record values for the lake.   This yield ranked second when compared to other recent surveys of trout lakes in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 15 inches with an average of 11.5 inches.  Sizes indicate at a minimum, two year classes were represented.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used for the first time to assess the largemouth bass population on Jammer Lake.  On the night of May 26, the entire shoreline was sampled.  One-hundred seventy-six largemouth bass were captured for a catch rate of 199.3 fish/hour of on-time.  This set the new record for Tower area lakes where largemouth bass electrofishing can be accomplished.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 19 inches with an average of just over 10 inches, and an average weight of 0.6 pounds.  Ages ranged from 1 to 12 years with the strongest representation from the 2015 year class.  Growth was slow with the average fish taking four years to reach nine inches long.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>James (Jammer) Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Jammer Lake is smaller, more bowl-shaped, and has clearer water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Jammer Lake was thermally stratified on 06/01/2004 with a surface temperature of 57 F and a bottom temperature of 45 F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 19 ft, where the temperature was 50 F.  Winter oxygen checks in six years from 1955 through 1986 showed that oxygen levels dropped to a maximum of 3-4 ppm in four of these years.Jammer  Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly muck and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are floatingleaf burreed and wild celery.Jammer Lake has been stocked with stream trout since 1954.  It was poisoned four times, in 1954, 1966, 1980, and 1989 to remove fish species (northern pike, black bullhead, white sucker, yellow perch, black crappie) which were interfering with trout management.The 2004 trout population assessment consisted of two standard gillnet sets, four standard trapnet sets, and four small mesh (1/4\" bar mesh) trapnets.  Sixteen previous trout assessments, dating back to 1973, consisted of 1-4 standard gillnet sets.  Standard trapnets were also used during 13 of these investigations and small mesh trapnets were used during 11 of these investigations.  All but the earliest two of these investigations were done in late May or early June.Twelve rainbow trout were caught in the gillnets in 2004; ten of these had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings and averaged 9.8\" when recaptured seven months later.  Scales of the remaining two trout were difficult to read.  They were 15\" and 16\" long and appeared to be ages two and three, respectively.  Eleven of the twelve trout stomachs examined contained midges; one stomach was empty.The catch of trout by weight in the gillnets in 2004 of 3.9 lb/gillnet was lower than the median trout catch of 7.9 lb/gillnet in all investigations on Jammer Lake, but was higher than the median catch of trout (all trout species combined) of 2.5 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Twenty eight largemouth bass were captured in the standard trapnets in 2004.  These bass ranged in size from 6.8\" to 11.6\".  Aging the scales of these bass was difficult, but they appeared to range in age from two to eight and their growth appeared to be faster than normal for age two and three bass, and slower than normal for age four and older bass.Four yearling bass, 3\" long, were caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2004.  No fish species other than rainbow trout or largemouth bass were caught in any of the sampling nets in 2004.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>James (Jammer) Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Jammer Lake is smaller, more bowl-shaped, and has clearer water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Jammer Lake was thermally stratified on 05/18/98 and retained good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 17 ft, where the temperature was 46 F.  Jammer Lake has no inlets or outlets.  The lake bottom along the shoreline consists mostly of muck and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are floatingleaf burreed and wild celery.Jammer Lake has been stocked with trout since 1954 and has had the fish poisoned out three times, in 1966, 1980, and 1989.  These fish eradications were made necessary by the unauthorized introductions of fish species which were incompatible with trout management.Rainbow trout numbers in the 1998 fish population assessment (45 trout in one gillnet) were very high, although most of these trout (43) had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings at the average length of 6.5\" and had grown to the average length of 9.8\" in the seven months prior to recapture.  The two older trout captured in the 1998 assessment were 15\" to 18\".  All of the trout captured in 1998 had food in their stomachs, which consisted of bloodworms (82% of trout), flying ants (20%), phantom midges (18%), and caddis nymphs (4%).The catch of trout by weight in 1998 of 19.1 lb/gillnet was much higher than the average catch of 8.8 lb/gillnet in 14 previous gillnettings in this lake dating back to 1973.  It was also much higher than the median catch of 6.0 lb/gillnet in recent assessments on 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.Captured in the trapnets in 1998 were 100 largemouth bass and 4 golden shiner.  Golden shiner were first captured in Jammer Lake in trapnets set in 1995.  Largemouth bass were also captured for the first time in the 1995 trapnets, and were probably the result of an intentional introduction by the public.  Ten of the bass caught in 1998 were age one and averaged 2.4\", which is slow growth for the area.  Ninety of the bass were age two and averaged 6.1\", which is fast growth for the area.  Bluegill sunfish, which were also captured in the 1995 trapnets, were not captured in 1998.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>James (Jammer) Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water. Jammer Lake is smaller, more bowl-shaped, and has clearer water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Jammer Lake was thermally stratified on 06/05/2001 and retained 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of 19 ft, where the temperature was 47 F.  The bottom temperature was 42 F.  Jammer Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Shoal water substrates are mostly muck and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 13 ft; the most common plants are floatingleaf burreed and wild celery.Jammer Lake has been stocked with stream trout since 1954 and has been reclaimed four times, in 1954, 1966, 1980, and 1989.The 2001 fish population assessment consisted of one gillnet, four 3/4\" bar mesh trapnets, and four 1/4\" bar mesh trapnets, all set in early June.  Previously, a lake survey (1995) and 15 population assessments were conducted on Jammer Lake, dating back to 1973.  Most of these were done from late May to mid June, and most consisted of 1-2 gillnets.  Standard trapnets and small mesh trapnets were also used in many of these previous investigations.Fourteen rainbow trout were caught in the gillnet in 2001; nine of these had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings and averaged 10.1\" when recaptured eight months later.  Five trout, averaging 17\", were from earlier fingerling stockings.  Most trout stomachs contained bloodworms, while daphnia and phantom midges were also common.  No other fish species were caught in the gillnet in 2001.The catch of trout by weight in 2001 of 14.6 lb/gillnet was higher than the average catch of 8.8 lb/gillnet in all previous investigations on this lake and was also higher than the median catch of 5.0 lb trout/gillnet (all trout species combined) in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Also caught in the trapnets in 2001 were 32 largemouth bass, two rainbow trout, a shiner, and a stickleback.  Largemouth bass were first captured in Jammer Lake in 1995, and were probably the result of an intentional introduction by the public.  Although the largest bass caught in 2001 was only 10\", natural reproduction is evident by the young year classes present.  Growth of bass captured in 2001 was somewhat slower than normal by area standards.</p>",
