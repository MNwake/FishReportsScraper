The average size of Northern Pike sampled was 22.4 inches and 2.45 pounds, with 20% of sampled fish measuring 25.0 inches or more. Largemouth Bass were sampled above median levels for abundance in both gill and trap nets, with gill net captured fish averaging 13.9 inches and 1.6 pounds. Bluegill were sampled above median levels for abundance, but within the normal catch rate range for this lake. The average Bluegill captured was 5.1\" TL and 0.08 pounds. Pumpkinseed Sunfish exhibited a similar size structure to that of BLG, but were sampled at the highest trap net catch rate ever recorded for this lake. No Walleye were captured during this survey despite recent stocking efforts. Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead and Bowfin were sampled above median levels for abundance for lakes of this type. </p>",

The clarity of the water as measured with a secchi disk during this survey was 11.0 feet recorded on July 19, 2010. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight in lakes of this type. The average size of NOP captured in the combined gear sample was 21.84\" in length and 2.91 pounds. Two NOP 30.0 inches in length or larger were sampled during this assessment, with the largest being 33.03\" TL and weighing 10.0 pounds. Growth rate of sampled NOP was good. No walleye (WAE) or yellow perch (YEP) were captured during this assessment. Largemouth Bass (LMB) also appear to have a good presence in this lake as they were sampled above the median level for abundance in trap nets. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled but in very low abundance in trap nets. No BLC were present in the gill net sample. The average BLC captured was 7.93 inches in length and 0.27 pounds (3.7 fish/lb). Bluegill (BLG) were sampled over the median level for abundance in trap nets. The average size of BLG in the trap net sample was 5.64 inches long and 0.13 pounds (7.7 fish/lb), with the largest individual BLG captured measured 7.28 inches. Pumpkinseed Sunfish (PMK) exhibited a similar size structure to that of BLG. The average PMK sampled was 5.79\" long and 0.16 pounds. (6.25 fish/lb), with the largest individual captured measuring 7.32 inches.</p>",

Bluegill is the most abundant species, and the population has a good size structure.  Lengths ranged up to 8 inches, and 40% were over 6 inches.  Northern pike are also abundant, but generally small - average length was 21 inches and few fish over 25 inches were sampled.  Two thirds of the northern pike sampled had neascus (black spot).  Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers, with lengths up to 19 inches.  Black crappie are scarce, with lengths up to 9 inches, but average length was about 7 inches and only 20% were over 8 inches.  Pumkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers with average lengths of about 6 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Black bullhead was the dominant bullhead species, but yellow and brown bullhead are also present - average lengths for all three species were between 9 and 11.5 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in East Twin Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 30-31 August 2023.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with four sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 30-31 August 2023 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.   Catches were light. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised most of the trap net catch by number and Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, and Bluegill comprised most of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 24 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with only 2% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data will be combined with gill net data from a survey planned in 2024 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The clarity of the water as measured with a secchi disk during this survey was 11.0 feet recorded on July 11, 2016. Northern Pike were sampled in above average levels for abundance in lakes of this type. The Northern Pike population as a whole has a good size distribution for lakes such East Twin and averaged 21.5 inches long. Northern Pike over 30.0\" in length were sampled during this assessment. No Walleye were captured during this survey. Largemouth Bass appear to have a good presence in this lake as they were sampled in above average abundance in trap nets. Black Crappie were sampled in very low abundance in the trap and gill nets. The average Black Crappie captured was a little over 7.0 inches in length. Bluegill Sunfish were sampled in above average numbers in trap nets. The average size of Bluegill in the survey was almost 6 inches long. Pumpkinseed Sunfish were found in good abundance but are small in size. The average Pumpkinseed sampled was 4 inches long.  Although Hybrid Sunfish are increasing their presence in East Twin when compared to previous surveys, the average size of Hybrid Sunfish sampled however is small. Black Bullheads were sampled in low abundance however Yellow and Brown Bullheads were found in moderate numbers with the largest individuals of each species captured measuring 11\" and 12\" respectively. Bowfin were found in average abundance but were small in size. Yellow Perch were observed in low numbers and small size during the survey. </p>",
