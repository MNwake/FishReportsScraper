Growth rates had been good, despite the apparent shortage of yellow perch to serve as forage.  It appeared that natural reproduction had contributed substantially to the walleye population, although stocked year classes were also represented in the catch.Northern pike were present in average numbers and sizes in 2000.  No fish older than four years were taken, and most were under 20 inches in length.  Northern pike also exhibited good growth, even though the only food item found in the stomaches examined was crayfish.West Pope Lake continued to support a bluegill population, with some large fish present.  Gill nets are not the gear of choice when determining bluegill abundance, so it is impossible to say whether bluegill were present in large enough numbers to be worth pursuing.</p>",

No fish older than four years were taken, but most were over 20 inches in length.  Northern pike also exhibited good growth.</p>",
