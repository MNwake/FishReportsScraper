                "narrative": "<p>Eugene Lake is located near the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness about 13 miles northeast of Crane Lake, MN.  The lake is 181 acres with a maximum depth of 64 feet.  The lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and contains stained water with low fertility, typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Forest Service maintains several campsites on the lake and portage trails to surrounding lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNine species were caught during the 2016 survey.  Northern Pike and White Sucker were the most common species in the gill net catch.  Yellow Perch and Hybrid Sunfish were the most common species captured in the special trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish provide an interesting option for anglers visiting Eugene Lake.  Abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The three fish captured were all very similar in size; mean length was 17.8 inches.  The mean weight was 1.98 pounds, which was within the expected range for this lake type.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The largest fish in the sample was 25.2 inches.  The mean weight was 1.74 pounds, which was near the lower end of the expected range for this lake type.     <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Eugene Lake.  Few were captured in our nets, but anglers reported catching good numbers and sizes to the survey crew.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small (only up to six inches).  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers in Eugene Lake.</p>",

The lake is only accessible via portage trails coming from Steep, Fat, Gun or Little Beartrack Lakes.  There are three primitive campsites maintained by the U.S. Forest Service on the lake.  The fish community is simple with only a few species present.  Northern pike are the primary predator species present in Eugene Lake.  The number of pike captured in nets was typical for Minnesota lakes like Eugene.  The average length was 23.0 inches but 27% exceeded 26 inches in length.  One individual was 32.9 inches long and weighed nine pounds.  Pike caught by angling were smaller than those netted averaging only 17.7 inches in length.Eugene Lake is also home to a relatively abundant population of old, slow growing lake whitefish.  The average whitefish captured was 16.6 inches in length and weighed 2.0 pounds. Other species present in the 2001 survey included average numbers of white sucker and below average numbers of cisco and yellow perch.</p>",
