The primary access is a 200 rod portage from a parking area located off the Spruce Road. There are 3 designated campsites located on the lake and another one located in the narrows between Little Gabbro and Gabbro Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nSeven species of fish were sampled during the 2016 survey of Little Gabbro Lake. Yellow perch and rock bass were the only species sampled in above average numbers while walleye, northern pike, black crappie, cisco and white sucker were sampled in below average numbers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2016 (4.0/gill net) were below average compared to other similar area lakes. The average walleye sampled was 12.6 inches and about 4 years old. The largest walleye sampled in 2016 was 20.2 inches which was the only walleye over 14 inches sampled. The 2016 survey indicated a walleye population with lower relative abundance and similar sizes compared to the last survey in 1988. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
