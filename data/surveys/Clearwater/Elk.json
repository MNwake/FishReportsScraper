The population was introduced in 1982 to establish a brood lake to provide a source of Leech Lake strain Muskellunge eggs for production purposes.  As a result the Elk Lake population has reached a healthy balance of size and density and is providing a quality fishery as well.  Special regulations were implemented as this population developed to provide protection for the larger female egg producers, first a 48 inch minimum, and then total catch-and-release. Now that the statewide minimum size limit has been increased to 54 inches there is no need for additional protection and managers are considering dropping the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nIn early May of 2018, large frame trap nets were set into Elk Lake as phase 1 of a two-year assessment to generate a population estimate.  The trap net phase captured 45 adult muskies.  Lengths ranged from 34.1 to 54.0 inches with an average of 43.7 inches.  Ninety-one percent of fish captured were over 40 inches and 11% were over 48 inches.  In Elk Lake, male Muskellunge appear to be maturing at age six and females by age eight.  Phase two of this assessment will be completed in 2019 where the ratio of marked fish in the sample will be used to generate an estimate of the mature adult population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Elk Lake was conducted on August 16-17, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at seven sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Elk Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Elk Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is located on the wilderness drive in Itasca State Park.  A State Park sticker is required to use the Public Access.  Parking at the public access is limited so crowding on the lake, assuming you can find a parking spot, is not a problem.  With the exception of a group campsite, there is no development on Elk Lake, and a feeling of wilderness is enhanced by the bulrush ringed shoreline and the towering pines on the surrounding hills.  Common loons, bald eagles, osprey, and great blue heron are common sites on Elk Lake.  With a surface area of 271 acres, a maximum depth of 93 feet, and  clean clear water, angling, even on windy days, can be a pleasant and relaxing experience.  Walleye, muskellunge, and sunfish are the primary targets for anglers on Elk Lake.  Abundant submerged and emergent vegetation beds, sunken islands, and sharp shoreline breaks offer anglers a multitude of underwater habitat types to explore with angling gear.The walleye population is maintained by fingerling stocking, and anglers who target walleye may be pleasantly surprised with the numbers, and size of fish.  Elk Lake offers some potential to catch a large walleye as well as the potential for numbers of smaller fish.Elk Lake has an introduced population of Leech Lake strain muskellunge.  It is managed as a muskellunge broodstock lake to supply muskellunge eggs, as needed, for statewide production requirements.  The minimum size limit is set at 48 inches to provide additional protection for mature females.  In addition to providing a source of eggs, muskie angling has become popular on the lake.  Because of the excellent water clarity, a trip around the shoreline provides park visitors a good opportunity to at least observe a large muskellunge, if not to actually catch one. Northern pike angling, in and of itself, can be great fun on Elk Lake.  Incidental catches of northern pike also fills the slow periods while angling for other species.  About two thirds of the northern pike sampled in the 2000 assessment were aged to the 1998 year class.  This amounts to a small average size, at this time, but the future looks good for size and numbers of northern pike.The major prey species in Elk lake are yellow perch, tullibee, and white sucker.  Yellow perch are abundant, but most are small.  They are good forage for smaller walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  Tullibee are a high protein forage for larger fish.  The tullibee population level is abundant enough to provide fast growth for large muskellunge, northern pike, and walleye.  White suckers are not abundant but are present and offer an alternative food source for large fish.The panfish community in Elk Lake is composed of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass, with an occasional hybrid sunfish documented.  No black crappie are present in the lake.  Bluegill are abundant but can be difficult to locate in the clear water.  Pumpkinseed are common and may be more susceptible to anglers because they tend to bite more aggressively.  Rock bass are common as well and are often captured while searching for other species.  They are aggressive fighters and have surprised more than one seasoned angler when finally landed.  While the average size of panfish is not large, many will be acceptable to anglers.  Largemouth bass are common but no assessments specifically targeting them have been carried out.</p>",

Several of these species are considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. These \"intolerant\" species included the following: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass. Cisco is another \"intolerant\" species present in Elk Lake; although not collected in this nearshore survey, they are routinely sampled in standard and vertical gill net assessments. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Elk Lake. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 76.3 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4?C (39.2?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1998-2020 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2020. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is in lake class 23, which groups it with similar lakes statewide for fish community purposes.  Lakes in this lake class in the Bemidji area include, Bungo, Ozawindib  (Squaw), Upper Lasalle, Long (trout management lake), Swenson, Grant, North Twin, South Twin, and Buck.  Class 23 lakes are typically deep, clear, hard water lakes with a small percentage of littoral area (that area of the lake less than 15 feet deep).  Elk Lake is within Itasca State Park and access requires a vehicle permit.  The lake water level has been drawn down and larger boats may have difficulty launching at the access.  Winter access is limited to snowmobile, or across Lake Itasca.     During the 1995 assessment walleye were sampled at higher abundance than most comparable lakes, with 65% of the sample more than 15 inches long.  There appears to be some natural walleye reproduction in the lake, but most walleye sampled were from year classes when walleye fingerlings had been stocked.  Six year classes of walleye were sampled, with 62 percent of the sample coming from fingerling stocks in 1988, and 1991.  The largest walleye sampled was 27 inches long.     Northern pike were sampled at average abundance, for lake class 23, though they are larger than those in comparable lakes.  The largest pike sampled was  36 inches long, while the average was 23 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Larger northern  pike have been sampled during previous spring special assessments.     Elk lake has been managed as a muskellunge brood stock lake (used as an egg source) and has a minimum length limit of 48 inches (total length), to protect mature, spawning fish.     Muskellunge have been stocked eight times, since their first introduction in 1982.  Spring Muskellunge netting has not been attempted during recent years, because egg take quotas have been filled by other management areas.      Largemouth bass are frequently caught by anglers, however only a few small bass were sampled during the 1995 survey.Bluegills and pumpkinseed were sampled at a lower abundance than during previous surveys, though they may be more abundant than the 1995 survey suggests.  Cold spawning seasons in 1992, and 1993 may also have prevented reproduction, and resulted in lower catches.  Rock bass were sampled at about average abundance, and weighed about 0.2 pounds.     Yellow perch are abundant in Elk lake though the size is too small to be attractive to most anglers.  Tullibee are abundant and may create an alternate angling opportunity, however whitefish and tullibee netting is not authorized.  Perch and tullibee are contributing to the fishery indirectly by providing adequate forage for a quality walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 271 acre lake located entirely within Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  With a maximum depth of 93 feet, clear water, and an abundance of large fish, Elk is a lake full of mystery and intrigue for anglers.  The undeveloped shoreline, beautiful scenery, and abundant wildlife add to the experience and make this lake an enjoyable place to spend a day, whether angling or not.  A permit is required to enter the state park, and access to the lake is at its north end along Wilderness Drive Road. <br> \n <br> \nElk Lake was selected as one of 24 \"sentinel lakes\" located around the state for the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  SLICE is a cooperative lake monitoring program between DNR Fisheries and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.  The project is designed to help scientists understand, predict, and respond to outcomes of major drivers of change (e.g. development, agriculture, invasive species, climate change) on lake habitats and fish populations.  In order to do this, constant monitoring of Elk Lake's fish community, aquatic habitat, and water quality will be necessary.  Work completed in 2008 represents the first year of sampling under this new program; this report presents results from various 2008 fish sampling efforts. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge is the species most often pursued by anglers on Elk.  The lake has been managed for muskellunge since they were first introduced in 1982; the population is currently maintained by annual fingerling stockings.  Previous creel surveys indicate that approximately 70% of anglers target muskellunge on Elk Lake, which has the distinction of being the only lake in the state with a catch and release restriction.  This special regulation is important for maintaining the population, which serves as a source of genetically pure brood fish for the Leech Lake strain of muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nAnother special harvest regulation on Elk Lake is the 40-inch minimum length limit for northern pike.  The lake meets many of the requirements for producing large muskellunge and northern pike, including low density populations, good growth rates, and an abundance of high quality forage such as tullibee (cisco).  Tullibee are an important species in Elk Lake's fish community, providing a preferred food source for large predators such as muskellunge, northern pike, and walleye.  These predators grow significantly faster when foraging on energetically rich tullibee.  In 2008, tullibee abundance was very good.  In addition, white sucker are present and offer an alternative food source for large fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is maintained by fingerling stocking, and anglers who target walleye may be pleasantly surprised, as Elk Lake offers the potential to catch good numbers of smaller fish as well as the occasional large walleye.  In 2008, walleye captured in gill nets ranged from 14 to 25 inches in length with an average of 17 inches.  Growth rates are typical of other Bemidji area lakes; in Elk Lake, it takes four years of growth for an average walleye to attain a length of 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish community in Elk Lake is composed of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  Black crappie are not present in the lake.  Bluegill are abundant, but few fish greater than eight inches in length are present in the population.  Quality-sized bluegill are disappearing from many of our lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  To maintain some quality in our bluegill populations, anglers are encouraged to show some restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can take the smaller, more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This would help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future. <br> \n <br> \nElk Lake is not known for its yellow perch or largemouth bass, but it appears that anglers targeting these species may have some success.  In 2008, yellow perch abundance was good.  Perch ranged from 5 to 11 inches in length with an average of 8 inches; forty-five percent were greater than nine inches long.  In spring 2008, a total of 26 largemouth bass were captured by electrofishing.  Bass ranged from 7 to 15 inches in length with an average of 11 inches.  Ages 2 through 5 were identified, with age-3 being the most common.  Growth rates of bass in Elk Lake are excellent.  After three years of growth, an average Elk Lake bass is 11 inches long. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elk Lake is a 303-acre, undeveloped lake located in Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  Elk has a mean water clarity of over 7 feet and a maximum depth of 93 feet.  Elk is categorized as a mildly productive, coolwater system and is surrounded by coniferous forest.  A public boat access is located on the north shore of Elk Lake and has room for three to four vehicles with trailers. <br> \n <br> \nElk is one of 25 Sentinel Lakes located around the state which comprise the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) project.  The SLICE project was initiated to record, monitor, understand, predict, and respond to biological and chemical responses related to environmental stressors and climate change.  Elk Lake is upstream of Lake Itasca, connected by Chambers Creek.  On Elk, the primary gamefish species include Walleye, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Special regulations were reverted to statewide regulations for Muskellunge and Northern Pike beginning on March 1, 2020. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance decreased from 2016 and was below average for the lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 26 inches and averaged 18 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an alternate year rotation to compensate for inconsistent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nAccording to the 2018-19 Muskellunge population assessment, about 85 adult Muskellunge currently inhabit Elk Lake.  Muskellunge lengths ranged from 34 to 54 inches and averaged about 44 inches.  Elk Lake has a mature and well-established Muskellunge population with ages ranging from 5 to 22 years old.  Muskellunge are maturing at 6 to 8 years of age depending on sex.  First stocked in 1982, the population in Elk has reached a healthy balance of size and density. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to recent surveys and above average for the lake.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 14 to 37 inches and averaged 24 inches.  Northern Pike averaged just over 3 pounds with 58% being greater than 22 inches in length.  This should provide anglers the opportunity to catch both harvestable and quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased and was the highest recorded since 2005; however, no Bluegill older than age-4 were captured.  Bluegill averaged 4 inches and ranged from 3 to 6 inches. Bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 4 years old, indicating a young population with the potential to grow fast. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was below average for the lake but still considered normal compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Muskellunge.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.5 to 10 inches and averaged 7 inches with 18% of the population larger than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 56 Tullibee (Cisco) were captured and ranged from 9 to 14 inches in length.  Cisco require cold water habitat to survive and are difficult to catch with standard survey nets.  Like Yellow Perch, Cisco are a nutritionally rich forage species for Northern Pike, Muskellunge, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey include Black Crappie, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in Elk Lake.  AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake.  Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
