The population may be supported by reproduction in springs along the north shore of the lake, or by movement of fish into the lake from Monker Creek, a designated trout stream supporting a wild brook trout population.  The long range goal for the lake, as stated in the 2010 lake management plan, has been to maintain a self-sustained brook trout population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set.  This was the first of two assessments scheduled to track attainment of that goal. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout catches in Monker Lake have varied considerably from year.  None were taken in 2010, when the lake was filled with dense growths of filamentous algae that clogged assessment nets.  The 2012 catch met the long range goal for this lake; however, since the entire catch consisted of relatively small one-year-old fish, the lake would not have supported a very satisfactory fishery.  Past assessments have at times taken more larger, older fish.  Brook trout collected in 2012 had reached a mean length of 5.0 inches at the end of their first year.  That compared well with the growth observed for wild one-year-old fish taken in area streams, where the mean length at the end of the first year is 4.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species found in Monker Lake in 2012 included creek chub, fathead minnow, and finescale dace.  Fathead minnows were apparently abundant; 2,520 were taken in eight wire minnow trap sets.  Creek chub would compete with brook trout for available forage, while fathead minnow and finescale dace would have provided forage for brook trout. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
