                "narrative": "<p>Sunset is a 67 acre lake with 36 (54%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 54 feet.  Sunset Lake is located 5 miles west of Twig, MN off County Highway #7.  Sunset Lake has a carry-down access on the north side of the lake.  The primary management species is northern pike, with secondary management for black crappie and bluegill.     Northern pike abundance of 8.8 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length for northerns of 21.5 inches was large.  Growth was average with length at age four of 22.2 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 1998 year class and all year classes from 1995 through 1999 represented. One northern pike was also aged to the 1992 year class.     Black crappie abundance of 2.9 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black crappie was 8.1 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 6.7 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed strong 1997 and 1999 year classes and all but one year class from 1994 through 1999 represented.     Bluegill abundance 4.9 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of bluegill was 5.8 inches.  Growth was average with length at age four of 4.6 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed strong 1995 and 1998 year classes, with all year classes from 1994 through 1998 represented.     Other fish species sampled at low abundance include johnny darter, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye and yellow bullhead.  Because gear used during the summer assessment is not an effective means to sample largemouth bass, it is speculated that bass are present at a higher abundance than indicated.     Due to limited public access on Sunset Lake, fishing pressure is considered light.  Future management of Sunset Lake will be limited by its low fisheries management priority rating.</p>",
