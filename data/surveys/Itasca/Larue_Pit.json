                "narrative": "<p>Larue Pit is a series of four abandoned mines, near the town of Nashwauk, that have been primarily managed for rainbow trout since 1997.  Typical to most pit lakes, the water is relatively infertile and clear.  Iron Range Resources has stocked yearling rainbow trout biannually (spring and fall) since 1997.  Walleye (1998) and adult brown trout (2001) were each stocked once.  This is the first assessment monitoring rainbow trout since stocking had begun. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 1.8 fish/net.  Lengths ranged from 11.6-23.8 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.  There were no rainbows sampled in trap nets.  Despite the difficulty in determining age and growth, length frequencies suggest there were fish from many different stockings (ages) captured in the assessment.  Having different year classes represented in the sample indicates over-winter survival and that angler harvest is not excessive.  These factors are conducive to growing relatively large rainbow trout. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Gill net captured fish ranged from 10.6- 12.3 inches, averaged 11.4inches, and had a mean weight close 0.6 lbs/fish. The origins of the brook trout are unclear, however growth (mean weight and length) was relatively consistent with yearling brook trout.  There is no record of brook trout ever being stocked in the pit on file with MNDNR. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate exceeding the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 3.0-8.3 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Bluegill were sampled in the 1996 assessment, however the seasons and number of nets were inconsistent between assessments.  No accurate comparisons between catch rates can be made.  Growth was consistent with relatively infertile environments, with fish up to age-8 present.\t <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled within the expected range.  The average length was about ten inches, and the longest was 13.2 inches.  One largemouth bass was sampled in the previous assessment.  Growth was consistent with relatively infertile environments, with fish up to age-5 present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate below the expected range.  The two northern sampled had an average length of 20.3 inches.  More northerns were sampled in the previous assessment.  Growth was average, with fish up to age-4 present. <br> \n <br> \nA few walleye were sampled, averaging about eighteen inches.  Growth was good with fish up to age-11 present.  Other species sampled included black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Larue Mine Pit is a complex of four mine pits encompassing about 195 acres with very limited littoral area and a maximum depth of 200 feet.  The 2.2 mile shoreline is mostly tax forfeit land.  There is a park area on the south west corner where the access is located.  Larue Pit has been primarily managed for Rainbow Trout since 1997, though other species of stream trout have been occasionally stocked.  The 2008 lake management plan indicates Rainbow Trout are a primary management species while Bluegill are considered a secondary management species.  The long range management goal is to provide a put, grow and take stream trout fishery in cooperation with Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) which would stock Rainbow Trout at a rate of 5/acre (1,000) in the spring and fall.  The lake management plan was amended in 2011 to adjust the stocking.  The IRRRB vendor's stock is contaminated with bacterial kidney disease and as such cannot be stocked in uncontaminated waters like Larue.  The IRRRB stocking was traded between Tioga Pit and Larue Pit.  Since 2011, DNR has stocked 1,530 Arlee strain Rainbow Trout yearlings annually.  This is the second survey since stream trout stocking had begun.  Rusty crayfish, an invasive species, has been documented at various abundances in past assessments. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were stocked 13 times in 10 years since 2008.  Despite the numerous stockings, no Rainbow Trout were sampled.  Brown Trout were stocked five times since 2008, resulting in one fish being sampled.  However, mine pits tend to be difficult to net due to physical characteristics, water temperature and volume, as trout tend to suspend in cold deep water during the summer.  Anecdotal angler reports suggests trout fishing has been successful and locally popular. <br> \n <br> \nPast Bluegill catches have been relatively high when compared to lakes with similar habitats and characterized by moderately poor size structure, similar to what was observed in 2017.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 7.9 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.  Ages 3 to 8 were represented with growth comparable to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was within the expected range for lakes similar to Larue and above the previous survey.  Lakes with similar habitats are not known to produce abundant Walleye fisheries.  Lengths were favorable, from 17.2 to 26.7 inches with an average length of 22.8 inches.  Age analysis identified five ages present suggesting natural reproduction is evident and may be capable of supporting a modest Walleye population.  Walleye averaged 18.5 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most numerous species sampled in gill nets, above the last survey yet near what was expected.  Sizes were favorable with lengths from 10.5 to 35.8 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  Ages 1 to 6 and 8 present.  Growth was slow early but similar to the statewide average by age 3.  Northern Pike averaged 23.9 inches by age 5. <br> \n</p>",
