                "narrative": "<p>Dinner Lake is located fifteen miles northwest of Park Raids in northeastern Becker County.  Dinner Lake has a surface area of 57 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a township-owned public access on the south shore of the lake.  Dinner Lake provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, panfish, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Dinner Lake is in lake class 28.  Class 28 lakes are characterized as small lakes, with hard water, good water clarity, and a regular shaped shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the 18 to 22 inch size range.  The Northern Pike population in Dinner has been very high since the 2003 survey.  Earlier surveys sampled pike in moderate numbers with a slightly larger average size.  The number of larger Northern Pike (> 28.0 inches) sampled has been very low for all surveys on Dinner Lake.  Dinner Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie. Present and past surveys have shown a moderate Bluegill population with decent numbers of Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie were sampled in low numbers in 2015.  Black Crappie abundance has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers in past surveys.  Largemouth Bass are present, but found in lower numbers compared to other area lakes.  Yellow Perch were sampled in very low numbers compared to past surveys.  Yellow Perch are generally small, and not an acceptable size for angling.  Walleye are present in Dinner Lake, but in very low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Dinner Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of walleyes sampled was 1.9 pounds with 50% of the samples more than 18.0 inches and 50% at 15.0 inches or less.  No walleye natural reproduction is apparent as all walleyes sampled were from two stocked year classes.  Only two of the many stocked years are represented.  Northern pike abundance is comparable to similar lakes in the area.  The average size of the northern pike sampled in 1993 was 23.8 inches and 3.5 pounds, with no northern pike sampled over 6 years old.  Largemouth bass and black crappie were not sufficiently sampled to analyze their abundance or size structure.  The bluegill trapnet catch is low for lake class 28 with 92% of the bluegill sampled exceeding 6.0 inches, with some bluegill up to 10.0 inches.  The yellow perch are very abundant in Dinner Lake and offer a good forage base for the walleyes and northern pike.  The yellow perch are small and slow growing with only 15% of the samples greater than 8 inches.</p>",

Dinner Lake provides angling opportunities for northern pike and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Dinner Lake is in class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers in 2003 with the gillnet catch rate of 14.3 pike/net the highest for all surveys going back to 1961.  Small northern pike dominated the sample as average size was only 19.7 inches and 1.7 pounds.   The number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Past surveys have shown northern pike numbers at moderate levels with a larger average size.  Dinner Lake supports a good panfish population and provides fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The average size of bluegill was less than 6.0 inches, however, enough larger fish are present that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  Moderate numbers of black crappies were sampled, \"typical\" for lakes in this class.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9 to 10 inch range.  Yellow perch were sampled in high numbers but are generally not an acceptable size for angling.  Other species sampled included high numbers of black bullhead, and moderate numbers of rock bass, white sucker, and brown bullhead.</p>",

Shoal water soils are all muck and there is lush growth of wild rice completly around the perimeter of the lake.Fish taken in numbers greater than the statewide median in gillnets were common sucker, northern pike, and perch.  Trapnets indicated that pumpkinseed and bluegill are the most prominent species in this lake.At this time (1961) the lake has two year-round homes and another under construction.  There were four boats located on this lake.Fish stocking:Dinner Lake is mainly a centrarchid-northern pike lake and to manage for walleye here will take annual plants of walleye fry or fingerlings.  Possibly the addition of a predator such as the walleye will help cut down on the number of perch.</p>",
