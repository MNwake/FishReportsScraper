                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is an 835 acre lake managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. The lake's stocking plan was amended in 2010.  Five hundred sixty one pounds of walleye fingerlings will now be stocked annually. The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity is generally low due to algae growth. The lake is a popular fishing and boating destination and receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Three hundred thirty two lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge, which should provide easier travel between the lakes when the water level returns to normal.  In keeping with the lake management plan, a population assessment was conducted utilizing night electrofishing in May and gill nets and trap nets in August. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake currently supports a fishable population of quality sized walleye.  Walleye sampled during the assessment averaged 2.2 pounds and 16.3 inches with lengths ranging from 8.5 to 27.1 inches.  One third of the walleye catch was 20 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, while not as abundant as walleye, were also of quality size.  Sampled northerns averaged 4.8 pounds in weight and 27.5 inches in length. The largest northern caught was 36.8 inches. In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to allow continued harvest of smaller pike while increasing the lakes potential to produce trophy sized fish. <br> \n      <br> \nLargemouth bass were very abundant with a 10.2 inch and 0.7 pound average.  Eighteen percent of the catch exceeded 12 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nBoth bluegill and black crappie numbers are high for the lake type.  Panfish anglers should find plenty of action but those looking for a meal may have to sort through some smaller fish.  Thirty nine percent of the crappies sampled were 8 inches or longer, a harvest size acceptable to some anglers.  However, less than 5% of the bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in South Center Lake was conducted on July 31-August 1, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations, but five stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and dense vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter and Mimic Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in South Center Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that South Center Lake is impaired for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The northern pike was slightly low at 3.08 per set but of fair to good size avging 2.81 pounds.  The yellow perch was below its local median figure of 24.27 at 9.00 fish per set.  The golden shiner at 7.25 was high.  The bluegill at 114.88 was extremely high and of small size.  The black crappie at 27.00 per set was slightly high and of small to average size.  The pumpkinseed was low while the hybrid sunfish was very low.  Young of the year largemouth bass were taken during shoreline seining operations.  The black bullhead was very low in the trapnets but was very high in the gillnet catch.  The brown bullhead was low while the yellow bullhead was slightly low.  All bullheads were of fair to good size.  The white sucker had a low population figure.  NOTE:  Based on the first 9 gillnet sets, there was no significant change in the walleye, northern pike or yellow perch populations as compared to the 1982 population assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is a 835 acre lake managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. The lake has been stocked biennially with walleye fingerling since 1995.  The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity is generally low due to algae growth. The lake is a popular fishing and boating destination and recieves high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Three hundred thirty two lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was being replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge, which should provide easier travel between the lakes.    In keeping with the lake management plan, a lake survey was conducted on the week of July 25th, 2005 utilizing gill nets, trap nets, seining, and electrofishing.       The lake currently supports a fishable population of quality sized walleye.  Walleye sampled during the assessment averaged 3.8 pounds and 21.1 inches with lengths ranging from 8.7 to 28.6 inches.     Northern pike while not as abundant as walleye were also of quality size.  Sampled northerns averaged 5.6 pounds in weight and 28.6 inches in length. The largest northern caught was 38 inches. In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are protected from harvest.  The regualtion goal is to allow continued harvest of smaller pike while increasing the lakes potential to produce trophy sized fish.     Largemouth bass were very abundant with a 10.8 inch and 0.8 pound average.   Bluegill were less abundant than in the previous sample while black crappie were at record numbers.  Both should be plentiful and of acceptable size.  Crappie averaged 8 inches and most bluegill were between 6.5 and 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is an 835 acre lake managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. The lake's stocking plan was amended in 2010.  Five hundred-sixty one pounds of Walleye fingerlings are now stocked annually. The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity is generally low due to algae growth. The lake is a popular fishing and boating destination and receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Three hundred-thirty two lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge, which should provide easier travel between the lakes when the water level returns to normal.  In stride with the lake management plan, a standard survey was conducted utilizing night electrofishing in June and gill nets and trap nets in August of 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake currently supports a fishable population of quality size Walleye.  Walleye sampled during the assessment averaged 1.6 pounds and 16.3 inches with lengths ranging from 7.9 to 23.1 inches.  One-third of the Walleye catch was 17 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were more abundant than Walleye and were also of quality size.  Sampled Northern Pike averaged 5.4 pounds in weight and 28.5 inches in length. The largest pike caught was 38.9 inches. In 2003, a special Northern Pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to allow continued harvest of smaller pike while increasing the lake's potential to produce trophy-sized fish. <br> \n      <br> \nLargemouth Bass were very abundant and, with an 11.3 inch and 0.9 pound average, larger than in all prior assessments.  Twenty seven percent of the adult bass caught exceeded 14 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nBoth Bluegill and Black Crappie numbers are high for the lake type.  Panfish anglers should find plenty of action but those looking for a meal may have to sort through some smaller fish.  In the trap nets, both Black Crappie and Bluegill displayed gains in size compared to the previous assessment.  Forty-five percent of the crappies sampled were over 8 inches while 20% of Bluegill were 7 inches or longer, harvest sizes acceptable to some anglers.</p>",

South Center is managed for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie as secondary species. Angler concern over statewide declines in Northern Pike quality led to calls for additional special regulations in the early 2000's. A public meeting regarding Northern Pike management on South Center took place in the fall of 2002. The consensus was to implement a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit starting in 2003. The regulation allows the harvest of smaller fish while increasing the lakes potential to grow more of the medium to large fish it historically produced. <br> \n  <br> \nAn ice out trap netting survey was conducted on South Center Lake during the middle of April 2022 to obtain length frequencies of pike in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the protected slot limit. Fifty trap net lifts over a five day period sampled 30 Northern Pike.  Pike ranged from 9.2 to 37.0 inches in length in 2022 compared to 20.3 to 31.5 inches in length in 2019.  Pike averaged 24.5 inches in length in 2022 compared to 24.7 inches in 2019. Future ice out surveys will be conducted to better understand Northern Pike length frequencies.  etention of the current slot limit of 24-36 inches is recommended until the results of further investigations suggest otherwise. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is an 835 acre lake managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. The lake's stocking plan was amended in 2017.  Seven hundred-twenty nine pounds of Walleye fingerlings are now stocked biennially.  The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity is generally low due to algae growth. The lake is a popular fishing and boating destination and receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Three hundred-thirty two lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge providing easier travel between the lakes.  In stride with the lake management plan, a targeted survey was conducted utilizing night electrofishing in May and gill nets and trap nets in August of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake currently supports a fishable population of quality size Walleye.  Walleye sampled during the assessment averaged 3.3 pounds and 20 inches with lengths ranging from 7.8 to 28.1 inches.  Most of the catch were 5 year olds attributed to the 2014 fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were more abundant than Walleye and were also of quality size.  Sampled Northern Pike averaged 4.4 pounds in weight and 27 inches in length. The largest Pike caught was 34.4 inches. In 2003, a special Northern Pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to allow continued harvest of smaller Pike while increasing the lake's potential to produce trophy-sized fish. <br> \n      <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant and, with a 13.7 inch and 1.6 pound average, far larger than in all prior assessments.  Half of the bass caught exceeded 14 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nBoth Bluegill and Black Crappie numbers are high for the lake type.  Pan fish anglers should find plenty of action but those looking for a meal may have to sort through some smaller fish.  Both Black Crappie and Bluegill decreased in size compared to the previous assessment.  Fourteen percent of the Crappies sampled were over 8 inches while 7% of Bluegill were 7 inches or longer, harvest sizes acceptable to some anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is an 835 acre lake in southern Chisago County best suited for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie.  Although much of the lake is less than 15 feet (561 acres or 67%), the lake has a maximum depth of 109 feet.  Water clarity is low, with visibility to only 3 feet.  A high amount of shoreline and watershed development is present, that includes 332 lake homes.  The lake is a popular fishing and boating destination and receives use from all types of recreational users.  The public access is often at capacity.  In 2023, a fisheries lake survey was conducted that consisted of night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass on May 16 and gill and trap netting from August 7 to 11 to evaluate the fish population.  The previous fish survey on South Center Lake was conducted in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nSpring nighttime electrofishing sampled 67 Largemouth Bass.  Lakes in the Chisago Chain commonly produce bass electrofishing catch rates in excess of 100 fish per hour.  The catch rate of 57 per hour in 2023 compares to 51 per hour in 2019.  Bass ranged from 7.8 to 19.9 inches with a 14.3 inch average. The average weight of bass was 1.6 pounds.  Bass over 14 inches included 50 percent of the total catch. Aging evaluation identified ten year classes.  Anglers should catch good numbers of moderate sized bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net (0.2/net) and trap net (0.8/net) catch rates were low for the lake and similar area lakes.  Pike sampled in gill and trap nets ranged from 18.5 to 34.3 inches.  Average weights were 7.3 and 6.1 pounds in gill and trap nets, respectively.  Although numbers were low, average size exceeded that of most area lakes.  Angler concern over declines in pike quality led to a public meeting for South Center in the fall of 2002.  The consensus was to implement a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit starting in 2003.  This regulation remains in place today. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate of 8.4/gill net, was above average compared to similar area lakes.  Angling pressure for crappies is heaviest in winter and early spring.  Overall crappies ranged from 4.4 to 12.2 inches in trap nets and 5.2 to 9.5 inches in gill nets.  Average lengths were 8.0 and 7.4 inches in trap and gill nets, respectively.  Twenty-three percent of crappies exceeded 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly seven Walleyes were captured during the 2023 survey compared to 48 in 2019.  The gill net catch rate decreased from 2.4/net in 2019 to 0.2/net in 2023.  Walleye sampled in gill and trap nets ranged from 12.7 to 26.3 inches.  Currently, Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 729 pounds in even years.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catches also remained low, with a catch rate of 2.8 fish per net in both 2023 and 2019.  Perch lengths ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches, with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Perch are a common prey species of Walleyes, and perch catch rates over 8 per gill net are preferred when managing for Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch rate was 62.9 per net.  Lengths ranged from 0.5 to 7.4 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Although the average size is small, angler catch rates should be above average and fun for kids. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the 2023 survey include Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill as secondary species.  This lake has a history of being very productive for panfish (crappie and sunfish), often having overabundant populations of small panfish.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly since the early 1970's.  A DNR lake survey was conducted in the summer of 1995 to evaluate fish populations. Fish were sampled by standard methods including gill nets, trap nets, electrofishing, and shoreline seining.     Northern pike were more abundant in 1995 than they had been in previous surveys.  In a system like South Center where water levels fluctuate, northern pike can often be a \"boom and bust\" species, dependent on spring water levels for spawning success. The average length of northern pike in the survey was 22 inches, although some 35\"+ fish are present.     Numbers of walleye were above average for this lake type.  The survey showed good numbers of 16-19\" walleye, along with larger fish measuring up to 28\".  The average weight was 1.9 pounds.       Largemouth bass abundance was well above average, yet high bass numbers are common throughout the Chisago chain of lakes.  The average largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing was 10 inches and 0.7 pounds, which is somewhat smaller than the average for Chisago Lake, but larger fish (up to 18\") are present.     Black crappie and bluegill numbers were both down from previous surveys, but were still above the normal range for this lake type.  Since crappie reproductive success varies from year to year, average sizes of crappie can vary also as different year classes become dominant in the population.  In 1995 the highest number of black crappies were in the 6-inch range, but there were also fairly good numbers of 10-inch fish.  Bluegills averaged 6.2 inches, with lengths up to 8 inches.     One small carp was seen during test netting, and was found to be a young-of-year.  This was the first carp ever seen in this lake in DNR nets, although carp are thought to have entered the lake in 1986 during a high water period.     Other species present in South Center Lake include bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, white sucker, bullhead (black, brown, and yellow species), pumpkinseed sunfish,and yellow perch.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Center is a 835 acre lake managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  The lake has been stocked biannually with walleye fingerling since 1995.  In keeping with the lake management plan a fish population assessment was conducted on July 24-28, 2000 utilizing gillnets, trapnets, seining, and electrofishing.            The lake supports an abundant population of good sized walleye.  Walleye sampled during the assessment averaged 3 pounds and 20.2 inches with lengths ranging from 11.9 to 27.6 inches.          Northern pike while not as abundant as walleye were also of quality size.  Sampled northerns averaged 4.3 pounds in weight and 26 inches in length. The largest northern caught was 45.3 inches.           Largemouth bass were likewise numerous with a 9.9 inch and 0.6 pound average.  Bass electrofishing was likely conducted before the larger females moved into shore where they could be captured.           Panfish as a whole were less abundant than in past surveys but still plentiful.  Average lengths for black crappie, bluegill, and yellow pearch respectfully were 7.2. 5.5, and 5.9 inches.            The public access although large can be filled to capacity at times.  Angling pressure ranges from moderately high to very high for all species.</p>",

Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish; Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Yellow Perch, Bluntnose Minnow, Spotfin Shiner, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Johnny Darter, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from the August 2019 lake survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for South Center Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. South Center Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",
