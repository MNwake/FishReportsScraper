White sucker dominated the catch by weight, followed by walleye, northern pike and yellow perch. Low numbers of all species were caught in the trapnets, with yellow perch, walleye and norther pike the most abundant, followed by black crappies and white sucker. Northern pike sizes were small, walleye sizes were average and sucker sizes were large. Walleye reproduction has occurred, but most walleye caught were from stocked years. Walleye growth is average for the area, and yellow perch growth is faster than average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations in Cedar Lake are dominated by walleye, followed by white sucker, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Low numbers of cisco and bluegill sunfish are also present.  Some large walleye (24\"), sucker (24\"), and perch (12\") are present.  Growth of northern pike and yellow perch is good.  Walleye growth in past assessments was average, but in the 1994 assessment was considered slow by area standards.  Natural reproduction and recruitment of northern pike, sucker, and yellow perch is very good.  Most strong year classes of walleye are from stocked years, but there was good natural reproduction in 1990 and 1991.The catch of young-of-year walleye in the 1/4\" trapnets was very high (67/net), as was the catch of young-of-year perch (725/net).  The average size of the walleye (3.0\") was not much larger than the average size of the perch (2.1\"), making it unlikely that the walleye will be able to eat perch of this relative size.  By comparison, the average size of walleye in Lake Vermilion on the same date was 3.7\" and the average size of perch was 1.5\".In the gillnets, the total numbers of fish (21.4/net) and total weight of fish (25.3 lbs/net) seems about average for the area.  In the trapnets, the total numbers of fish (3.7/net) and the total weight of fish (5.4 lbs/net) is lower than average for the area.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are deep, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is typical of these lakes except that it is shallower (45 ft) than the lake class average maximum depth of 77 ft.Cedar Lake was stratified thermally during the 1998 assessment and had good oxygen (2 ppm) to a depth of 23 ft, where the temperature was 63 F.  Cedar Lake has one inlet that drains a swamp.  The outlet to Fall Lake has a rocky, braided channel and logs and debris that limit fish movement.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly boulder and rubble, with some sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft; the most common plants are Canada waterweed and largeleaf pondweed.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 30 fish/net (39 lb/net) was higher than normal for this lake class, and was similar to the average catch of 25 fish/net (34 lb/net) in nine previous gillnettings in Cedar Lake dating back to 1957.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1998 of 5 fish/net (3 lb/net) was quite low, but was similar to the average catch of 4 fish/net (3 lb/net) in four previous trapnettings in Cedar Lake.Fish populations in 1998 were dominated by walleye and white sucker, followed by northern pike and yellow perch.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.No walleye were found in Cedar Lake in the initial lake survey in 1957, and their numbers were very low in 1973, when the lake was next netted.  Walleye numbers increased after 1973, probably as a result of the stocking of small walleye fingerlings in the mid-to-late 1970's.  Walleye numbers in 1998 (10.0/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 12.5/gillnet in nettings from 1976 through 1994.  Walleye sizes in 1998 averaged 15\" and the largest was 27\".  Most walleye caught in 1998 were ages three and four, from strong 1995 and 1994 year classes.  Growth of walleye captured in 1998 (11\" at age three, 13\" at age four) was normal for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1998 (3.0/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 3.7/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1998 averaged 21\" and the largest was 26\".  Growth of pike captured in 1998 (18\" at age three, 21\" at age four) was normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1998 (8.8/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Perch numbers were quite low in early nettings on Cedar Lake and have gradually increased over time to their present abundance.  Many young-of-year perch were also caught in the small mesh trapnets in 1998.  Perch sizes in 1998 averaged 7\" and the largest was 12\".  Growth of perch captured in 1998 (8\" at age three, 9\" at age four) was faster than normal for the area.Neascus (black spot) was present on half of the northern pike examined in 1998 and was also present on a few individuals of the other fish species examined.  Neascus is a parasite in the skin of fish that is native to the area and quite common.  It cannot infect humans and is usually removed by filleting and is killed by cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are deep, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is shallower (45 ft) than the lake class average of 77 ft.Cedar Lake was thermally stratified on 08/19/2002 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) to a depth of 24 ft, where the temperature was 60 F.  The bottom temperature was 52 F.  Cedar Lake has one inlet that drains a local swamp.  The outlet to Fall Lake has a rocky, braided channel with logs and debris that limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rubble, with some sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft; the most common plants are Canada waterweed and largeleaf pondweed.The 2002 fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Previously, three Fisheries lake surveys and seven fish population assessments dating back to 1957 consisted of 2-9 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (5-20 sets) were used during five of these investigations.  Most of these investigations were done in August, except that beginning in 1994 trapnets were set in June or July to better sample panfish populations.  Small mesh trapnets were set in 18 summers during the period 1977 through 1998.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2002 of 26.5  fish/gillnet (30.2 lb/gillnet) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 23.3 fish/gillnet (35.1 lb/gillnet) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 3 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2002 of 11.9 fish/net (15.9 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 4.1 fish/net (3.3 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake, due to higher trapnet catches of yellow perch and white sucker in 2002.Fish populations in 2002 were dominated by walleye, followed by white sucker, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Smallmouth abundance may be underrepresented in the gillnet and trapnet catches.Walleye numbers in 2002  (13.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 9.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since walleye were first observed in 1973.  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 13.3\" (1.0 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 14.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2002, caught in a trapnet, was 29.3\" (9.8 lb).  Walleye were present from 13 year classes in 2002, with age two walleye (from the 2000 year class) being the strongest.  Growth of walleye captured in 2002 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.White sucker numbers in the gillnets in 2002 (3.4/net) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 7.4/net in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker numbers in the trapnets in 2002 (2.2/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 0.3/net in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2002 averaged 18.4\" in the gillnets and 19.9\" in the trapnets, which was near the third quartile for both gear types.Northern pike numbers in 2002 (2.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 19.1\" (1.7 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 19.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002, caught in a trapnet, was 28.2\".  Most pike in 2002 were age two, from a strong 2000 year class.  Pike scales were difficult to read, but growth of pike captured in 2002 appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2002 (6.1/gillnet and 6.1/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class in both gear types, and were higher than the median catches of 2.2/gillnet and 1.6/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2002 averaged 8.3\" (0.3 lb) in both gear types, which was about the third quartile for this lake class; the largest perch was 12.1\".  Perch recruitment was fairly even each year.  Perch scales were difficult to read, but growth of perch captured in 2002 appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2002 (1.0/gillnet, 0.1/trapnet) were similar to their numbers in the 1998 fish population assessment, when they were first observed in this lake.  Smallmouth sizes in 2002 averaged 14.5\" (1.9 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class; the largest smallmouth was 16.5\".  Growth of smallmouth captured in 2002 was faster than normal by area standards.Neascus (black spot) was found on many of the game fish examined in 2002.  In addition, yellow grub was present on some of the yellow perch and bass tapeworm was found in some of the smallmouth bass.  All of these common parasites are  native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are killed at temperatures used to cook fish, and are usually removed by filleting the fish.Rusty crayfish were captured in Cedar Lake for the first time in 2002, mostly in one gillnet on the south central shoreline.  Rusty crayfish are a large, aggressive crayfish that are native to the Ohio River Valley and were introduced to the area about 15 years ago, probably by anglers using them for bait. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are deep, have irregularly shaped shorelines, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is shallower than most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake was thermally stratified on 8/21/2006 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 feet, where the temperature was 66 F.  Cedar Lake has one inlet that drains a local swamp.  The outlet, to Fall Lake, has a rocky, braided channel with logs and debris that limits fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Cedar Lake are mostly boulder and rubble, with some sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 9 feet; the most common plants are Canada waterweed and largeleaf pondweed. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 fish population assessment used nine gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Previously, three fisheries lake surveys and eight fish population assessments dating back to 1957 used 2-9 gillnet sets.  Six of these previous investigations used trapnets (5-20 sets).  Most of these investigations were done in August, except that trapnetting was done in June or July in 1994, 1998, and 2002 in an effort to better sample panfish populations.  Panfish catches did not increase during these three investigations, and trapnetting was moved back to August in 2006.  Small mesh trapnets were used in 18 summers during the period 1977 through 1998 to sample young-of-year fish. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2006, as in most previous investigations, were dominated by walleye, northern pike, and white sucker.  Low numbers of other fish species were caught in 2006.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked in seven years from 1941 through 1970, but walleye were absent in the initial 1957 investigation and were present in low numbers (1.0/gillnet) in the next investigation in 1973.  Walleye fingerlings and fry were stocked in eleven years from 1974 through 1994, and walleye populations increased, reaching very high levels in some investigations.  Walleye numbers in 2006 (13.2/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 10.0/gillnet in all investigations since they first appeared in this lake.  All of the walleye captured in 2006 were the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye sizes in 2006 averaged 14.4 inches (1.25 lb), which was somewhat smaller than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class, but was similar to the average size of 14.8 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 2006 was 26.0 inches.  Walleye from thirteen year-classes were captured in 2006, and recruitment in each year from 2000 through 2005 was very even.  Walleye growth was somewhat slower than normal by area standards (in the second quartile).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (3.4/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median pike catch of 3.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2006 averaged 20.9 inches (2.2 lb), which was somewhat smaller than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class, but was larger than the average pike size of 19.7 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2006 (caught in a trapnet) was 34.4 inches.  Pike from seven year-classes were captured in 2006.  Pike growth was somewhat faster than normal by area standards (in the third quartile). <br> \n <br> \nSucker numbers in 2006 (7.3/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median sucker catch of 7.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nPerch numbers in 2006 (2.8/gillnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median perch catch of 2.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2006 averaged 7.2 inches (0.17 lb), which was normal (near the median) for this lake class, but was smaller than the average perch size of 7.8 inches for all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2006 (caught in a trapnet) was 11.1 inches.  Perch growth was faster than normal by area standards (in the fourth quartile). <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were first observed in Cedar Lake in the 1998 investigation.  Smallmouth numbers in 2006 (0.9/gillnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in 2002 and 1998.  Smallmouth and largemouth bass tend to avoid standard sampling nets and are likely to be more abundant than indicated by the number caught in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth sizes in 2006 averaged 17.4 inches (3.1 lb), which was larger than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and was larger than in previous investigations.  The largest smallmouth in 2006 was 18.8 inches.  Smallmouth growth was faster than normal by area standards (in the fourth quartile). <br> \n <br> \nNeascus (black spot) was found on many of the game fish examined in 2006.  A few of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and a few of the perch had yellow grub.  All of these parasites are common and are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were found for the first time in Cedar Lake in 2002 in one gillnet on the south-central shoreline.  In 2006, rusty crayfish were found in seven of nine gillnets spread throughout the lake; the average rusty crayfish catch was 37.7/gillnet.  Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River Valley and were likely introduced to Minnesota by anglers using them for bait.  They are large and aggressive, and outcompete native crayfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is located approximately 5 miles northeast of Ely. It has a surface area of 472 acres and a maximum depth of 45 feet. There is a concrete boat ramp for public access near the northeast end with a dock and parking for approximately 5 vehicles with trailers. There are no designated campsites on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has one inlet that drains a local swamp. The outlet, to Fall Lake, has a rocky, braided channel with logs and debris that limits fish movement. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Cedar Lake are mostly boulder and rubble, with some sand. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2012 (10.6/gill net) were similar to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. there were 11 year classes of walleye sampled in the survey.  Over half the walleye were from the 2009-2011 year classes which will provide a steady supply of fish for future years as they grow into sizes that anglers like to keep. The average walleye sampled was 14.1 inches long and about 4.5 years old but anglers can expect to find a range of fish sizes from 14 to 20 inches. The largest walleye sampled was 24.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2012 (1.3/gill net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average pike sampled was 22.4 inches long and about 5 years old. The largest pike sampled was 26.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, smallmouth bass, black crappie , white sucker, and cisco  were also sampled in 2012. The largest perch sampled was 10.1 inches and the largest smallmouth was 18.9 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish are abundant in Cedar Lake after first being observed in the 2002 assessment. They are likely responsible for the decrease in submerged aquatic vegetation since the 1994 survey.  Rusty crayfish are a non-native species and illegal to introduce into public waters.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 465 acre lake located four miles northeast of Ely. The main access is a concrete ramp on the northeast part of the lake. Cedar has a maximum depth of 45 feet and at the time of this survey, light green colored water due to a slight algae bloom.\n\nCedar was thermally stratified on July 27, 2020 with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 48 F. Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 24 feet. The lake has one inlet that drains a local swamp and the lone outlet to Fall Lake has a rocky, braided channel with logs and debris that limits fish movement. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rubble with some sand and muck in the bays. Vegetation is largely non-existent due to the lake being infested with rusty crayfish.\n\nFish species sampled were walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch. The overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined in 2020 was 18.3 fish/net which was a little below average compared to past catches on the lake. Total yield was 28.2 lbs/net which was also below average compared to past surveys. Fish species sampled in gill nets were walleye, white sucker, northern pike, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, and cisco (tullibee). The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 5.3 fish/net which was low compared to past surveys. However, total yield was 5.8 lbs/net which was better than average.\n\nThe 2020 gill nets sampled 96 walleye for a catch rate of 10.7 fish/net. This catch rate was higher than the average of past surveys on Cedar and was very good when compared to other similar lakes in the state. The catch rate was also very good when compared to other walleye lakes in the Tower area. Lengths ranged from 7 to 28 inches with an average of nearly 14 inches, which was similar to past surveys. Walleye growth was good with the average fish taking four years to reach nearly 15 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 21 years with 71 percent of the fish three years old or younger.  \n\nThe northern pike gill net catch rate was 2.6 fish/net which was near the average compared to past surveys on Cedar and better than average compared to other similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 13 to 27 inches with an average of nearly 22 inches. Sizes were similar to previous surveys.    \n\nFive smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.6 fish/net which was just below average compared to other similar lakes.  Smallmouth were first sampled in 1998 and since that survey have been sampled in every investigation. Sizes were impressive ranging from 16 to 18 inches which were similar to past surveys. Ages ranged from 6 to 10.\n\nThree cisco were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3 fish/net.  Cisco catches have been spotty over the years from Cedar with usually zero or one fish caught. Sizes ranged from 8 to 12 inches. These sizes were similar to past cisco samples from Cedar.  \n\nWhite sucker and yellow perch were also sampled in gill nets. Their catch rates and sizes were similar to past surveys.  \n\nRusty crayfish were first sampled in 2002. Their numbers have moved from 37.7/gill net in 2006 to 116.7 in 2012 and now a slight decrease to 69.1 in 2020.  \n</p>",
