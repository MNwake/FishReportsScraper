                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1041 acre lake in Martin County.  Walleye and muskellunge are the primary species of management.  Additionally, Fox Lake is managed secondarily for black and white crappie and channel catfish.  Since 2001, the walleye catch rate has been somewhat lower than desired.  In an effort to boost the walleye fishery, the Windom DNR Fisheries Office stocked 1556 pounds of walleye fingerlings in 2001 and 2103 pounds of walleye fingerlings in 2003.  Muskellunge were stocked in 1999 and 2001 to create an additional fishery and potentially create a top-level predator on an abundant freshwater drum population.  One more stocking of muskellunge was scheduled for the fall of 2003 but the ponds failed to produce.  Fisheries personnel will evaluate the muskellunge introductions following the last stocking to decide if the plan is having the desired affect to the fish community.  A population assessment was conducted the week of September 8, 2003 using 6 gill nets and 12 trap nets.The walleye catch rate was slightly better than the 2002 catch rate and within \"normal\" range. Most of the fish were good sized and averaged 21.5 inches.  Four year classes of walleyes were sampled (1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998).  Fox Lake has a history of natural reproduction and the walleye from 1994 and 1997 were from years in which  natural reproduction was probably occurred.  With the recent emphasis on walleye fingerling stocking and the typically higher survival of fingerling stockings, it is likely walleye numbers will increase in the next couple of years.Only 1 muskellunge was captured in a gill net during the 2003 survey.  Personal contacts with local anglers indicate some  muskies are being caught at times.  According to the local anglers and commercial operators, most of the muskies are not quite 40 inches long, but are growing well and are in good condition.  Remember that muskellunge that are not 40 inches long have to be returned to the water. The black crappie catch rate was higher than average.  Total lengths ranged from 3.5 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  The black crappie size structure declined slightly from 2002 while the catch rates have not changed substantially since the last survey.  Historically, Fox Lake crappie fishing has been excellent in the spring.  Netting information indicated spring of 2004 should be great fishing.  The white crappie catch rates was at least 5 times higher than the normal range.  Most of the fish are in the 6-8 inch range and averaged close to 7 inches.  The 2002 netting documented a large naturally reproduced year class of fish from 2001.  That year class of fish averaged 6.4 inches long in 2002 and now are averaging 7.7 inches.  If growth rates continue, fish should be close to 9 inches by fall of 2004.  Crappie fishing could be excellent in another year for some real \"slabs\".  Channel catfish were abundant in gill nets in 2003.  Channel catfish have not been stocked since 1986 which means the population is self-sustaining.  These fish could provide some exciting action on those hot summer days when the crappie and walleye are finicky.   The freshwater drum catch rate in gill nets was 24.7/set which was typical and they averaged about 9 inches long.  Since a lot fewer were sampled in 2003 than in 2002, it is possible that muskies may be using them for forage, which was a goal of stocking muskies in the first place. Future yearly monitoring of the drum and muskellunge populations may provide insight to the predator-prey relationship.A total of thirteen species of fish were captured during the survey of 2003.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, common carp, northern pike, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1,041 acre lake in Martin County.  Walleye and muskellunge are the primary species of management.  Fox Lake is managed secondarily for crappie and channel catfish.  In an effort to bolster the walleye population, 2.6 tons of walleye fingerlings/adults have been stocked since 2001.  A population assessment was conducted the week of September 12, 2005 using 6 gill nets and 12 trap nets.The walleye catch rate in Fox Lake has been similar for the last 4 surveys with catch rates below the expected range.  Walleyes averaged over 15 inches in gill nets and over 18 inches in trap nets.  There is some reason to believe that our netting information is not revealing a \"true\" picture of the walleye population.  Our trap netting data indicated the population was greater than the expected range.  It is possible that fall electrofishing or spring trap netting will provide a more accurate picture of the walleye population.  Despite the low catch rates in gill nets, our trap netting data indicated a good \"slug\" of walleyes in the 20-26 inch range.    A total of 6 muskellunge were captured in gill nets and trap nets during the 2005 survey.  Nets failed to capture any fish greater than 40 inches, however commercial seining has documented several fish greater than 40 inches.  Personal contacts with local anglers indicate that legal muskies are being caught.  Ernie and Rick Hand have reported nearly 300 muskellunge in commercial fishing reports in 6 years of seining in Fox Lake.  The commercial fishing reports provide good information on the success of muskie stocking and population status.  Further cooperative work with the local commercial fishing operator will likely yield information on the success of the fishery.  If an angler is looking for a unique opportunity to catch a muskie, it is likely it won't take \"10,000\" casts to get some action.The black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 14.8 fish/set, which was within the expected range (1.8 to 21.2 fish/set).  Black crappies averaged nearly 8 inches in length and were in great condition. The last several years, white crappie catch rates have been greater than the black crappie.  Based on growth analysis, it would appear the 2002 year class of white crappie, similar to black crappie, is abundant and continues to grow at a rate of 1-2 inches per year.  Both species were quite \"plump\", which indicated the fish are growing well and in good health.  Given the large population of crappies, this fishery seems to consistently provide a possibility at some great action, especially in the spring.The channel catfish catch rates have been similar for the last 3 years.  Good numbers of channel catfish averaging 17.4 inches can provide some quality fishing during the heat of the summer. Channel catfish have not been stocked since 1986, which means the population is self-sustaining.  If you are in the Sherburn area fishing and wanting to catch some catfish, it is likely this fishery would be worth your limited angler hours.Since 2002, we have captured only 2 common carp per gill net during the last 3 years of assessments on Fox Lake.  Additionally, we have documented less than 1 common carp per trap net during the same time frame.  It is possible that muskellunge are influencing reproduction and thereby controlling the numbers of common carp.  Further assessments will be evaluated to see if this trend continues.Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, freshwater drum, northern pike, and yellow perch.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoyPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.   Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet; however, roughly 75 percent of the lake is considered littoral (less than 15 ft deep).  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities and Fox Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lake class 24 consists of smaller, shallower, relatively turbid lakes high in nutrients, littoral area, and having irregular shape.  The lake to watershed ratio for Fox Lake is 4 to 1, which indicates a relatively small influence of the watershed to the lake.  The water clarity for Fox Lake has improved since the water diversion was welded shut.  Other watershed improvements have facilitated the return of aquatic vegetation.  Despite some recreational user complaints about the aquatic vegetation, the increased habitat has been good for the fish.  Water clarity has returned as well; a 2.9 foot water transparency was observed during the summer of 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black and white crappie.  However, Fox Lake is unique within the Windom Fish Management area because it is the only lake that is managed for muskellunge and the lake represents the southernmost muskellunge lake in the state, which provides a very unique angling opportunity.  In addition, Fox Lake has been surveyed annually since 1991, which has provided an exceptional dataset to infer fish population trends and direct subsequent fish management decisions.  Finally, unlike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake has never been aerated during the winter and provides a more stable dissolved oxygen profile during winter when compared to other area lakes.  Ultimately, Fox Lake has proven to be a valuable and unique resource in southern Minnesota for lakeshore owners, local and regional anglers, as well as general recreational users.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe management goals for Fox Lake are to maintain a walleye population at an abundance that will consistently yield gill net catches above 6 fish per net with a balanced size structure.  Another management goal is to continue efforts to establish a fishery for trophy size (greater than 50 inches) muskellunge.  Lastly, our goal is to maintain secondary populations of white or black crappie within normal ranges for trap net catches (0.5 to 6.6 fish per net for white crappie and 1.8 to 21.2 fish per net for black crappie).  Populations of the above mentioned species will be maintained through stocking (walleye and muskellunge) or natural reproduction (white and black crappie).  In order to assess the management goals for Fox Lake, a fish population assessment was conducted in September 2011 using trap nets and gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate in 2011 was 3.2 fish per net, which was within the normal range for lake class 24 (1.2 to 6.3 fish per net).  In the same way, the trap net catch rate was 0.9 fish per net which was within the normal range of 0.3 to 1.2 fish per net.  With that said, the catch rate did not meet the management goal of 6 fish per net.  Total length of walleye in the gill nets had an average length of 12.8 inches and ranged from 11.4 to 16.7 inches.  The gill net and trap net sample indicated a population of walleye that is dominated by fish smaller than 15 inches.  Walleye stocking in Fox Lake has usually been done with fingerlings (late development age 0 fish between 6 and 10 inches), but in 2010 and 2011 oxytetracycline (OTC) marked frylings (2 to 4 inches) were stocked.  It appears the fryling stockings were successful, but growth was slow.  Age 0 walleye had an average length of 6.7 inches, age 1 were 11.4 inches, age 2 were 12.5 inches, age 3 were 13.7 inches, age 4 were 14.0 inches and age 5 were 16.7 inches.  The overall condition of the walleye was fair indicating a population of fish that is in below average condition.  Overall, it appears that the walleye population is at a low abundance and may be experiencing growth problems as a result of foraging stress during their first 3 years.  Continued stocking of frylings may boost the walleye abundance if blank stocking years are included to increase forage abundance through decreased competition for food.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge catch rates in 2011 were 0.2 fish per gill net and 0.3 fish per trap net, which are below the normal gill net (0.3 to 1.0 fish per gill net) and trap net (0.4 to 0.5 fish per trap net) catch rates for lake class 24.  Gill nets and standard survey trap nets are ineffective at sampling larger muskellunge.  The lengths of the 5 fish caught in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 33.1 to 45.1 inches with an average of 40.4 inches.  Therefore, large frame trap nets are used in the spring months (April and May) to assess the Fox Lake muskellunge population.  In 2009, a large frame trap net survey was conducted for the first time; 95 muskellunge were sampled.  The muskellunge ranged in length from 33.0 to 48.2 inches with an average of 40.7 inches.  In 2009, 33% of the muskellunge sampled were greater than 42 inches.  A follow-up large frame trap net survey was conducted in the spring of 2011, which is the start of a long-term monitoring study to obtain a population estimate.  In 2011, 140 muskellunge were caught over 2 weeks in May.  The muskellunge ranged in length from 14.5 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 41.7 inches.  In 2011, 45% of the muskellunge sampled were greater than 42 inches.  The chance of producing a very large muskellunge is excellent in Fox Lake creating a unique experience in southern Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe crappie population abundance is down from our long term catch rate average.  The crappie catch rates during 2011 were 2.5 fish per trap net (black crappie) and 1.7 fish per trap net (white crappie).  Both black and white crappie trap net catches were within their normal ranges of 1.8 to 21.2 fish per trap net and 0.5 to 6.6 fish per trap net respectively.  From the late 1990's until the mid 2000's Fox Lake experienced high catch rates of both black and white crappie that were routinely near or above the upper quartile range for each species.  While the catch rates were high from the late 1990's until the mid 2000's, the average weight per fish never exceeded one-third of a pound.  Currently, the black and white crappie populations have very high average weights at 0.7 and 0.6 pounds, respectively, even though the population abundance has taken a hit.  Total lengths of black crappie ranged from 6.6 to 14.8 inches with a mean of 10.3 inches.  Total lengths of white crappie ranged from 3.9 to 11.9 inches with a mean of 9.7 inches.  The size of fish in the gill net and trap net sample indicated the crappie populations are both dominated by large fish (10 inches or greater).  With a large size and a lower abundance compared to previous surveys, the overall conditions of black and white crappie were good.  This suggested that both crappie populations were foraging successfully.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead have experienced a decline in abundance in Fox Lake since the early 1990's.  In 2010, the catch rate was less than 1 fish per net for both gill nets (0.7) and trap nets (0.5).  All black bullhead caught (n=10) were greater than 7 inches with one fish greater than 12 inches indicating a population that is experiencing poor recruitment as a result of reproduction failure or high predation on young fish.  In 2011, no black bullhead were caught in gill nets or trap nets adding to the credibility of recruitment failure in Fox Lake.  Local reports observe schools of Age 0 black bullhead on the surface in the spring, but they most likely end up as forage for predators. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance has declined in both trap nets and gill nets since 2003.  However common carp catch rates have increased since 2010.  In 2011, the gill net catch rate was 2.7 per net which is within the normal range of 0.3 to 3.0.  The trap net catch rate was 1.2 which was also within the normal range of 0.4 to 2.0 fish per net.  The spike in catch rates in gill nets and trap nets appears to be the result of one year class (Age 1 fish).  Eighty-seven percent of the fish were 13-19 inches.  It would appear that a successful year class was produced despite the lack of winterkill that is thought to trigger common carp natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2010 was 1.8 fish per gill net and was less than the normal range of 2.0 to 27.9 fish per gill net for lake class 24.  This is perplexing because the 2010 catch rate was the second highest observed (44.0 per gill net) since sampling began in 1981.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 0.8, which was within the normal range of 0.3 to 1.7 fish per gill net.  It is obvious that the yellow perch population is suppressed most likely due to their prey status with walleye and muskellunge present in the lake.  The total lengths of yellow perch ranged from 6.4 to 9.2 inches with a mean of 7.9 inches.  The gill net and trap net sample indicated a balanced size structure.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was fair and indicated the fish were foraging adequately.  The yellow perch population appears to be suppressed but maintaining a balanced size structure including spawning stock to reproduce in the future.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in gill nets and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, common carp, channel catfish, freshwater drum, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass and quillback carpsucker.  All species listed above were within or near their respected normal ranges except for freshwater drum, which had a catch rate greater than normal.  The freshwater drum catch rate was 35.0 fish per gill net.  According to our historical netting information from Fox Lake, the average catch rate in gill nets is 42.3 fish per gill net.  The last 4 years catch rates have stabilized around 35 to 38 fish per gill net.  The average total length of freshwater drum captured has increased in gill nets and trap nets since 2004.  It is possible that predators are cropping off the smaller fish as forage.  Freshwater drum could be forage for crappie, muskellunge, yellow perch, and walleye.  Additionally, the overall condition for all of the species listed above were good, indicating populations that are not experiencing foraging stress.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe Fox Lake fish community appears to be healthy and abundance of primary management species is within normal ranges or higher.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is a 1,041acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet but 75 percent of the lake has water less than15 feet deep.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities and Fox Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lake class 24 consists of shallower, relatively turbid (brown colored water) lakes high in nutrients that have some shallow water areas and are irregularly shaped (not round).  The lake-to-watershed ratio for Fox Lake is 4-to-1, which indicates a small influence of the watershed to the lake.  Recent watershed improvements have led to the return of aquatic vegetation in Fox Lake.  Water clarity is improving, a 2.6 foot water transparency was observed during the summer of 2013.  A Martin County Soil and Watershed District led program started in 2012 is focused on further improving watershed conditions for Fox Lake as well other Martin County Lakes.  Improvements in the watershed for Fox Lake will continue to manifest in improved water quality and thereby improved habitat conditions for the fish community.    <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake is managed for walleye and crappie.  However, Fox Lake is unique to the Windom Fish management area because it is managed for muskie and it is the southernmost muskie lake in the state, which provides a very unique angling opportunity.  In addition, the fish population of Fox Lake has been surveyed by DNR annually since 1991, which has provided an exceptional dataset to understand the fish community with a better ability to focus fish management decisions.  Finally, unlike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake has never been aerated during the winter and provides a more stable dissolved oxygen profile during winter when compared to other area lakes.  Ultimately, Fox Lake has proven to be a valuable and unique resource in southern Minnesota for lakeshore owners, local and regional anglers, as well as general recreational users.   <br> \n <br> \nA fish population assessment is conducted each September.  The following information outlines the information collected during the latest population assessment in September 2013 using 11 trap nets and 6 gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThe expected gill net catch rate of walleye in Fox Lake is between 1.2 and 6.3 per net and the expected range for the trap net catch rate is between 0.3 and 1.2 per net.  The gill net catch rate in 2013 was 1.8 per net which is within the expected range, but less than desired for Fox Lake based on the lake management plan.  The trap net catch rate was only less than 0.1 per net, which was below the interquartile range for Fox Lake.  Historically, the Fox Lake gill net catch rate has been sporadic with catches ranging from 0.5 to 45.2 from 1981 to 2001 with an average catch rate of 9.8 per gill net during that same time frame.  Since 2002, the catch rates have varied to a lesser degree from 0.5 to 4.0 with an average catch rate of 2.4 walleye per gill net indicating a more stable walleye population.  The reduction in the average catch rate from 9.8 walleye per gill net from 1981 to 2001 to 2.4 walleye per gill net from 2002 to 2013 is not easily explainable and is most likely the result of many factors.  From 1979 to 2009 Fox Lake has been stocked with walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults depending on production.    When the catch rate after stocking was analyzed, the highest catch rates were associated with fry stockings in 1983 and 1984 and intensive fingerling stocking in 1992 and 1993.  But, suppressed catch rates were also associated with fry and fingerling stocking from 2002 to 2013 indicating other factors may be involved.  Since 1998, competition for limited prey resources has never been higher in Fox Lake with the emergence of robust populations of white crappie, black crappie, channel catfish and the decline of black bullhead as a forage base.  In addition, muskie have been stocked in Fox Lake starting in 1999 adding an additional predator to compete with for limited prey items (yellow perch, small common carp, small freshwater drum, and seasonally abundant minnow species).  Starting in 2010, walleye frylings (2 to 3 inch fish) have been stocked annually (except 2012 when production failed) which led to a slight improvement in gill net catch rates to 3.2 to 3.5 fish per gill net from 2011 to 2012.  Given only a slight improvement, competition with other predators appears to continue to suppress the walleye population abundance.  In 2013, fingerling walleye were stocked in the fall in addition to frylings in the spring.  Monitoring of the walleye population in 2014 will indicate if that stocking was successful.  While the catch rates have been suppressed in recent years, the size structure of the population does appear to be improving.  The number of 15 inch and larger walleye is increasing.  Larger fish are becoming more common and local anglers have even stated that the walleye fishing is the \"best walleye fishing in recent years\".  The walleye in the 2013 sample ranged from 14.8 to 19.5 inches with an average size of 17.7 inches.  Additionally, the walleye in the sample were healthy with an average weight above 2 pounds.  Future abundance of the walleye population appears directly related to other species given the competition for limited food sources.  Improvement of the walleye population abundance will most likely occur if other predator species abundance decreases (crappies, channel catfish, muskie, or largemouth bass).  The population appears to be at a level that provides some good fishing opportunities, but less than a population level that makes walleyes the dominant game species in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMUSKIE <br> \n <br> \nMuskie have been stocked into Fox Lake starting in 1999 with subsequent stockings in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.  No natural reproduction of muskie has been documented in Fox Lake so all muskie in the lake are from stocking.  Year classes present from the stockings are ages 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 16.  Muskies over 10 years old have the ability to reach trophy size so potential exists for the Fox Lake muskie population to have trophy individuals present in the lake.  In 2013, 2 muskies were caught in the gill net sample (a little more than 0.3 fish per net). Muskie are not effectively sampled with gill nets and standard trap nets and the long-term catch rates from 2000 to 2013 reflect that with gill net catch rates varying from only 0 to 0.7 fish per net.  Therefore, in 2011 a long-term muskie study was started focusing on obtaining information leading to a population estimate that will help determine the ideal stocking rate for Fox Lake. Large-frame trap nets were used in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in the spring to capture muskie, particularly muskie greater than 34 inches and thus considered mature.  In 2011, 140 muskie were caught over 2 weeks in May.  The muskie ranged in length from 14.5 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 41.7 inches.  In 2012, 45 muskie were caught over 3 weeks in April and May. The muskie ranged in length from 31.0 to 48.7 inches with an average length of 41.5 inches.  In 2013, 107 muskie were sampled over 2 weeks in April and May.  The muskie ranged in length from 29.0 to 50.4 inches with an average length of 41.1 inches.  The population estimate of muskie greater than 34 inches ranges anywhere from 190 to 287 fish with 95% confidence.  This indicates the population is doing well and many large muskies are present in the lake.  The muskie population will be monitored every other year with large frame trap nets starting in 2015.       <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n  <br> \nTwo species of crappie are present in Fox Lake, black crappie and white crappie.  The catch rates of black crappie were 5.7 fish per gill net and 5.4 fish per trap net and the catch rates of white crappie were 0.3 fish per trap net with no white crappie in the gill net sample.  Catch rates of crappie are not necessarily the best indicator of how well the population is doing.  Crappie catch rates tend to vary widely from year to year and even from season to season and the population size structure is more indicative of the overall health of the population in the lake.  Black crappie ranged in size from 3.2 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 7.3 inches in the gill net sample and 5.9 inches in the trap net sample.  More than 60% of the black crappie in the sample were 10 inches or greater and about 35% were bigger than 12 inches.  White crappie ranged in size from 10.75 to 11.06 inches with an average size of 10.91 inches.  All white crappie in the sample were larger than 10 inches.  Overall, it appears that the black and white crappie populations have an imbalanced size structure with most of the fish being larger than 8 inches.  An imbalanced size structure can indicate that a year class of crappie is missing from the sample, whether from failed spawning or from bad sampling during the time period of the sample.  Future assessments, including potential spring trap netting in 2014 when they are moving near shore, will monitor the black crappie populations to determine if they are truly out of balance or if they were ineffectively sampled in 2013. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch in Fox Lake are the main forage for the walleye and muskie populations.  Fluctuations in the abundance of the yellow perch population can lead to fluctuations in the walleye and muskellunge populations.  The historical catch rates of yellow perch in the gill nets range from a low of 0.3 per gill net in 1992 to a high of 80.5 in 2012 and from 0 per trap net (1986, 1989, and 1992) to 22.6 per trap net in 1997.  The 2013 gill net catch rate was one of the lowest on record at 1.5 fish per gill net which is unusual because the catch rate in 2012 was the highest on record at 80.5 per gill net.  A cause in the swing in catch rate from one of the greatest to one of the lowest is not completely understood at this time, but growth of large aquatic vegetation beds over the last 5 years may give the yellow perch a place to successfully hide from survey nets as well as from predators.  Increased survival of the yellow perch in Fox Lake as a result of increased vegetation growth will increase the chances of sustaining a consistent abundance of forage sized fish in the lake which will help the yellow perch population sustain itself in addition to sustaining the walleye and muskellunge populations.  The size of yellow perch in the 2013 sample ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 8.0 inches in the gill net sample and 6.3 inches in the trap net sample.  This range of sizes should be adequate as a forage base even if perch are low in abundance.  Spawning sized fish remain in the population and successful reproduction in the future may help to boost the forage base and add an additional angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish caught in the 2013 survey were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum, and largemouth bass.  Of the species listed above, channel catfish and freshwater drum are the most significant contributors to the fish community in terms of relative biomass (weight of fish available as a relation to the total weight of all fish species in the lake combine).  Channel catfish are doing well in Fox Lake and currently range in length from 22.1 to 26.4 inches with an average weight of 5.1 pounds. The abundant channel catfish population is the suspected reason why the bullhead population is not as prevalent as it has been in the past due to predation and competition for common resources.  Finally, freshwater drum are the most prevalent \"rough\" fish in the population with a gill net catch rate of 64.8 fish per net.  Freshwater drum in the 2013 sample ranged in length from 3.8 to 18.0 inches with an average of 10.9 inches in the gill net sample and 13.7 inches in the trap net sample.  With an abundant muskie and potentially expanding walleye population, small freshwater drum will increasingly become important as prey species for larger muskellunge and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the Fox Lake fish community appears to be doing well with a diverse fish community that is seeing improvements in managed fish species abundance and/or size structure.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community.  Wise use of our resources makes us good stewards to the land and water that all of us use every day. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre lake located in Martin County near the City of Sherburn.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated.  Fox Lake's watershed is relatively small indicating a potentially small impact from its surrounding landscape.  Watershed improvements and the closing of a diversion structure have created a better opportunity for the return of aquatic vegetation, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Curly-leaf Pondweed was first documented during a survey in 2006.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, it is managed primarily for Muskellunge and Walleye and secondarily for crappie, making it one of two lakes in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskellunge angling opportunities.  A rarity in the Windom Fish Management Area is annual surveying of a lake, however, Fox has an annual survey conducted during the first week of September to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nIn 2019, the Walleye catch rate was 1.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 6.3 per gill net).  From 2015 to 2017 the Fox Lake Walleye catch rate was on a 3 year increasing trend (5.7 in 2015, 9.8 in 2016, and 14.5 in 2017).  However, the past 2 years the gill net catch has been very low.  Interestingly, trap net catch rates during those 2 years has been decent with a catch rate of 1.0 in 2018 and 1.42 in 2019.  It appears during the week of sampling in 2019 Walleye may have remained near shore away from the gill nets.  Gill nets are an offshore sampling method and capture fish in deeper water.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from just under 8 inches to just over 27.5 inches and averaged 13 inches in gill nets and 15.5 inches in trap nets.  Unfortunately, Walleyes in the sample were in below average health.  Fox Lake Walleye appear to be experiencing some stress based on how plump the fish appear.  Due to low catch rates of Walleye over the past 2 years with fish in poor health, stocking of Walleye fry will occur when surplus Walleye are produced in the hatchery.  Surplus Walleye fry were produced in 2019 and were stocked into Fox Lake.  The Walleye population will continue to be monitored annually to maintain an opportunity for Walleye fishing in Fox Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \nMuskellunge were first introduced into Fox Lake in 1999.  Subsequently they were stocked in 2001 and were stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  However due to production constraints, starting in 2019, Muskellunge were stocked and will continue to be stocked every-other year (odd year stocking).  Four Muskellunge were captured in trap nets in the annual standard survey.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskellunge.  The 4 fish ranged in length from 35.0 to 41.5 inches with an average length of 38.3 inches.  In the 2017 assessment using large frame trap nets, Muskellunge were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 10.8 to 50.1 inches and averaged 42.2 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate) was 241 adults (192 to 290).  Since 2011, 325 unique adult Muskellunge have been sampled and PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder-a unique identifier) tagged and 2,474 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nIn 2019, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 52.5 per trap net, which is more than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.8 to 21.2 per trap net) and the second highest ever recorded.  Additionally, the catch rate is greater than the long-term average of nearly 15.7 per trap net since 1981.  Fox Lake has had 5 years in a row of catch rates above the long-term average indicating a return of good numbers of crappie.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from under 3 inches to just shy of 10 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged nearly 7.5 inches in trap nets.  The average length is similar to 2018 indicating slower growth.  Black Crappie are feeding successfully as indicated by how plump the fish are. The Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with at least 2 or 3 strong year classes present based on length frequency in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2019 was 5.3 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 6.6).  White Crappie lengths ranged from just over 5 inches to just above 12.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches in the trap net sample.  Although the two species of crappie can coexist, Black Crappie are dominating the Fox Lake crappie fishery. However, it appears that the larger fish, over 10 inches, in the crappie population are White Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nAngling for Black or White Crappie should be good over the next 5 to 6 years.  There appears to be enough food to support the populations as they were healthy fish in good condition.  Multiple strong year classes are present and the fish, although slow growing, should attain 10 inches or greater over the next several years.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2019 was 0.3 per gill net, which is less than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net).  The catch rate of Yellow Perch has been characterized by extreme ups and downs since 2011. The gill net catch rate was 1.8 in 2011, then 80.5 in 2012 and back to 1.5 in 2013 followed by 25, 27.7, and 30.5 from 2014 to 2017 and most recently down to 0.5 and 0.3 in 2018 and 2019.  Yellow Perch naturally reproduce as the variability in catches is not a byproduct of stocking.  This variability in gill net catch is most likely due to environmental conditions and not true population changes.  However, if the population remains low in 2020 there may be a need to restock to boost the population.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from just under 6 inches to 8.5 inches and averaged just shy of 7 inches in gill nets and just over 7 inches in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate was 45.3 per gill net, just above the long term average of 45.2 per gill net and higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.0 to 32.3 per gill net).  There is some desire to remove Freshwater Drum to reduce numbers, however, past studies have shown that this only leads to a reproduction response and actually speeds up growth and reproduction in Freshwater Drum.  Control of Freshwater Drum will instead focus on competition and predation.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 1.2 per gill net.  Nine Channel Catfish were caught that ranged from 14.8 inches and 28.7 inches.  Interestingly, we have only sampled 22 Black Bullheads in trap nets or gill nets combined since 2010 during annual netting on Fox Lake.  While this number is extremely low, it is a trend that we have been observing in other lakes in the Windom Fish Management Area as well.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty-five Bluegill, 3.3 to 7.9 inches in length, were sampled in trap nets.  The Bluegill population is starting to become more abundant on Fox Lake.  There could be a shift in habitat that favors Bluegill and crappie over Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Quillback Carpsucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskie were first introduced into Fox Lake in 1999 and subsequently stocked in 2001 and have been stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  The last two stockings were in October 2019 (N=475) and October 2022 (N=476). The recent 3 year gap in stocking was a byproduct of inconsistent statewide Muskie production, COVID related cessation of stocking in 2020, and a statewide reprioritization along with improvement in lessons learned with Muskie management.  No Muskie were captured in gill nets or trap nets in the 2022 survey.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskie during our annual survey in September.  Therefore, large frame trap nets are set every 5 years to sample the Muskie population.  A survey utilizing the large frame trap nets was done in May 2022.  No Muskies were sampled.  Five years prior during the 2017 assessment Muskie were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  During 2017, Muskie ranged in length from 10.8 to 50.1 inches and averaged 42.2 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate using 2017 as a recapture event) was 250 adults (193 to 307; 95 Percent Confidence Interval).  Given the recent water quality issues, however, a special targeted LTN assessment was conducted during the spring of 2021.  Five Muskie were caught in 3 days of netting with 2 nets each day (6 net nights).  Muskies sampled ranged in length from 39.1 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 42.2 inches.  Three males and 2 females were sampled.  Therefore, it is strange that 0 Muskie were sampled in 2022.  We suspect that the adult Muskie population has shifted to a much less abundant population, but Muskies are most likely still present.  It is very likely that the originally stocked fish in 1999 and the following year class in 2001 are now gone from the lake due to old age.  Since 2011 when PIT tagging was started on Fox Lake, 325 unique adult Muskie have been sampled and PIT tagged and 2,950 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked. </p>",

THE WAE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY AGE 2 FISH (76% OF THE POPULATION).  THE STRONG YEAR CLASS MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM A FINGERLING STOCKING IN 1990.  TWO AGE 1 FISH WERE SAMPLED DURING THE SURVEY WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR WAE INCREASED FROM 5.3 IN 1991 TO 8.3 IN 1992.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 10.0 TO 26.0 INCHES.  COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN REPORTED CAPTURING 20 WAE WEIGHING 7-11 LBS IN HOOP NETS TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLC WERE BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A LOW POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE TRAPNET CPUE AT THE END OF MAY WAS ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  TWO 27 INCH CCF WERE CAPTURED WITH TROTLINES IN SEPTEMBER.  ONE OF THE CATFISH WAS AGED AT 5+ INDICATING NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  CCF HAVE BEEN STOCKED SEVEN TIMES SINCE 1950.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB HAVE ONLY BEEN ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE TWICE IN THE NINE YEARS WE HAVE RECORDS FOR.  ALTHOUGH GILL AND TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CCF HAVE BEEN LOW, ANGLERS HAVE HAD GOOD SUCCESS FISHING FOR CCF. COMMERCIAL SEINERS REPORTED CAPTURING TEN CCF FROM 3-8 LBS IN A SEINE HAUL IN 1992 AND SEVEN CCF FROM 5-7 LBS IN HOOP NETS.  SHORELINE SEINING IN 1992 INDICATED NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF LMB, BLC YEP, BIB AND FRD.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a unique system in the pothole prairie region because of the lake's physical characteristics.  Fox Lake is one of the deeper lakes in this area and the orientation of the lake is mostly east and west.  Fox Lake is the only lake managed by the Windom office that has been sampled on a yearly basis since 1991.  This unique sampling situation enables the Windom Office to follow the fish population trends and thus increases the effectiveness of evaluating and managing the populations.  Additionally, Fox Lake is the only lake in this area that is managed secondarily for muskellunge.  Approximately 520 muskellunge (Age 2+) were stocked in the fall of 1999 after a public comment period.  The general public had overwhelming support of the concept so muskellunge (1-2 pounds/fish) were stocked.  The following information was collected before muskellunge were stocked so no effect of this species was observed in these data.  The average walleye gill net catch was 3.13 fish/net set which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Despite the walleye catch rates being normal compared to other area lakes, only one other time in the last 10 consecutive surveys (1987) has catch rates been so low.  The average walleye gill net sample weight however, was the highest (2.37 lbs./fish) in the last ten consecutive surveys.  Total lengths of walleye sampled in our gill nets ranged from 9.9 to 25.9 inches and had a mean of 18.5.  Many walleye were 17 to 18 inches in length, which would make these fish 3 or 4 years old.  All of this means that walleye numbers may be lower than in the past but the average is larger.  Fall electrofishing for young of the year walleye indicated some natural reproduction and/or fry survival in 1999 (23 young of the year walleye/hour).  These data are important because historical fall electrofishing and shoreline seining indicate very limited natural reproduction.  Another year class of walleye recruiting to the population is highly possible if survival is good for the young of the year walleye sampled in the fall.  Survival of young of the year walleye would probably be improved if aquatic vegetation could be abundant.  Aquatic vegetation, acting as nursery habitat, enables smaller walleye and other forage fish to escape from larger predators.  The current Fox Lake walleye stocking regime calls for fry three out of four years at a rate of 1000 per surface acre.      Crappie population densities are susceptible to extreme fluctuations in the pothole prairie region.  Examining the historical catches from Fox Lake, it appears both black and white crappie populations are in or nearing a high point in the cycle.  Based on trap netting, the black crappie population is looking quite promising for anglers.  The average black crappie trap net catch was 13.08 fish/net which was higher than normal for this type of lake.  Historically, average black crappie trap net catches have been higher during two other periods (1998, 1995) in the last nine consecutive surveys.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged between 4.2 and 8.4 inches, with a mean of 7.0.  A mode was recorded in the range of 6.5 to 7.0 inches.  Overall the last few years the white crappie population has becom more abundant than the black crappie population.  Fisheries literature indicates that white crappies tend to survive better in more turbid environments (less transparent water).  The average white crappie trap net catch was 53.17 fish/net set which was eight times higher than normal for this lake type.  Total lengths of white crappie sampled in trap nets ranged between 6.1 and 9.8 inches, with a mean of 7.3.  Since 1997, the average white crappie trap net catches have been steadily increasing.  All of these data suggest the white crappie population is relatively dense and consists mostly of smaller individuals.  Fishing for both white and black crappie could be phenomenal for the next couple of years.Bluegill and largemouth bass usually do considerably better when aquatic vegetation is abundant.  The average bluegill trap net catch was 2.0 fish/net set which was below normal for this lake type.  However, the average bluegill trap net catches have been above normal only once in the last nine consecutive surveys.  Total lengths of bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged between 3.8 and 7.3 inches, with a mean of 6.3.  Historical shoreline seining has revealed varying numbers of young of the year bluegill which suggests some natural reproduction.  These data suggest the bluegill population is self-sustaining but at a low density.  Aquatic vegetation would likely enhance this population.  The average channel catfish gill net catch was 7.50 fish/net set which was the second highest catch in the last 10 consecutive surveys.  The highest catch was 7.83 fish/net set in 1997.  Total lengths of channel catfish sampled in our gill nets ranged between 11.5 and 21.3 inches, with a mean of 14.5.  Nearly 76% of the channel catfish aged were 5 years old (average length= 14.8 inches) while the remaining were Age 4 (average length=12.5 inches).  Channel catfish were last stocked in 1986 which indicates the population was basically self-sustaining. Freshwater drum, black bullhead and common carp populations in Fox Lake could provide the opportunity to teach some kids how to fish.  The freshwater drum population was doing quite well in spite of a moderate \"summerkill\" in 1999.  The average gill net catch was 45.13 fish/net set which was above normal.  Based on the last ten consecutive surveys, the average freshwater drum gill net catches have only twice been lower than normal.  Total lengths of freshwater drum sampled in the gill nets ranged between 4.6 and 9.7 inches, with a mean of 8.2.  These data suggest the freshwater drum population density was relatively high and consisted mostly of smaller individuals.  The average black bullhead gill net catch was 27.88 fish/net set which was higher than normal for this type of lake.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 7.7 and 10.6 inches, with a mean of 8.8.  These data suggest a normal to above normal black bullhead density and a population size structure that consisted mostly of smaller individuals.  The average common carp trap net catch was 3.17 fish/net set which was higher than normal for this type of  lake.  Total lengths of common carp sampled in the trap nets ranged between 16.7 and 32.3 inches, with a mean of 25.5.  Fox Lake has a common carp population density that was relatively low and a size structure that consisted mostly of larger individuals.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn in Martin County, has a maximum of 20 feet deep and encompasses 1041 acres.  It is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.  Additionally, Fox Lake is managed secondarily for black and white crappie and channel catfish.   The current walleye stocking regime calls for fingerling stocking at a pound per acre every other year (2001 and 2003).  The 2001 walleye fingerling stocking consisted of approximately 1500 pounds of fingerlings (76,511 fish) in an effort to boost the walleye fishery.  The last muskellunge fingerlings (yearlings) are scheduled to be stocked in the fall of 2003 after which the muskellunge stocking will be evaluated.  Five gill net sets and 11 trap net sets were used to assess the Fox Lake fishery during the week of September 9, 2002. The walleye catch rate in gill nets averaged 1.20/set which was just barely within the expected range. They averaged 18.2 inches in length.  The walleye stocking regime was changed to stocking fingerlings because walleye catch rates have been less than usual since 1999.  Despite the fact that gill nets sampled fewer walleyes, trap net catch rates remained nearly identical to the last three surveys.  Six different year classes of walleyes were captured and indicated growth was quite good as Age 1 walleye averaged 10.79 inches while Age 2 walleye were 16.20 inches.  Creel surveys indicated that 45 percent of all anglers interviewed were seeking walleye.  It is somewhat interesting that boat anglers experienced lower walleye catch rates than bank anglers.   Based on the creel data it would appear that bank angling would actually improve your walleye catch rates.  The moral of the story is the walleye numbers remain low but crappie and channel catfish numbers are quite high. Four muskellunge were captured in trap nets during the survey in 2002 and in 2001.  Two of the fish from the 2002 survey were from the 1999 stocking and the other two were from the 2001 stocking.  The fish from the 1999 stocking were around 32 inches while the fish from the 2001 stocking were around 16 inches.  All of the fish appeared to be in good condition and doing well.  Remember it is unlawful to possess a muskellunge that is less than 40 inches in length.  Give these fish a chance to become established, so practice catch and release.The black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 25.64/set and averaged 6.11 inches.  Four year classes of black crappie were captured, with the 2001 year class (91% of the black crappie) the most abundant. The white crappie catch rate in trap nets was 43.00/set and averaged 6.91 inches in length.  Eighty-two percent of the white crappie caught were from the 2001 year class.  Fox Lake over the years has maintained relatively high abundances of both black and white crappie,  which is unique as panfish populations tend to cycle in the pothole prairie lakes of southern Minnesota.  Give these fish a few years to grow and they will provide some excellent fishing if you can find them.The channel catfish catch rate was 15.20/set in gill nets and 2.45/set in trap nets, which was the highest catch rate in either gear ever captured in all the years of surveying Fox Lake.  Total lengths of channel catfish captured averaged 12.81 inches and ranged from 7.28 to 22.83 inches.   Despite not being stocked since 1986, the channel catfish population has been self-sufficient and it appears that in 2000, 1996, and 1995 year classes were successfully produced. A total of fourteen species of fish were captured during the survey of 2002.  Other species captured were yellow perch, northern pike, common carp, black bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

Fox Lake has a low watershed to lake ratio of 4 to 1, which indicates a smaller drainage area when compared to the surface acres of the lake.  Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for channel catfish, white crappie, and black crappie.  The annual population assessment was conducted during the week of September 2, 2008. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, walleye catch rates have not changed much in over 8 years despite regular walleye fingerling stockings.  The regular stockings were equivalent to stocking 20 walleye fingerlings/acre/year with little return to the survey.  Total lengths of walleye sampled ranged from 8.4 to 26.4 inches and averaged 16.8 inches.  Six year classes of walleye were sampled in 2008 with most correlating back to fingerling stockings in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  Nearly half the walleye sampled in 2008 were 14 inches and larger.  Although numbers were higher in the early 90\u0019s, walleye can still be caught with regularity as reported in the open water creel survey on Fox Lake in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 4 muskellunge were sampled in trap nets and gill nets combined in 2008.  Muskellunge sampling has been extremely challenging over the years.  Typically we sample very few muskies each year during the annual assessment.  In the last 8 assessments we have sampled a total of 26 muskies in trap nets and gill nets combined.  Although muskie sampling can be difficult and sample sizes are typically small, the sizes of fish captured indicate the presence of legal sized fish.  The creel survey during the open water period of 2008 showed that 25% of the anglers fishing Fox Lake were targeting muskellunge.  The creel survey estimated that 203 muskellunge were captured and only 8 were harvested.  Nearly 96% of the muskellunge captured were released.  The estimated average size muskie caught was just over 37 inches.  Muskellunge (520 fish) will continue to be stocked in even years through 2010.  In the spring of 2009, we are planning to conduct another special assessment to get  better estimates of muskie size structure and abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate in gill nets was 4.5 fish/set, which was down from the 2007 assessment of 11.3 fish/set.  Historically catch rates have ranged from 0.6 to 15.2 fish/set.  Total lengths of channel catfish ranged from 18.6 to 25.4 inches with a mean of 21.4 inches.  The average total length channel catfish sampled in gill nets has increased 8.6 inches during a 6-year time frame.  During a mid-summer evening, there is a good chance of catching some nice sized channel catfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 5.4 fish/set, which was within the expected range (1.8 to 21.2 fish/set).  Based on trap net catch rates, black crappie numbers have not changed since last year.  Total lengths of black crappie in trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 11.8 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  It would appear that white crappie outnumber black crappie in Fox Lake by at least 2 to 1.  Total lengths and average sizes are similar between the two species.  Either species can provide some good action.  Since 2004, both species have showed an increase of 2 inches in average length.  <br> \n <br> \nCompared to last year, yellow perch numbers are nearly the same.  Total lengths ranged from 6.5 to 8.9 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Most of the fish sampled were in the 6.5 to 8.0 inch range.  It is possible to catch a few perch while targeting the seemingly abundant crappie in Fox Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum, or sheephead, numbers continue to be relatively high.  Since 1981, sheephead numbers continue to be nearly the same but average size is increasing.  This may suggest that predators, such as walleyes or muskellunge, are foraging on the smaller freshwater drum and thereby shifting the size structure toward larger fish.  Total lengths ranged from 11.0 to 19.1 inches and averaged 12.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in Fox Lake continue to decline.  A total of 10 black bullhead were sampled in gill nets and trap nets combined in 2008.  Since 1999, catch rates during annual assessments have revealed a declining trend in abundance.  However, all of the bullheads sampled in 2008 were at least 10 inches in total length.  Natural reproduction is either very limited and/or heavy predation on smaller bullheads limit their abundance.  It is possible to catch a bullhead on Fox Lake but there are plenty of lakes nearby with better abundance, such as Big Twin Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos    <br> \n <br> \n   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n       <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1,041-acre lake in Martin County with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  In the last few years aquatic vegetation (mostly sago pondweed and claspingleaf pondweed) has gradually increased in abundance.  Unfortunately curlyleaf pondweed (exotic species) was documented in Fox Lake as well.  The Windom Area Office will be adding an additional vegetation survey to monitor this exotic species.  Generally when we see increasing aquatic vegetation in an area lake, it is a result of increasing water clarity.  Sago pondweed is important for fish and wildlife as it provides nursery and feeding habitat for small fish as well as cover from predators.  Sago pondweed is also valuable from the water quality standpoint as nutrients are tied up in the aquatic vegetation instead of being available for algae production.  Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for black crappie, white crappie, and bluegill.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of September 8, 2009 using gillnets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch of walleye in 2009 was a little over one fish/net, but within the objective range.  However, the catch of walleye fell short of the long range goal of 6 fish/net.  Although walleye catch has averaged 6.7 fish/net historically in Fox Lake dating back to 1981, the long range goal for walleye catch in Fox Lake has been achieved only 9 times out of 24 assessments and only once in the past 11 years.  This has been the case even though walleye stockings have equaled 20 fingerlings/acre/year.  Since 2001 the walleye gillnet catch rate has not changed substantially and indicates a walleye population with low numbers despite an aggressive annual stocking of fingerlings.  Although numbers of walleye were low, the sizes of fish were good with walleye ranging from 10 to 26 inches and averaging 14.0 inches in length.  The majority of the walleye captured represented the 2007 fingerling stocking.     <br> \n <br> \nSampling muskellunge has not been effective on Fox Lake in the past number of years.  For example, in the last 9 population assessments on Fox Lake a total of only 30 muskellunge were captured.  During the spring of 2007, a special assessment designed to target muskellunge was conducted during early spring; however, during a 10-day period of netting only 3 muskellunge were captured.  In 2009, a special assessment was repeated with larger standardized muskellunge nets for the first time and met with good results.  A total of 95 muskellunge were captured and lengths of fish ranged from 33 to 48 inches with a mean around 41 inches.  Overall, the muskellunge population is healthy, maturing, and continues to provide an exceptional opportunity for area/regional anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe crappie population continues to do quite well in Fox Lake, with white crappies out numbering black crappies.  Both black and white crappie numbers continue to be higher than anticipated in Fox Lake.  Both species average lengths were nearly 10 inches with the largest crappie in the 13 inch range.  Since 1994 the white crappie catch in trap nets has outnumbered the black crappie catch by 2 or even 3 to 1.  Most likely, both black and white crappie have similar life histories within Fox Lake and their coexistence and hybridization has resulted in behaving as one population and not as separate populations.  Coincidentally, the crappie population as a whole has demonstrated a consistent decline in abundance each year since 2002.  Crappie are known to have a cyclic life-cycle, meaning that the population numbers increase during periods of good reproduction, then as the number decline due to natural and hooking mortality (removal by anglers), the sizes increase until the next round of good reproduction increases abundances again.  Both black and white crappie continue to provide the best chance to catch fish in Fox Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 22.7 fish/net, which was at the upper end of the expected range (2.0 to 27.9 fish/net).  By comparison, the average catch rate (1981 \u0013 2009) for yellow perch in gill nets in Fox Lake is 14.5 fish/set.  Total lengths ranged from 6 to 10 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  The chance of catching perch has been increasing since 2001 and sizes are beginning to become respectable for table fare. <br> \n <br> \n The channel catfish catch rate in gill nets was 2.3 fish/net, which was down from previous years (Range-0.6 to 15.2 fish/net).  Total lengths of channel catfish ranged from 17 to 25 inches with a mean of about 22 inches.  During the last 7 years, the average length of channel catfish has increased by nearly 9 inches.  The catch and sizes over the years suggested that channel catfish reproduction has been limited in recent years.  Because walleye are a primary species of management and although there may be anglers who target channel catfish on Fox Lake during the summer months, we are not planning to stock additional channel catfish due to the possibility that they may be competing with walleye for similar resources (e.g.,, black bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nOther important fish species present in Fox Lake include freshwater drum, black bullhead, common carp, and bigmouth buffalo.  The catch rate for freshwater drum in gill nets was 37.3 fish/net, which exceeded the objective range (4.0 to 32.3 fish/set).  In comparison, the average catch rate in gill nets since 1981 was 44.1 fish/net.  There does not appear to be a trend in freshwater drum abundance.  Total lengths ranged from 10 to 17 inches and averaged 12 inches.  The black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 0.2 fish/net, which was less than expected.  In fact, only six black bullhead were sampled in gill nets and trap nets combined in 2009 and the population numbers have continued to decline since 1999.   All of the bullheads sampled in 2009 were 11 inches and greater in length.  Natural reproduction is either very limited and/or heavy predation on smaller sized bullheads limit their abundance.  There are indications that common carp and bigmouth buffalo abundances are down.  The 2009 gillnet catch rates of 0.0 and 0.2 for common carp and bigmouth buffalo were well below the 1981 \u0013 2009 average of 6.6 and 1.3, respectively.  In the last few years commercial fishing effort has declined significantly in Fox Lake due to the declining carp and buffalo numbers.  Other fish species captured in relatively low abundance were bluegill, golden shiner, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Craig Soupir, NR Specialist-Fisheries <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>193 Muskellunge were sampled in April 2016.  Nets were large frame trap nets with 100 foot leads that were set on April 25th and checked and reset in the same location each day until April 29th for a total of 4 days of sets.  Of the 193 Muskellunge captured, 1 was recaptured twice and 40 were recaptured once resulting in 152 unique Muskellunge over 30\" caught in 2016.  Eighty of the 152 were captured for the first time ever in the 2016 netting.  Each Muskellunge was tagged with a uniquely identified passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag if not tagged in a previous year.  Muskellunge were tagged with PIT tags in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015 for a previous population estimate study so some captured muskies already had a tag.   <br> \n <br> \nOf the 152 unique Muskellunge that were measured there were 85 males and 61 females and 6 undetermined due to immaturity.  The average length of males was 39 inches and the average length of females was 45 inches with an overall average of 42 inches.  The minimum length of males was 34 inches and the minimum length of females was 39 inches.  The maximum length of males was 44 inches and the maximum length of females was 51 inches.  Most Muskellunge in the netting sample were over 42 inches.  In addition to the good size distribution of the Muskellunge in Fox Lake, the population abundance is also good.  Population estimates (# over 30 inches) have been done since 2011.  The estimates range from 190 to 251.  Since 2011, the population estimate has steadily increased from 190 to the current value of 251 Muskie over 30 inches in the population.  This amounts to 1 Muskellunge over 30 inches for every 4 acres of water on Fox Lake.  This is excellent for Fox Lake because the lake can have high densities of Freshwater Drum, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Common Carp.  Those rough fish provide excellent forage and provide good food to grow the Fox Lake Muskellunge to trophy sizes.       <br> \n <br> \nThe Muskellunge population appears to be doing well in Fox Lake with fish over 50 inches in the sample.  Additional spring large netting will be conducted in 2017 to further monitor Muskellunge in Fox Lake.  If anyone is interested in helping sample Muskellunge as part of the spring assessment they are welcome to contact the Windom DNR office at 507-831-2900 to volunteer.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre, class 24 lake located in Martin County near the City of Sherburn.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated.  Fox Lake's watershed is relatively small with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4 to 1 meaning for every 4 acres of upland area there is 1 acre of water in Fox Lake.  Watershed improvements and the closing of a diversion structure have resulted the return of aquatic vegetation, which provides habitat for fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed (an invasive plant) can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Curly-leaf Pondweed was first documented during a survey in 2006.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskellunge and Walleye and secondarily for Crappie, making it one of two lakes in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskellunge angling opportunities.  An annual survey was conducted on Fox Lake (starting September 8, 2020) to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.  Since the winter of 2019, Fox Lake has experienced poor water clarity and high levels of chlorophyll a, which is indicative of an increase in nutrients leading to a persistent algae bloom.  The water clarity during the netting survey was less than 1 foot.  Additionally, Alkalinity was 200 part per million.  For Southwest Minnesota Lakes, average alkalinity is 174 ppm with a 95% of readings falling within the 165-182 ppm range over the past 30 years.  This indicates a high alkalinity level for Fox Lake.  Currently, Fox Lake is experiencing nutrient overloading and resulting stress.  A look at the fish community can help reveal the level of stress and potentially help pinpoint causes and solutions.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nIn 2020, the Walleye catch rate was 0.5 per gill net, which is less than the 25 percentile (1.2 per gill net) for DNR class 24 lakes (collectively known as relatively deep southern/central Minnesota lakes).  From 2015 to 2017 the Fox Lake Walleye catch rate was on a 3 year increasing trend (5.7 in 2015, 9.8 in 2016, and 14.5 in 2017).  However, the past 3 years the gill net catch has been discouragingly low.  However, the trap net catch rates during those 3 years has been decent with a catch rate of 1.0 in 2018, 1.42 in 2019, and 0.92 in 2020.  The 2020 catch rate is within the normal range for class 24 lakes (0.27 to 1.24 per trap net).  It appears during the week of sampling in 2020 Walleye may have remained near shore away from the gill nets.  Gill nets are an offshore sampling method and capture fish in deeper water.  Fox Lake Walleye may be experiencing stress.  Three Walleye were aged and all 3 were different ages (2, 5, and 6), years when frylings (2014) and fingerlings (2015 and 2018) were stocked.  An additional year class was observed in the length frequency distribution and was most likely age-1 Walleye from fry stocking in 2019 that ranged in length from 8 to 10 inches.  Looking at all Walleyes sampled, lengths ranged from 8.58 to 23.66 inches and averaged 14.9 inches in gill nets and 13.6 inches in trap nets.  Walleyes in the sample showed less than expected body condition and were fairly thin but this was an improvement over 2019 when many Walleye were extremely thin with large heads and skinny bodies.  Due to low catch rates of Walleye over the past 3 years with fish in below average health stocking of Walleye fry will occur when surplus Walleye are produced in the hatchery.  The Walleye population will continue to be monitored annually to assess the effectiveness of Walleye stocking in Fox Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced into Fox Lake in 1999, were stocked in 2001 and were stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  Starting in 2019, Muskellunge fingerlings were stocked and will continue to be stocked every-other year (a change to odd year stocking).  No Muskellunge were captured in gill nets or trap nets in the 2020 survey.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskellunge.  The last Muskellunge survey utilizing special large frame trap nets that do sample Muskellunge well was done in 2017.  In the 2017 assessment Muskellunge were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 10.8 to 50.1 inches and averaged 42.2 inches.  The population estimate was 241 adults at that time.   <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nIn 2020, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 52.75 per trap net, which is greater than the 75 percentile for class 24 lakes (21.2 per trap net) and the second highest ever recorded.  Additionally, the catch rate is greater than the long-term average of 16.8 per trap net since 1981.  Fox Lake has had 6 successive years of catch rates above the long-term average indicating a return of good numbers of crappie.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 to 9.1 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged 6.6 inches in trap nets.  The mean and maximum lengths are similar to the past several years indicating fairly slow growth.  Black Crappie are self-sustaining in Fox Lake and stable with at least 2 or 3 strong year classes present based on netting.   <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2020 was 6 per trap net, which is within the normal range of catch rates for class 24 lakes (0.5 to 6.6 per trap net).  White Crappie lengths ranged from 5.2 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7 inches in the trap net sample.  Although the two species of crappie can coexist, Black Crappie are dominating the Fox Lake crappie fishery. However, it appears that the larger fish in the crappie population are White Crappie.  Hybridization can happen and could lead to increased growth and maximum size of crappie in the lake.  Continued monitoring will evaluate growth and hybridization.   <br> \n <br> \nAngling for Black or White Crappie should be good over the next several years.  There appears to be enough forage to support the population as they were healthy fish in fair condition.  Multiple strong year classes are present and the fish, although slow growing, should reach 10 inches or more.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOnly 1 Yellow Perch was caught in gill nets and trap nets in 2020.  The DNR may stock adult pre-spawn Yellow Perch to help boost the population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate was 31 per gill net, within the normal range of catch rates for class 24 lakes (4.0 to 32.3 per gill net) but more than the long-term catch rate of 16 per gill net.  There is some desire to remove large numbers of Freshwater Drum, however, past studies have shown that this only induces a reproduction response and can speed up growth and reproduction in Freshwater Drum.  Control of Freshwater Drum will instead focus on competition and predation.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, and Quillback Carpsucker.  Of the species listed in the previous sentence, Bigmouth Buffalo were very abundant and of particular concern.  While Bigmouth Buffalo are native, they can over populate and act as a source of competition for limited food resources.  They also have the ability to suspend sediments while disturbing the bottom of the lake while looking for food that can lead to internal nutrient loading and create poor water quality.  Continued monitoring will be done to track changes in numbers and species caught in Fox Lake.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet near the City of Sherburn in Martin County Minnesota.  Fox Lake's upland watershed is small with only 4 acres of land for every 1 acre of water.  Watershed improvements and closing of a diversion structure have facilitated the return of aquatic vegetation in some years, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Curly-leaf Pondweed was first documented during a survey in 2006.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskie and Walleye and secondarily for crappie, making it one of two lakes in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskie angling opportunities.  A survey was conducted on Fox Lake (starting September 6, 2022) to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 11 trap nets.  Surveys have been done annually since 1991 resulting in an excellent dataset to infer changes observed.  While watershed improvements have been done, since the winter of 2019, Fox Lake has had poor water clarity and high levels of Chlorophyll a (greater than 100 parts per billion).  The cause is not known, but high Chlorophyll a levels are indicative of an increase in nutrients (either internal or external in nature) leading to a persistent algae bloom, even under ice.  Alkalinity was 220 parts per million during the survey and ranged from 163 to 169 from May to September 2022.  For Southwest Minnesota Lakes, average alkalinity is 174 ppm with a 95% confidence interval of 165-182 ppm over the past 30 years.  This indicates a very high alkalinity level for Fox Lake as well.  Currently, Fox Lake is experiencing nutrient overloading and stress.  A look at the fish community can help reveal the level of stress and potentially help pinpoint causes and solutions.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nEight Walleye were caught in the trap net sample, no Walleye were caught in the gill nets.  From 2015 to 2017 the Walleye catch rate was on a 3 year increasing trend (5.7 in 2015, 9.8 in 2016, and 14.5 in 2017).  However, the past 5 years the gill net catch has been discouragingly low with catch rates never exceeding 1.6 per gill net.  Interestingly, the trap net catch rates (# per net) during the past 5 years has been decent with 1.0 in 2018, 1.4 in 2019, 0.9 in 2020, 0.8 in 2021, and 0.7 in 2022.  The 2022 trap net catch rate is within the normal range for similar lakes statewide (0.27 to 1.24 per trap net).  It appears during the week of sampling in 2022 Walleye remained near shore away from the gill nets.  This is typical of lakes experiencing heavy algae blooms where dissolved oxygen is low in the deep water habitat that is typically utilized during summer.  All Walleye sampled in trap nets were catchable sized adults and ranged in length from 15 to 20 inches.  Weights of Walleye in the sample showed an improvement compared to the past several years.  Additionally, larger fish tended to maintain good plumpness indicating forage is easily available.  Larger Walleye (1,422 fish at nearly 1 pound per fish, 13-15 inches) were stocked in September and October of 2021.  Those stocked fish did not have to experience stressful conditions observed in Fox Lake during 2018 to 2021 and thus maintained good weight once in the lake.  <br> \nTherefore, Walleye fry (390,000 fish) and fingerling (approximately 6,795 Walleye, 6-7 inches) were stocked in 2022 to continue to boost the population.  The Walleye population will continue to be monitored annually to assess the health of the Walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKIE <br> \n <br> \nMuskie were first introduced into Fox Lake in 1999 and subsequently stocked in 2001 and have been stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  The last two stockings were in October 2019 (N=475) and October 2022 (N=476). The recent 3 year gap in stocking was a byproduct of inconsistent statewide Muskie production, COVID related cessation of stocking in 2020, and a statewide reprioritization along with improvement in lessons learned with Muskie management.  No Muskie were captured in gill nets or trap nets in the 2022 survey.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskie during our annual survey in September.  Therefore, large frame trap nets are set every 5 years to sample the Muskie population.  A survey utilizing the large frame trap nets was done in May 2022.  No Muskies were sampled.  Five years prior during the 2017 assessment Muskie were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  During 2017, Muskie ranged in length from 10.8 to 50.1 inches and averaged 42.2 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate using 2017 as a recapture event) was 250 adults (193 to 307; 95 Percent Confidence Interval).  Given the recent water quality issues, however, a special targeted LTN assessment was conducted during the spring of 2021.  Five Muskie were caught in 3 days of netting with 2 nets each day (6 net nights).  Muskies sampled ranged in length from 39.1 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 42.2 inches.  Three males and 2 females were sampled.  Therefore, it is strange that 0 Muskie were sampled in 2022.  We suspect that the adult Muskie population has shifted to a much less abundant population, but Muskies are mostly likely still present.  It is very likely that the originally stocked fish in 1999 and the following year class in 2001 are now gone from the lake due to old age.  Since 2011 when PIT tagging was started on Fox Lake, 325 unique adult Muskie have been sampled and PIT tagged and 2,950 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked. A follow-up sampling event for Muskie will occur in the spring of 2023 to determine presence and size of individuals in the population.    <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured at a rate of 17.3 per trap net, which is within the normal range (1.8 to 21.2 per trap net) but down slightly from 23.0 per trap net in 2021.  However, the catch rate is nearly equal to the long-term average of 17.0 per trap net since 1981.  Fox Lake has had 8 successive years (2015-2022) of catch rates above or near the long-term average indicating a return of good numbers of crappie.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 4 to 13 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged nearly 7 inches in trap nets.  The average and maximum lengths are similar to the past several years indicating potential slow growth.  Black Crappie appear to be feeding successfully with most fish being plump.  The Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with at least 2 or 3 strong year classes present based on length frequency in trap nets.  The management goal was exceeded because the catch rate was above the desired range.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2022 was 66.8 per trap net, which exceeded the upper expected range (0.5 to 6.6) and is the greatest on record since 1981.  Additionally, the gill net catch rate was 20.3 per net, near the long term average of 20.1 per trap net.  Several years of above average catch rates are good news and potentially a signal that good crappie fishing may be just around the corner.  During the mid-to-late 2000's the Crappie population was dominated by many fish over 10 inches.  This was largely due to hybridization that occurs when White and Black Crappie numbers are high.  Currently, White Crappie lengths ranged from just under 5 inches to just over 10 inches and averaged 7 inches in the trap net sample.  White Crappie, similarly to Black Crappie, did not appear to have a definitive increasing or decreasing body weight relationship as length increased.  Unlike the past 7 years, White Crappie abundance exceeds Black Crappie abundance.  When this occurs there is an increased probability of hybridization during spawning.  Hybridization could lead to increased growth and maximum size attained by a future hybrid crappie population.  Continued monitoring will evaluate growth and hybridization.   <br> \n <br> \nMultiple strong year classes are present and the fish, although somewhat slow growing, could attain 10 inches or greater.  Annual surveys will monitor abundance and growth of Black and White Crappie.     <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2022 (0.2 per gill net) was lower than we would expect for lakes similar to Fox Lake. Catch rates of Yellow Perch have been characterized by extreme fluctuations from 2011 to 2016 followed by a drastic drop and maintenance of an extremely low abundance (less than 1 per gill net). This variability in gill net catches is most likely due to environmental conditions and potential resource scarcity and competition with increasing Black and White crappie populations.  However, with only 7 Yellow Perch caught in gill nets and trap nets in 2022 additional stocking may be warranted.  Yellow Perch were stocked by the Fox Lake Association during the spring of 2022, but those fish have not had time to spawn.  While Yellow Perch abundance remains low, additional stocking will be implemented in 2023 to boost broodstock.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate was 111 per gill net, more than twice the long-term average (47.7 per gill net) and above the normal range of 4 to 32 per gill net for similar lakes.  While the gill net catch rate was the greatest catch on record, the trap net catch rate was only 2.3 per net, less than the long-term average of 12 per net but above the normal range of 0.5 to 4.2 per trap net.  There is some desire among the Fox Lake Association members and Fox Lake Conservation League to remove Freshwater Drum to reduce their relative abundance, however, past studies have shown that this may actually induce a reproduction response and can speed up growth in Freshwater Drum.  Currently, the Freshwater Drum in the gill net and trap net sample range in length from 3 to 15 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches in the gill nets.  With the exception of a few of the largest Freshwater Drum in the sample, all of these fish are potentially subject to predation by the existing Muskie population and the newly stocked adult Walleye.  Predation coupled with potential commercial fish removal in the future may help to reduce Freshwater Drum abundance. However, this will not be a fast shift in abundance and could take several years with intensive stocking of gamefish to keep them in balance.    <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled included 198 Bigmouth Buffalo, 29 Bluegill, 2 Channel Catfish, 20 Common Carp, 6 Golden Shiner, 3 Quillback Carpsucker, and 1 Yellow Bullhead.  Of these species, Bigmouth Buffalo are of particular concern.  These fish, while native, can over populate and act as a source of competition for limited plankton resources due to their filter feeding which can shift the plankton community to one dominated by phytoplankton.  They also have the ability to suspend sediments while looking for invertebrate food sources that can lead to internal nutrient loading and create poor water quality.  The large 2013-2015 year classes of Bigmouth Buffalo appear to be a possible driver of poor water quality on Fox over the last few years.  While those year classes of fish continue to grow and move through the fish community, their growth appears to be slower than other populations in the Windom area.  Continued monitoring will be done to track changes in numbers and species caught in Fox Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is managed for walleye primarily because of the species popularity and their willingness to eatfreshwater drum.  In addition to providing a walleye fishery, the Windom Fisheries is evaluating the effectivenessof walleye for reducing/controlling the freshwater drum population.  During the 1994 survey, over 70% of thewalleye had eaten young-of-the-year freshwater drum.  Although there are a lot of walleye in Fox Lake and theydo eat freshwater drum, we do not have the information to say how long throughout the year walleye prey onfreshwater drum (because we only sampled the lake for one week).  Only time will tell if walleye can be aneffective predator on freshwater drum.     The walleye population was looking good in 1994.  The net catches indicated that the population was 7 timeshigher than most lakes that are similar to Fox Lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.1 to 25.2 inches but themajority of the fish were 12 to 16 inches.  We can't put the walleyes on the line for you but the fish werecertainly there.     The northern pike population has always been pretty low when we have sampled Fox Lake.  In 1994, the northernpike numbers were still low but there is a chance that you could catch a 12 to 20 pound fish.  The commercialseiners caught about 115 northern pike during the winter and approximately 25 of these fish were from 12 to 24pounds.  The fact that northern pike do not seem to be very successful in reproducing in Fox Lake may be anindication that there is insufficient quality spawning habitat.     Only a few largemouth bass have ever been sampled in Fox Lake and unless the submerged vegetation increasesthe population will likely remain low.  Bluegill is another species that really relies on submerged vegetationto have a good population.  These species do best when there is enough vegetation to provide protection for theadults spawning and guarding their nests and then for the newly hatched fish as they grow during the summer.  Asof 1994, the bluegill numbers had increased from previous surveys, but the population is still low.     Black crappie have been low during the last few years but they were successful in producing a good year classin 1994.  If this year class survives beyond their first year of life it should help to improve the black crappiepopulation.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.7 to 12.0 but most of the fish were about 4 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041 acre lake located near Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake is in lake class 24, is about 3.5 miles long and has 9.6 miles of shoreline.  The lakes bottom consists of sand, gravel, rubble, and muck.  Fox lake is managed primarily for walleye with largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike managed as secondary species.  In the past, Fox Lake was stocked with northern pike to control freshwater drum.  Recent surveys have indicated walleye may be more effective than pike.  Presently the lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings two of three years at a rate of 1.5 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre to control the freshwater drum population.The walleye population would be considered normal to high for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 7.5 to almost 26 inches and averaged 16.5 inches.  The average weight of walleye in Fox was 2 pounds.  Our data collected during the 1996 population assessment suggest that the population is well balanced.  Fish from 1994 and 1996 were the result of natural reproduction.The northern pike population would be considered normal for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Northern pike catch rates have increased from 0.1 fish/net in 1994 to 0.5 fish/net in 1996.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 25 to 39 inches and averaged 32.6 inches.  The average weight of northern pike collected during the survey was over 9 pounds.  In the past, northern pike were stocked to control freshwater drum.  Our data suggests they have been ineffective and walleye may have better success controlling drum.The yellow perch population has been relatively stable since 1994.  Numbers of yellow perch would be considered normal compared to lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 4 to almost 11 inches and averaged 9 inches.  The average weight of yellow perch in Fox Lake was almost ? pound.The bluegill population would be considered low to average for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Lengths of bluegill collected during the 1996 population assessment 3.5 to 8.5 inches and averaged almost 6 inches.  The average weight of bluegill was about 1/4 lb.The black crappie population would be considered average for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Catch rates for black crappie have decreased from 1995 but are still considered normal.  Lengths of black crappie collected during the 1996 population assessment ranged from 3.5 to 10.5 inches and averaged about 7.5 inches. The average weight of black crappie was 1/3 lb.The largemouth bass population was up from previous years.  This was attributed to a good hatch of largemouth bass in 1996.  The largemouth bass collected during the 1996 survey were from natural reproduction.  The black bullhead population is good compared to lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 5 to 13 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was almost 3/4 lb.  Black bullhead should provide excellent fishing opportunities in the future.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre, class 24 lake located in Martin County near the Town of Sherburn.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and has never been aerated.  Fox Lake's watershed is small with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4 to 1.  Watershed improvements and the closing of a diversion structure have facilitated the return of aquatic vegetation in some years, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  Curly-leaf pondweed, a non-native species of aquatic vegetation, can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Curly-leaf Pondweed was first documented during a survey in 2006.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskie and Walleye and secondarily for crappie, making it one of two systems in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskie angling opportunities.  A survey was conducted on Fox Lake (starting September 5, 2023) to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 11 trap nets.  Surveys have been done annually since 1991 resulting in an excellent dataset to observe track changes in fish abundances.  While watershed improvements have been done, since the winter of 2019, Fox Lake has had poor water clarity and high levels of Chlorophyll a (Over 90 parts per billion).  The cause is not known, but high Chlorophyll A levels are indicative of an increase in nutrients leading to a persistent algae bloom, even under ice.  Alkalinity was 200 parts per million during the survey and ranged from 157 to 163 from June to September 2023.  For Southwest Minnesota Lakes, average alkalinity is 174 ppm with many under 182 ppm for a high value.  Therefore, a value of 200 ppm is very high.  Currently, Fox Lake is experiencing nutrient overloading and lots of environmental stress.  A look at the fish community can help reveal the level of stress and potentially help pinpoint potential causes and solutions.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nFour Walleye were caught in trap nets and no Walleye were caught in the gill nets.  From 2015 to 2017 the Fox Lake Walleye catch rate was on a 3 year increasing trend (5.7 in 2015, 9.8 in 2016, and 14.5 in 2017).  However, the past 6 years the gill net catch has been discouragingly low. Interestingly, the trap net catch rates (# per net) during the past 6 years has been within the normal range (0.27 to 1.24 per trap net). In 2023 the trap net catch rate was 0.4 per net. It appears during the week of sampling in 2023 Walleye may have remained near shore away from the gill nets.  This is typical of lakes experiencing heavy algae blooms where dissolved oxygen can decrease in the deep water habitat that is typically utilized during summer.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.5 to 24.8 inches. It is surprising to continue to see the Walleye abundance numbers low in Fox Lake as stocking has ramped up. Walleye adults (1,422 individuals, 1,394 total pounds) were stocked in September and October of 2021 and fingerlings (7,134 individuals, 718 total pounds) were stocked in 2022.  With that many Walleye stocked, there should have been more than were sampled, indicating survival of stocked Walleye may be very low. The Walleye population will continue to be monitored annually to assess the effectiveness of Walleye stocking in Fox Lake and determine the correct stocking strategy moving forward. Depending on the success of production, Walleye fryling (fry raised until larger size and stocked in June) may be utilized again on Fox Lake. Frylings were discontinued in production and have not been stocked since 2015. However, they survived well and production may resume with Lower Mississippi Strain (Lake Sarah egg take) Walleye fryling to help boost some southern Minnesota populations that benefit from fryling stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKIE <br> \n <br> \nMuskie were first introduced into Fox Lake in 1999 and subsequently stocked in 2001 and have been stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  The last two stockings were in October 2019 (N=475) and October 2022 (N=476). The recent 3 year gap in stocking was a byproduct of inconsistent statewide Muskie production, COVID shutdown of stocking in 2020, and a statewide reprioritization along with improvement in lessons learned with Muskie management.  No Muskie were captured in gill nets or trap nets in the 2023 survey.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskie during our annual survey in September.  Therefore, large frame trap nets are set every 5 years to sample the Muskie population.  A survey utilizing the large frame trap nets was done in May 2022.  No Muskies were sampled.  Five years prior during the 2017 assessment Muskie were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  During 2017, Muskie ranged in length from 11 to 50 inches and averaged 42 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate using 2017 as a recapture event) was 250 adults (anywhere from 193 to 307 when including statistical error).  Given the water quality issues, a special targeted LTN assessment was also conducted during the spring of 2021.  Five Muskie were caught in 3 days of netting with 2 nets each day (6 net nights).  Muskies sampled ranged in length from 39.1 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 42.2 inches.  Three males and 2 females were sampled.  Therefore, it is strange that 0 Muskie were sampled in 2022.  We suspect that the adult Muskie population has shifted to a much less abundant population, but Muskies are likely still present.  Odds are high that the originally stocked Muskie in 1999 and the next year class in 2001 are now gone from the lake due to natural mortality (old age).  Since 2011 when PIT tagging was started on Fox Lake, 325 unique adult Muskie have been sampled and PIT tagged and 2,950 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked. Electrofishing for Muskie may occur in the next year or two to determine presence and size of individuals in the population.    <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were captured at a rate of 17.6 per trap net, which is within the normal range (1.8 to 21.2 per trap net) and similar to 17.3 per trap net in 2022. Additionally, the catch rate is nearly equal to the long-term average of 17.0 per trap net since 1981.  Fox Lake has had 9 successive years (2015-2023) of catch rates above or near the long-term average indicating a return of good numbers of crappie. Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5 to 10 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged nearly 6.5 inches in trap nets.  The mean and maximum lengths are similar to the past several years indicating slow growth and potential difficulty finding adequate food.  Black Crappie appear to have average or a bit below average body condition. The Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with at least 2 or 3 strong year classes present based on length frequency in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2023 was 40.3 per trap net, which exceeded the normal range of catch rates for class 24 lakes (0.5 to 6.6) and is one of the top 5 catch rates since 1981. Additionally, the gill net catch rate was 31.2 per net, well above the long term average of 20.5 per trap net.  Several years of above average catch rates are good news and potentially a signal that good crappie fishing may be just around the corner.  During the mid-to-late 2000's, the Crappie population was dominated by many fish over 10 inches.  This was largely due to hybridization that occurs when White and Black Crappie numbers are high.  Currently, White Crappie lengths ranged from 3.5 to 11 inches and averaged 6 inches in the trap net sample.  White Crappie, similarly to Black Crappie, had average body condition. As with 2022, White Crappie abundance exceeds Black Crappie abundance in 2023.  When this occurs there is an increased probability of hybridization during spawning.  Hybridization could lead to increased growth and maximum size attained by a future hybrid crappie population. Encouragingly, 2 hybrid crappie were observed in sampling in 2023. Continued monitoring will evaluate growth and hybridization.    <br> \n <br> \nMultiple strong year classes are present and the fish, although somewhat slow growing, could attain 10 inches or greater.  Annual surveys will monitor abundance and growth of Black and White Crappie.     <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2023 was 0 per gill net, which has happened 3 times since 2018 and indicates a very low abundance of Yellow Perch in the lake.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch have been characterized by extreme fluctuations from 2011 to 2016 followed by a drastic drop and continued level of low abundance (less than 1 per gill net). This variability in gill net catches is most likely due to environmental conditions and/or niche overlap and competition with increasing Black and White crappie populations. Habitat loss due to lack of submerged vegetation is also a potential cause. However, with only 1 Yellow Perch caught in trap nets in 2023 additional stocking is warranted.  Yellow Perch were stocked during the spring of 2022, but a resulting year class has not been observed yet.   While Yellow Perch abundance remains low stocking will be done in 2024 with adults if a source is found.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate was 118.3 per gill net, more than twice the long-term average (49.6 per gill net) and above the interquartile range of 4.0 to 32.3 per gill net for class 24 lakes.  While the gill net catch rate was the greatest catch on record, the trap net catch rate was only 9.6 per net, less than the long-term average of 12.0 per net.  There is some desire among the Fox Lake Association members and Fox Lake Conservation League to remove Freshwater Drum to reduce their relative abundance, however, past studies have shown that this may actually induce a reproduction response and can speed up growth in Freshwater Drum.  Currently, the Freshwater Drum in the gill net and trap net sample range in length from 5 to 13.5 inches with an average length of just under 10 inches in the gill nets.  With the exception of a few of the largest Freshwater Drum in the sample, all of these fish are potentially subject to predation by the existing Muskie population.  Predation coupled with potential commercial fish removal in the future may help to reduce Freshwater Drum abundance. However, this will not be a fast shift in abundance and could take several years with intensive stocking of gamefish to keep them in balance. A potential consideration is to stock yearling or adult Muskie instead of fingerling Muskie, which will serve 2 purposes. First, larger Muskie will act as a predator right away and larger Muskie have a greater chance of survival to larger sizes and thus eat more fish over time.    <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo (N=258), Bluegill (N=8), Channel Catfish (N=7), Common Carp (N=41), Golden Shiner (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=1), Quillback Carpsucker (N=2), and Yellow Bullhead (N=2).  Of these species, Bigmouth Buffalo are of particular concern.  These fish, while native, can over populate and act as a source of competition for limited plankton resources due to their filter feeding which can shift the plankton community to one dominated by phytoplankton.  They also have the ability to suspend sediments while looking for invertebrate food sources that can lead to internal nutrient loading and create poor water quality.  The large 2013-2015 year classes of Bigmouth Buffalo appear to be a possible driver of poor water quality on Fox over the last few years.  While those year classes of fish continue to grow and move through the fish community, their growth appears to be slower than other populations in the Windom area.  Continued monitoring will be done to track changes in numbers and species caught in Fox Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1041 acre lake that is managed primarily for walleye.  Additionally, Fox Lake is managed secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, muskellunge, and white crappie.   Lakeshore development has increased in the last 9 years.  Dissolved oxygen in the winter has never been a problem due in part to the open water from heated discharge from the power plant and due to the deeper water in the east end of the lake.  A recreational survey to assess angling effort and catch is scheduled for the summer of 2001 and winter of 2001-2002.  Walleye stocking regime calls for fry stocking three out of four years (1998, 1999, and 2000). Muskellunge fingerlings (yearlings) are scheduled to be stocked in the fall of 2001 and 2003.  The average walleye gill net catch rate was 6.83 fish/net. The catch rate was higher than the upper average range (6.33 fish/net) for this lake class.  Walleyes captured in gill nets range in size from 9.06 inches to 25.28 inches with a mean of 17.07 inches.  The walleye size structure was definitely worth your limited angler hours.  Artificial or natural recruitment of walleye is an issue the DNR monitors closely which is why the fall electrofishing for Age 0 walleye in 2000 was done.  Fall electrofishing found 14 Age 0 walleye/hr which indicated moderate survival of fry or natural reproduction.  Either scenario indicates some recruitment of walleye into the population.  Fall electrofishing is scheduled for 2001 to assess natural reproduction.  It appears the walleye population is holding steady and may be providing an additional benefit by controlling bullhead numbers.  Fox Lake has some real potential for walleye action.The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 18.75 fish/net. The catch rate for black crappie was close to the upper average range (21.16 fish/net) for this lake class.  Crappie catch rates have only twice been higher in the past 9 years.  Fish ranged in size from 3.43 to 9.53 inches with a mean of 7.54 inches.  The size structure of the black crappie population indicates a healthy fishery. Although the size of these crappie tend to be smaller, it can provide some good action!The average white crappie trap net catch rate was 33.00 fish/net. The catch rate for white crappie was greater than the upper average range (6.55 fish/net) for this lake class.  Only once in the last 9 years has the white crappie catch rate been larger.  These fish ranged in size from 4.02 to 9.96 inches with a mean of 7.67 inches.  This healthy population has some \"eaters\".The average bluegill trap net catch rate was 4.42 fish/net. The bluegill catch rate in trap nets was less than the lower average range (7.54 fish/net) for this lake class.  While catch rates for bluegill have been historically better, the sizes of fish in the system are nice.  The average channel catfish gill net catch rate was 6.67 fish/net.  The catch rate for channel catfish have been fairly consistent in the last 4 years.  Age 3 (321 mm) and Age 5 ( =423 mm) channel catfish tend to be slow growing so reasonable harvest should be self-imposed.  Fishing for channel catfish can be excellent and relaxing during those \"dog days\" of summer.No muskellunge were captured in trap nets but 4 were captured in gill nets during the survey in 2000.  All of the fish were between 25-27 inches and appeared to be in adequate condition.  The mean weight of the muskellunge captured was 3.09 lbs/fish.  Muskellunge need to be 40 inches to be harvested.  It will be a few years until harvest could be considered so please release muskellunge as quickly as possible if not beyond the harvestable length.  Occasionally a northern pike has been caught with survey nets so make sure your identification is positive before harvest occurs.  This population has the potential to be a good tool for controlling less desirable species.  The average freshwater drum gill net catch rate was 46.67 fish/net.  The catch rate for freshwater drum exceeded the upper average range (32.25 fish/net) for this lake class.  The drum population is dominated by smaller individuals so not much of a fishery exists.The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 20.00 fish/net.  The catch rate for black bullhead was greater than the average range (10.46 fish/net).  The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 2.25 fish/net.  The population of black bullhead might provide some recreational fishing opportunities.  Black bullheads always seem to provide action for teaching kids how to fish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.              </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1,041 acre lake in Martin County.  Fox Lake is a unique lake for the Windom Area as the opportunity exists to catch muskellunge.  Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for black and white crappie and channel catfish.  A re-survey was conducted the week of September 11, 2006 using gill nets, trap nets, and seine hauls.  The reason we use all these different gears is because each gear is used to index certain species in the population.  In 2006, submergent aquatic vegetation was comparatively more dense than historical vegetation surveys.  This will likely be good for natural reproduction for many of our gamefish in Fox Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of walleye in gill nets was 2.8/gill net, which was within the expected range for this type of lake.  The average length captured was 15.4 inches, but ranged from 8.8 to 26.8 inches.  Although the catch rate for walleyes has been historically higher at times, the variety of sizes may indicate a more stable population.  Walleye grew from 1.5 to 2.3 inches per year.  In 21 assessments on Fox Lake since 1981, the walleye catch rate has exceeded the upper normal range (6.3 walleye/gn) only 8 times.  The current stocking plan calls for stocking walleye fingerlings at 1 pound per littoral acre or around 780 pounds per year.  A variety of walleye sizes can be caught if the effort is put forth. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge data and status will be further determined in a spring 2007 assessment.  Although we sample muskellunge in our gears during our annual surveys on Fox Lake, the number of fish captured is limited and therefore their status is difficult to speculate on.  Only 1 muskellunge was captured in a gill net during the 2006 survey.  The captured fish was 24.7 inches and two years old.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish have done well in Fox Lake since 1997.  The catch rate of channel catfish in gill nets in 2006 was 6.7 fish/gill net.  Channel catfish have not been stocked in Fox Lake since 1986, which means the population has been self-sustaining.  Most of the fish captured ranged from 17.2 to 26.1 inches with an average of 19.4 inches.  Windom Area staff have observed an indirect correlation between black bullhead abundance and channel catfish abundance.  Typically, Windom Area lakes have relatively high bullhead abundance except in lakes where channel catfish are abundant.  Most of the fish were naturally reproduced in 2000.  If you are looking for something to fish for during those hot summer months, Fox Lake channel catfish will likely provide some good angling. <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie have thrived in Fox Lake and have consistently been abundant since 1997.  In 2006, both species grew around an inch per year and averaged around 8 inches long.  While the proportion of black to white crappie has varied over the years, the white crappie population has been more abundant.  Good numbers and sizes of both black and white crappies can be caught, especially in the spring.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile bluegill numbers appear to be similar to years past, natural reproduction of bluegills in 2006 was excellent.  Seine hauls sampled about 1600 young of the year bluegill.  Natural reproduction of bluegill and largemouth bass are often related to the amount of aquatic vegetation.  The 2006 aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed) was quite abundant on the south and east sides of the lake from shore out to around 5 feet deep.  Most of the adult bluegills were 5.5 to 7.5 inches.  It is quite possible that the abundance of bluegills could be higher in years to come.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in 2006 were common carp, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and shiners. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by  <br> \n <br> \nRyan Doorenbos        <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1,041-acre lake in Martin County with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  In the last few years aquatic vegetation (mostly sago pondweed) has gradually increased in abundance.  Generally when we see increasing aquatic vegetation in an area lake, it is a result of increasing water clarity.  Sago pondweed is important for fish and wildlife as it provides nursery and feeding habitat for small fish as well as cover from predators.  It is possible that seasonal (spring/early summer) changes in water clarity have increased, which may have brought on this resurgence of sago pondweed.  Sago is valuable from the water quality standpoint as nutrients are tied up in the aquatic vegetation instead of being available for algae production.  Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for channel catfish, white crappie, and black crappie.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of September 9, 2007 using 6 gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has increased slightly the last couple of years, but historical catch rates have been better.  The average length walleye sampled in gill nets in 2007 was 14.6 inches, but ranged from 8.3 to 26.3 inches.  Six year classes of walleye were sampled with most (91%) of the fish being Age 1 (8.1 inches), Age 2 (10.0 inches), and Age 3 (11.9 inches).  The walleyes sampled are likely from fingerling stocking, but natural reproduction has occurred in the past on Fox Lake.  Based on the netting results, there are a few larger walleye to target despite their apparent lower numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nOne of the problems with assessing muskellunge populations is the difficulty in sampling them.  Annual surveys done in September have sampled very few muskellunge since they were introduced into Fox Lake.  Only 1 muskellunge was captured in gill nets during the annual population assessment in 2007.  The fish was nearly 15 inches and likely from the fall 2006 stocking.  We did some additional netting (35-trap net sets) during the spring of 2007 to supplement our annual assessments.  Unfortunately, our nets only sampled 3 muskellunge, which averaged 37.5 inches in length.  On May 10, 2007, the commercial operator captured 6 muskellunge during a seine haul.  Total lengths ranged from 28.7 to 45.8 inches with a mean of 40.1 inches.  It would appear from this information that there are legal fish to be caught. <br> \n <br> \nThe freshwater drum catch rate in gill nets was the lowest since 2002 while the size structure was the largest in 4 years.  This suggests that the predators (muskellunge, walleye, and channel catfish) are eating smaller drum.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers remain high in Fox Lake.  Average total length was 18 inches, but ranged from 17.8 to 28.7 inches.   Catch rate since 2002 has averaged nearly 11 channel catfish/set, which was equal to the catch rate in 2007.  No channel catfish were captured less than 17 inches long, which may eventually benefit walleye numbers.  Channel catfish have not been stocked since 1986, which suggests the population is self-sustaining after this many years.  Those hot summer days could provide the angler some great catfishing with the potential of a trophy. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie in gill nets was the highest ever recorded.  Typically, trap nets have been a better indicator of crappie abundance.  The average length black crappie sampled in trap nets was 8.6 inches, but they ranged from 5.6 to 10.8 inches.  Typically, black crappies tend to do better than white crappie in lakes with higher clarity water.  Based on the ratio of black to white crappies in trap nets, the odds of catching white crappie are better.   <br> \n <br> \nThe white crappie catch rate in trap nets was 28.9/set, which was more than 4 times the expected range.  Sizes of white and black crappie were nearly identical.  Total lengths averaged 8.5 inches, but ranged from 7.3 to 10.1 inches.  Most (84%) of the fish were 8-9.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 20.5/set, which was within the expected range (2.0 to 27.9/set).  Since 2001, the abundance of yellow perch seems to be increasing steadily.  In fact, the catch rate in 2007 has increased nearly 10 times that of the 2001 catch rate.  Average length was 7.3 inches, but the range was from 6.1 to 9.4 inches.  The chance of catching perch has been increasing since 2001 and sizes will be respectable in a year or so. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, bluegill catch rates have been within the expected range only 3 times since 1981.  The bluegill catch rate in trap nets in 2007 was 2.7/set, which was equal to the catch rate in 2005.  Total lengths in 2007 averaged just over 7 inches.  Last year\u0019s six seine hauls captured nearly 1600 Age 0 bluegill.  It is possible that these fish were not large enough to be captured by trap nets in 2007.  With the high catch rate of Age 0 bluegill in the seine hauls last year and the resurgence of sago pondweed in 2007, catch rates of bluegills may increase in successive annual surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance continues to be low compared to other Windom Area lakes.  The catch rate in gill nets was 1.5/set and 1.2/set in trap nets.  Long-term abundance of black bullhead has been declining since 1985.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, green sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is a 1,041 acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet with nearly 75 percent of the lake having water less than 15 feet deep.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities and Fox Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lake class 24 consists of shallow relatively turbid lakes high in nutrients with a smaller littoral area and irregular shape.  The lake-to-watershed ratio for Fox Lake is 4-to-1, which indicates a relatively small influence of the watershed to the lake.  Watershed improvements have helped the return of aquatic vegetation.  As a result water clarity is gradually increasing.  A Martin County Soil and Watershed District led program started in 2012 is focused on further improving watershed conditions for Fox Lake as well other Martin County Lakes.  Improvements in the watershed for Fox Lake will continue to show up as improvements in water quality and clarity within the lake that will ultimately lead to healthier conditions for the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for panfish; in this case crappie.  However, Fox Lake is unique because it is also managed primarily for Muskellunge and is the southernmost Muskellunge lake in the state, which provides a unique angling opportunity.  In addition, Fox Lake has been gill netted and trap netted annually since 1991, which has provided an exceptional fish catch history to analyze fish population trends and make the best fish management decisions.  Finally, unlike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake has never been aerated during the winter and provides a more stable dissolved oxygen profile during winter when compared to other area lakes.  Ultimately, Fox Lake has proven to be a valuable and unique resource in southern Minnesota for lakeshore owners, local and regional anglers, as well as general recreational users.   <br> \n <br> \nThe management goals for Fox Lake are to maintain a Walleye population at an abundance that will consistently yield gill net catches above 6 fish per net with a balanced length distribution (fish of all possible sizes in the sample).  Another management goal is to continue efforts to establish a fishery for trophy size Muskellunge.  Lastly, another goal is to maintain secondary populations of crappie within interquartile ranges for trap net catches which are 0.5 to 6.6 fish per net for white crappie and 1.8 to 21.2 fish per net for Black Crappie.  Populations of the above mentioned species will be maintained through stocking (Walleye and Muskellunge) or natural reproduction (White and Black Crappie).  In order to assess the management goals for Fox Lake, a fish population assessment is conducted each September.  The following information outlines the information collected during the latest population assessment in September 2014 using 12 trap nets and 6 gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThe expected gill net catch rate of Walleye in Fox Lake is between 1.2 and 6.3 per net and the expected range for the trap net catch rate is between 0.3 and 1.2 per net.  The gill net catch rate in 2014 was 5.7 per net which is within the expected range and nearly equal to the management goal of 6 per net.  In addition, the trap net catch rate was 1.3 per net which is equal to a normal catch rate for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Historically, the Fox Lake gill net catch rate has been sporadic with catches ranging from 0.5 to 45.2 from 1981 to 2001 with an average catch rate of 9.8 per gill net during that same time frame.  Since 2002, the catch rates have varied to a lesser degree from 0.5 to 5.7 with an average catch rate of 2.4 Walleye per gill net indicating a more stable and less abundant fish population.  The reduction in the average catch rate from 9.8 Walleye per gill net from 1981 to 2001 to 2.4 Walleye per gill net from 2002 to 2013 is not easily explainable and is most likely the result of many factors.  From 1979 to 2009 Fox Lake was stocked with Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults. Analyzing the catch rate after each stocking, it appeared that the highest catch rates were correlated to fry stockings in 1983 and 1984 and intensive fingerling stocking in 1992 and 1993.  But, suppressed catch rates from 2002 to 2013 occur during similar stocking strategies indicating other factors may be involved.  Since 1998, competition for limited prey resources has never been higher in Fox Lake with the emergence of robust populations of White crappie, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Channel Catfish and the decline of Black Bullhead as an additional forage base.  In addition, Muskellunge have been stocked in Fox Lake since 1999 adding an additional predator.  Starting in 2010, Walleye frylings (2 to 3 inch fish) have been stocked annually showing some improvement in gill net catch rates, 3.2 to 3.5 fish per gill net from 2011 to 2012.  However, competition with other predators or other unknown factors appears to continue to suppress the Walleye population abundance.  In response, fingerling Walleye were stocked in the fall of 2013.  The gill net catch rate in 2014 (5.7 per net) was 1.6 to 3.1 times greater than catch rates over the previous 3 years.  All age-1 Walleye (2013 year class) caught in the 2014 gill net sample were inspected for oxytetracycline (OTC) marks on their inner ear bones (known as otoliths).  An OTC mark would indicate that the Walleye is from the fryling stocking (marked fish) in 2013 and not the fingerling stocked fish in 2013.  Four of the 23 age-1 Walleye (17%) had an OTC mark.  This indicated that the fryling stocking may have only contributed 17% of the Walleye in the 2013 year class.  Therefore, the fingerling stocking was highly successful making up 83% of the age-1 fish, assuming no natural reproduction occurred.  The size structure of the population was also good in 2014 and shows promise for the perpetuation of catchable size Walleye in the future.  Walleye of all sizes are becoming more common in anglers catches with local fishing reports indicating the \"best Walleye fishing in recent years\".  The Walleye in the sample in 2014 ranged from 10.0 to 25.0 inches with an average size of 13.9 inches in the gill net sample and 19.6 in the trap net sample.  Aging of otoliths from gill net fish revealed 5 age groups (ages 1, 4, 5, 6, and 17).  Interestingly, only 2 age-4 fish and 4 age-1 fish can be directly linked to fryling stocking showing a limited contribution of fryling stocking from the Walleye in the aged sample (n=34).  Regardless of stocking method, Walleye in the sample were healthy and had good body condition.  Future abundance of the Walleye population appears directly related to other species leading to competition for limited food sources at times and potential negative interactions at the time Walleye are stocked.  Improvement of the Walleye population abundance will most likely occur if White Crappie, Black Crappie, or Channel Catfish abundance decreases (none are stocked).  Additionally, it may be beneficial to stock Walleye fry in the spring of each year and add additional fingerling Walleye if needed.  Without a reduced abundance of other predators in Fox Lake or a change in management it is likely that the population will not exceed current abundance levels.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nMuskie have been stocked into Fox Lake starting in 1999 with subsequent stockings in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.  No natural reproduction of Muskie has been documented in Fox Lake so all fish present are from stocking.  Ages of Muskie in Fox Lake range from 2 to 17 years old.  Muskies over 10 years old have the ability to reach trophy size so potential exists for the Fox Lake Muskie population to have trophy individuals present in the lake.  In 2014, 2 Muskies were caught in the trap net sample (0.2 fish per net).  Muskie are not effectively sampled with gill nets or standard trap nets and the long-term catch rates from 2000 to 2014 reflect that with gill net catch rates varying from only 0 to 0.7 fish per net.  Therefore, in 2011 a long-term Muskie study was started focusing on obtaining information leading to a population estimate that will help determine the ideal stocking rate for Fox Lake. Large-frame trap nets were used in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in the spring to capture Muskie, particularly Muskie greater than 34 inches (considered mature adults).  In 2011, 140 Muskie were caught over 2 weeks in May.  The Muskie ranged in length from 14.5 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 41.7 inches.  In 2012, 45 Muskie were caught over 3 weeks in April and May. Muskie ranged in length from 31.0 to 48.7 inches with an average length of 41.5 inches.  In 2013, 107 Muskie were sampled over 2 weeks in April and May.  Muskie ranged in length from 29.0 to 50.4 inches with an average length of 41.1 inches.  Fluctuations in catch rates from year-to-year is the result of vastly different spring water temperatures and duration of spring spawning conditions.  Population estimates from the 3 year study put the population number of Muskie greater than 34 inches somewhere between 190 to 287 individuals with 95% confidence.  This indicates the population is doing well and many large Muskies are present in the lake.  The Muskie population will be monitored bi-annually with large frame trap nets starting in the spring 2015.       <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n  <br> \nTwo species of crappie (Black and White) have been sampled historically in Fox Lake.  However, in 2014 only Black Crappie were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  The catch rates of Black Crappie were 6.8 fish per gill net (n=41) and 6.9 fish per trap net (n=83).  Catch rates of Black Crappie are not necessarily the best indicator of how well the population is doing.  Black Crappie catch rates tend to vary widely from year to year and even from season to season and the population size structure is more indicative of the overall health of the population in the lake.  Black Crappie ranged in size from 3.4 to 13.6 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches in the gill net sample and 6.1 inches in the trap net sample.  Overall, it appears that the Black Crappie population has a balanced size structure.  Production of younger Black Crappie (3-4 inch fish) in the population in 2014 also helped to balance the Black Crappie population.  Future assessments, including potential spring trap netting, will monitor the Black Crappie populations to determine relative abundance, size structure, and recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch in Fox Lake are the main forage for the Walleye and muskellunge populations.  Fluctuations in the abundance of the Yellow Perch population can lead to fluctuations in the Walleye and Muskellunge populations.  The historical catch rates of Yellow Perch in the gill nets range from a low of 0.3 per gill net in 1992 to a high of 80.5 in 2012 and from 0 per trap net in 1986, 1989, and 1992 to 22.6 per trap net in 1997.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was a more typical catch rate of 25.0 fish per gill net (n=150).  However, over the past 4 years the Yellow Perch population has fluctuated from lows of 1.5 (2013) and 1.8 per gill net (2011) to a high of 80.5 per gill net (2012).  A cause in the swing in catch rate from very low to very high is not completely understood, but growth of vast aquatic vegetation beds over the last 5 years may give the Yellow Perch population a place to successfully hide from survey nets as well as from predators.  Increased survival of the Yellow Perch in Fox Lake will improve the chances of sustaining a consistent abundance of forage sized fish in the lake that will help the Yellow Perch population sustain itself.  The size of Yellow Perch in the 2014 sample ranged from 5.2 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches in the gill net sample and 8.0 inches in the trap net sample.  This range of sizes may be a little large for Walleye forage but it is adequate for Muskellunge, and at levels that will allow for plentiful availability.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish caught in the 2014 survey were Bigmouth Buffalo (278), Black Bullhead (84), Channel Catfish (20), Common Carp (26), Freshwater Drum (532), and Largemouth Bass (1).  Of the species listed above, Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, and Freshwater Drum are the most prevalent.  Bigmouth Buffalo in the population are mainly 4 to 7 inches indicating successful spawn in recent years.  Channel Catfish are doing well in Fox Lake and currently range in length from 20.4 to 28.9 inches with an average weight of 5.7 pounds. The abundant Channel Catfish population is the suspected reason why the bullhead population is not as prevalent as it has been in the past due to predation and competition for common resources.  Finally, Freshwater Drum are the most abundant \"rough\" fish in the population with a gill net catch rate of 42.5 fish per net.  Freshwater Drum in the 2014 sample ranged in length from 4.8 to 19.4 inches with an average of 10.9 inches in the gill net sample and 14.9 inches in the trap net sample.  With an abundant Muskie and potentially expanding Walleye population, Freshwater Drum will increasingly become important as forage for larger Muskellunge and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the Fox Lake fish community appears to be doing well with a diverse fish community that is seeing improvements in managed fish species abundance and/or size structure.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community.  Wise use of our natural resources makes us good stewards to the land and water that all of us use every day. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

Nets were large frame trap nets that were set on April 24th and checked and reset in the same location each day until April 28th for a total of 4 days of sets.  Of the 125 Muskies captured, 12 were recaptured more than once and 2 were less than 30 inches resulting in 111 unique Muskie over 30 inches (referred to as adults) caught in 2017.  Twenty of the 111 were newly encountered in the 2017 netting.  Each Muskie was tagged with a PIT tag if not tagged in a previous year.  Muskies were tagged with PIT tags in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 for a previous population estimate study so some captured muskies already had a tag.  <br> \n  <br> \nOf the 111 unique Muskie over 30 inches there were 65 males and 42 females and 4 undetermined.  The average length of males and females was 40.3 inches and 45.7 inches respectively with an overall average of 42.3 inches.  The minimum length of males and females was 34.9 inches and 38.1 inches respectively.  The maximum length of males and females was 45.5 inches and 50.1 inches respectively.  In addition to an excellent size distribution, the population abundance was also good.  Population estimates (# over 30 inches) have been done since 2011 on Fox Lake, with the exception of 2014.  The most recent population estimate was for 2016 as the 2017 netting finalized the 2016 estimate.  The 2011 estimate was 258, the 2012 estimate was 210, the 2013 estimate was 193, the 2015 population estimate was 242, and the 2016 population estimate was 248.  Since 2011, the population estimate has remained relatively stable from a low of 193 to a high of 258.  Additionally, due to increase sampling and confidence the 2016 of 248 is the most reliable.  This amounts to 1 Muskie over 30 inches for every 4 acres of water on Fox Lake.  This is excellent for Fox Lake, which at times can have high densities of Freshwater Drum, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Common Carp.  Those fish, especially Bigmouth Buffalo, provide excellent forage and energy to grow the Fox Lake Muskies to trophy sizes.   <br> \n       <br> \nThe Muskellunge population appears to be doing well in Fox Lake with fish over 50 inches in the sample.  Angling for Muskie can range from excellent to difficult on Fox Lake.  Water clarity reductions due to temporary algae blooms can hamper techniques that traditional Muskie anglers are used to.  Don't be afraid to vary the style of angling on Fox Lake.  Be willing to utilize lures that mimic prey that are more common to southern Minnesota.  For example, due to a recent boom of young Bigmouth Buffalo, anglers would be smart to utilize lures that mimic those soft bodied rough fish.  Good luck landing the big one!   <br> \n  <br> \nAdditional spring netting will be conducted in the future to further monitor Muskellunge in Fox Lake.  If anyone is interested in helping sample Muskellunge as part of the spring assessment they are welcome to contact the Windom DNR office at 507-831-2900 to volunteer.        <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As part of a standard survey on Fox Lake during 2017, an additional nearshore survey was conducted from 4 August 2017 to 7 August 2017.  Sampling for the nearshore survey involved backpack electrofishing and seining in wadable water at locations along the lakeshore.  Fox Lake had 12 shoreline locations, 100 feet in length, where both backpack electrofishing and seining with one-eighth inch mesh was conducted.  Seventeen species of fish were sampled.  Species included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Spotfin Shiner, Spottail Shiner, Walleye, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Of those species caught, 7 had young-of-the-year representation indicating successful reproduction.  Young-of-the-year species were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Sunfishes (including Bluegill, Crappies, and Bass) and minnows (including Buffalo and Shiners) made up the majority of the fish which is indicative of good vegetative cover and critical habitat for those species.  A previous IBI survey was conducted in 2010 and sampled some species not found in 2017.  Species not found in 2017 were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Emerald Shiner.  During the standard survey in 2017, Black Bullhead and Common Carp were present, so the only species absent was Emerald Shiner.  It is quite possible that Emerald Shiner could actually have been either misidentified young Spotfin Shiner or young Spottail Shiner.  Therefore, species present within Fox Lake has remained stable for the past 8 or more years.  Fox Lake appears to be a relatively healthy southern Minnesota Lake based solely on the fish community data.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of lakeshore habitat on Fox Lake was conducted on 7/6/2017.  The assessment consisted of 91 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 67.0(+/- 2.3), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 69 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 55.7(+/- 2.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.5(+/- 1.3).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Fox Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre lake located near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated.  Fox Lake's watershed is relatively small compared to the size of the lake (4 acres of land for every 1 acre of water).  Watershed improvements and the closing of a diversion structure on the west end has helped water quality and has allowed aquatic vegetation to return, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskellunge and Walleye and secondarily for crappie, making it one of only two lake systems in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskellunge angling opportunities.  An annual fish community survey is conducted on Fox Lake and was done during the first week of September 2018 using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nIn 2018, the Walleye catch rate was 0.5 per gill net, which is below the expected range of 1.2 to 6.3 per gill net and is tied for the lowest catch rate observed since sampling began.  Prior to 2018, the Walleye catch rate was experiencing a resurgence with a three year increasing trend.  The lack of Walleye captured in gill nets is a bit concerning, however, a catch rate of 1 per trap net in 2018 falls within the normal range for similar lakes.  During the week of sampling in 2018 Walleye may have remained near shore away from the gill nets.  Gill nets are an offshore sampling method and capture fish in deeper water.  One year with a poor catch rate followed by 3 high years does not indicate a population level failure, but instead indicates behavior or catchability changes during the week of sampling.  Fox Lake is sampled every year and 2019 sampling should help to give a better indication of the Walleye population in Fox Lake.  If the catch rate remains low, then there may be a need to alter Walleye management.  Three ages of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2014, 2015, and 2016, which all correspond to stocking.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from nearly 11 to just over 22 inches and averaged 13 inches in gill nets and 14 inches in trap nets.  Growth of Walleye in Fox Lake was slower, but not surprising given the type of lake, for southern Minnesota with Walleye only reaching 11.5 inches by age 3.  Walleyes in the sample were in fair health, not skinny but not fat.  Future stocking may include the newly reestablished Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye from the Lake Sarah egg take which may help to boost the population in Fox Lake.  Walleye angling has been better on Fox Lake over the past 4 years and should continue to be good in 2019.     <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Fox Lake in 1999, were stocked in 2001 and have been stocked every other year since 2004.  No Muskellunge were captured in the annual standard survey because standard gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample them.  In the 2017 assessment using large frame trap nets, Muskellunge were captured at a rate of 3.9 per set per day.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 11 to just over 50 inches and averaged 42 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate) was 241 adults or equivalent to 1 adult muskellunge every 4 acres.  Since 2011, 325 unique adult Muskellunge have been sampled and PIT tagged and 1,999 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked.  Trophy Muskie are now present in Fox Lake and catch rates have been above statewide averages so targeting them should be easier than usual for Muskie fishing. Get out there and give it a try, you just might find you are the one that gets hooked! <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nIn 2018, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 35.2 per trap net, which is greater than the expected catch rate range of 1.8 to 21.2 per trap net.  Historically, the catch rate is greater than the long term average of nearly 14.6 per trap net and is the third highest ever recorded.  Fox Lake has had 4 successive years of catch rates above the long-term average indicating a potential return of good numbers of crappie.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3 to 14 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged 7.5 inches in trap nets.  The average length is an increase of a half inch since 2017 indicating decent growth.  Black Crappie are healthy and appear to be finding adequate food. The Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with at least 2 strong age groups present based on lengths observed in trap nets.  Black Crappie fishing is Fox Lake's bread and butter and it should continue to get better in the years to come with some big fish present. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2018 was 1.5 per trap net, which is within the expected catch range of 0.5 to 6.6 on similar lakes.  White Crappie ranged in length from just under 6 inches to nearly 10 inches and averaged 7 inches in the trap net sample.  Although the two species of crappie can coexist, Black Crappie are dominating the Fox Lake crappie fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was 0.5 per gill net, less than the expected catch rates for similar lakes (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net).  The catch rate of Yellow Perch has been up and down since 2011. This variability in gill net success is most likely due to environmental conditions and not true population changes.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 7 to almost 8 inches and averaged just over 7 inches.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate was slightly above 71 per gill net, above the long term average of 45 per gill net and higher than the expected catch rate for similar lakes (4.0 to 32.3 per gill net).  There is a desire by local anglers to remove Freshwater Drum to reduce numbers, however, past studies have shown that this only creates a reproduction response and actually speeds up growth and reproduction in Freshwater Drum.  Freshwater Drum cannot be removed fast enough by humans to truly make an impact.  Control of Freshwater Drum should instead focus on competition (Bluegill or Crappie) and predation (large Muskie).  The Channel Catfish catch rate was 0.33 per gill net.  Only 2 Channel Catfish were caught that were 13 inches and 23 inches.  Fourteen Bluegill, 5 to just under 8 inches in length, were sampled in trap nets.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and Quillback Carpsucker. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

GILLNET CATCHES FOR NOP HAVE DECLINED FROM A HIGH OF 3.0 FISH PER SET IN 1986 TO 0.7 FISH PER SET IN 1991. THE 1986 STOCKING WAS PRIOR TO THE LAKE SURVEY AND MAY BE THE REASON FOR THE HIGHER CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT IN 1986.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP WERE 3.8 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR FRD INDICATE A STEADY DECLINE IN THE POPULATION SINCE 1986.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR FRD REMAIN HIGH.  50 OF THE 60 FRD MEASURED IN THE TRAPNETS WERE BETWEEN 8.8 AND 10.5 INCHES.

Nets were set on April 27th and checked and reset in the same location each day until May 8th, excluding the weekend.  Each muskie was tagged with a uniquely identified passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag.  Of the 37 muskies captured, 1 was not measured and 1 was captured twice.    Muskies were tagged with PIT tags in 2011, 2012, and 2013 for a previous population estimate study so some captured muskies already had a tag. <br> \n <br> \nOf the 35 unique muskie that were measured there were 19 males and 13 females and 3 undetermined because they were not old enough.  The average length of males was 40 inches and the average length of females was 44 inches with an overall average of 41 inches.  The minimum length of males was 35 inches and 37 inches for females.  The maximum length of males was 43 inches and for females was 50 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe muskie population appears to be doing well in Fox Lake with fish equal to 50 inches in the sample.  Additional spring large netting will be conducted in 2017 to further monitor muskie in Fox Lake.  If anyone is interested in helping sample muskies as part of the spring assessment they are welcome to contact the Windom DNR office at 507-831-2900 to volunteer.  Handling and collecting information from a large muskie is a rewarding and unique process that can be shared by all interested anglers.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is a 1,041 acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet with nearly 75 percent of the lake having water less than 15 feet deep.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities and Fox Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lake class 24 consists of shallow relatively turbid lakes high in nutrients with a smaller littoral area and irregular shape.  A 1.8 foot water transparency was observed during the summer of 2015.  The following information outlines the information collected during the latest population assessment in September 2015 using 12 trap nets and 6 gill nets.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThe expected gill net catch rate of Walleye in Fox Lake is between 1.2 and 6.3 per gill net and the expected trap net catch rate range is between 0.3 and 1.2 per net.  The gill net catch rate in 2015 was 5.7 per net which is within the expected range and nearly equivalent to the management goal of 6 per net.  In addition, the trap net catch rate was 1.9 per net which is higher than what we would expect for lakes similar to Fox.  Historically, the Fox Lake gill net catch rate has been sporadic with catch rates ranging from 0.5 to 45.2 from 1981 to 2001 with an average catch rate of 9.8 per gill net during that same time frame.  Over the past 5 years, catch rates have varied to a lesser degree from 1.8 to 5.7 with an average catch rate of 4.0 Walleye per gill net indicating a more stable fish population.  Walleye of all sizes are becoming more common in anglers catches with fisherman indicating the \"best Walleye fishing in recent years\" during the 2014 and 2015 seasons.  The Walleye in the sample in 2015 ranged from 8.4 to 25.7 inches with an average size of 14.7 inches in the gill net sample and 16.7 in the trap net sample.  Aging of ear bones (otoliths) from gill netted Walleye revealed 4 age groups (ages 1, 2, 4, and 6).  Walleye in the sample were healthy.  The outlook for Walleye fishing in Fox Lake looks good with a stable population where nearly 40% of the fish in the sample in 2015 were over 15 inches.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, no Muskies were caught in the gill net or trap net sample.  Muskie are not effectively sampled with gill nets or standard trap nets and the long-term catch rates from 2000 to 2015 reflect that with gill net catch rates varying from only 0.0 to 0.7 fish per net.  Therefore, in 2011 a long-term Muskie study was started focusing on obtaining information leading to a population estimate that will help determine the ideal stocking rate for Fox Lake.  Population estimates from the 3 year study put the population number of Muskie greater than 30 inches somewhere around 225 individuals.  This would mean there is 1 Muskie about every 4-6 acres in Fox Lake.  This indicated the population was doing well and many large Muskies were present in the lake.  Additional population estimates will be conducted in the future, as large frame trap netting will be conducted during the spring biennially beginning in 2015.  Every other year spring large frame trap netting was started in 2015.  The 2015 spring large frame trap survey caught 37 muskies over the course of 2 weeks in April and May.  Of the 37 muskies captured, 1 was not measured and 1 was captured twice that spring.  Each Muskie was tagged with a uniquely identified passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag which allows us to tell how many times we catch a fish and how much the fish has grown since it was last captured.  Muskies were also tagged with PIT tags in 2011, 2012, and 2013 for the population estimate study so some captured muskies already had a tag.  Of the 35 unique Muskie that were measured there were 19 males and 13 females and 3 undetermined due to immaturity.  The average length of males and females was 40 inches and 44 inches respectively with an overall average of 41 inches.  The minimum length of males and females was 35 inches and 37 inches respectively.  The maximum length of males and females was 43 inches and 50 inches respectively.  The Muskie population appears to be doing well in Fox Lake with fish approaching the trophy category of greater than 50 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n     <br> \nTwo species of crappie (Black and White) have been sampled historically in Fox Lake. Black Crappies have 7-8 dorsal spines and white crappies have 5-6 dorsal spines.  In 2015, 366 Black Crappie were sampled in gill nets and trap nets and only 2 White Crappie were sampled in the trap nets.  The catch rate of White Crappie was 0.2 per trap net, below the expected range of 0.5 to 6.6 per trap net.  Over the past 3 surveys (2013 to 2015) only 6 White Crappie have been caught in gill nets and trap nets.  The catch rates of Black Crappie in 2015 were 8.2 fish per gill net and 26.4 fish per trap net.  It should be noted that this is the 4th highest catch rate of black crappie in trap nets in 30 surveys going back to 1981.  The message is that black crappie abundance is increasing and smaller fish dominate the fishery at this time.  The gill net catch rate was within the expected range of 2.5 to 16.5 fish per gill net and the trap net catch rate exceeded the expected range of 1.8 to 21.2 per trap net.  Black Crappie ranged in size from 3 to 14 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  Eighty percent of the Black Crappie were between 5 and 8 inches in the 2015 sample.  With continued growth more keeper fish should be present in a year or two.  In the meantime, large Black Crappie are present in Fox Lake and anglers should be able to harvest a few crappie bigger than 14 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch in Fox Lake are the main forage for the Walleye and Muskellunge populations.  Fluctuations in the abundance of the Yellow Perch population can lead to fluctuations in the Walleye and Muskellunge populations.  The historical catch rates of Yellow Perch in gill nets range from a low of nearly 0 per gill net in 1992 to a high of 80.5 in 2012 and from 0 per trap net in 1986, 1989, and 1992 to 22.6 per trap net in 1997.  The 2015 gill net catch rate was a more typical catch rate of 27.7 fish per gill net.  However, over the past 4 years the Yellow Perch population has fluctuated from lows of 1.5 (2013) and 1.8 per gill net (2011) to a high of 80.5 per gill net (2012) and finally the current 25.0 to 27.0 per gill net in 2014 and 2015.  This variable catch rate is not completely understood, but growth of aquatic vegetation beds over the last 5 years may give Yellow Perch a place to successfully hide from survey nets as well as from predators.  However, targeting the weed line or these vegetation beds should make it easier for anglers to catch the Yellow Perch.  The size of Yellow Perch in the 2015 sample ranged from 6 to just shy of 10 inches with an average length of 8 inches.  As Yellow Perch continue to grow, anglers should be able to catch more harvestable sized Yellow Perch.   Currently, the range of sizes is better suited for Walleye and Muskellunge forage and Yellow Perch are at levels that will allow for plentiful prey availability.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish caught in the 2015 survey were Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, and Largemouth Bass.  Of the species listed above, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, and Freshwater Drum are the most significant contributors to the fish community.  The Bigmouth Buffalo in the population are mainly 8 to 11 inches indicating a strong year class and good forage for large Walleye and Muskellunge.  Bluegill have started to become more stable in the fish community with a catch rate of 2.7 per trap net with sizes ranging from 3 to just over 8 inches.  Channel Catfish are doing well in Fox Lake too and currently range in length from 12 to 29 inches with an average weight of nearly 5.5 pounds!  Finally, Freshwater Drum are the most prevalent native \"rough\" fish in the population with a gill net catch rate of 57 fish per net.  Freshwater Drum ranged in length from 7.5 to 18.5 inches with most between 10 to 15 inches.  With an abundant Muskellunge and potentially expanding Walleye population, Freshwater Drum may increasingly become important as forage for trophy Muskellunge and large Walleye.  Freshwater Drum are not often utilized by anglers or large predators in Fox Lake and are only just becoming susceptible to predation by large Muskellunge as those fish are now commonly above 40 inches.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the Fox Lake fish community appears to be doing well with a diverse fish community that is seeing improvements in managed fish species abundance size structure.  Further improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community.  Wise use of our natural resources makes us good stewards to the land and water that all of us use every day. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre lake located in Martin County near the City of Sherburn.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated because it typically doesn't experience low oxygen levels.  Fox Lake's watershed is relatively small as indicated by a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4 to 1.  Watershed improvements and the closing of the diversion have facilitated the return of aquatic vegetation, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskellunge and Walleye and secondarily for Crappie, making it one of two systems in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskellunge angling opportunities.  An annual survey was conducted on Fox Lake (September 6, 2016) to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, the Walleye catch rate was 9.8 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 6.3 per gill net) and was the highest catch rate observed since 1997.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 16.3 inches and averaged 12.3 inches.  Growth of Walleye was normal, as mean length at age-3 was 13.6 inches, and Walleyes were plump indicating that food is not limited.  Three year classes of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2013, 2014, and 2015, which all correspond to stockings of frylings and/or fingerlings.  Walleye angling should be good on Fox Lake in the spring of 2017 as a good population is present.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Fox Lake in 1999, were stocked in 2001 and have been stocked every other since 2004.  No Muskellunge were captured in the annual standard survey because the standard gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample them.  In the 2016 assessment using large frame trap nets, Muskellunge were captured at a rate of 7.4 per set-day, with 80 untagged Muskellunge captured.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 34.1 to 50.6 inches and averaged 41.9 inches.  The population estimate in 2015 (the last reliable estimate) was 251 adults (183 to 345; 95 Percent CI).  Muskellunge provide a unique angling opportunity in southwest Minnesota and provide the opportunity to catch a trophy sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 19.4 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes and is greater than the long term average of 12.6 per trap net since 1981.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.3 to 11.3 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Black Crappie were fat, indicating that food is not limited for Crappie in Fox Lake. The Black Crappie population appears to be self-sustaining and stable with at least four year classes present in the trap nets.  The White Crappie catch rate in 2016 was 1.7 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes and is the first time they have been sampled since 2013.  White Crappie lengths ranged from 4.1 to 10.9 inches and averaged 7.5 inches (PSD=30, PSD-P=10), with at least 3 year classes present.  Although the two species of crappie can coexist, it appears that Black Crappie are dominating the Fox Lake crappie fishery.  Crappie angling should be good in the spring around downed trees and other shallow structure when crappies move into shallow water to spawn.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2016 was 30.5 per gill net, which is above the interquartile range of catch rates for class 24 lakes (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.8 to 9.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate was 41.8 per gill net, slightly below the long term average of 44.5 per gill net, but higher than the interquartile range of catch rates for class 24 lakes (4.0 to 32.3 per gill net).  The Channel Catfish catch rate was 1.7 per gill net.  Channel Catfish were large as lengths ranged from 21.5 to 29.6 inches and averaged 24.4 inches.  Ten Bluegill, 3.7 to 7.5 inches in length, were sampled in trap nets.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Largemouth Bass, and Common Carp. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is one of the deeper lakes in the area located one mile northeast of Sherburn.  Fox Lake contains a diverse fish community and is one of the most utilized lakes in Martin County.  The importance of the Fox Lake fishery has resulted in it being monitored annually.  The lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish and largemouth bass as secondary species.  An important lake management objective is to reduce freshwater drum numbers so the other species can thrive.The walleye population looked good in 1997.  The net catches indicated the population was 2.5 times higher than most lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10.5 to 26.0 inches and averaged 16.2 inches.  Seven year classes of walleye were identified by aging scales.  Walleye aged from a year no stocking occurred must be from natural reproduction.  We know there is some natural reproduction in Fox Lake.  It will require more investigating to determine how much and how often natural reproduction happens.  Walleye fishing should be good for a couple years.In 1997, we sampled good numbers of black and white crappie.  When compared to lakes similar to Fox Lake, it appears to have a moderate black crappie population but a high population of white crappie.  Unfortunately for the angler, many of those fish are still small.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.7 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  White crappie lengths ranged from 4.1 to 9.1 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  The majority of the crappie were almost two years old and averaged about 7.0 inches.  Given another year or two of growth, crappie fishing should be decent on Fox Lake.Largemouth bass and bluegill are two species that do best when there is good vegetation available in the shallows.  Both species build their nests near vegetation in sandy areas.  Largemouth bass and bluegill young feed on insects and fish that live on and around vegetation.  Vegetation also helps young fish to avoid predators.  Fox Lake has some vegetation but probably not enough to allow good largemouth bass or bluegill populations to develop.  These populations were relatively low when compared to lakes similar to Fox Lake and probably will remain low.  Although their numbers were low, largemouth bass and bluegill grow fast in Fox Lake.  Fast growth rates for these species could result in a few trophy fish in the lake.The channel catfish population has really expanded in the last few years.  Channel catfish have been in Fox Lake for many years but we usually only heard of a few big fish being caught.  Channel catfish have not been stocked since 1986.  Therefore, these young fish are from natural reproduction.  When we used the spine of a catfish to age it, we found two, three, four, and five year old fish.  Twelve fish were five years old and they averaged almost 20.0 inches.  Channel catfish can grow to 20 or 30 pounds so be ready for a battle if you hook one.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed but lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, poor septic systems, fertilizing lawns, and mowing lawns down to the lakeshore can also be harmful.  Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

Gillnet catch indices for walleye are below state and local medians (25% and 37% respectively).  Trapnet catch indices for walleye were substantially above state and local medians.  Net catch indices for black crappie and yellow perch are above state and local medians.  Net catch indices for northern pike and bluegill are below state and local medians.  Net catch indices for freshwater drum remain substantially above state and local medians.  Shoreline seining indicates very successful natural reproduction by bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox is a 1,041 acre lake with a maximum depth of 20.0 feet located near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  The lake is presently managed for walleye and muskellunge as the primary species while black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  Fox is assessed annually and was assessed during the week of September 10th in 2001 using six gillnets and 12 trapnets.  A creel survey was conducted on Fox during the summer of 2001 and winter of 2001-2002.  Walleye and muskellunge fingerlings were stocked in 2001.  The abundance of walleye in Fox is very comparable to other lakes like Fox.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gillnets ranged from 12.0 to 27.0 inches and averaged 15.6 inches while lengths of walleye sampled in trapnets ranged from 8.0 to 25.2 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Because of a combination of stocking and natural reproduction, seven year classes of walleye were observed during the survey.  The lake has been stocked the last five years and should provide a good walleye fishery in the future.The abundance of muskellunge is low at this point but what we anticipated with a new fishery.  The lake was stocked with two year old muskellunge in 1999.  Lengths of muskellunge sampled during the survey ranged from 22.3 to 31.3 inches and averaged 28.6 inches.  The average weight of muskellunge sampled in trapnets was 5.1 pounds.The abundance of black crappie was average compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 3.1 to 11.4 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Anglers reported good black crappie fishing during the winter of 2001-2002 with some nice size crappie caught.The abundance of white crappie was high compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of white crappie ranged from 3.9 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.The abundance of bluegill was low compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 3.8 to 8.5 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.The abundance of yellow perch was average for lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 6.5 to 9.4 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  Good perch fishing was reported by area anglers during the winter of 2001-2002 with fish in the 8 to 9.5 inch range.Channel catfish fishing in Fox has historically been a popular sport among area anglers.  The abundance of channel catfish is still high for lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of channel catfish ranged from 10.4 to 21.8 inches and averaged 18.8 inches.The abundance of black bullhead is normal compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 9.7 to 11.2 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  Black bullhead fishing has been popular in the past and the lake should provide good angling opportunities in the future.Other fish species sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum, common carp, quillback, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.  A big step in improving the water quality was taken when the diversion was closed on Fox lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre lake located near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated.  Fox Lake's watershed is relatively small compared to the size of the lake (4 acres of land for every 1 acre of water).  Watershed improvements and the closing of a diversion structure on the west end has helped water quality and has allowed aquatic vegetation to return, which provides habitat for several species of fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskellunge and Walleye and secondarily for Crappie, making it one of only two lake systems in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskellunge angling opportunities.  An annual fish community survey is conducted on Fox Lake and was done during the first week of September 2017 using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nIn 2017, the Walleye catch rate was 14.5 per gill net, which exceeds the normal range for class 24 lakes (lakes that Fox Lake is similar to within Minnesota) and is tied for the 4th highest catch rate since sampling began.  In addition, it is the highest catch rate since 1997 and is now part of a three year increasing trend of catch rates (5.7 per net in 2015, 9.8 per net in 2016).  Part of the reason for a return in Walleye numbers has been a change in management from small fingerling (fryling) to fall fingerling stocking.  As a result, five age groups of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 which all correspond to years when frylings and/or fingerlings were stocked.  Over the past several years, fingerling stocking has been more effective at surviving to catchable sized fish.  Lengths of Walleye in the sample ranged from just under 9 inches to just under 28 inches and averaged 14 inches.  Growth of Walleye was average for class 24 lakes with age 3 Walleye reaching 13.5 inches; however, this is a slow growth rate compared to other shallow southwest Minnesota Lakes.  Walleyes in the sample were in fair health indicating fish are finding adequate prey, but could use additional food to fatten up.  Future stocking of fall fingerlings will include the newly reestablished Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye from Lake Sarah.  Eggs from Lake Sarah will be transplanted to rearing ponds as fry and then raised until fall when they will be stocked into Fox Lake.  Fishing for Walleye on Fox Lake may be heating up! Until recently, Walleye were a bonus fish for Crappie and Muskellunge anglers.  Now, Walleye can be targeted on Fox Lake with good numbers of harvestable fish present.      <br> \n   <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Fox Lake in 1999, were stocked again in 2001 and have been stocked every other year since 2004.  No Muskellunge were captured in the annual standard survey because standard gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample them.  In the 2017 assessment using large frame trap nets, Muskellunge were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  Muskellunge ranged in length from 11 to 50 inches and averaged 42 inches.  The most recent population estimate indicates that there are 241 adult muskellunge over 30 inches in Fox Lake, with a range from 192 to 290 when factoring error into the model.  Since 2011, 325 unique Muskellunge have been caught and tagged.  Muskellunge fishing can be very good on Fox Lake at times.  Larger fish are starting to be found in the sample.  A trophy fish may be as close as one cast away on Fox Lake, give Muskellunge fishing a try on Fox Lake; just remember, a 54 inch minimum size limit is in effect (release all fish less than 54 inches). <br> \n  <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nIn 2017, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 56.2 per trap net, which is greater than the expected range of catch rates for lakes similar to Fox and the highest ever recorded!  Additionally, the catch rate is greater than the long term average of 14 per trap net since 1981.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5 to just over 12.5 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged nearly 7 inches in trap nets.  Black Crappie are foraging successfully with many of the larger fish having \"thick\" bodies and excellent condition. The Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with several year classes present based on length frequency in the trap nets.  Black Crappie fishing will start to heat up over the next 3 to 5 years on Fox Lake as the fish continue to grow.   <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2017 was 3.3 per trap net, which is within the normal range of catch rates for lakes similar to Fox.  White Crappie lengths ranged from over 6 inches to 10.5 inches and averaged nearly 8 inches.  Although the two species of crappie can coexist, Black Crappie are dominating the Fox Lake crappie fishery and will make up most of the Crappie that you will catch.  However, some White Crappie have the ability to grow very large with some reaching 15 plus inches in the past on Fox Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2017 was 7.8 per gill net, which is within the normal range of catch rates for lakes similar to Fox.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from just under 6 inches to just over 8.5 inches and averaged just shy of 7.5 inches.  Yellow Perch are currently at an average abundance, but may be more difficult to target with as many Crappie and other species present.  Yellow Perch are Fox Lake's prey base for Walleye and Muskellunge.  But, don't give up hope& some larger Yellow Perch can be caught while targeting other species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum (aka Sheephead) catch rate was 41 per gill net, slightly below the long term average of 44.4 per gill net, but higher than the normal range of catch rates for lakes similar to Fox.  Sheephead have historically been abundant on Fox Lake and continue to remain a dominant part of the fishery.  Don't overlook a hooked Sheephead, they are an excellent food fish and should be utilized more than they are.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 1.7 per gill net.  Channel Catfish were large as lengths ranged from 23 to 29 inches and averaged nearly 27 inches.  Expect a fight if you tie into one of these catfish!    <br> \n <br> \nFifty Bluegill were caught in the trap nets and ranged from 4 to 8 inches.  As aquatic plants start to return, so will Bluegill. These fish are creatures of habitat.  Bluegill are making somewhat of a resurgence on Fox Lake and savvy anglers should be able to target them.  Find pockets of submerged vegetation and fish near the edges, this should bring you luck.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Presently Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye with secondary management for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  The walleye population is high for lakes similar to Fox Lake but the average size is small.  The average weight of walleye from our 1993 survey was just over 1/2 lb. and average length was about 10.5 inches long.  The reason for the small average weight was because of a strong year class of 1 year old fish.  These fish should be around 1 lb. for the 1994 fishing season.  There is still a good population of walleye in the 14 inch and longer range however.  Walleye lengths on Fox Lake ranged from 7.0 inches to just over 25 inches.Fox Lake has a fair number of black crappie present.  The average weight of black crappie is almost 1/2 lb.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 inches to 11.5 inches and averaged 8 inches.  Bluegill numbers are low in Fox Lake but the average size of almost 1/2 lb. is very good.  The average length of bluegill is about 7 inches. Fox Lake is well known for black bullhead fishing and 1994 should be no exception.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 8 inches to 13 inches and averaged 3/4 of a lb.  This is an excellent population of black bullhead in the 10 to 13 inch range.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake, near the town of Sherburn, is a 1041 acre lake in Martin County.  Walleye and muskellunge are the primary species of management.  Additionally, Fox Lake is managed secondarily for black and white crappie and channel catfish.  Since 2001, the walleye catch rate has been somewhat lower than desired.  In an effort to boost the walleye fishery, the Windom DNR Fisheries Office has stocked 2.2 tons of walleye fingerlings since 2001.  A population assessment was conducted the week of September 7, 2004 using 6 gill nets and 12 trap nets.The walleye catch rate has been similar during the last 3 surveys and within \"normal\" range. At least 4 year classes of walleye were captured in gill nets and trap nets and averaged 18-19 inches. With the recent emphasis on walleye fingerling stocking and typically higher survival of fingerling stockings, it is likely walleye numbers will increase in the next couple of years.  Although Fox Lake might now be less known for walleye, other species such as crappie and muskellunge might provide some excitement and action you might not find on other lakes in the Windom Fish Management Area.No muskellunge were captured during the 2004 survey.  However, muskellunge do not trap well at this time of the year.  A total of 251 muskellunge have been captured during commercial seine hauls since 2001.  Personal contacts with local anglers indicate some  muskies are being caught by hook and line at certain times of the year.  According to the local anglers and commercial fishermen, many of the muskies captured are greater than 40 inches, growing well, and are in good condition.  Another interesting observation from the 2004 survey was the lack of common carp and bigmouth buffalo caught in our survey nets and commerical fishing seine hauls.  It is possible that the muskies are eating these species of fish as juveniles which may be a factor why so few were captured in survey nets and commercial seine hauls. Remember that muskellunge that are not 40 inches long have to be returned to the water. The black crappie catch rate was 11.5/trap net which is higher than the average (6.50/trap net).  Total lengths ranged from 5.9 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  The black crappie size structure was similar to the 2003 survey.  Historically, Fox Lake crappie fishing has been excellent in the spring.  Based on the netting information from the 2004 survey, anglers can look forward to some descent action for crappie in the spring of 2005.  The white crappie catch rates was nearly 52/trap net which is at least 7 times higher than the upper normal range (6.5/trap net).  Most of the fish are in the 6-8 inch range and averaged 7 inches.  Very few fish were captured greater than 8 inches.  Like the last few years, crappie action will be fast but most of the fish (either black or white crappies) won't be huge.The channel catfish catch rate in gill nets was 8.3/set compared to 13/set in 2003.  A fairly substantial year class of fish are in the 12-13 inch range.  The sizes of fish have not changed significantly since last year which would be expected given the fact that they only grow a couple of inches per year.  Total lengths ranged from 11.0 to 23.8 inches and averaged 14.6 inches.  Channel catfish have not been stocked since 1986 which means the population is self-sustaining.  These fish could provide some exciting action on those hot summer days when the crappie and walleye are finicky.    A total of eleven species of fish were sampled during the survey of 2004.  Other species were black bullhead, bluegill, northern pike, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041-acre, moderate depth lake located in Martin County near the City of Sherburn.  Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and is not aerated.  Fox Lake provides a unique fishery, in that it is managed primarily for Muskie and Walleye and secondarily for crappie, making it one of two lakes in the Windom fisheries management area that provide Muskie angling opportunities.  A survey was conducted on Fox Lake (starting September 8, 2020) to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 11 trap nets.  Surveys have been done annually since 1991 resulting in a great ability to track changes in the fish community.   <br> \nFox Lake's watershed is relatively small, with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4 to 1, basically indicating that there are only 4 upland acres for every 1 water acre.  Past watershed improvements have helped lead to the return of aquatic vegetation in some years, which provides spawning and nursery habitat for several species of fish.  In addition, curly-leaf pondweed can become abundant in the southeast area of Fox Lake when conditions are favorable.  Curly-leaf Pondweed was first documented during a survey in 2006.  Recently, aquatic vegetation has been sparse and Fox Lake has been dominated by algae.  Since the winter of 2019, Fox Lake has had poor water clarity and high levels of chlorophyll-a, which is indicative of an increase in nutrients (either internal or external in nature) leading to a persistent algae bloom, even under ice.  Alkalinity was 240 part per million.  For Southwest Minnesota Lakes, average alkalinity is 174 ppm with a 95% confidence interval of 165-182 ppm over the past 30 years.  This indicates a very high alkalinity level for Fox Lake.  Currently, Fox Lake is experiencing nutrient overloading and stress.  A look at the fish community can help reveal the level of stress and potentially help pinpoint causes and reveal potential solutions.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nIn 2021 no Walleye were caught in the gillnet sample.  From 2015 to 2017, the Fox Lake Walleye catch rate was on a 3 year increasing trend (5.7 in 2015, 9.8 in 2016, and 14.5 in 2017).  However, the past 4 years the gill net catch has been discouragingly low.  The trap net catch rates during those 4 years has been decent with a catch rate of 1.0 in 2018, 1.4 in 2019, 0.9 in 2020, and 0.8 in 2021.  The 2021 catch rate is within the interquartile range for similar lakes (0.27 to 1.24 per trap net).  It appears during the week of sampling in 2021 Walleye may have remained near shore away from the gill nets.  However, 7 of 9 Walleye sampled in trap nets were less than 11.5 inches.  Looking at all Walleye sampled, lengths ranged from 10.1 to 15.9 inches and averaged 11.6 inches.  Walleye in the sample showed less than desired body condition with an average plumpness which is an index to their foraging success.  There did not appear to be a size based difference with respect to body size, indicating the fish were average condition across all sizes.  The lake management goal was not met because the catch rate was below 6.0 per gill net.  Due to low catch rates of Walleye over the past 4 years, 1,422 catchable Walleye adults (1,394 pounds; nearly 1 pound per fish) were stocked in September and October of 2021.  Walleye fry and adults will continue to be stocked to boost the population.  The Walleye population will continue to be monitored annually to assess the effectiveness of increased stocking in Fox Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKIE <br> \nMuskie were introduced into Fox Lake in 1999 and subsequently stocked in 2001 after which point they were stocked every other year from 2004 to 2018.  In 2019, Muskie fingerlings were stocked again due to a surplus of fish produced in state fish hatcheries.  No fingerlings have been stocked since 2019, but will be stocked again in 2023. The recent change in stockings have been a byproduct of inconsistent statewide Muskie production, COVID shutdowns, and statewide reprioritization along with improvement in lessons learned with Muskie management.  Gill nets and trap nets are usually ineffective at sampling Muskie during our annual gill net and trap net surveys and that held true in 2021 with no Muskie being sampled.  The last Muskie survey utilizing special large frame trap nets was done in 2017.  In the 2017 assessment Muskie were captured at a rate of 3.9 per net per day.  Muskie ranged in length from 10.8 to 50.1 inches and averaged 42.2 inches.  The population estimate in 2016 (the last reliable estimate using 2017 as a recapture event) was 241 adults (192 to 290; 95 Percent Confidence Interval).  Since 2011, 325 unique adult Muskie have been sampled and PIT tagged and 2,474 fingerling Muskie have been PIT tagged and stocked.  Given the water quality challenges since 2019 on Fox Lake, a special targeted LTN assessment was conducted during the spring of 2021.  Five Muskie were caught in 3 days of netting with 2 nets each day.  Muskies sampled ranged in length from 39.1 to 48.9 inches with an average length of 42.2 inches.  Three males and 2 females were sampled.  Full-fledged mark-recapture sampling will occur in the springs of 2022 and 2023 to capture and recapture adult Muskie and determine if population numbers are similar to 2016 and if management adjustments should be made.    <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nIn 2021, Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 23.0 per trap net, which is greater than the upper normal range for similar lakes (21.2 per trap net) but down substantially from 52.75 per trap net in 2020.  Additionally, the catch rate is greater than the long-term average of 16.9 per trap net since 1981.  Fox Lake has had 7 successive years of catch rates above the long-term average indicating a return of good numbers of crappie.  However, lengths of Black Crappie are lagging behind at this point.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 4.2 to 8.9 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged 6.6 inches in trap nets.  The mean and maximum lengths are similar to the past several years indicating potential slow growth.  Black Crappie appear to be foraging successfully as indicated by good body condition, but there is a decline in body condition for larger Black Crappie indicating some foraging stress and may explain slow growth.  Overall, the Black Crappie population is self-sustaining and stable with at least 2 or 3 strong year classes present.  The management goal was exceeded because the catch rate was above the desired abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie catch rate in 2021 was 19.9 per trap net, which exceeded the expected normal range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 6.6).  Additionally, the gill net catch rate was 48.17 per net.  The last time the White Crappie trap net or gill net catch rates were equal to or greater than 2021 was during the early to mid-2000's.  This is a positive sign for the Fox Lake Crappie population.  During the mid-to-late 2000's the Crappie population was dominated by many fish over 10 inches.  This was largely due to hybridization that occurs when White and Black Crappie numbers are high.  This may result again in the near future.  Currently, White Crappie lengths ranged from 4.6 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.4 inches in the trap net sample.  White Crappie displayed the same decreasing body condition trend as Black Crappie.  Unlike the past 6 years, White Crappie abundance is approaching and potentially exceeding Black Crappie abundance.  When this occurs there is an increased probability of hybridization during spawning.  Hybridization could lead to increased growth and maximum size attained by both species of crappie.  Continued monitoring will evaluate growth and hybridization.   <br> \n   <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2021 was 0 per gill net, which is less than the normal catch rate range for similar lakes (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net) and unchanged from 0 in 2020.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch have been characterized by extreme fluctuations since 2011. This variability in gill net catches is most likely due to environmental conditions and/or competition with increasing Black and White crappie populations.  However, with only 1 Yellow Perch caught in trap nets in 2021 it is our plan to add some Yellow Perch broodstock to Fox Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate was 87.0 per gill net, nearly twice the long-term average (45.9 per gill net) and above the expected catch rate range of 4.0 to 32.3 per gill net for similar lakes.  While the gill net catch rate was the third greatest catch on record, the trap net catch rate was only 6.73 per net, less than the long-term average of 12.24 per net but above the expected normal catch rate range of 0.5 to 4.2 per trap net.  Currently, the Freshwater Drum in the gill net and trap net sample range in length from 3.5 to 15.3 inches with an average length of 9.8 inches in the gill nets.  With the exception of a few of the largest Freshwater Drum in the sample, all of these fish are potentially subject to predation by the existing Muskie population and the newly stocked adult Walleye.  Predation coupled with potential commercial fish removal in the spring of 2022 may help to reduce Freshwater Drum abundance. However, this will not be a fast shift in abundance and could take several years with intensive stocking of gamefish.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo (N=216), Bluegill (N=14), Channel Catfish (N=6), Common Carp (N=14), Golden Shiner (N=1), Quillback Carpsucker (N=1), and Yellow Bullhead (N=1).  Of these species, Bigmouth Buffalo are of particular concern.  These fish, while native, can over populate and act as a source of competition for limited plankton resources due to their filter feeding.  They also have the ability to suspend sediments while looking for invertebrate food sources that can lead to internal nutrient loading and create poor water quality.  The larger 2013-2015 year classes of Bigmouth Buffalo appear to be a possible driver of poor water quality on Fox over the last few years.  While those year classes of fish continue to grow and move through the fish community, their growth appears to be slower than other populations in the Windom area.  Continued monitoring will be done to track changes in numbers and species caught in Fox Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041 acre lake located near Sherburn in Martin County.  The lake is about 3.5 miles long and has 9.6 miles of shoreline.  The lakes bottom consists of sand, gravel, rubble and muck.  Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye with largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill and northern pike managed as secondary species.Catch rates for walleye declined substantially since 1994.  Local anglers reported 25 - 40 boats per day taking home limits of walleye from 1.5 to 2.5 lbs. in May of 1995.  Despite this decline, the walleye population is still considered higher than normal for lakes similar to Fox.  Net catches indicated that the population in 1995 was comprised of mainly larger fish.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 27 inches with an average length of 16.5 inches.  The average weight of walleye in Fox was almost 2 lbs.  Walleye fingerlings are presently stocked 2 out of 3 years and were last stocked in the Fall of 1995.Catch rates for black crappie were high for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Net catches indicate the population is comprised of mainly larger fish.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches and had an average length of 8 inches.  The average weight of black crappie was 1/3 of a lb.  The black crappie population has increased since 1994.The bluegill population is considered normal compared to lakes similar to Fox.  The bluegill population has increased since 1994.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches and had an average length of 6.5 inches.  The average weight of bluegill was about 1/4 of a lb.  Net catches indicated the bluegill population was comprised of mainly large fish.The yellow perch population is considered normal to lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Net catches increase since 1994 indicating a population increase.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 7 to 9.5 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  The average weight of yellow perch in Fox Lake was about 1/3 of a lb.Black bullhead catch rates were high compared to lakes similar to Fox.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 7 to 13 inches averaged 11 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead in Fox Lake was 0.5 lbs.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is located just north of Sherburn and is one of the deeper prairie lakes in the area.  Fox Lake contains a diverse fish community and is one of the most important lakes in Martin County.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species with black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, and largemouth bass as secondary species.Walleye numbers have varied a lot in the last ten years.  There have been years of excellent fishing and some years of moderate to poor fishing.  Fishing success is determined by much more than just the number of walleye in the lake.  Great walleye fishing generally occurs when the population is high, food for walleye is low, and the weather cooperates for anglers.Prior to 1998, Fox Lake received walleye fingerlings (1.5 lbs/littoral acre) two of every three years.  Walleye fingerlings typically range from 5.0 to 9.0 inches (10-25 fish to the pound) in the fall and cost about 10 times more than walleye fry.  Walleye fry are about a day old and the size of a mosquito larva.  Due to the differences in survival for fingerlings and fry, more fry are stocked than fingerlings.  Beginning in 1998, walleye fry were stocked at a rate of 1,000/acre, on a two of every three year rotation.  Under this new stocking plan, it's believed the population can be maintained and probably improved.  Since Fox Lake is sampled on a yearly basis, determining the effectiveness of fry stocking should only take three or four years.In 1998, walleye numbers were above average when compared to lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.8 to 25.6 inches, and averaged 17.5 inches.  After their first two years of growth, walleye averaged more than 13 inches.  Management goals for walleye were reached in 1998.  Walleye fishing should continue to be good for the next couple of years. Fish populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all effect the success of a given year class.  Any increase in the available spawning and nursery habitat, such as vegetation and overhanging tree branches, should help improve the panfish populations.Black crappie catch rates have varied considerably from 1994 to 1998.  The black crappie sample was dominated by the strong 1997 year class.  Growth was good with fish averaging 7.5 inches in two years.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 5.9 to 10.5 inches, and averaged 6.8 inches.  Fishing for black crappies could be good after the fall of 1999 when these fish have grown to a size desirable to anglers. Largemouth bass and bluegill require good underwater vegetation to thrive.  These species build their nest in sandy/gravel areas near vegetation.  The young bass and bluegill feed on insects and fish that live on and around vegetation, and the vegetation helps young fish to avoid predators.  Although Fox Lake has some vegetation, it is probably not enough to allow the largemouth bass and bluegill populations to expand.  Largemouth bass and bluegill experience good growth in Fox Lake.  These species can add to a fun day on the water, with the possibility of catching a trophy.The channel catfish population had been increasing from 1994 to 1997 but declined slightly in 1998.  The expansion of the channel catfish population is a result of natural reproduction.  Channel catfish lengths ranged from 10.8 to 21.4 inches, with an average of 12.7 inches.  These fish should provide some exciting fishing experiences once they get larger.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to improve the water quality of Fox Lake through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, poor septic systems, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Improved land use practices by everyone should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 1,041 acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County.   Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet; however, roughly 75 percent of the lake is considered littoral (less than 15 ft deep).  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical and chemical similarities and Fox Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Class 24 lakes have associated fish abundance averages that then can be used to compare Fox Lake with other similar class 24 lakes.  The lake to watershed ratio for Fox Lake is 4 to 1, which indicates a relatively small influence of the watershed to the lake.  The water clarity for Fox Lake has improved since a water diversion structure was welded shut that brought more drainage to Fox Lake.  Following the closure of the structure aquatic vegetation has returned; a 2.1 foot water transparency was observed during the summer of 2010. <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for black and white crappie.  However, Fox Lake is unique within the Windom Fish Management area because it is the only lake that is managed for muskellunge and the lake represents the southernmost muskellunge lake in the state, which provides a very unique angling opportunity.  In addition, Fox Lake has been surveyed annually since 1991, which has provided an exceptional dataset to infer fish population trends and direct subsequent fish management decisions.  Finally, unlike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake has never been aerated during the winter and provides a more stable dissolved oxygen profile when compared to other area lakes.  Ultimately, Fox Lake has proven to be a valuable and unique resource in southern Minnesota for lakeshore owners, local and regional anglers, as well as general recreational users.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIn order to assess the management goals for Fox Lake, a lake survey with nearshore sampling was conducted in September 2010 using trap nets, gillnets, seining, and backpack electrofishing.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate in 2010 was 4.0 fish/net, which was the highest catch rate since 2000 and was within the expected catch range for this type of lake.  The walleye in the gill nets had an average length of 11 inches and ranged from 9.5 to 17 inches.  A 28 inch walleye was caught in a trap net indicating large fish are present in the lake.  The overall size structure of the walleye indicated a population that is dominated by fish smaller than 15 inches.  Currently, 3 age groups were present (1, 2, and 4 year olds) in the gill net catches with walleye reaching 13.5 inches by age 4.  It appears the early stages of life are where the walleye are experiencing their slowest growth as they only reach 7 inches by age 1, and 10 inches by age 2.  The overall condition of the walleye was good indicating a population of fish that is foraging successfully.  Overall, it appears that the walleye population is at a low abundance and may be experiencing some growth problems.  With that said large walleye can be caught in Fox Lake and trophy fish can be caught because the population may be slow growing and long lived. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge catch rate in 2010 was 0.7 fish/gill net and 0.2 fish/trap net which are within and below the gill net and trap net expected catch ranges, respectively.  These catch rates indicate that the population of muskellunge is at an acceptable abundance.  The lengths of the 6 fish caught in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 24 to 34 inches with 5 of the 6 fish in the 22 to 25 inch range.  Gill nets and standard survey trap nets have been shown to be ineffective at sampling larger muskellunge.  Therefore, large frame trap nets are used in the spring months every 2 years to assess the Fox Lake muskellunge population.  In 2009, a large frame trap net survey was conducted for the first time; 95 muskellunge were sampled.  The muskellunge ranged in length from 33 to 48 inches with an average of 41 inches.  A follow-up large frame trap net survey will be conducted in the spring of 2011.  In 2009, 33% of the muskellunge sampled were greater than 42 inches.  The chance producing a very large muskellunge is excellent in Fox Lake creating a unique experience in southern Minnesota.  With two years of growth since 2009, the largest muskellunge in Fox Lake may be exceeding 50 inches.  Trophy fish can be caught in Fox Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie are present in Fox Lake.  The crappie catch rates during 2010 were 10.1 fish/trap net and 7.9 fish/trap net for black crappie and white crappie, respectively.  The black crappie trap net catch was within the expected range and the white crappie trap net catch was higher than the expected range for lake class 24.  From the late 1990s until the mid 2000s Fox Lake experienced high catch rates of crappie that were routinely near or above the high expected range for each species.  While the catch rates were high during this time frame, the average weight per fish never exceeded 0.3 pounds.  Currently, the black and white crappie populations have the highest average weight per fish ever observed at 0.8 and 0.5 pounds, respectively.  The black crappie range in length from 3 to 14 inches and the white crappie range in length from 3 to 12 inches.  Both species have a mean length near 10 inches.  The size structure of the crappies indicated that the populations are both dominated by fish larger than 10 inches.  With a large size and a lower abundance compared to previous surveys, the overall condition of crappie were excellent indicating the crappie populations are foraging successfully.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population has experienced a decline in abundance in Fox Lake since the early 1990s.  In 2010, the catch rate was less than 1 fish/net for both gill nets (0.7 fish/net) and trap nets (0.5 fish/net).  All black bullhead caught were greater than 7 inches and one fish was greater than 12 inches indicating a population that is experiencing poor recruitment as a result of reproduction failure or high predation on young fish.  High predation is more probable based on angler reports of seeing schools of young bullheads near shore.  Black bullhead in Fox Lake may be difficult to catch due to their low abundance, but the average size of fish caught may be very large. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2010 was 44.0 fish/gill net and was greater than the upper expected range for lake class 24.  The 2010 catch rate was the second highest observed since sampling began.  The total lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a mean of 8 inches.  The size structure indicated a population of yellow perch that is dominated by fish in the 8 to 10 inch range.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was good and indicated the fish were foraging successfully.  The yellow perch population appears to be at a high abundance with many large fish greater than 8 inches with no foraging related stress.  Yellow perch fishing in Fox Lake should be good with many fish greater than 8 inches present in the population.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in gill nets and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead.  All species listed above were within or near their expected catch ranges, except for freshwater drum and golden shiner.  Both species had abundances greater than the upper expected catch rates.  The freshwater drum catch rate was 36.3 fish/gill net and the golden shiner catch rate was 2.2 fish/trap net.  Freshwater drum and golden shiner can be critical forage for crappie, muskellunge, yellow perch, and walleye.  Therefore, a high population of freshwater drum and golden shiner indicates an adequate forage base for the primary predators of Fox Lake. Additionally, the overall condition for all of the species listed above range from good to excellent, which indicates a fish community that is in excellent health.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing caught 15 species of fish.  In addition to the species listed above, shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing caught johnny darter, emerald shiner, and green sunfish.  Age 0 fish sampled were black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, white crappie, and yellow perch indicating some natural reproduction success.  Interestingly, the bluegill age 0 catch rate was high at 576 fish per 50 foot seine haul indicating a strong year class of bluegill which may increase the abundance of bluegill in trap nets in Fox Lake in the summer of 2011.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe Fox Lake fish community appears to be healthy and abundance of primary management species is within normal ranges or higher.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \n <br> \nNate Hodgins    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nFox Lake is a 1,041acre lake located in south-central Minnesota near the city of Sherburn in Martin County along the I-90 corridor.   Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet, but most of the lake is 15 feet or less.  Fox Lake has a small surrounding landscape that directly contributes runoff water supply to the lake (also called a watershed).  Watershed improvements have allowed for the return of aquatic vegetation which is good for in lake fish habitat.  Water clarity is improving with the ability to see down nearly 2.5 feet in the middle of the lake in the summer when other area lakes have very dense algae blooms causing water clarity of less than several inches.  A Martin County Soil and Watershed District led program started in 2012 is focused on further improving watershed conditions for Fox Lake as well other Martin County Lakes.  Improvements in the watershed for Fox Lake will continue to show up as improvements in water quality and clarity within the lake that will ultimately lead to healthier conditions for the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black and white crappie.  However, Fox Lake is unique because it is managed for muskellunge and is the southernmost muskellunge lake in the state, which provides a very unique angling opportunity.  In addition, Fox Lake has been surveyed every year since 1991, which has provided an exceptional dataset to detect changes in the fish population that will help the DNR to quickly adjust our management decisions.  Finally, unlike many lakes in southern Minnesota, Fox Lake has never been aerated during the winter and provides a more stable dissolved oxygen profile during winter when compared to other area lakes.  Ultimately, Fox Lake has proven to be a valuable and unique resource in southern Minnesota for local and regional anglers, general recreational users, and for the local economy.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nForty-three walleye were caught in 2012.  The gill net catch rate of 3.5 fish per net was considered normal for Fox Lake while the trap net catch rate of 1.4 fish per net was higher than it has been in the past.  Walleye gill net and trap net catch rates have fluctuated irregularly since the heydays of high catch rates in the early 1990's (1991 to 1994).  The long-term DNR management goal of 6.0 walleye per gill net has not been reached yet so future intensive stocking of walleye frylings will continue.  Frylings are 2 month old fish that are stocked in June at a size of 2 to 3 inches long.  Frylings tend to have higher survival than just hatched walleye fry that are usually stocked in the spring.   While the catch rate is still below the long-term management goal, the size structure of the walleye population is improving.  Last year during the 2011 survey only 4% of the walleye caught were larger than 15 inches.  Contrast that to this year's survey when 49% of the walleye caught were larger than 15 inches.  The walleye in the 2012 sample ranged in length from 11 to 17 inches and the average size was 14.5 inches.  The overall condition of the walleye in the sample was good with a slight decline to fair condition as the fish length increased.  While there was a decline from good to fair condition, it did not appear to negative impact growth of the walleye in Fox Lake.  The walleye in Fox Lake reach nearly 14 inches by age 3 and thus harvestable after only 3 years of growth.  Overall, the walleye population appears to be reaching equilibrium with more large fish in the population.  Continued walleye stocking should help to improve the size structure of the walleye population as it appears to be helping with fryling having been stocked since 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge (nicknamed muskie) have been stocked into Fox Lake starting in 1999 with subsequent stockings in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.  No natural reproduction of muskie has been documented in Fox Lake so all fish present are from stocking.  Muskie in the lake are now ages 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 15.  Muskies over 10 years old have the ability to reach trophy size so potential exists for the Fox Lake muskie population to have trophy individuals present in the lake.  In 2012 only 2 muskie were caught with 1 in the gill nets and 1 in the trap nets. Muskie are not effectively sampled with gill nets and standard trap nets.  Therefore, in 2011 a long-term muskie study was started focusing on obtaining information leading to a population estimate that will help determine the ideal stocking rate for Fox Lake. Large-frame trap nets were used in 2011 and 2012 in the spring to capture muskie.  In 2011, 140 muskie were caught over 2 weeks in May.  The muskie ranged in length from 15 to 49 inches with an average length of 42 inches.  In 2012, 45 muskie were caught over 3 weeks in April and May. The muskie ranged in length from 31 to 49 inches with an average length of 42 inches.  Initial estimates from the long-term study suggest the adult muskie population (fish over 34 inches) has somewhere between 159 to 261 fish with 95% statistical confidence.  This indicates the population is doing well and many large muskies are present in the lake. <br> \n     <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of crappie are present in Fox Lake, Black crappie and White crappie.  The catch rates of black crappie were 20.0 fish per gill net and 10.4 fish per trap net and the catch rates of white crappie were 9.0 fish per gill net and 6.4 fish per trap net.  However, catch rates of crappie are not good indicators of how well the population is doing.  Crappie catch rates tend to vary widely from year to year and even from season to season.  Usually, the population length distribution is more indicative of the overall health of the population.  Black crappie ranged in size from 3 to 14 inches with an average length of 8 inches and 48% of the black crappie were larger than 8 inches.  White crappie ranged in size from 4 to 12 inches with an average size of 9 inches and 68% of the white crappie were larger than 8 inches.  Overall, it is safe to say that the crappie populations have balanced size structures with many larger fish present.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch in Fox Lake are the main forage for the walleye and muskie populations.  The 2012 gill net catch rate was 80.5 fish per net which is the highest on record.  The size of yellow perch in the 2012 sample ranged from 6 to 11 inches with an average of 8 inches.  This range of sizes should be adequate as a forage base.  A large yellow perch population that has many fish across a wide range of lengths will increase the chances of sustaining large walleye and muskellunge populations.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish caught in the 2012 survey were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow bullhead.  Of the species listed above, bluegill, channel catfish, and freshwater drum are the most significant contributors to the fish community. Since 2010 bluegill have become more abundant in Fox Lake, which is coincident with the return of large mats of aquatic vegetation and improved water quality and clarity.  The size structure of the population is fair with fish ranging in length from 4 to 9 inches with an average size of 6 inches.  As the bluegill population becomes further established it should become a larger contributor to the forage base along with yellow perch and become a considerable component of the nearshore fish community in the lake creating a new fishing opportunity for bank anglers.  Channel catfish are doing very well in Fox Lake and currently range in length from 18 to 25 inches with an average weight of 5.5 pounds. The abundant channel catfish population is the suspected reason why the bullhead population is not as prevalent as is has been in the past due to predation and competition for common resources in a similar niche.  Finally, the freshwater drum are the most prevalent rough fish in the population with a gill net catch rate of 42.7 fish per net.  Freshwater drum ranged in length from 6 to 22 inches with an average of 13 inches.  With an abundant muskellunge and growing walleye population, freshwater drum will increasingly become important as forage for larger muskellunge and big walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the Fox Lake fish community appears to be doing well with a diverse fish community that is seeing improvements in managed fish species abundance and size distribution as well as increases in forage species such as yellow perch, bluegill, and even freshwater drum.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will directly result in improvements for the fish community.  Fox Lake appears to be displaying the benefits of an improved watershed health over the past 10 years by way of a great fish community. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",
