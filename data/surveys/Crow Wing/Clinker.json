                "narrative": "<p>Clinker is a small lake (84 ac.) about three miles north of Crosby.  About 51% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Aquatic vegetation is fairly diverse and abundant to a depth of 15 feet.  The shoreline is currently undeveloped, providing adequate quantities of habitat for a variety of fish species.  Because of the low fertility, any significant reduction in aquatic plants could produce noticeable changes in fish populations.Northern pike and largemouth bass are the major game species in the lake.  Their abundance is rather low compared to similar type lakes.  Several ages-sizes of northern pike were present during the 1994 netting and growth rate was good.  Only one bass was sampled.  Bluegills were the commonest panfish found.  Growth was slow but about 25% of the catch was 7.0-8.2 inches in length.  Black crappies, pumpkinseeds and rock bass were found in \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Other species found in 1994 included yellow perch and black bullheads, in low numbers, yellow and brown bullheads, in \"average\" numbers, and bowfin (dogfish), in \"high\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>At roughly 80 acres, Clinker is a small lake and therefore probably can't take the fishing pressure some of the other lakes in the area do.  It does have a nice public access and could be a good place to get away from the crowds.  Being visible from the highway can and does bring extra attention to it; especially in the winter when a few parties are seen fishing on it.  Anglers are encouraged to only keep enough for a meal while releasing most fish for others to enjoy. <br> \n <br> \nThere are a few species that could give a person some fishing action on Clinker.  Northern pike were present in average numbers (4.8/gill net).  Average size was 21.5\", with 33% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Largemouth bass would be another option.  They were sampled by night electrofishing at the rate of 70.7/hr.  Average length was 12.2\" and 55% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Fish up to 17.8\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish results were mixed.  Bluegill numbers were average for this type of lake (12.8/trap net), however, size was lacking.  Average length was 5.4\" and only 9% were 7\" or larger.  No bluegills reached 8\"; it likely takes 9 or more years to grow a bluegill that size.  Black crappie were also caught in average numbers, but size looked better with 86% measuring 8\" or larger.  Crappies measuring 10\" are 5 or more years old in Clinker. <br> \n</p>",
