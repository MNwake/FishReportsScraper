Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  They averaged 19.2 inches (1.5 pounds) and ranged from 10.3 inches to 26.4 inches (3.9 pounds).     Bluegill numbers have been increasing to the point that now there is an average population present.  They averaged 6.7 inches with fish up to 10.5 inches (1.0 pound) sampled.  Approximately 25% of the fish were 8.0 inches or larger.     Yellow perch are very abundant and there are a fair number of keeper size fish in the 9.0 inch to 11.0 inch range present.  The average size of yellow perch was 7.2 inches with a maximum size of 11.1 inches.  West Chub Lake is in the Superior National Forest approximately 14 miles northwest of Isabella, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 12 feet, but most of the lake is less than 6 feet.  The lake is not being stocked and the fish population is maintained through natural reproduction.</p>",

Access to the lake is a long carry along a trail to the southwest shore from a forest road that starts on private property. A survey was completed in July 2022 to monitor the status of the current fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nNetting failed to capture any Northern Pike and the catch rates for several forage species were very high. These results indicate Northern Pike were unable to sustain a population since the previous survey of the lake in 1999. The exact cause of these changes is unknown, but the most likely culprit is beaver activity restricting fish movement between connected waterbodies coupled with low water conditions. <br> \n <br> \nThere are no plans to restock the lake at this time because public access is restricted to users that obtain permission from private landowners. It is possible connectivity between East and West Chub could be restored during high water conditions to supply the lake with a top predator to balance the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Chub Lake is a 120 acre, moderately hard water lake in the Stony River system of the Kawishiwi watershed. The lake is accessible by a channel from East Chub lake, or a 1/4 mile woodland trail to logging roads. The lake is surrounded by forest and marshland, 3/4 of which is in public ownership. The maximum depth of West Chub Lake is 12 feet. The lake has two inlets and an outlet. Shoal water soils are muck, boulders, rubble sand and gravel. \nAt the time of the survey, moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were found to depths of 6 feet. Test netting results indicate that Northern Pike were abundant in the lake. Most of the Northern Pike taken, however; were small in size. Rock Bass and Largemouth Bass were also taken but in lesser numbers. No Walleye were taken, but reliable reports indicate that Walleyes once inhabited the lake. The Yellow Perch catch was high.\nSpawning facilities are rated as \"fair to good\" for Northern Pike, \"fair\" for Walleyes, and \"poor to fair\" for Largemouth Bass and centrarchid panfish.\nMany of the Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were infested with neascus, or \"black spot\" in varying degrees.\nWest Chub Lake appears to get little fishing pressure, but the development of a new public access on East Chub Lake is expected to increase use of both East and West Chub Lakes. West Chub Lake reportedly yielded good Walleye fishing some years ago.\nWaterfowl and muskrats were observed on the lake.</p>",
