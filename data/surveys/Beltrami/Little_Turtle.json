                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is located about 9 miles north of Bemidji off County Road 15.  Big Turtle, Little Turtle, and Movil Lakes are connected by river channels and accessible from the public access on Big Turtle Lake.  The Little Turtle Lake fish community is compared with 107 similar lakes statewide including Boot and Campbell Lakes in the Bemidji area.  Most lakes in this classification are in central Minnesota.  Primary fish management species is walleye with secondary species listed as northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.    Although Little Turtle Lake receives no direct walleye stocking, the population in the entire chain of lakes may be enhanced by fry stocking into Big Turtle and Beltrami Lakes.  Natural reproduction contributes significantly to the population in the chain.  The walleye catch rate in the 1998 assessment was the highest recorded of four assessments since 1971 and higher than that of most comparable lakes.  The population is dominated by a very strong 1996 year class produced from natural reproduction in a year when no fry stocking occurred in the chain.  Those fish were 11-13 inches long in 1998.  All year classes since 1987 were present.  The largest walleye captured was 26 inches long.  Average length of the sample was 14 inches.    Northern pike catch rate was higher than that in comparable lakes and well above any prior assessment.  The average size was 19.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  This is comparable to similar lakes and would be acceptable to many anglers.  The largest pike sampled was about 31 inches long.    Panfish species were generally low in abundance, but they are present.  Black crappie catch was low but most were 10-11.5 inches providing a quality size.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled, but they are not common.  Rock bass are the most abundant panfish, but they have decreased in abundance over the survey history.  Yellow perch are abundant but small.  With only four percent greater than eight inches long, few are acceptable to anglers.    Tullibee and white suckers, though not often caught by anglers, are present and are a valuable forage source for the northern pike and walleye populations.  Tullibee netting is authorized, but the extent of harvest is unknown.    Some other fish present but not generally sought after by anglers include bowfin (dogfish), burbot (eelpout), brown and black bullheads.    A high proportion of the perch, northern pike and walleye examined had Neascus (black spot), a parasite that is unsightly but not harmful to humans.  This parasite is common in many area lakes and especially prevalent in smaller lakes with abundant vegetation.  Yellow grub, another parasite of fish, was found on a few perch.    Aquatic vegetation is a valuable asset to a lake like Little Turtle providing nursery areas for fish and wildlife.  Rooted vegetation also improves water clarity by tying up nutrients that would otherwise produce algae blooms.  Emergent vegetation in the form of bulrush, lilypads, and wild rice are important buffers against wave action helping to reduce shoreline erosion.  Permits are required and can be issued to remove emergent vegetation in limited areas where plants are seriously interfering with recreational use or reasonable access to open water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is a 464-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located ten miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Little Turtle is part of a chain of eleven lakes known as the Turtle River chain, and is connected to Big Turtle and Movil Lakes downstream.   Public access on Little Turtle consists of a carry-in location on an Aquatic Management Area (walking access only) off of CSAH 15 at the outlet of the lake.  Most people access Little Turtle Lake via the river channel from Big Turtle Lake, which has a single lane concrete boat ramp and parking for 10 trucks/trailers located on the west shore of the lake.  The fish community of Little Turtle Lake consists of panfish (including black crappie), walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch, sucker/redhorse and bullhead species.  Little Turtle, like many other lakes in the Turtle River chain, is managed with a special regulation for northern pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot limit, implemented in 2003).  The regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and reduce the abundance of small fish in the population.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Turtle Lake has been drawing attention from panfish anglers for some time.  Historic population assessments have consistently documented good average size of bluegill and a quality population size structure.  The 2011 catch rate of 4.2/trap net was below the first quartile for lake class but within the range of historic assessments.  A good proportion of the bluegill catch was greater than 8 inches in length.  Little Turtle Lake is fertile, and produces good growth rates for bluegill, with fish reaching 8 inches in length at age-6.  Little Turtle has also been a consistent producer of black crappie over the years.  Catch rates for black crappie in 2011 were high for both gill nets (5.8/GN) and trap nets (8.2/TN).  A total of four year classes of black crappie were identified in the sample.  The 2010 year class (age-1) was particularly abundant.  These fish will provide good angling opportunity within the next few years.  Age and growth analysis showed that black crappie reach 9 inches in length at age-4, and grow to over 11 inches by age-5.  Fish over 12 inches in length were present in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in population assessments have been consistently above 4.0/GN, which approaches the upper quartile value for class 34 lakes.  Walleye up to 23 inches in length were captured in 2011.  Walleye are not stocked in Little Turtle Lake, but the lake benefits from its close connection to Big Turtle Lake, which is stocked with walleye fry on alternate, odd years (2009, 2011).  The 2009 year class (age-2) was particularly abundant in the 2011 assessment of Little Turtle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at 10.3/GN in 2011, which was a good sign after the extremely high catch rate of 22.7/GN in 2007, although the size structure of the population continues to be dominated by smaller fish.  Average size of northern pike was 20.2 inches and 1.7 pounds/fish.  Northern pike up to 33 inches in length were present in the 2011 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake (D.O.W. # 04-0155-00) is a 468-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 10 miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Little Turtle is part of a connected chain of lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  Little Turtle Lake is accessed from Big Turtle Lake, which is connected by a navigable channel.  The DNR public water access is located on the west shore of Big Turtle Lake off of County Road 15.  Little Turtle is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  There is a special regulation in effect for Northern Pike.  All pike from 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released.  The possession limit is 3, with only one greater than 36 inches allowed in possession. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity) and location within the state.  Lake Class can affect the type of fish community present in the lake.  Little Turtle Lake is in lake class 34.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Little Turtle Lake and other class 34 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Campbell Lake and Boot Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 3.44/gill net.  Walleye captured had an average size of 15.83 inches in length and 1.33 lbs/fish. Walleye presence in Little Turtle is likely due to a combination of stocking in connected waters and natural reproduction throughout the chain.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 8.11/gill net.  While this is higher than desired, pike numbers have been declining the in the last two assessments.  Pike had an average size of 20.33 inches in length and 1.76 lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2016 assessment measured 33.78 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured, measured and released using electrofishing in mid-June to evaluate the population in Little Turtle Lake.  In just over two hours of effort, 16 bass were captured with lengths from 12.6 to 19.5 inches and averaged 15.4 inches.  Though few fish in total were captured, they were of quality sizes and definitely worth pursuing.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in Big Turtle in 2016, but so far have not been documented in Little Turtle. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was 1.56/trap net.  The average size of 11.0 inches and 0.87 lbs/fish was above the normal range found in similar lakes (0.22 lbs/fish - 0.48 lbs/fish).   <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was 8.22/trap net.  Bluegill had a good average size (7.27 inches in length and 0.40 lbs/fish) with good numbers of fish exceeding 8 inches in length.  <br> \n  <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Bowfin, Yellow Perch, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Bullhead species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is a 469-acre lake, located 10 miles north of Bemidji, MN. A targeted survey was completed on Little Turtle Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2021 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of seven sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A total of 17 species of fish were sampled, which included six species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Sunfish, and Pugnose Shiner) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2021 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Little Turtle Lake. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Little Turtle Lake is in great health with a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute towards the assessment of the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed with biological information about the health of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle is a 469-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 10 miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Little Turtle is part of a connected chain of lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  Little Turtle is accessed by boat via the Turtle River from Big Turtle Lake which lies just downstream.  Access is limited to smaller boats due to shallow water and a box culvert at the County Road 15 crossing on the Turtle River.  An Aquatic Management Area (AMA) located on the east shore of the lake offers additional carry-in and limited winter access.  Special regulations are in effect for Sunfish (daily limit of 5 fish) and Northern Pike. Anglers should check regulations for northern pike as its special regulation was under review in 2022. Statewide regulations apply to all other species <br> \n <br> \nThe Turtle River chain of lakes is known for good panfishing opportunities and Little Turtle Lake is no exception.  The 2021 survey documented healthy populations of Bluegill and Black Crappie with good average sizes.  The shallow, productive lake basin produces fast growth rates for these species and provides excellent habitat.   <br> \nAlthough Little Turtle Lake is not known as a Walleye destination in the area, the number captured in surveys is usually above average in comparison to similar lakes.  The lake's connection to the Turtle River benefits migratory species such as Walleye, which are found in good numbers in many lakes in the Turtle River chain.  Walleye anglers may want to give Little Turtle Lake a pass in favor of Big Turtle and Movil Lakes which are closely connected and contain better Walleye habitat and larger populations of the species.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have always been abundant in Little Turtle Lake and can provide some good fishing action on days when other species may not want to cooperate.  Northern Pike up to 32 inches in length were captured in this survey.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present but have never been captured in large numbers in surveys of Little Turtle Lake.  Bass up to 17 inches were captured in this survey, with a good average size of nearly 13 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2021 survey were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is a 464-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located seven miles north of Bemidji.  Access to the lake is gained by following the Turtle River upstream from Big Turtle Lake.  Public access to Big Turtle Lake is located on the west side of the lake off county road 15.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Turtle Lake is in lake class 34.  The only other lakes in the Bemidji area in this lake class are Boot and Campbell Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are shallow, turbid and have regular shaped shorelines.  DNR Fisheries management focuses mainly on walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.Little Turtle Lake is one of several connected lakes on the Turtle River chain.  A 24\"-36\" protected slot for northern pike was implemented in 2003 on opening day of the fishing season for a number of lakes in this chain including Little Turtle Lake.  This means that anglers need to release all northern pike between 24 and 36 inches.  Only one northern pike more than 36 inches can be kept.  The goal is to improve the size of northern pike.Northern pike are abundant in Little Turtle Lake but are small.  In this assessment only 14% of the pike were greater than 22 inches long.  Ninety-seven percent of the pike sampled were ages 2-4.  A population dominated by very young fish may be an indication of excessive harvest.  Hopefully with the special regulation, pike will have a chance to live longer and grow larger.Walleye abundance is typical of other lake class 34 lakes.  The walleye population is maintained by natural reproduction or movement between connected waters of the Turtle River chain.  No walleye are stocked directly into Little Turtle Lake, but Big Turtle Lake is stocked in alternate years.  It is uncertain how much movement occurs.  Population densities tend to be similar between Big Turtle and directly connected waters.  It would be helpful to mark walleye stocked into Big Turtle Lake to help determine contribution from stocking compared to natural reproduction throughout the chain of lakes.  Forty-six percent of the walleye sampled in Little Turtle were greater than 15 inches providing some quality fishing.  Ten different year classes were identified suggesting that significant natural reproduction may be occurring.  The 2001 year class, making up 43% of the aged sample coincides with a year of stocking on Big Turtle Lake.Yellow perch is the main food fish for both northern pike and walleye.  The 2003 catch rate was down from 1998 findings but still comparable to past assessments and to other class 34 lakes.  No perch were over nine inches in length, the size generally thought to be desirable for anglers.  Other food fish that can be utilized by predators would be white sucker and tullibee.The bluegill catch in the 2003 assessment was the highest recorded of any survey conducted on Little Turtle Lake.  The diverse size structure, ranging from 3.5 - 9.4 inches, indicates some consistent reproductive success.  Sixty-eight percent of the bluegill sampled were greater than eight inches in length which should provide some excellent fishing.  Bluegill growth is exceptional.  At five years old, bluegill were eight inches long.A total of 28 black crappie were sampled and all were from a single year class hatched in 2002.  Black crappie tend to be more cyclic in their reproductive success.  This leads to some fluctuation in fishing success, as individual dominant year classes cycle through.  This particular year class which average five inches is still a couple of years away from providing an improved crappie fishery.Only four largemouth bass were sampled.  Standard assessment netting does not adequately sample bass populations.  Specialized sampling directed at bass needs to be employed in order to obtain a more representative sample of this important species.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and hybrid sunfish were other members of the sunfish family sampled.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Turtle Lake is a 464-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located in southern Beltrami County.  It is one of several lakes on the Turtle River chain of lakes.  There is no public access on Little Turtle Lake, however, boaters can access the lake by river channel from Big Turtle Lake.  The public access on Big Turtle Lake is on the west side of the lake off of county road 15.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Turtle Lake is in lake class 34. With the exception of carp and black bullhead, all species of fish typically found in a lake class 34 fish community are found in Little Turtle Lake.  However due to connectivity with other basins Little Turtle functions somewhat differently than typical class 34 lakes.  No stocking of any species occurs in Little Turtle Lake but walleye abundance tends to exceed the normal range for this lake class. Natural reproduction may be a contributing factor with some quality spawning substrate in the Turtle River.  Migration of stocked walleye from connected basins my also be contributing.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Turtle is included in a special northern pike regulation consistent for all lakes on the Turtle River chain. The regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike from 24-36 inches, with only one over 36 inches allowed.  This regulation, implemented in 2003, is intended to improve the quality of pike population and help maintain a more balanced predator population.  A long-term objective of the protected size regulation is to eventually shift the population from a high-density small pike population to a lower density population of larger pike.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the fifth year of this special pike regulation abundance has more than doubled since the previous assessment in 2003.  This appears to be in direct contrast to the regulation objectives.  However, the increase in abundance has little to do with the regulation since the majority (90%) of the pike sampled are under the protected size range.  When the regulation was implemented few fish were large enough to benefit from the protected size. It will take a number of years of young fish growing into the protected range to retain some of the quality that has been lost.  Only when significant improvement can be gained in 24-36 inch fish can we expect some suppression of smaller fish.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Turtle is probably better known as a panfish lake with good populations of crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish. Bluegill abundance continues to improve and quality is excellent with almost 80% of bluegill sampled greater than eight inches in length.  In order to maintain this quality, anglers are encouraged to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This will help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shoreline and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.
