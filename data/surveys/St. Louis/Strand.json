STOCKING AND CATCH RATE RECORDS NEITHER PROVE OR DISPROVE THE CONTRIBUTION OF STOCKING. THE 1972 CATCH RATE MAY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY 1968, 1969, AND 1970 FINGERLING PLANTS. HOWEVER, THE HIGHER 1977 CATCH RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY TWO FRY PLANTS BETWEEN 1970 AND 1977 SUGGESTING THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR MIGRATING FISH CAN ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. FINALLY, THE 1957 AND 1989 AGE ANALYSES SHOW GOOD YEAR CLASSES, STOCKED OR NOT. YELLOW PERCH HAVE A 8.5 PER GILLNET CATCH RATE. PERCH AND WALLEYE CATCH RATES HAVE MOVED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS IN THE 1957, 1972, 1977, 1982, AND 1989 ASSESSMENTS, ALTHOUGH THE DEGREE HAS DAMPENED SINCE 1977. NORTHERN PIKE CATCH RATE IS 2.0 PER GILLNET LIFT AND HAS REMAINED STABLE SINCE 1957. WHTIE SUCKER ARE LOW AND STABLE. PANFISH WERE LOW OR DECLINING IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS, BUT CATCH RATES HAVE INCREASED IN 1989. PUMPKIN- SEED AND CRAPPIE EXCEED OR EQUAL LOCAL AND STATE- WIDE MEDIANS.

Fish were not included in sample.Walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker were collected over the course of this survey for contaminent analysis.Island Reservoir, specifically the east basin near the Cloquet River inlet, was electrofished in the spring of 1994 by the Fond du Lac Ceded Territory Department.     \"Along with the rights to utilize a resource comes the responsibility to manage and monitor the resource.  Bands are taking an increased responsibility to monitor fish populations and to develop long term data bases to set harvest quotas and to monitor the effects of tribal harvest.\" 1The Minnesota Power Fishing League has taken part of the volunteer angler survey utilizing the diary format.  Several angling trips were taken to Island Lake Reservoir in 1994.  Walleyes were caught at a rate of 1.51 fish per hour with a mean length of 11.0 inches, ranging from 6 to 24 inches.  Northern pike were caught at a rate of 0.008 fish per hour with an average length of 17.7 inches.  Black crappie were caught at a rate of 0.29 fish per hour with a mean length of 12.0 inches and a range of 9 to 14 inches.  Yellow perch and smallmouth bass catch and length data were also obtained.  Catch rates have remained stable in 1993 and 1994.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Strand Lake during the summer of 2015 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the walleye stocking program.  Walleye is the primary management species for Strand Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked every other year into Strand Lake.  Walleye abundance of 8.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Walleye average length was small at 12.1 inches and average weight was 0.7 pounds.  Seventy-three percent of Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye for the next several years as both the 2012 and 2014 year-classes were well represented.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not abundant, all panfish populations have very good size structure in Strand Lake.  Black Crappie abundance of 3.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes. Average length was 9.7 inches with fish up to 11.8 inches sampled.  Bluegill abundance was average at 2.9 per trapnet lift.  Average length was large at 7.7 inches with 65% exceeding 8 inches and Bluegill up to 10.0 inches sampled.  Yellow Perch abundance of 13.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was large at 8.3 inches and 18% exceeded 10 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to release exceptionally large panfish to preserve this unique opportunity.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used to determine if an emerging Largemouth Bass population was evident.  No prior electrofishing surveys have been conducted on Strand Lake.  One Largemouth Bass measuring 14.3 inches was captured for a catch rate of 0.8 per hour of electrofishing, which was below average compared to other Duluth Area Largemouth Bass populations.   <br> \n</p>",

There is a township administered, gravel back-in access located on the north side of the lake off County Road 973.   <br> \n <br> \nStrand has a history of producing large Bluegill and Black Crappie and new angling regulations to improve and protect these species are under consideration.  The proposed regulation is a daily limit of 5 sunfish, possession limit of 20 and a daily limit of 5 Black Crappie, possession limit 10.  The objective of this targeted survey was to obtain baseline information to describe Bluegill and Black Crappie size structure, age structure and growth prior to implementation of the reduced bag limit angling regulation change.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill spring trapnet abundance was 13.7 per lift.  Average length of Bluegill was 8.6 inches and maximum size was 10.6 inches.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 96%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 83%.  The proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 10 inches) was 3%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2010 to 2019 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trapnet abundance was 10.1 per lift.  Average length of Black Crappie was 10.3 inches and maximum size was 12.1 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 97%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 68%.

The percentage of \"keeper\" sized fish is currently down from previous years but a strong 1997 year class may be keeping these numbers down.  Northern pike are not real abundant and most are of the \"hammerhandle\" variety.  Yellow perch numbers a up from recent investigations with good numbers of fish over 9 inches.  Black crappies are not abundant but all fish sampled in the 1999 assessment were over 8 inches and growth rates are the fastest in the Duluth area. </p>",

There is a township administered, gravel back-in access located on the north side of the lake off County Road 973.  Strand was surveyed during the summer of 2007 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, walleye fry are stocked into Strand at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre (660,000) in even years.  Walleye abundance of 10.0 was up slightly from 1999 (9.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 13.2 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Twenty-six percent of the walleyes sampled were over 18 inches in length.  Two year-classes were not represented (2000 and 2004) from 1999 through 2006 with the bulk of the catch coming from the 2005 year-class (41%).  Twenty-eight percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was up from 1999 (1.0) but was still below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 19.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only 25 percent of the sample was over 20 inches in length.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2005 were represented in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was impressive at 11.0 inches, and growth was very fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Seventy-three percent of the fish sampled were over 11 inches in length, fish to 12.6 inches sampled.  However, just two year-classes were present (2003 and 2005) with the bulk of the catch coming from the 2003 year-class (73%).   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.2 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Ninety-four percent of the fish captured were less than 7 inches.  Three-year classes (2002, 2005 and 2006) were represented. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 8.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was good at 8.6 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fifteen percent of the perch sampled were over 10 inches in length, with fish up to 12 inches sampled.  All year-classes from 2000 through 2005 were represented with strong 2003 and 2005 year-classes (43% each).     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 4 largemouth bass were sampled for the first time in 2007 on Strand Lake.  Two bass were young-of-the-year and two were age 1.  This follows an emerging pattern in Duluth Area lakes of largemouth bass showing up in lakes where they have not been documented before.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, brown bullheads and white suckers.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was good with 31 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  The horsetail group was the most frequently found plant (80% of locations) followed by floating-leaf burreed and spikerush (70% of locations).  Rare species include cane, manna grass, reed canary grass (an invasive species), and wild rice, which were identified at 5% of the sampling stations.  The most common substrate types were sand and detritus, which were identified along 85% and 60% of the sampling locations, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Strand is a nearly neutral, moderately hard water lake with low fertility.     <br> \n</p>",
