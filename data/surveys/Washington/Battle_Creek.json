                "narrative": "<p>Battle Creek (Mud) Lake is a 103-acre, class 43 FiN lake located at the western edge of Woodbury just south of Interstate 94.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye and yellow perch.  The city of Woodbury operates a winter aeration system, a park (Menomini) that provides a fishing pier, and a park (Shawnee) that provides a boat access.  Both park facilities offer paved trails, picnic tables, play structures, and off-road parking.  For more information on amenities offered by Woodbury parks go to:  http://www.ci.woodbury.mn.us/parks/parkinfo.html.         <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye were sampled in varying numbers.  Although walleye have not been stocked in Battle Creek Lake, two age-5 walleyes, averaging 18.6 inches and 2.1 lbs, were sampled.  Apparently migration from Tanners Lake is occurring on a limited basis.  Walleyes have not been sampled in any of the previous surveys.  Consistent with past sureveys, pike abundance (20.0/gill net) was high.    Pike caught in gill net averaged 25.5 inches (range: 20.3 to 33.9 inches) and 4.0 lb, with 65% of the population exceeding 25 inches.  Five largemouth bass averaging 11.2 inches and 1.2 lbs were also sampled.  Inferences regarding bass population should not be made based on trap net catches.  In order to properly sample the largemouth bass population, spring daytime electrofishing needs to be administered.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were in present in varying numbers.  Bluegill numbers (15.42/trap net) were up from the 2004 survey (0.9/trap net).  Seventy-seven trap netted bluegills averaged 6.3 inches with 58% exceeding 6.0 inches.  The 2009 survey revealed trap net catches above 15.0/trap net for the first time since 1983.  Consistent with past surveys, black crappie numbers were relatively low.  Sampled crappies ranged between 4.9 and 8.0 inches.  Two yellow perch were sampled in lone gill net in 2009 and no perch were sampled in 2004 assessment.  Historical catches have ranged from 0 to 48 perch/gill net.  No perch sampled in 2009 exceeded 8.0 inches.  Hybrid sunfish (N=2) and pumpkinseeds (N=14) were sampled in relatively low numbers in both gill and trap nets.  No sampled pumpkinseeds or hybrid sunfish exceeded six inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers (2.0/ gill net) were considerably lower than the gill net catches from the previous four surveys, where catches ranged from 65-170 per gill net.  On the contrary, yellow bullheads were sampled in high numbers (9.0/gill net).  Four golden shiners were also sampled in lone gill net.  In addition, fourteen yellow bullheads, five common carp, and one brown bullhead were sampled in trap nets.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Battle Creek (Mud) Lake is a 103-acre, class 43 FiN lake located at the western edge of Woodbury just south of Interstate 94.  The sport fish community consists of Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish. The City of Woodbury operates a winter aeration system, a park (Menomini) that provides a fishing pier, and a park (Shawnee) that provides a boat access.  Both park facilities offer paved trails, picnic tables, play structures, and off-road parking. For more information on amenities offered by Woodbury parks go to: http://www.ci.woodbury.mn.us/parks/parkinfo.html.   <br> \n       <br> \nConsistent with past surveys Northern Pike were sampled in above average numbers (9.0/gill net) but were below average in size. Pike caught in the gill net averaged 17.5 inches and 1.42 lb, with only one Northern Pike exceeding 25 inches. Panfish are present in low to average numbers. Bluegill numbers were down considerably from previous surveys with only one fish being observed.  Pumpkinseed Sunfish are found in average abundance and size for lakes like Battle Creek. Hybrid Sunfish are present in low to average numbers.  No sampled Pumpkinseeds or Hybrid Sunfish exceeded six inches.  The overall low to average abundance of the various fish species found in Battle Creek Lake is likely due to the last two severe winters with some winter kill occurring in spite of the lake being aerated. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

One largemouth bass weighing one pound was seen (none were seen during the electrofishing).  Reproduction checks showed high numbers of perch and black bullheads, and fewer numbers of bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and black crappies.</p>",
