                "narrative": "<p>Catch indices for Northern Pike, Yellow Bullheads. Pumpkinseeds and Bluegill are above the third regional quartile. Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Walleye are within the median regional range in abundance. The catch indices for white sucker. Brown Bullhead and Yellow Perch are below the first regional quartile. The catch indices for Northern Pike, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed and Bluegill are above the third area quartile. Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Walleye indices are within the median area range. White Sucker index is below the first area quartile. Northern Pike ranged from one to eight years old. Age two age three and age four dominated the age groups sampled. Growth increments ranged from normal growth rate as seen in the third increment to growth being forty-two percent slower than normal as seen in the sixth growth increment. The growth increments for ages two through four and age seven ranged from twenty-three to thirty-two percent slower than normal. This reduced rate of growth combines to give an overall reduction of length at annulus formation of sixteen percent through age seven. Pumpkinseeds ranged in age from three to eight years old. Twenty-eight percent of the sample aged were age six fish. Ages four and five each made up fourteen percent of the sample. Ages seven and eight each made up twenty percent of the sample. Growth increments from age two through age seven show a constant growth rate of 0.8 in. Per year. This growth rate for ages five, six and seven is normal, but for ages two, three and four it is thirty-nine percent slower than normal. Bluegill ranged in age from four to seven years old. Forty-eight percent were age five and thirty five percent were age six. Growth the first year was normal. Growth for years two through four was forty-five percent slower than normal. Growth is better for ages five through seven, although only 0.8 inches per year, which is normal for bluegills in Minnesota. Largemouth Bass ranged from three to eight years old. Fifty percent were age four, with no fish sampled in ages six and seven. Growth increments for each year are within the normal growth range for Largemouth Bass in Minnesota. Black Crappie were found to be all age two and three fish, with sixty-nine percent being age three. Growth the second increment is slow but the overall growth rate is normal for the fish observed. Yellow Perch ranged from four to six years of age. Year classes represented were uniformly abundant. Growth was normal for fish found in Minnesota. Walleye ranged from four to seven years old. Fifty percent were age four and forty percent were age seven. Six Walleye, not aged, ranging in length from 6.5 to 8.4 inches were probably 1985 year class fish. These three strong year classes show a very positive correlation with past Walleye stocking of Round Lake. Growth rates for the Walleye were normal for all ages. The Northern Pike population since 1975 has not increased significantly. The range of lengths seen in 1975 and 1986 samplings were the same, 9.5 to 27.9 with 96.6 percent less than 22.9 inches in 1975 and 9.5 to 26.9 with 96.8 percent less than 22.9 inches in 1986. The average length of Northern Pike seen has increased from 15.7 in 1975 to 16.6 in 1986. This increase in mean length may be a result of older fish in the 1986 sample. In 1975 22.7 percent of the Northern Pike aged were older than three years. In the 1986 sample 40.3 percent were older than three years. In 1975 the average lengths at annulus formation were 8.3, 13.2, 16.9 and 20.0 inches for annuli one through four respectively. In 1986 the average length at annulus formation were 6.9, 10.9, 14.9 and 17.8 inches for annuli 1 through four. This is an average decrease in length at annulus formation of fourteen percent the strong 1981 and 1982 year classes documented in the 1986 sampling when coupled with the strong 1983 and 1984 year classes appear to have reduced the growth rates for Northern Pike but at the same time increase the average length of the sample. Pumpkinseeds increased significantly in abundance from 5.0 per trap net in 1975 to 25.5 per trap net in 1986. The range of lengths did not change, 3.0 to 7.9 in 1975 and 3.0 to 8.4 in 1986. The mean length increased from 4.6 in 1975 to 5.8 in 1986. This increase in mean length was a result of a loss of fish less than 5.0 in the 1986 sample. In 1975 seventy-five percent of the \nPumpkinseeds were less than 4.9 inches long. In 1986 only seventeen percent of the fish were less than 4.9 inches. As was noted in additional field notes there were many small Pumpkinseeds seen dead along the shore of the lake. Bluegill increased in abundance from 16.6 per trap net in 1975 to 38.8 in 1986. The range of lengths seen in the samples and the mean lengths have not changed since the 1975 sample. Yellow Perch have not shown any change in abundance since 1975 but have shown a change in length frequency. The shift toward larger fish would indicate that the population is made up primarily of older fish with poor recruitment of young fish. The sample is too small to draw any definite conclusions. The Walleye abundance has not changed since 1975. The fact that ninety percent of the Walleye aged were from year classes correlated to stocking would indicate that there is very poor spawning success and that the fingerling stocking program is at the present time successful.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a soft water lake located in east central Aitkin County that is noted for its clear water and sandy beaches.  Round lake is also known for its abundant bluegill and northern pike populations.The northern pike population has been stable since 1997 both in number and size of the fish sampled.  The average length of a northern pike sampled in gill nets was 17 inches long with less than 10 percent of the fish sampled greater than 20 inches in length.  While there was not a great deal of shoreline spawning habitat for northern pike found in Round Lake the length frequency information indicates that they are successfully recruiting year classes almost annually. Panfish populations decreased in abundance since 1997.  The three most common species, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and the hybrid sunfishes have all decreased in abundance since 1997.  With this decrease in abundance the mean length of fish sampled in trap nets increased from that seen in 1997.Largemouth bass were sampled during both the normal survey and by night electro-fishing.  The lack of large numbers of largemouth bass being sampled during the electro-fishing is probably a direct result of the lack of abundant shoal water habitat that is needed to hold largemouth bass.  It should be noted, that while not captured, the electro-fishing crew did observe a muskellunge, the first documented sighting by a fisheries employee.  Shoepack strain muskellunge were stocked into Round Lake in 1978 and 1979.Walleye abundance was similar to that observed in 1997.  As in 1997 almost all of the walleye sampled came from year classes correlated with stocking events.  Growth rates for the walleye sampled were good indicating that forage was not a limiting factor at present abundance levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake has clean, sandy beaches, clear and infertile water and few shallow water plants, conditions that are often sought by shoreland owners. These conditions may have resulted in poor population structure for several sportfishes, including northern pike and sunfishes. Natural reproduction for pike and sunfishes is high and survival of young fishes is good, resulting in too many fish for the amount of prey available.     This survey collected above-average numbers of northern pike but they are below average in size. Northern averaged only 16.9 inches in the gill nets, and only ten percent of the northerns were 21 inches or larger. Most of the fish grew slowly due to low prey availability; only two yellow perch and two white suckers were caught in gill nets or trap nets. Spawning habitat appears to be limited within the lake and yet northern pike recruitment is consistent and substantial. Northerns may be spawning on submerged vegetation within the lake, in emergent plants on the southwest shore, or beyond the outlet in a shallow marsh area.     Bluegills and pumpkinseeds were also more abundant than normal and smaller than average for this lake type. The average length for sunfish was less than 5.7 inches and the largest sunfish was only 7.4 inches long.     Largemouth bass were caught at acceptable rates in this survey and averaged about 13 inches long. Recruitment is somewhat sporadic yet consistent enough to produce several year classes and yield a broad size range of bass. Growth is slower than would be expected given the high abundance of small sunfish. Intense predation of smaller, more suitable prey may be reducing bass prey and restricting bass growth.    Walleye abundance, while normal for this lake type, is lower than is expected given the regular stocking effort directed at the lake. Walleyes averaged 3 pound each, however a wide range of sizes were observed. Almost all of the walleyes came from year classes which were supplemented with stocked fish. Low numbers of smaller walleyes, despite regular stocking, may produce less fishing success in a couple of years as older fish are removed. Intense northern pike predation may be drastically reducing walleye survival, despite the stocking of larger fingerling walleyes.    For anglers willing to try an alternate species, the yellow bullhead population is doing well. Yellow bullheads were caught at above-normal rates in the gill nets and 22 percent were 10 inches or longer. However, about 40 percent of the yellow bulheads had a parasite, yellow grub, which will not infect humans when properly cooked yet discourages consumption by some anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is located about 5 miles northwest of Tamarack in Aitkin County.  It is popular with recreational users because of its clear water and abundant sandy beaches.  There is a public access with a concrete log ramp and swimming area on the north shore.  The lake has a reputation for abundant northern pike and bluegill populations with poor size structure and the 2012 fisheries survey supports this perception. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at the highest rate to date, 20.0 per gill net.  This was not unusual for this lake as pike catches have been above the normal range for similar lakes in each survey since 1986.  Average size followed the historic trend with an average size in gill nets of just 16.5 inches and 0.9 pounds and only 1% of fish greater than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has maintained a relatively stable abundance since 2002.  Size has improved since the previous survey to an average of 6.4 inches in trap nets with a few individuals over eight inches long sampled.  Hybrid sunfish also provide opportunities for anglers to catch preferred sized sunfish with an average size of 7.2 inches in trap nets and 11% greater than eight inches long.  Black crappie, which have generally not been captured in particularly high numbers in survey nets, may also be of interest to anglers looking for a meal of panfish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were first stocked into the lake in 1952 and have been stocked regularly since about 1982, at various rates and frequencies.  Walleye abundance (1.2 per gill net) was similar to previous assessments and within the normal range for similar lakes.  Age analysis revealed all fish were from stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted in June 2012, to assess the largemouth bass population.  Sampling for 30 minutes resulted in 37 fish collected, size ranged from 7.8 to 16.3\" with an average of 12.1\" and 1.0 pound.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is located about 5 miles northwest of Tamarack in Aitkin County. It is popular with recreational users because of its clear water and abundant sandy beaches. There is a public access with a concrete log ramp and swimming area on the north shore and a Wildlife Management Area along much of the south shore. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were first stocked into the lake in 1952, and have been stocked regularly since about 1982, at various rates and frequencies. Walleye abundance (2.1/gill net) was similar to previous assessments, but remains below the normal range for similar lakes, and below the management goal of 3/gill net. The mean length was 16.4 inches, meeting the size goal for the lake. There were 6 age classes represented, which also meets the goal in the management plan. When available, larger sized fingerlings, yearlings, or adults are desirable to be stocked in Round Lake to help reduce predation from abundant and small Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a reputation for abundant Northern Pike with poor size structure and the 2022 fisheries survey again supports this perception. Northern Pike abundance has dropped some from an average of over 19/per gill net seen between 1997 and 2012. The last two surveys have been a bit lower at 12.6/gill net in 2017 and 14.8/gill net in 2022. As is typical for this lake, size structure remained poor with an average length of just 16 inches and an average weight of 0.9 pounds. No fish were larger than 26 inches and only 2 of 133 fell within the 22-26 inch protected slot, which did not meet the management objective for the lake. This scenario has played out in previous surveys and 2022 was no different, suggesting that the long-term goal listed in the plan to reduce the catch of Northern Pike to 6/gill net with 25% greater than 24\" may not be attainable. The new zone regulations do offer more promise for changing the Northern Pike size structure, but it may be many years to see those effects. <br> \n <br> \nStandard trap nets captured Bluegill at a rate of 15.5/net and is within the expected range for similar lakes, but below the long-term average for the lake of about 30/net. Sizes ranged from 5.0 to 9.1 inches with an average of 6.7 inches. The size structure has shown improvements in the previous two surveys. In addition to true Bluegills, Hybrid Sunfish are also available to anglers and offer a decent size distribution, with fish nearing 9 inches observed in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie also provide anglers with opportunities to harvest panfish. Crappie are not overly abundant and net catches were nearly identical to the previous survey. The size structure was respectable with a mean length of 7.7 inches and a maximum length of just over 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch showed up again in the gill net catch for the second survey in a row after being absent or nearly so for 20 years. They were caught at a rate of 2.2/gill net. Improvements to Yellow Perch populations are important for managing Northern Pike and Walleye, as well as panfish. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was conducted to assess the Largemouth Bass population. The catch rate of 140/hr is higher than previous surveys and considered a high catch rate for a lake in this area. This is consistent with a general trend of increasing abundance in the standard gill nets and trap nets.  Sizes in the electrofishing sample ranged from 5.4 to 15.6 inches with an average of 11.6 inches. One fish over 16 inches was also observed in the trap net sample. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Round Lake was conducted on July 7, 2022 by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing and seine hauls were completed at all fourteen sampling stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and none that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Round Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The gill net indices for white sucker and yep were below their respective lake class 29 first quartiles.  The trap net indices for yellow bullhead and black crappie were above their respective lake class 29 third quartiles.  Northern pike (59 of 156 aged) ranged from one to eight years of age with a strong yea class indicated for 1988.  Growth rates for the first, fourth, fifth and sixth annual increments were slower than normal.  Bluegill (33 of 121 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with most of the fish sampled eight years of age or older. Growth rates for the first through the fifth annual increments were slower than normal.  Largemouth bass (27 of 27 aged) ranged from four to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  The growth rate for the third annual increment was faster than normal.  Total length at annulus formation after the third annual increment was normal.  Black crappie (37 of 83 aged) ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year class in 1988 and no fish sampled from 1985.  Growth rates for the first and second annual increments were slow.  Yep (2 of 2 aged) were five and seven years of age.  Walleye (28 of 30 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes in 1985 and 1986.  The 1985, 1986 and 1989 year classes observed correspond to years in which walleye stocked.  Growth rates were normal.  Walleye gillnet catches increased from 1.1 per net in 1986 to 2.4 per net in 1991 (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p=0.1562, n=6).  Pumpkinseed trap net catches decreased from 25.5 fish per net in 1986 to 7.8 fish per net in 1991 (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p=0.0538, n=12).  Hybrid sunfish had not been separated from pumpkinseed in 1991, the pumpkinseed trap net catch would still have been lower in 1991 than in 1986 (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p=0.118, n=12).  Black crappie trap net catches increased from 1.3 fish per net in 1986 to 7.3 fish per net in 1991 (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p=0.042, n=12).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is located about 5 miles northwest of Tamarack in Aitkin County. It is popular with recreational users because of its clear water and abundant sandy beaches. There is a public access with a concrete log ramp and swimming area on the north shore. The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike with largemouth bass and bluegill as secondary species.  Walleye were first stocked into the lake in 1952, and have been stocked regularly since about 1982, at various rates and frequencies. Walleye abundance (1.9/gill net) was similar to previous assessments, but remains below the normal range for similar lakes, and below the management goal of 3/gill net. The mean length was 17.9 inches, meeting the size goal for the lake. There were 7 age classes represented, which also meets the goal in the management plan.  All age classes appear to be from stocked years. When available, larger sized fingerlings, yearlings, or adults are desirable to be stocked in Round Lake to help reduce predation from abundant and small northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a reputation for abundant northern pike with poor size structure and the 2017 fisheries survey again supports this perception.  Northern pike abundance did drop substantially from 20.0/gill net in 2012, to 12.6/gill net in 2017. Prior to this decrease the average gill net catch rate for pike was approximately 19/gill net going back to the late 1990's.  As is typical for this lake, size structure remained poor with an average length of just 16 inches and an average weight of 0.9 pounds. Only 2 percent were larger than 24 inches, which falls short of the management goal for the lake.  The long-term goal listed in the plan to reduce the catch to 6/gill net with 25% greater than 24 inches may not have been attainable with recent regulation scenarios. The new zone regulations do offer more promise for changing the northern pike size structure. <br> \n <br> \nStandard trap nets captured bluegill at a rate of 16.8/net and is within the expected range for similar lakes, but below the long term average for the lake of about 30/net. Sizes ranged from 4.1 to 8.5 inches with an average of 7.0 inches and fifty eight percent were greater than 7 inches.  The size structure has shown improvements from the previous two surveys. In addition to true bluegills, numbers of hybrid sunfish are also available to anglers and offer a better size distribution, with fish exceeding 9 inches observed in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie also provide anglers with opportunities to harvest panfish. Crappie are not overly abundant and net catches were nearly identical to the previous survey. The size structure was respectable with a mean length of 8.3 inches and a maximum length of 12.1 inches.  Yellow perch showed up again in the gill net catch after being absent for 20 years. They were caught at a rate of 2/net.  Improvements to yellow perch populations are important for managing northern pike and walleye, as well as panfish. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was conducted to assess the largemouth bass population. The catch rate of 88/hr is similar to the results from the previous survey and considered a good catch rate for a lake in this area.  Sizes ranged from 7.5 to 16.9 inches with an average of 12.6 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a soft water lake located in east central Aitkin County that is noted for its clear water and sandy beaches. A public access is located on the north end of the lake.  Round lake is also known for its small sized, but abundant bluegill and northern pike populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population has been stable since 2002 both in number and size of the fish sampled.  The average length of a northern pike sampled in gill nets was 17 inches long with only 3 percent of the fish sampled greater than 24 inches in length.  Although Round Lake has little shoreline spawning habitat for northern pike, the age frequency distribution suggests that they are annually recruiting successful year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nSunfish populations have been stable since 2002.  Growth rates for bluegill are slow, however have improved from previous surveys. The average size was 6 inches.  Adding quality to the fishery are hybrid sunfish, which had an average size of 7 inches.   Growth rates were faster for the hybrids, which has resulted in sunfish over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie populations are low for this lake class, although there are sizes present that are acceptable to most anglers. The largest observed was 10.75 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled during both the standard survey and by night electro-fishing.  Electro-fishing catch rates were lower than in 2002; whereas, the gill net catch rates increased since 2002.   The lower electrofishing catch rates could be attributed to the lack of shoal water habitat that holds largemouth bass in shallow water.  Because of this, the gill net catches are probably a better indicator of the population.  The mean length observed was about 12 inches in all samples.  The 2002 year class appears very strong, and accounted for one-half of all the bass caught. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was similar to that observed in 2002 and 1997.  As in 2002, all of the walleye sampled came from year classes that were stocked.  The two strongest year classes appear to be from 1998 and 2004. Both were stocked heavily as fingerlings, as well as yearlings.  The mean back-calculated length at age 2 for both of these year classes was considerably larger than the other year classes, suggesting that these surviving fish were likely from the stocking of yearlings that occurred in 1999 and 2005. Growth rates for the walleye sampled were normal, but were on the lower side of the average range for this lake type.  Also, the growth rates observed this year were the lowest we have seen in previous surveys.  One possibility for this is the decline of the yellow perch population.  We have not sampled any in the last two surveys. <br> \n</p>",
