                "narrative": "<p>Thomas Lake (unnamed 19006700) is located in the City of Eagan at the Thomas Lake Park.  The park is managed by The City of Eagan Parks and Thomas Lake is co-managed by the City of Eagan Lakes and Wetlands Program and the MN DNR. The park has a fishing pier, shore fishing stations, boat access, restrooms, ample parking, and hiking trails.  City regulations prohibit all usage of motor-driven watercraft, except for electric motors, on Thomas and all lakes, ponds, and impoundments lying entirely within the corporate boundaries. The lake is 38 acres with a maximum depth of about 8 feet.  The 2.49 mile long shoreline is split between developed and undeveloped shorelines, with residential homes on the south side and the Thomas lake park along the north side of the lake. The lake is a good place to watch for egrets, black crowned night herons, green herons and waterfowl.  There are shore fishing stations at various locations along the park shore and a fishing pier on the northeast shore not far from the parking lot. The pier makes angling easier in the mid-summer when dense vegetation grows near shore.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe lake is primarily managed for Bluegill with secondary management emphasis on Largemouth Bass.    Bluegills were sampled in below average numbers, and are average in size for lakes such as Thomas. The average size of Thomas Lake Bluegills is 5.5 inches. The most common size Bluegills are the 5.0 to 6.0 inch group.  Additionally, 42% of the sample was over 6 inches, and the largest bluegill sampled was 7.5 inches.  Largemouth Bass are fairly abundant in Thomas Lake and trapnetting found average numbers of Largemouth Bass. Black Crappies are less abundant in Thomas Lake than bluegills with only 8 Black Crappies documented in 2016. About half the fish were between 7.0 and 9.5 inches, with the largest being 9.5 inches. Also sampled in low to below average numbers were Black Bullhead, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Golden Shiners. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thomas Lake (unnamed 19006700) is located in the City of Eagan at the Thomas Lake Park.  The park is managed by The City of Eagan Parks and Thomas Lake is co-managed by the City of Eagan Lakes and Wetlands Program and the MN DNR. The park has a fishing pier, shore fishing stations, boat access, restrooms, ample parking, and hiking trails.  City regulations prohibit all usage of motor-driven watercraft, except for electric motors, on Thomas and all lakes, ponds, and impoundments lying entirely within the corporate boundaries. The lake is 38 acres with a maximum depth of about 8 feet.  The 2.49 mile long shoreline is split between developed and undeveloped shorelines, with residential homes on the south side and the Thomas lake park along the north side of the lake. The lake is a good place to watch for egrets, black crowned night herons, green herons and waterfowl.  There are shore fishing stations at various locations along the park shore and a fishing pier on the northeast shore not far from the parking lot. The pier makes angling easier in the mid-summer when dense vegetation grows near shore.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe lake is primarily managed for bluegill with secondary management emphasis on largemouth bass.    Bluegills were sampled in average numbers, but are small in size for lakes such as Thomas. The average size of Thomas Lake bluegills is 5.04 inches. The most common size bluegills are the 5.0 to 6.0 inch group.  Only 6% of the sample was over 6 inches, and the largest bluegill sampled was 6.5 inches.  Largemouth bass are fairly abundant in Thomas Lake. Electro-fishing found good numbers of largemouth bass. An analysis of the of Thomas lake largemouth bass sampled indicate that the population is balanced, with average numbers of quality sized fish in the lake. The data also suggest that are enough smaller sized fish coming along to sustain the current size structure and distribution as long as overharvest does not occur.  Black crappies are less abundant in Thomas Lake than bluegills with only 10 black crappies documented in 2011.  Most fish were between 7.0 and 9.5 inches, with the largest being 9.5 inches. Also sampled in moderate to below average numbers were hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed.  <br> \n</p>",
