Nearly half of the fish sampled exceeded 6 inches in length. Black crappies are also abundant but were small. The average size of crappies sampled from the trapnets was 8.1 inches and 0.3 pounds. Black crappie growth is good.         Both black bullheads and yellow bullheads were sampled during the survey. The catch of each species is considered to be average for this type of lake. Yellow bullheads had a larger average size than that of the black bullheads. Carp, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were each sampled in relatively low numbers, although hybrid sunfish are currently at their most abundant population.         Yellow perch are at their highest population since 1988. The average size of perch was 6.9 inches in length in the gillnet sample. Largemouth bass were sampled within the average range for this type of lake. Northern pike were also sampled within the average range. The average size of fish sampled was 20.1 inches long and 2.0 pounds.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reitz Lake (DOW#10-0052-00) is a 79-acre, Class 30 lake with a maximum depth of 36 feet. It is located in central Carver County, southeast of Waconia. Reitz is actively managed as a panfish lake focusing on Black Crappie and Bluegill. Long-range goals aim to maintain Bluegill numbers above 60/net, while Black Crappie should produce numbers between 20-40/net. Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. A standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Reitz Lake during the week of 6/20/16 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Spring nighttime electrofishing was also completed to sample Largemouth Bass. Reitz is a small eutrophic lake, which during the survey had visible brown/green water with 6 feet of water clarity. Dissolved oxygen fell to 1.8 parts per million (ppm) at a depth of 12 feet, and 0 ppm at greater depths, during the late-June 2016 sampling period. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in Reitz Lake were low, sampled at 4.4/trap net, and the lowest since the 1993 survey (2.2/net). Despite historically low catch rates, size structure was well above management expectations. Of the 51 Bluegill measured in gill and trap nets, fish averaged 6.9 inches with the largest individual measuring 9.7 inches. Body condition values were at an all-time high and well above average values. Growth of Bluegill was also fast compared to other metro lakes, with an average length of 7 inches at age 3. Despite low numbers of Bluegill, the population has responded with increased growth, body condition, and a more favorable size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie in Reitz Lake were abundant in the 2016 survey. Trap net (14/net) and gill net (30.8/net) catches were high when compared to similar lakes across the state. There were 300 total Black Crappie netted between gill and trap nets, with an average length of 7.2 inches and maximum length of 11.0 inches. However, only a small proportion were of quality (>8 inches) size. Despite low numbers of quality fish, body condition values were high. Growth was also fast with an average size of 8.5 inches by age 3. In addition, there is a large year class of age-2 fish that made up the bulk of the catch, averaging 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled with gill nets at 8.0/net, a high catch rate compared to similar lakes across the state. The 2016 catch rate was the highest recorded on Reitz Lake, and more than double the previously high catch rate of 3.5/net. Average size of Northern Pike was 23.4 inches with the largest measured at 30.7 inches. Body condition values were normal. Growth of Northern Pike was moderately fast, with an average length of 23 inches at age 3. Seven consecutive year classes were identified during aging, suggesting consistent recruitment among years. The 2016 survey results suggest Northern Pike in Reitz Lake had consistent recruitment, good abundance, average condition and size. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2016 with nighttime boat electrofishing. This was the first year Largemouth Bass had been targeted with electrofishing. 62 total bass were sampled with a catch rate of 29.7/hour. Average size of Largemouth Bass was 11.4 inches with the largest measured at 18.7 inches. Although average size was small, the proportion of fish greater than 15 inches was high. Growth rates were moderate, with an average length of 9.5 inches by age 3. Natural recruitment was consistent, shown by 10 consecutive years without a missing age class. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. In addition, 43 Freshwater Drum were sampled with an average length of 15 inches, and the largest measuring 19.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reitz Lake is 92-acres (45.7 littoral acres), with a maximum depth of 36 feet. Reitz is located east of Waconia in central Carver County. Public water access is provided by the DNR Parks and Trails on the north side of the lake off of Reitz Lake road (up to 3 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Reitz is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie, but also supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nReitz Lake has been known to \"boom or bust\" in recent years. The last reported partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 2018-2019. A Standard Survey (9 trap nets/2 gill nets) was conducted on Reitz Lake during the week of 6/21/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Reitz was productive (brown stained water), with low-moderate water clarity, measured at 4 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 11 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Reitz Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (107.8/net). There were 970 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 4.8 inches and the largest measured at 8.4 inches. Although Bluegill sizes are currently small and numbers are high, growth rates should also be high following the previous winterkill (2018-2019). <br> \n <br> \nExtremely high numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (56/net) and trap nets (77.3/net). There were 658 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 6.3 inches and the largest measured at 11.8 inches. Black Crappie growth rates were fast compared to similar lakes with an average size of 6.2 inches by age 2. The current Black Crappie population is dominated by a single (2019) year class (95% of catch), likely a product of the 2018-2019 winterkill. With fast growth and high abundances, Black Crappie should provide desirable angling opportunity in the next 2-3 years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Reitz Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2021 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught a single Largemouth Bass, which measured 11.4 inches. Largemouth Bass appear to have been negatively impacted from the 2018-2019 winterkill, as such, targeted boat-electrofishing during the next survey should be prioritized to assess the actual impact. <br> \n <br> \nRecord high numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (16.5/net). Although catch rates were highs, size structure was substantially lower than previous surveys. There were 33 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 21.3 inches and the largest measured at 31.9 inches. While numbers of pike have increased from the previous surveys, much of this increase can potentially be attributed to an abundance of food resources (Bluegill and Black Crappie) following the 2018-2019 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

WHITE CRAPPIES WERE ALSO PRESENT BUT THE POPULATION HAS CRASHED. BLACK AND YELLOW BULLHEADS WERE PRESENT. THOUGH YELLOW BULLHEADS ARE ABUNDANT THEY WERE FAR OUTNUMBERED BY BLACK BULLHEADS WHICH MADE UP 83% OF THE TOTAL CATCH OF ALL SPECIES BY NUMBERS AND 45% BY WEIGHT. OTHER SPECIES PRESENT WERE WHITE SUCKERS, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, AND YELLOW PERCH, ALL IN NUMBERS NEAR THEIR LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH RATES.

                "narrative": "<p>Reitz Lake is an 80-acre, class 30 lake located 1.5 miles southeast of the city of Waconia.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Although white crappies have not been sampled since the 1988 population assessment, they are believed to be present in limited numbers.  Currently Carver County personnel, in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MnPCA), Metropolitan Council, and Wenck Associates, Inc., are investigating current water quality while calculating a lake specific Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL).  Refer to http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/tmdl.html for information regarding TMDL.  Reitz Lake has low numbers of good-sized, fast growing northern pike.  Fifty-five percent of sampled pike were over 24 inches and 44% were greater than 26 inches.  The largest pike measured approximately 35.0 inches.  Additionally, Reitz Lake has a reputation as a quality bass fishery.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, three bass less than 14.0 inches were sampled.  Spring electrofishing is needed to adequately assess bass numbers and size structure.     Although numbers are down for both bluegills and black crappies since last assessment in 1998, growth and average size are good.  High water (3-4 feet above average) may have affected bluegill and black crappie trap net catches.  Of the 189 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 70% were above 7.0 inches while 11 fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Additionally, average length of sampled bluegill (7.2 inches) increased by one inch since 1998.  Forty-five black crappie averaging 7.3 inches were sampled using both gill and trap nets.  Approximately 18 and 56% of the crappie sampled were above 10.0 and 8.0 inches, respectively.  The sampled crappie population consisted primarily of 4 and 5 year old fish plus a strong age-1 (2003 year class) averaging 4.4 inches at time of capture.  Although yellow perch numbers were down when compared to the 1998 survey, gill net catch rates were still above average when compared to other similar lakes across the state.  Average perch length was a respectable 8.3 inches with the largest perch measuring approximately 9.5 inches.  Black bullheads, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and white suckers were sampled in varying numbers and lengths.  Averaging 9.7/ trap net, common carp were sampled in above average numbers when compared to other class 30 lakes.  High carp catches may be due to assessment being performed during peak spawning activity.  Four freshwater drum averaging 17.7 inches were sampled using both gears.  The presence of freshwater drum may be due to connectivity to Lake Waconia and the Minnesota River via Carver Creek.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reitz Lake is a 92 acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet, located in north central Carver County.  Reitz Lake provides some recreational opportunities.  Parking at the state owned access is limited.  Water quality in Reitz Lake is poor compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 9 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing northern pike and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 9 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Reitz lake contains a simple fish community.  Boaters should also keep in mind, new laws require the drain plug be removed while on public roadways.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Reitz Lake is not diverse, but fish are large.  Northern pike numbers were below average.  Average weight was high.  Northern pike averaged 26.1 inches in length.  One fish over 35 inches was sampled.  In the 2010 population assessment largemouth bass abundance was below average, compared to similar lakes.  Average weight was very high.  Largemouth bass averaged 14.4 inches in length.  One fish over 18 inches was sampled.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.     <br> \n  <br> \nThree species of panfish are present in Reitz Lake.  Black crappie abundance is above average.  Few large fish were sampled.  Average black crappie length was 7.2 inches.  Bluegill abundance increased compared to the 2004 survey.  Abundance remains in the average range.  Average weight decreased slightly.  Over 57% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Nearly one-third of sampled fish were 7 inches or larger.  Individuals up to 8.25 inches were sampled.  This size distribution is very good for a metro area lake.  Yellow perch abundance in Reitz Lake is above average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average. Average length was 6.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in low numbers.   Common carp abundance decreased since the 2004 survey.  Both black and yellow bullhead were also sampled at below average abundance.  Freshwater drum (sheephead) were present in low numbers as well.   <br> \n <br> \nNearshore seining and backpack electrofishing found only fathead minnows and central mudminnows .  Both species are tolerant of poor water quality.  These findings reinforce the fact that Reitz Lake has poor water quality.  Overall, Reitz Lake contains a limited forage base.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
