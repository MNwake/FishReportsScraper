                "narrative": "<p>A special gill net survey was conducted on 8/22/2011 to assess the fish population.  Northern pike abundance increased from 2.0/gill net in 2004 to 3.0/gill net in 2011 (p=0.18), but was below the inter-quartile range for lake class 31.  Size ranged from 16.0-27.0\" with an average of 21.7\" and 2.1 pounds.  Fish ranged from 2-7 years old with the 2006 year class strongly represented in the catch (11 of 24).  Growth was similar to county and statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance decreased from 8.7/gill net in 2004 to 3.8/gill net in 2011 (p=0.12), but remained above the normal range for this type of lake.  Age assessment (29 of 30 fish) revealed seven year classes with fish ranging from 1-9 years old.  Strong year classes in 2006 (11 fish) and 2007 (11 fish) made up most of the catch.  Growth was slow compared to county and statewide averages for all increments.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catches have ranged from 0.6-11.0/gill net with a mean of 3.3 and a median of 1.0 in the eight previous surveys dating back to 1970.  Only one perch was captured in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has ranged from 0.7-2.8/gill net with a mean of 1.3/gill net and a median of 1.2/gill net in the six surveys conducted over the last thirty years (1981-2011).  Fish from Gun Lake and the Rice River may move to French Lake during favorable hydrologic conditions.  Aging revealed all fish were 7-8 years old.  Most fish (4 of 6) came from a Gun Lake stocked year class (2004), but two fish may have been the result of natural reproduction (2003 year class).  Since no walleye from the 2003 year class were observed in the Gun Lake assessments in 2008 or 2011, it is likely these fish were either from natural reproduction in French Lake or movement from the Rice River.  Growth was similar to county and statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough gill nets are not typically used to assess bluegill populations, there has been a steady increase in bluegill abundance in French Lake. The catch rate of over 3/gill net was the highest observed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on July 20, 2016. The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish IBI for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but two sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites. Nearshore sampling captured one intolerant fish species, the blackchin shiner. <br> \n <br> \nFrench lake falls within lake class 31 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2016 standard assessment, calculated from this survey was 20.1 below the impairment threshold. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. French Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is located six miles southeast of Palisade in central Aitkin County.  The lake has a surface area of 137 acres and a maximum depth of 37 feet.  The northwest aspect of the lakeshore is marshy grassland, while the remainder of the lakeshore is forested.  French Lake is managed for black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike.       In 1994 French Lake was included in a northern pike research study as a control lake without experimental regulation.  Information about the fish communities in French Lake will be used to compare with information from lakes that have an experimental northern pike regulation.  This comparison will help clarify whether the special regulation increases the size of northern pike in these lakes.  French Lake will continue to be the subject of special sampling throughout the end of the project in March 2007.       French Lake provides a diverse fishery for anglers with many species including northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and walleye.  The walleye population maintains itself through natural reproduction with an abundance that is lower than average for this lake type.  Walleye growth was normal compared to other lakes in Minnesota and most of the walleyes were between two and four years old.  The average walleye was about 18 inches long and weighed a little over two pounds.  Northern pike abundance was within the normal range for this lake.  Pike averaged 20.7 inches long, weighing about two pounds, with the longest fish measuring 30.5 inches.  A preferred prey species of northern pike and walleyes is yellow perch.  The abundance of yellow perch has decreased since the last survey.  During this survey less than one perch was sampled per gill net when catches in similar lakes average around thirteen fish.  The panfish abundance has been relatively stable in French Lake over the last twenty years.  Black crappie abundance was above average with strong year-classes occurring in the last three years, which should provide good angling opportunity as they move through the fishery.  Black crappies were growing at normal to above average rates.  Crappies averaged 6.75 inches long with some of the larger fish measuring ten inches.  Bluegill abundance has been lower than normal for this lake type.  In 1999 fish were averaging a little over 5 inches long with a few fish over 7.0 inches.  Bluegills grew well after the first year of life.  Most of the bluegills sampled were two and three-year-olds. Other species sampled in low numbers from the fish community were bowfin, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, shorthead redhorse, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a small lake located in central Aitkin County approximately 6 miles southwest of Palisade.  The lake has a surface area of 137 acres with a maximum depth of 37 feet.  The water is green in color with a secchi disc reading of 4.5 feet.  There is an unimproved township owned access located on the northeast corner of the lake. The lakeshore is a mixture of timber covered hills, open bog, and grassland.Most of the angling activity on French Lake is directed toward three species; northern pike, black crappie and bluegill.  Northern pike were small despite having good growth rates.  The fish ranged in size from 18 to 25 inches with an average length of about 22 inches.  Black crappie are popular with both winter and summer anglers on French Lake.  While the lake is not noted for having fish of memorable size, fish up to ? pound are common.  Bluegill can be found in sufficient numbers to provide some good fishing. Two strong year classes dominate the fishery. The 1999-year class is just reaching harvestable size and the 2002-year class will be recruiting in another couple of years.  There is also a chance that anglers who fish French Lake could catch a walleye. Most walleye present in French Lake are likely migrants from Gun Lake during spawning runs or high water events.  Spawning habitat for walleye is limited and recruitment from natural reproduction is poor in French Lake.  Walleye populations in this type of lake are primarily made up of a few older individuals.  The walleye sampled ranged from 13 to 28 inches in length with an average length of almost 20 inches.French Lake was included in an experimental northern pike regulation study as a control lake.  The experimental regulation was not implemented on French Lake, but information on the fish community was collected and used as a control to compare to the treatment lakes.  The regulation study is scheduled to run through the 2007 season. Northern pike anglers on French Lake are subject to the statewide regulations for inland waters which is a 3 fish bag limit and only one over 30 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a small lake located in central Aitkin County approximately 6 miles southwest of Palisade. The lake has a surface area of 137 acres with a maximum depth of 37 feet. The water is brownish-green in color with a secchi disc reading that has ranged from 5 to 8 feet over the years. There is an unimproved township owned access located on the northeast corner of the lake. The lakeshore is a mixture of timber covered hills, open bog, and grassland, with private homes and cabins on the east side of the lake, and the French Lake Wildlife Management Area on the west. Northern Pike and Black Crappie are the primary management species and Walleye and Bluegill are secondary management species. The invasive aquatic plant Eurasian Milfoil has established itself in the lake, so lake users should be sure to clean, drain and dry equipment when leaving the lake to prevent the spread to other waterbodies. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have inhabited the lake and have been caught in all but two surveys of the lake going back to 1970. Walleye present in French Lake were presumably migrants from Gun Lake during spawning runs or high water events, or possibly via the ditch connection to the Rice River. Spawning habitat for Walleye is limited and recruitment from natural reproduction is poor in French Lake. Since Walleye are known to have survived in the lake, a Walleye fry stocking strategy was implemented in 2013 to augment the existing population. No Walleye had been stocked in the lake prior to 2013. From 2013 to 2018 30,500 Walleye fry were stocked annually. Walleye abundance has ranged from 0 - 2.8/gill net with an average catch rate of 1.0/gill net in the eight surveys conducted spanning a time period from (1981-2020). This is the second survey since fry stocking started. No Walleye were caught in 2016 and only one Walleye was caught in 2020, for a catchrate of 0.17/gillnet. The fish was a 5 year old, 17.5 inches and 1.8 lbs. After two surveys it appears fry survival is poor in this lake and may need to be dropped or amended to fingerlings instead. Walleye from Gun Lake and the Rice River may move to French Lake during favorable hydrologic conditions, however this is sporadic at best. Spawning habitat for Walleye is limited and recruitment from natural reproduction is poor in French Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers are generally stable and on the low end for this lake type, this survey was no different at a catch of 2.7/gill net. The size structure was reasonable but not as good as 2016. The average size was 21.7 inches, and 2 fish were over 26 inches. For a small lake it has the potential to produce pike in the mid-30 inch range as seen in most surveys. The largest in 2020 was 32.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are popular with winter and summer anglers on French Lake. Black Crappie numbers showed an increase from the previous survey 1.5/net (2016) to 4.2/gill net (2020), but not yet at the abundance that was seen through the 1990's, averaging about 8/net (1989-2004). No Black Crappie over 10 inches were sampled, falling short of the lake management goal for this species. The average length for Black Crappie was 7.3 inches with a maximum length of 9 inches. Keep in mind no trap nets were used in this assessment, although at French Lake both gears typically show similar results.  <br> \n <br> \nThough historically not known as a bass lake, Largemouth Bass have been increasing in abundance and have been sampled in each of the last three surveys at moderate abundance. <br> \n</p>",
