All the walleye collected had been produced naturally - there are no records of any stocking in this lake.  Walleye growth was slightly slower than average for the area, probably because of low yellow perch abundance.  The northern pike catch was one of the highest ever observed in this lake; however, most of the fish collected were two years old, and were less than 20 inches in length.  There were a few larger northern pike present.  The yellow perch catch was the lowest ever observed in this lake.  White sucker were abundant, but the catch was not unusually high for this lake, historically.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch was similar to recent assessment catches in this lake, and near the mid-range for the lake class.  The average size of walleye was typical for the lake, but was high for this class of lake.  Ten year classes (ages 1-7, 10-12) were represented in the catch, and all were the result of natural reproduction.  The 2001 year class (age 6) appeared to be abundant; those fish averaged 18.8 inches long at the time of the assessment.  Growth rates varied among year classes, but, overall, growth was not far from average for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was within the normal range for the lake and lake class.  The average size of northern pike taken in gill nets was the largest recorded for the lake, but was within the normal range for the lake class.  Representatives of eight year classes were identified, including fish as old as nine.  All had been naturally produced.  Growth rates had been close to average for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was the highest for the lake since 1978, and fairly high for the lake class.  Average size was smaller than in any past assessment, and was small for the lake class, but some fish over 12 inches were present.  The large perch population should provide good forage for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill had first been collected in 1991, and a larger number were collected in 2007.  Bluegill from age 1 to age 8 were identified, and some large fish were present.  Growth rates had been average to faster-than-average for the lake class.  The few hybrid sunfish collected might have been the result of interbreeding between bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clara Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed.  It lies between Wills Lake (upstream) and White Pine Lake (downstream) in the Tait River system, draining to Lake Superior via the Tait and Poplar Rivers.  Primary and secondary management species in the latest (2012) lake management plan (LMP) were walleye and northern pike.  That plan established long range goals for those species of a minimum walleye gill net catch of 7.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches, and a minimum northern pike gill net catch of 1.5 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThis was to have been the second of two standard surveys intended to determine whether walleye and northern pike reproduction alone could sustain populations meeting their long range goals.  The first survey, scheduled as a full survey in 2015, was not completed due to fund and staffing cuts.  Based on the results of the 2019 survey, the management plan for this lake will be revised in March 2021.  Comments on, and suggestions for, management of this lake will be welcome as we prepare that plan. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of walleye, mostly in the 12-18-inch size range, were present in 2019.  The 2019 walleye gill net catch fell within the normal range for this type of lake, but failed to meet the catch goal set in 2012.  The 2019 catch was the lowest seen to date in Clara Lake, but should still have been high enough to drive reasonable fishing success.  The size goal for the species was met by the capture of one fish over 20 inches in length.   Seven year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2019 catch, but only the 2016 year class appeared to have been strong.  Growth of young walleye had been somewhat faster than average; fish reached a mean length of 12.2 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 11.3 inches.   Good walleye growth was supported by modest yellow perch numbers, and by what appeared to have been fairly high numbers of minnows (mainly blacknose shiner and golden shiner) in nearshore habitats. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of northern pike were present in 2019, and some larger fish could be found.  The 2019 northern pike gill net catch was typical for this lake historically and met management goals for the number and size of fish present.   Several fish larger than 30 inches (up to 39 inches) were sampled.  Eight year classes, all naturally produced, and including fish as old as ten years, contributed to the 2019 catch.  None appeared to have been exceptionally strong.  Growth of young northern pike had been somewhat slower than average; by the end of their third year fish had reached a mean length of 16.2 inches, compared to the area average of 18.1 inches.  Growth seemed to have been better among older fish; by the end of seven years, fish had reached a mean length of 30.1 inches.  Northern pike growth would have been supported by minnows, modest numbers of yellow perch, a few smaller white sucker, and large numbers of small panfish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant in 2019, and large numbers of fish over six inches in length (up to ten inches) were sampled.  The 2019 trap net catch was well above the normal range for a lake of this type, and was one of the highest ever seen in this area.  Bluegill first appeared in the Clara Lake survey catch (in significant numbers) in 2007.  No surveys had been done since, and no angler reports indicating high bluegill numbers had come in, so results of the 2019 survey were surprising.  In 2019 most anglers on the lake still seemed to have been targeting walleye and northern pike, but the few anglers targeting bluegill were having considerable success.  Eleven year classes, all naturally produced, and including fish as old as 12 years, contributed to the 2019 catch.  It appeared that strong year classes had been produced in 2011-2013, and in 2016-2017.   Growth had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 6.1 inches at the end of their fourth year, and a mean length of 9.1 inches by the end of their tenth year. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch in 2019 was low for this lake, and for this lake class; however, it did include a few fish large enough to have been of interest to anglers.  Catches in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets indicated the presence of two additional year classes of smaller perch, although their numbers were also modest.  The catch of young-of-year (YOY) yellow perch in those nets fell just within the normal range for that gear (5.5-97.1 YOY/set) when used in this area.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clara Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed. It lies between Wills Lake (upstream) and White Pine Lake (downstream) in the Tait River system, draining to Lake Superior via the Tait and Poplar Rivers. It is located approximately 12 miles north of Lutsen and access to the lake is through a public boat landing on the southwest bay. Clara Lake is primarily managed for walleye, northern pike, and bluegill. The 2023 targeted survey in Clara Lake was conducted to evaluate the survival and growth of the bluegill population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was considerably down from the previous survey in 2019, but above average for similar lakes in the area. Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 10.0 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches. Age analysis found 10 different naturally produced year classes and indicate good spawning success by the bluegill population. Growth rates were good with bluegill reaching eight inches in seven years of age. Clara Lake can produce trophy sized bluegill 10 inches in size. Both relative abundance and size structure goals were met in this targeted survey. Clara provides a unique high quality bluegill fishery for the area with a diverse fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches were low compared to similar lakes, however walleye were above average in size. Walleye up to 28 inches were captured in trap nets and provide a quality angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was slightly above average for similar lakes. Northern pike were captured in good numbers and averaged 20 inches in size, with large fish captured up to 34 inches. Anglers have the opportunity to catch large sized northern pike in Clara Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed abundance was above average for the lake and higher than other local lakes. Although most fish were about 4 inches in size, the pumpkinseed population in Clara Lake is robust. The prevalence of quality naturally reproducing bluegill and pumpkinseed populations highlight the ability of Clara Lake to support panfish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",
