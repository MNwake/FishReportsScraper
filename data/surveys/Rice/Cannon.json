                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nCannon Lake is a 1,591 acre lake located in Rice County west of the city of Faribault. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast side of the lake adjacent to Shager Park (Rice County) off MN-60. Cannon Lake is a large, windswept, relatively shallow lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Cannon Lake is placed in Lake Class 41. Other area lakes with this classification include Elysian Lake (Waseca County), Lura Lake (Blue Earth County), and Albert Lea Lake (Freeborn County). Cannon Lake is managed primarily for walleye, which are stocked three of every four years as fry (N = 2,386,500; 1,500 fry/littoral acre). Cannon Lake was surveyed the week of August 10, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe walleye population in Cannon Lake continues to exhibit strong numbers of quality fish. The 2014 catch rate is the highest on record at 11.8 fish/gill net and is well above the long-term Cannon Lake average of 6.3 fish/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 7.5 to 26.4 inches and averaged 14.2 inches, indicating relatively good size structure. The shallow, productive water of Cannon Lake allows for fast growth of walleye, with the average length of two year old fish measuring 15.5 inches. Young yellow perch and white suckers are abundant in Cannon Lake and provide a main forage base for walleye in this system, allowing for the relatively fast growth. Walleye fry stocking will continue in Cannon Lake (three out of every four years) to sustain this quality fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant fish in the 2014 survey, with a total of 173 fish collected in the gill nets (14.4 fish/net). With the exception of a 1981 survey when the catch rate was 114.5 fish/gill net, yellow perch catch rates have remained relatively stable throughout the years. The yellow perch collected in 2014 ranged in length from 5.4 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.3 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure of yellow perch. Younger, smaller yellow perch (1.0 - 3.0 inches) that provide a vital prey source in Cannon Lake do not recruit to the sampling gear used in this survey, thus are not represented.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nCannon Lake does not support the aquatic vegetation required to sustain a large bluegill population. As a result, bluegill catch rates have been low throughout the survey history. Trap nets in the 2014 survey collected a total of only 18 bluegill (1.5 fish/net), which is below the long-term average catch rate for Cannon Lake (2.2 fish/net). The length of bluegill collected in trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 9.0 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. Although a small handful of large bluegill were sampled in 2014, other area lakes may be a better option for bluegill fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in Cannon Lake has been variable and overall population levels appear to be highly dependent on successful year classes every 3-5 years. In 2009, the black crappie catch rate was 0.3 fish/gill net, which was well below the long-term Cannon Lake average of 3.6 fish/net. However, the following survey in 2014 yielded a gill net catch rate of 8.8 fish/net. Black crappie collected in gill nets ranged in length from 5.0 to 11.5 inches, with 32% of the catch measuring 9.0 inches or longer. Black crappie were also collected in trap nets during this survey at a rate of 2.3 fish/net, which ranged in length from 5.3 to 11.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe northern pike population in Cannon Lake has remained low throughout the survey history, ranging from 0.5 fish/gill net in 1972 to 1.5 fish/gill net in 2014 and averaging just 1.0 fish/gill net. Northern pike lengths in 2014 ranged from 16.5 to 33.6 inches and averaged 24.5 inches. Northern pike in most southern Minnesota lakes grow very fast. The average length of Cannon Lake pike was 22.7 inches at age-2, 26.7 inches at age-3, and 31.7 inches at age-4. No management or stocking plans exist for northern pike in Cannon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish <br> \nChannel catfish are present throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes and provide a valuable angling opportunity. Channel catfish catch rates in Cannon Lake have averaged 0.8 fish/gill net in surveys conducted since 1972. However, catch rates have increased in recent years. The 2009 survey yielded 1.4 fish/gill net and the 2014 survey yielded a catch rate of 2.3 fish/gill net, which is the highest ever recorded in Cannon Lake. Lengths of channel catfish ranged from 8.7 to 29.9 inches. Forty-eight percent of channel catfish from gill nets measured 20.0 inches or longer, indicating a good size structure in Cannon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass <br> \nWhite bass in Cannon Lake also provide a valuable angling opportunity. White bass catch rates peaked in 1999 (103.4 fish/gill net), which was likely the result of a single large year class. The following two surveys (2004, 16.6 fish/net; 2009, 15.4 fish/net) yielded lower catch rates, but still above average compared to similar lakes. The 2014 survey collected a more moderate catch rate of white bass at 6.0 fish/net. However, the size structure was good, ranging from 5.0 to 16.7 inches and averaging 13.4 inches. White bass can be caught throughout the year and are considered great table fare. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nLargemouth bass are not effectively sampled in the gears used in this survey, so the population was not accurately represented. Three largemouth bass were collected in trap nets, which measured 4.0, 16.1, and 18.5 inches. Anecdotal reports indicate quality largemouth bass fishing opportunities in Cannon Lake. Other fish species collected during the 2014 survey included white sucker, common carp, freshwater drum, bowfin, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead. White sucker, which is an important prey fish for predators such as walleye, was one of the most abundant fish species collected in gill nets (N = 132). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cannon Lake is a 1,476-acre lake located in Rice County west of the city of Faribault. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast side of the lake adjacent to Shager Park (Rice County) off MN-60. Cannon Lake is a large, windswept, relatively shallow lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet. Cannon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, which are stocked three of every four years as fry (N = 2,386,500; 1,500 fry/littoral acre).  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted the week of August 10, 2020 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying twelve gill nets as well as recording water quality parameters. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and the social distancing protocols in place at the time, only gill nets were used in the survey. Results from this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys because standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Cannon Lake continues to exhibit strong numbers of quality fish. The 2020 catch rate was 9.3 fish/gill net and was above the long-term Cannon Lake average of 6.6 fish/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 11.9 to 26.1 inches and averaged 19.3 inches. The shallow, productive water of Cannon Lake allows for relatively fast growth of Walleye, with mean length at capture of age-2 fish measuring 17.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most abundant fish in the 2020 survey, with a total of 478 fish collected in the gill nets (39.3 fish/net). The Yellow Perch collected in 2020 ranged in length from 0.6 to 11.2 inches and averaged 6.6 inches. Small Yellow Perch are common among many southern Minnesota lakes. Yellow Perch were aged and represented four age classes age-0 to age-3. Age-1 fish made up 54 percent of the catch. The abundance of small Yellow Perch can help to explain the fast growth rate of Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets do not sample Bluegill well, and due to the Covid-19 pandemic trap nets were not used during the survey. Cannon Lake does not support the aquatic vegetation required to sustain a large Bluegill population. As a result, Bluegill catch rates have been low throughout the survey history. Trap nets in the 2014 survey collected a total of only 18 Bluegill (1.5 fish/net), which is below the long-term average catch rate for Cannon Lake (2.2 fish/net). The length of Bluegill collected in trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 9.0 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. Although a small handful of large Bluegill were sampled in 2020, other area lakes may be a better option for Bluegill fishing. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in Cannon Lake has been variable and overall population levels appear to be highly dependent on successful year classes every 3-5 years. Gill nets yielded a catch rate of 8.3 fish/net in 2020. Black Crappie collected in gill nets ranged in length from 5.1 to 13.9 inches, with 6% of the catch measuring 9.0 inches or longer. The 2019 year-class (age-1) made up 67 percent of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population in Cannon Lake has remained low throughout the survey history, ranging from 0.5 fish/gill net in 1972 to 2.0 fish/gill net in 2020 and averaging just 1.0 fish/gill net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 8.9 to 35.2 inches and averaged 23.4 inches. Nearly 35 percent of Northern Pike exceeded the 24 inch minimum size requirement for harvest. Northern Pike in most southern Minnesota lakes grow very fast. Cannon Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nChannel Catfish are present throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes and provide a valuable angling opportunity. Channel Catfish catch rates in Cannon Lake have averaged 0.9 fish/gill net in surveys conducted since 1972. In 2020, 1.9 Channel Catfish were caught per gill net. Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 12.4 to 28.8 inches. Seventy-eight percent of Channel Catfish from gill nets measured 20.0 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass in Cannon Lake also provide a valuable angling opportunity. White Bass catch rates peaked in 1999 (103.4 fish/gill net), which was likely the result of a single large year class. The past two surveys (2014, 6.0 fish/net; 2020, 4.5 fish/net) yielded lower catch rates, but still above the median for Lake Class 41 (1.7 fish/gill net). The White Bass size structure was good, ranging from 5.0 to 17.1 inches and averaging 9.3 inches. White Bass can be caught throughout the year and are considered great table fare. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in the gears used in this survey, so the population was not accurately represented. Anecdotal reports indicate quality Largemouth Bass fishing opportunities in Cannon Lake. Other fish species collected during the 2020 survey included bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. White sucker, which is an important prey fish for predators such as Walleye, was one of the most abundant fish species collected in gill nets (N = 107). <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included water temperature and dissolved oxygen readings. Cannon Lake is shallow, windswept, and productive, so water clarity is often low. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 75.0 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.7 ppm at the surface to 75.4 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.5 ppm at 11.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Walleye have been stocked 6 out of the past 7 years.  Walleyes sampled in 1984 had a good distribution of age classes 1-6 present.Northern pike remain in relative low abundance averaging 1.18/gill net compared to 0.73/gill net in 1984.  Northern pike are exhibiting fast growth and are represented by age classes 2 - 4.  Northern pike sampled in 1984 were represented by 1 - 3 year olds.White bass increased from 3.73/gill net in 1984 to 14.82/gill net in 1989.  The fish sampled were large with most 11.0-13.0 inches.  White bass are represented by 1 - 4 year olds compared to 2 and 3 year olds sampled in 1984.  White bass show fast growth.Channel catfish averaged 0.73/gill net compared to 0.27/gill net in 1984.  The present population is represented by large fish, 22.0-27.9 inches.  It is suspected that most catfish migrated from Tetonka Lake, which was regularly stocked with catfish until 1984.  One young-of-the-year catfish was captured in shoreline seining.Yellow perch were well represented in netting, averaging 19.54/gill net compared to 24.54/gill net in 1984.  Yellow perch sampled in 1989 are large with many 8.0 - 11.9 inches.  Yellow perch are represented by 1 - 6 year olds with ages 4 and 5 dominating.Black crappie were sampled in low abundance, averaging 4.00/trap net compared to 11.25/trap net in 1984.White crappie remain in low numbers averaging 1.09/gill net compared to 0.82/gill net in 1984.Bluegill remain in low abundance, averaging 2.50/trap net in 1989 compared to 1.12/trap net in 1984.Black bullheads have shown a decline from 196.62/trap net in 1984 in 2.37/trap net in 1989.  The present black bullhead population is represented by large fish with most 9.5 - 12.9 inches.Other species sampled ans showing little change include yellow bullhead, carp, freshwater drum, white sucker, highfin carpsucker, and bowfin.</p>",

A total of 32 age-0 Walleyes averaging 8.3 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 32.6/hour. Catch rates varied from 1.0/hour to 380.6/hour with an average of 74.5/hour from 1997 to 2020. The four highest catch rates exceeded 100/hour and came from years when fry were stocked. The highest catch rates from non-stocked years were 33.0/hour in 2001 and 32.6/hour in 2020. It appears likely the high catch rates are at least partially due to fry stocking however there is strong evidence for periodic natural reproduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cannon Lake is located west of Faribault on the Cannon River.  The lake is relatively large at nearly 1600 acres, yet fairly shallow with a maximum depth of 15 ft.  A fishery survey was conducted on Cannon Lake in 2004 to assess the status of the fish community and the aquatic habitat.  White bass where the most common species in the gill net catches with a rate above normal compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  The white bass were mainly around 10 and 13 to 14 inches long.  Walleye catch per gill net was at a moderate level and had declined from previous surveys in 1994 and 1999.  High catches of young-of-year walleye in fall electrofishing samples (greater than 50 per hour) occurred in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996.  Catches in the late 1990's through 2003 were low.  This apparently low walleye recruitment over that last seven years appears to have resulted in the reduced walleye abundance in Cannon Lake.  Young-of-year abundance in fall 2004 electrofishing was the second highest recorded and may result in an improved walleye population in Cannon Lake by 2006 and 2007.  The 2004 walleye population was primarily age 3 fish from the 2001 year class when a large naturally spawned year class occurred in Tetonka and Upper Sakatah lakes and to a lesser extent in Cannon Lake.  Carp were the most abundant species in the trap net catches as they were in the previous two surveys.  Some large black crappie were present - up to 11.5 inches.  Bluegill were generally small with the largest at 7.6 inches.  Both bluegill and black crappie were mainly age 1 and 3.  Vegetation was rare in the main portion of the lake.  In the shallow bays upstream of Warsaw submergent vegetation and cattails were common.  A boat launch is located in Shager Memorial Park along state highway 60.  Additional shore access is located on county highway 12 which runs between Cannon and Wells lakes.  </p>",

A total of 397 age-0 Walleyes averaging 7.25 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 454.6/hour on-time. In 17 surveys since 1997, the mean catch rate during fry-stocked years (n = 11) was 208.0/hour on-time while the mean catch rate from non-stocked years (n = 6) was just 12.5/hour on-time. Additionally, the 5 highest catch rates on record have been collected in recent years (2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023). This coincides with the Walleye strain performance study being conducted by Fisheries Research and the expanded use of Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye fry. Fry stocking, and particularly LMS fry stocking, appears to be responsible for a surge in age-0 Walleye numbers in Cannon Lake in recent years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cannon Lake in Rice County is a 1,591 acre lake west of the city of Faribault. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast end of the lake at Shager County Park, located next to Minnesota State Highway 60. Cannon Lake is part of the Cannon River system that begins in Shields Lake, loops through Le Sueur and Rice counties, and finally runs to the east, draining into the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nCannon Lake was surveyed the week of August 10th, 2009 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. Walleye are the primary management species in Cannon Lake. Strong gill net catches on Cannon show an abundant walleye population. Walleyes average 7.3 fish per gill net. Walleye were older and larger, with a mean weight of 2.3 pounds and a mean length of 17.7 inches. Fishing reports have been poor and the lake has been little used by anglers, particularly in the winter. <br> \n <br> \nA strong forage base of yellow perch may help sustain the abundant walleye population. Yellow perch averaged 30 fish per gill net, a value that exceeds the upper quartile for Cannon's lake class. Perch in gill nets ranged between 6 and 10 inches.  Perch were prolific enough to be one of the more abundant species in the trap nets, a gear type that is usually ineffective for an open water pelagic species like perch. With more time, yellow perch average size will move into quality and preferred (8 and 10 inch, respectively) stock index values, translating into a higher use fishery. Some good perch fishing has been reported from shore anglers fishing off Rice county road 12 and 13. <br> \n <br> \nLow level bluegill abundance was observed in trap net catches. Young fish made up most of the sample, with just seven percent of the sample being fish larger than six inches. Bluegills are better situated to habitat on the west end of the lake, where there is more aquatic vegetation available, rather than the windswept and more turbid main lake, where vegetation is sparse.  <br> \n <br> \nNearly missing from the survey were crappie. Three black crappies were caught in gill nets and seventeen in trap nets. Crappie ranged from 5 to 13 inches, a wide variety of size and age. With no protected bays and little vegetation, spawning habitat is poor. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were gill netted at a rate of 1.5 fish per lift, trap netted at 0.3 fish per lift. Cannon Lake has poor spawning habitat outside of the Cannon river connection at the west end. A strong forage base is available if a strong year class of pike develops. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were the most abundant fish in trap nets and were modestly abundant in gillnets, at 10.3 and 3.1 fish per net, respectively. Carp have been the most abundant fish in trap nets for the past three surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass made another strong showing at Cannon Lake. Gill net catches of white bass averaged 15 fish per lift, above the upper quartile for Cannon's lake class. White bass ranged between 9 and 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe biggest change to Cannon Lake since the last survey has been the population growth of white sucker. Suckers have exploded to record high levels in the lake and presently constitute the largest percentage of biomass. 21 white suckers per gill net lift were recorded, weighing an average of 33 pounds per gill net set. Water levels in Cannon Lake and the Cannon River were very low in 2009, so its possible some of the fish may have been concentrated. <br> \n <br> \n22 channel catfish were captured during the 2009 survey. Channel catfish have moved up and down the Cannon River and many lakes within the chain have received supplemental catfish fingerling stocking. The largest catfish captured in the survey was 28 inches; the smallest 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not observed in 2009. There was not adequate staff time in the spring for largemouth bass electrofishing and bass are not well sampled by passive gears (gill nets and trap nets). One smallmouth bass was sampled in the gill nets. Smallmouth bass maintain a small population on Tetonka Lake within the Cannon Chain, and are more abundant further downstream below the King Mill Dam on the Cannon River. Other fish sampled in 2009 include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), freshwater drum, quillback sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Cannon Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

In 16 surveys since 1997, the mean catch rate during fry-stocked years was 183.3/hour on-time while the mean catch rate from non-stocked years was just 12.5/hour on-time. Additionally, the 4 highest catch rates on record have been collected in recent years (2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022). This coincides with the Walleye strain performance study being conducted by Fisheries Research and the expanded use of Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye fry.

A good distribution on I - VI yr. class fish is present.  Northerns are in relatively low abundance, as in the '81 netting.  Northerns have dropped from 1.16/gillnet in '81 to 0.73/gillnet today.  Northerns are dominated by younger fish with no fish over 3 yrs. being captured.  Black crappies have shown a slight increase and are present in fair numbers compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies are dominated by a strong IV yr. class, contrary to the even distribution of I - IV yr. classes present in '81.  White crappies were not sampled in '81, but a few were captured in '84.  Perch have declined sharply form 114.50/gillnet in '81 to 24.54/gillnet today.  The population structure today is similar to what was present in '81.  A strong IV yr. class now dominates the perch population with I - V yr. class fish represented.  White bass have shown a significant increase from 0.25/gillnet in '81 to 3.73/gillnet in '84.  All but one bass captured was II yr. class.  Four channel catfish were sampled this year with none being captured in '81.  A very small bluegill population is present, as was the case in '81.There is a very large non-gamefish population present.  Freshwater drum and black bullheads have shown significant increases from '81 levels.  White sucker, highfin carpsucker and buffalo have remained unchanged in abundance.  Carp have declined since '81 nettings.</p>",

Panfish are present in lower numbers, but are of acceptable size (around 8 inches).  The bridge between Cannon and Wells lake proves to be a popular spot for shorefishing, while a number of shallow sand bars and points in the lake provide excellent walleye fishing.</p>",

A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast side of the lake adjacent to Shager Park (Rice County) off MN-60. Cannon Lake is a large, windswept, relatively shallow lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet. Cannon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, which are stocked every other year as. <br> \n <br> \nCannon Lake was surveyed the week 14 August 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying twelve gill nets and 11 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Cannon Lake continues to exhibit strong numbers of quality fish. The 2023 catch rate was 11.0/gill net and is above the long-term Cannon Lake average of 7.5/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 6.8 to 28.0 inches and averaged 15.7 inches. The shallow, productive water of Cannon Lake combined with abundant Yellow Perch allows for relatively fast growth. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch was the most abundant game fish in the 2023 survey, with a total of 279 fish collected in gill nets (23.3/net). Yellow Perch catch rates have remained relatively stable throughout the years except for a 1981 survey when the catch rate was 114.5/gill net. The Yellow Perch collected in 2023 ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.6 inches and averaged 6.4 inches. Small Yellow Perch are common among many southern Minnesota lakes. The abundance of small Yellow Perch can help to explain the fast growth rate of Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nCannon Lake in the past has not supported the aquatic vegetation required to sustain a large Bluegill population. As a result, Bluegill catch rates have been low throughout the survey history. Trap nets in the 2023 survey collected a total of 162 Bluegill (14.7/net), which is the highest on record, well above the long-term average catch rate for Cannon Lake (3.0/net). The length of Bluegill collected in trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 7.4 inches and averaged 4.9 inches. The western end of Cannon Lake has seen an increased amount of aquatic vegetation growth and an increase in water clarity which has likely influenced the increase of the Bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in Cannon Lake has been variable and overall population levels appear to be dependent on successful year classes every 3-5 years. Gill nets yielded a catch rate of 3.8 fish/net in 2023. Black Crappie collected in gill nets ranged in length from 3.1 to 10.4 inches. Black Crappie were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 2.6/net. Black Crappie were aged using otoliths and scales. Seven year classes were represented, age-1 through age-5, and age-7 and age-8. The 2020 year class (age-3) made up 52 percent of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 0.8/gill net in 2023. The Northern Pike population in Cannon Lake has remained low throughout the survey history, ranging from 0.5/gill net in 1972 to 2.0/gill net in 2020 and averaging just 1.1/gill net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 19.9 to 38.8 inches and averaged 28.2 inches. Seventy-five percent of Northern Pike exceeded the 24-inch minimum size requirement for harvest. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish are present throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes and provide a valuable angling opportunity. Channel Catfish catch rates in Cannon Lake have averaged 0.8/gill net in surveys conducted since 1972. However, catch rates had increased in recent years. The 2009 survey yielded 1.4 fish/gill net and had stayed above that rate since. However, in 2023 only 1 Channel Catfish was sampled in the survey. That fish measured 30.8 inches and weighed approximately 12.0 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass in Cannon Lake provide a valuable angling opportunity. White Bass catch rates peaked in 1999 (103.4/gill net), which was likely the result of a single, large year class. The past two surveys (2020, 4.5/net; 2023, 0.7/net) yielded lower catch rates. Only age-0 White Bass were sampled in 2023, ranging in size from 5.5 to 6.3 inches.  White Bass can be caught throughout the year and are considered great table fare. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in netting gears, so the bass population was assessed using boat electrofishing. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 73.2/hour. These fish ranged in length from 4.1 to 20.1 inches in length and averaged 15.7 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish species collected during the 2023 survey included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Pumpkinseed Sunfish, River Carpsucker, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. White sucker, which is an important prey fish for predators such as Walleye, was one of the most abundant fish species collected in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included water temperature and dissolved oxygen readings. Cannon Lake is shallow, windswept, and productive, so water clarity is often low. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 75.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 9.0 ppm at the surface to 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.8 ppm at 12.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",
