                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are shallow and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Clear Lake was not thermally stratified on 09/08/2008.  Clear Lake has several small inlets draining local swamps.  The outlet, to the South Kawishiwi River, has a beaver dam limiting fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, ledge rock, or rubble.  Aquatic plants are moderately abundant and are scattered along the shoreline and in sheltered bays.  Wild rice, waterlilies, pondweeds, and floating leaf burreed are the most common plants.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 fish population assessment on Clear Lake consisted of 6 gillnet sets.  Six previous fisheries investigations have been conducted on Clear Lake, dating back to 1964.  All used 6-8 gillnets and two included shoreline seining for sampling small fish.  No trapnets were used due to the difficult portage access.  The initial investigation was done in mid-July; subsequent investigations were done in August or early September. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2008 of 15 fish/net (15 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class, but was similar to the median catch of 17.4 fish/net (19.5 lb/net) in all investigations on Clear Lake.  Fish populations in 2008 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and yellow perch.  Fewer white sucker were caught in 2008 than in previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2008 (5.0/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye fry have been stocked in Clear Lake in odd-numbered years, and all but two of the 30 walleye captured in 2008 were from stocked year-classes.  Walleye sizes in 2008 averaged 14.0\" (1.1 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 22.4\" and was eleven years old.  Walleye growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2008 (3.0/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2008 averaged 21.8\" (2.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 26.6\".  Pike growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of bluegill sunfish and yellow perch were present in 2008.  A few black crappie and two smallmouth bass were also caught.  These were the first smallmouth captured in Clear Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNeascus (black spot) was present on some of the game fish examined in 2008.  One walleye had lymphocystis, and one perch had yellow grub.  All of these are caused by parasites or viruses that are common and are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 2, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are shallow and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Clear Lake partially stratifies some years, but has a bottom temperature around 70 F in midsummer.  Good oxygen (more than 2 ppm) is retained to near the bottom in most years.  Three small inlets drain local marshes.  The outlet to the South Kawishiwi River has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 6 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlily and floatingleaf burreed.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 19.1 fish/net (19.2 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to the average catch of 17.1 fish/net (20.4 lb/net) in five previous gillnettings in Clear Lake dating back to 1964.  Fish populations in 1998 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, and white sucker.Walleye numbers in 1998 (6.5/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 3.0/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Many of the walleye caught in 1998 were age three fish from a strong 1995 year class, and most of the walleye were from years which had been stocked with walleye fry.  The average size of walleye caught in 1998 (13.3\") was smaller than in previous nettings.  Walleye growth (10\" at age three, 15\" at age five) was somewhat slower than average for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1998 (4.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 4.1/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1998 averaged 20.5\"; the largest was 25\".  Pike growth (17\" at age two, 20\" at age three) was faster than normal by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 1998 (1.7/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, but were identical to the average catch of 1.7/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.White sucker, bluegill, and black crappie numbers in 1998 were similar to catches in previous nettings on this lake.  Crappie and bluegill are not easily caught in gillnets, and their numbers may be higher than represented by this gillnet assessment.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located approximately 8 miles E of Ely in the BWCAW. This scenic lake has several islands and is surrounded by picturesque hills of pines and other conifers. Clear is uniquely situated between the N and S branches of the Kawishiwi River and is popular with wilderness enthusiasts exploring the area. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a 144 rod portage from the N Kawishiwi River and a 70 rod portage from the S Kawishiwi River that are the most commonly used accesses to Clear Lake. Another 70 rod portage from Eskwagama Lake can be found on the W side. There are 5 designated USFS campsites located on the lake for overnight use. <br> \n <br> \nSeven species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey of Clear Lake. Walleye (39%) and northern pike (21%) were the most common species sampled. Low numbers of bluegill and black crappie were observed. Four smallmouth bass were also sampled in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2018 (7.3/gill net) were above the historic average (2.8/gill net) for this lake and above average (5.4/gill net) compared to other area lakes that are similar. The average walleye sampled measured 14.6 inches long and about 4 years old. Walleye fry are currently stocked during odd-numbered years in Clear Lake. Approximately 64% of the walleye aged in 2018 were from years where fry stocking occurred, indicating a fair amount of natural reproduction also exists. Approximately 73% of the walleye sampled were 12 inches or larger. The largest walleye sampled in 2018 was 22.4 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (4.0/gill net) were similar to the historic average (4.3/gill net) for this lake and identical to the average when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled was 22.8 inches which is slightly larger than the historic average length of 21.7 inches.  Approximately 33% of the pike sampled in 2018 were 24 inches or larger with a maximum length of 34.1 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
