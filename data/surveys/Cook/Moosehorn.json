                "narrative": "<p>Moosehorn is a designated stream trout lake that has been stocked with Brook Trout or Splake since 1967.  This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the current (2009) lake management plan to evaluate a change in stocking that began after 2010.  At that time, the Splake stocking frequency was changed from annual to even-numbered years only, with no change in the number of fish stocked (6,000 fingerlings/stocking).  It was hoped that the change could be made while still meeting long term goals for the lake (a minimum of 10.0 Splake/gill net, two year classes over 10 inches present) while improving conditions for average or better growth. <br> \n <br> \nWith only two sets made, little confidence can be placed on the results of a single survey in this lake; however, numbers from the 2016 survey were encouraging.  Splake seemed to have been abundant, and the gill net catch was similar to catches seen under annual stocking (14.5-35.5 fish/gill net set in 1991-2010).  The two year classes contributing to the catch both averaged 10 inches or more in length.  Our expectations for Splake growth were not met; growth appeared to have been slower than average, with fish reaching a mean length of 12.8 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 15.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSlow Splake growth could be attributed to high competition between Splake (high numbers of Splake), or to poor water quality (high summer water temperatures in this shallow lake).  Competition from other species was probably not a factor, since no undesirable fish species were taken in 2016.  Although White Sucker have been found in this lake, their numbers appear to have remained low and none have been collected since 1991. <br> \n <br> \nTemperature-oxygen conditions were to have been measured in late August 2016; however, poor access and a lack of staff and equipment kept us out of the lake at that time.  Several area lakes that were tested in 2016, most deeper than Moosehorn Lake, exhibited marginal temperature-oxygen conditions for Brook Trout or Splake by the end of the summer.  High water temperatures (over 68 F) would be stressful for Splake and could result in poor growth, particularly among larger fish.  Because Moosehorn Lake is fairly shallow, cold water with sufficient oxygen typically found in deeper waters may be lacking. <br> \n</p>",
