                "narrative": "<p>Spurzem Lake is a 70-acre, class 30 lake, located on the Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) in western Hennepin County.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch. Spurzem Lake has a history of winterkill activity dating back to the winter of 1948-1949.  The northern pike is the dominant sport fish in Spurzem Lake.  Exhibiting good size structure and numbers, the pike population averaged approximately 24 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Thirty-nine percent of sampled pike were over 25 inches and 8% were greater than 30 inches.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, three fish were sampled.  Both trap net caught bass were approximately 17 inches and had an average weight of 3.3 lbs.  Spurzem Lake supports a healthy panfish population consisting of bluegills and black crappies.  Fifty-eight percent of sampled bluegill exceeded 7.0 inches while 24 bluegills were over 8.0 inches in length.  Twenty-three and 63% of the crappies sampled were above 8.0 and 7.0 inches, respectively.  Three crappies sampled were approximately 12.0 inches in length.  A strong 2000 year class (age-3) of black crappies may provide plenty of action in years to come.  Additionally, perch were present in good numbers.  While only 14% of the perch sampled exceeded 8.0 inches in length, a strong 2000-year class may provide a respectable perch fishery in the next 2-3 years. Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were present in varying numbers.  Bowfin (dogfish) and golden shiners were sampled in good numbers.  Additionally, twelve common carp, averaging approximately 25 inches and 8 pounds, were sampled.    </p>",

SINCE THERE IS NO RECORD OF FISH STOCKING AFTER 1944, REPOPULATION OF SPURZEM LAKE IS LIKELY A RESULT OF IMMIGRATION OF SEASONALLY MIGRATORY SPECIES FROM OTHER LAKES IN THE WATERSHED WHEN HIGH WATER CONDITIONS EXIST.  BOF, NOP, BLB, BLG, AND BLC WERE SAMPLED ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET USING GEAR TYPES.  BOF WERE ABUNDANT, BUT AVERAGE SMALL IN SIZE. INDIVIDUALS RANGED FROM 9.5 TO 25.0 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH AND OVER 80 PERCENT OF THOSE SAMPLED WERE LESS THAN 13.0 INCHES.  NOP SAMPLED RANGED FROM 18.0 TO 34.2 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH AND ARE REPRESENTED BY AN RSD =58.54% FOR COMBINED GEAR TYPES.  GROWTH RATE FOR NOP IN THIS LAKE IS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE.  BLGS SAMPLED GREATLY EXCEEDED MEDIAN LEVELS AND WERE VERY POPULAR WITH ANGLERS.  SAMPLED BLGS HAD A CALCULATED PSD=86.9%. LMB WERE SAMPLED ONLY DURING SHORELINE SEINING AND ALL INDIVIDUALS WERE YOUNG-OF-YEAR.  CARP WERE SAMPLED NEAR MEDIAN NUMBERS FOR TRAPNETS, BUT ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR POUNDS PER SET. INDIVIDUALS SAMPLED AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 20 INCHES IN LENGTH.  YEB, BRB, PMK, YEP, GOS, AND WTS WERE ALSO SAMPLED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT, BUT AT OR BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR STAND GEAR TYPES.</p>",

While the numbers of fish sampled for each species was down from that observed in 1991, the average size has increased. Bluegill up to 8.6\" were captured, and the average size was found to be 7.0\" in length. Over 90 percent of the black crappie in this assessment were over 8.0\" with individuals up to 11.6\" observed. Almost 1/3 of the northern pike were 25.0\" or more in length and the largest collected measured 30.7 inches. Yellow perch up to 8.5 inches were also present in the net sample. All species exhibited good growth rate at the time of this assessment. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spurzem is a 70-acre lake located in the Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) in western Hennepin County. The sport fishery consists of bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  A population assessment was conducted during June 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates in the 2009 assessment (47/trap net) were 3 times higher than the previous survey in 2003, however, mean weight of an individual fish was high at 0.29 lbs, the same as in 2003.  The largest bluegill measured was 9.2 inches and 0.65 lbs.  Eighty-three percent were 6 inches or longer and 18% were 8 inches or longer.  Growth of bluegill was fast compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, fish were 5.1 inches by age 3.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was moderately high (7.2/trap net), additionally, mean weight of an individual was high (0.29 lbs).  Size structure has improved since the previous assessment.  Eighty-five percent of black crappie sampled were 8 inches or longer and the largest measured was 9.6 inches and 0.43 lbs.  Black crappie grew similar to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area reaching 6.5 inches by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, yellow perch abundance was the highest ever documented, more than 2.5 times the previous highest catch in 2003 (35.3/gill net).  Yellow perch averaged 7.3 inches and 0.18 lbs.  The longest measured 10 inches and weighed 0.44 lbs.  Thirteen percent of yellow perch sampled were 8 inches or longer and less than one percent were 10 inches or longer.   Yellow perch grew faster than in other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, reaching 6.9 inches by age 3.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo largemouth bass were sampled (13 and 20 inches), however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was low (0.75/gill net) and considerably lower than the previous assessment in 2003 (13.8/gill net).  The largest pike measured 37.8 inches and 13.78 lbs.  Winterkill is not a likely explanation for low numbers as sufficient oxygen has been observed in Spurzem Lake since the previous assessment and there have been no reports of winterkill.  The connections to Half Moon Lake and Lake Independence may provide ample corridors for northern pike to move between these lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye was sampled measuring 19.7 inches and 2.58 lbs.  Walleye are not stocked in Spurzem Lake; however, they have been present in previous population assessments.  It is likely these fish have migrated from the connection to nearby Lake Independence during spring high water events.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead, bowfin, common carp, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spurzem Lake is 82-acres, with a maximum depth of 38 feet. Spurzem is located in the Baker Park Reserve (Three Rivers Park District) in western Hennepin County. Three Rivers Park District owns and maintains a public access ramp (subject to Three Rivers Park District rules and hours) located off of Hamel Road on the northwest shore of the lake. Spurzem is primarily managed for Northern Pike but includes catchable populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (gill nets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing) was conducted on Spurzem Lake during the week of 6/17/2019. During the survey, water clarity was moderate with 9 feet of visibility, with low oxygen below 14 feet. Although Spurzem has not been listed as an infested water as of 2019, both Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels have been found in Lake Independence, which shares a direct connection to Spurzem. <br> \n <br> \nA partial winterkill was reported on Spurzem Lake during the winter of 2018-2019, with a substantial number of Common Carp confirmed dead during spring reconnaissance. Despite the winterkill and a history of occasional partial winterkills (last previous was winter of 2010-2011), fish regularly migrate through the Pioneer Creek Watershed, particularly from Lake Independence, to aid repopulation of Spurzem. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in Spurzem Lake were sampled at moderate numbers (6.8/net) compared to similar lakes in the area. There were 27 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 25.2 inches and the largest measured at 33.5 inches. While a majority of pike fall within the protective slot (22-26 inches), harvest opportunity is available for anglers that wish to fill their 10 fish limit outside of the protected slot, with not more than 2 of those 10 fish over 26 inches. Northern Pike in Spurzem Lake continue to grow fast and show little impact from the occasional winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nFew Bluegill were sampled (9.6/net) during the 2019 survey, a historically low catch for Spurzem Lake. Bluegill averaged 7.2 inches with the largest measured at 8.0 inches. Despite low numbers, enough Bluegill remain to sufficiently repopulate Spurzem Lake. Angler activity and reports reflect partial winterkills have acted to provide periodic boosts to panfish size quality. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2019 survey, low numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (2.5/net) and trap nets (1.6/net), both historic lows for the lake. There were 23 Black Crappie sampled during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 8.4 inches and the largest measured at 9.3 inches. Despite low numbers and sizes, enough Black Crappie remain to sufficiently repopulate Spurzem Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2019 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the first time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were low, with 10 total bass sampled, with an average length of 13.9 inches and the largest measured at 16.5 inches. Despite low numbers (likely owing to the recent (2018-2019) winterkill), size of remaining Largemouth Bass should be sufficient to repopulate the lake. There has not been a history of concerns about winterkill/water quality impacting bass fishing. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Walleye. <br> \n</p>",
