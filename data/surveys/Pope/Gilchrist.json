                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist is located on the East Branch of the Chippewa River  which provides a significant sourceof nutrient laden sediment.  Water quality and clarity can vary greatly from year to year depending onannual precipitation and storm run-off.  Lake Gilchrist supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plantcommunity.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of only 7.0 feet but is dense in many shallow areas. Common cattail is common around the shoreline.  Past vegetation surveys and anecdotal informationsuggest a loss of hardstem bulrush stands over the past twenty years.  Eurasian watermilfoil wasdiscovered during the vegetation survey in 1996.  This is the first reported infestation in PopeCounty.  Northern pike catches averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (2.3 - 9.2 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches have ranged from 1.1 to 16.8 fish/net in previous surveys.  Mean weight of fish captured in1996 was 2.0 pounds.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 18.9 largemouth bass per hour.  Mean weightof fish captured was 3.1 pounds.  Most of the fish captured were between 15.0 and 20.0 inches in totallength.  Similar results were recorded in 1990.  The age class distribution of fish indicatesinconsistent recruitment.  Shoreline seining results suggest successful reproduction in 1996.  Walleyecatches averaged 4.1 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 0.4 to 5.8 fish/net in pastsurveys.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.2 - 5.3 fish/gillnet.  Catchablesize fish ranged from 15 to 26 inches in length.  Experimental fry stockings began in 1993 after surveyresults indicated that fingerling stocking was mostly ineffective.  Fry stocking in 1995 may haveproduced a relatively strong year class.  Bluegill catches decreased from 42.9 fish/trapnet in 1992 to2.2 fish/trapnet in 1996.  Trapnet catches were consistent in previous surveys, averaging 5.0, 6.3, and6.5 fish/net in 1990, 1985, and 1980, respectively.  Most of the fish captured in 1996 were smallindividuals, less than 6 inches in length.  Erratic natural reproduction in recent years may explainvariable trapnet catch rates.   Yellow perch catches decreased from 89.3 fish/gillnet in 1992 to 17.6fish/gillnet in 1996.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 39.6 to 89.3 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  The expected range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.7 - 28.4fish/gillnet.  Most of the fish captured were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in total length.  Blackcrappie are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summer months.  Catches averaged3.9 fish/gillnet and 2.1 fish/trapnet.  Fish ranged from 4.2 to 12.7 inches in total length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 14, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with two sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 20 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) two native species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish), and one non-native species that is also tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Gilchrist Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community has seemed to recover from the low densities observed during the 1990 population assessment.  Mean total weight of fish captured per gillnet increased from 24.4 pounds to 50.9 pounds and the mean total weight of fish captured per trapnet increased from 7.2 pounds to 22.4 pounds.  Gillnet catch rates for Walleye averaged 1.9 fish per net in 1992, which is within the inter-quartile range of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 32.  The Walleye catch recorded in 1990 (0.4 fish per net) was below the first quartile of mean catch rates.  The lake management plan defines a long range goal of 3.0 fish per net.  The mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 1.7 pounds and PSD was measured at 38%. Seven of the thirteen fish captured were cohorts of the 1990 year class.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even numbered years since 1984, however catch rates and age analysis indicate that fingerling stocking is only marginally successful in Lake Gilchrist.  Northern Pike catch rates averaged 4.6 fish/gillnet in 1992 which is greater than the catch rate of 1.1 fish/net reported in 1990.  The catch rate recorded is now within the inter-quartile range of mean catches from lakes within lake class 32.  The mean weight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds and PSD was measured at only 29%. Size structure of the population has been poor since 1977; PSD has not exceeded 30%.  Growth rates are slow and well below the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in area lakes within lake class 32.  Age 4 fish average 17.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Gillnet and trapnet are not effective gear for sampling the Largemouth Bass population and electrofishing was not conducted as part of the population assessment in 1992.  Daytime electrofishing yielded an average of 24.0 fish/hour in 1990.  PSD and RSD-P were measured at 100% and 39%, respectively, indicating a lack of fish under eight inches.  Age analysis indicated little or no recruitment in 1987-1989.  One, seven inch fish was captured in the trapnets in 1992 which may indicate that recruitment is still limited.  Bluegill catch rates increased from 5.0 fish/trapnet in 1990 to 42.9 fish/trapnet in 1992.  This capture rate is now within the normal range of catch rates for lakes in lake class 32 and well above the lake management plan goal of 10.0 fish/net.  The mean weight of Bluegill captured in trapnets was 0.2 pounds. PSD was calculated to be 40%.  Bluegill growth rates are similar to other area lakes within lake class 32.  Bluegill density and size structure should provide a quality fishery.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.5 Black Crappie/net in 1992.  This catch rate is greater than the catch of 0.1 fish/net recorded in 1990, yet is still below the first quartile of mean catch rates for lake class 32.  The highest catch rate recorded in past surveys dating back to 1977 was 5.5 fish/net.  Trapnetting during summer months may not be an effective way to sample Black Crappie populations.  Yellow perch catch rates increased from 40.0 fish/gillnet in 1990 to 89.3 fish/gillnet in 1992. The mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds. PSD was calculated at 1.4%.  Yellow perch catch rates have exceeded the third quartile of mean catches for similar lakes since 1977 and the size structure of the population has always been dominated by small individuals (PSD <4%).</p>",

Secchi  disk measurements average about 4.0 feet during summer months.  Lake Gilchrist supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 7 feet and is dense in many shallow areas.  The exotic plant Eurasian watermilfoil was found in 1996.   The plant has expanded in density and coverage to nuisance levels.   Please be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving the lake.  Lake Gilchrist provides diversified fishing opportunities.  Northern pike are relatively abundant and average about 2.0 pounds in size.  Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers and the size structure of the population is excellent.  Forty-five percent of the fish sampled were 15 inches in length or greater.  Bluegill and black crappie were not sampled in high numbers, however anglers have been successful in the past year during both summer and winter months.  Walleye fry are stocked in alternate years to provide an additional angling opportunity.  Gill net catches averaged 3.2 fish/net in 2001.  This catch rate is within the normal range for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics.  The age class distribution of fish captured in gill nets revealed that thirty-seven percent of the fish corresponded to years of no stocking.  This suggests that natural reproduction is occurring within the lake or that fish are moving into the lake from the Chippewa River or lakes along the river.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist is a shallow, 321-acre basin located in southeast Pope County.  Maximum depth is 24.0 feet.  Approximately 61% of the surface area is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  The East Branch of the Chippewa River runs through the basin.  Water quality and habitat conditions are variable in cumulative responses to a large watershed, river flow, and prevailing climatic conditions.  Lake level has varied as much as 5.5 feet between dry and wet weather cycles.  Water transparency in recent years has averaged only 4.3 feet during summer months.  An abundant and diverse aquatic plant community helps sustain reasonably good water clarity.  However, one plant species is an undesired aquatic exotic species.  Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in the lake in 1996.  This invasive plant has expanded to nuisance levels and can make navigation difficult in the shallow southern portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked during odd-numbers years in order to sustain a fishery.  Walleye gillnet catch rates are lower than desired but within the range of \"normal\" for similar lakes.  Size of walleye captured in gillnets ranged from 9.9 inches to 22.6 inches.  Average size captured during the 2011 survey was 16.1 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Approximately half of the total gillnet population sample was made up of two-year-old walleye.  These fish growth fast and should approach 15.0 inches in length in 2012.  Potential to catch 20.0-inch and larger walleye is very good.  Twenty-one percent of walleye in the capture sample exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are not abundant.  Gillnet catches during the 2011 survey 2006 were at the lower range of expected catches for similar lake types.  Approximately 90% of pike captures were four and six-year old fish.  The average weight of pike captured in 2011 was 2.5 pounds.  Few fish have exceeded 28.0 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth bass are only moderately abundant, but they tend have a larger average size than populations in many other lakes.  Sixty-nine percent of the 8.0 inch and larger bass captured by electrofishing exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass measured 19.7 inches in length.  Consistent annual recruitment was evidenced by presence of 10 year classes in the age-frequency distribution. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to other sunfish populations such as largemouth bass and black crappie, bluegill cannot be described as abundant.  Trapnet catches fell below the range of expected catches for similar lake types.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size caught, is good because bluegill grow fast.  Age-5 fish averaged 8.3 inches in length.  Despite fairly heavy harvest, particularly during winter months, 41% of bluegill measured in 2011 exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  The largest bluegill measured 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFew crappie have been caught from Gilchrist in surveys due to high water temperatures during late-August surveys.  Population abundance can be projected to be greater than represented by a trapnet catch rate of only 1.9-crappie/net.   The lake likely does not support an abundant population black crappie, but Lake Gilchrist has the capacity to produce fish.  Average length of crappie captured in the 2011 survey was 8.6 inches.  The largest capture measured 12.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers must help contain the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in west-central Minnesota.  Lake Gilchrist is one of two lakes known to be infested with this undesirable exotic plant within Pope County.  Please be responsible in preventing transfer to other lakes.  Remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist is a shallow, 321-acre basin located in southeast Pope County.  The East Branch of the Chippewa River runs through the basin.  Maximum depth is 24.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 10.0 feet.  Water quality and habitat conditions are variable and strongly influenced by stormwater runoff from an expansive watershed area.  Water level has varied as much as 5.0 feet between dry and wet weather cycles. Water clarity can be poor due to algal blooms, especially in late summer.   Water clarity measures average 5.0 feet during summer months.  Lake Gilchrist is classified as a bass/panfish type lake and is also stocked with Walleye to supplement natural reproduction and sustain a Walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2017 to assess abundance and size distribution of gamefishes.  Survey methodology included an electrofishing survey completed June 1 to assess the Largemouth Bass population.  Other fish populations were sampled with gill nets and trap nets.  The netting component of the survey began on July 10 and ended July 13. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing catches described a moderate density of Largemouth Bass.  While bass are not abundant, the population offers high quality fishing opportunities.  Almost half of the bass caught during the survey were 16.0 inches or longer.  The largest bass capture measured 20.2 inches.  Growth rates of Largemouth Bass are above average. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches averaged 4.3 fish/gill net which is well within expectations for Gilchrist Lake and lakes with similar size and habitat attributes.  Eleven age groups were represented in the gill net catch.  Age assignments extended from one to 17 years of age.  Average length of Walleyes was 20.5 inches.  The largest Walleye caught during the survey was 28.4 inches long.  Walleye fingerling stockings have not been more successful in increasing Walleye population abundance than fry stockings.  Supplemental stocking methodology will revert back to alternate year fry stockings beginning in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches increased greatly in 2017 to exceed desired population objectives.  While pike up to 33.5 inches were measured, average length was only 22.5 inches due to the increase of young pike in the population.  High numbers of small pike can decrease prey fish abundance and reduce effectiveness of Walleye stocking.  Starting in May 2018, new Northern Pike regulations will allow the opportunity to harvest more small pike.  Lake Gilchrist falls within the North-central pike zone and anglers will be able to harvest up to ten Northern Pike less than 22 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Gilchrist has a history of producing large Bluegills and Black Crappies.  Population abundance of Bluegills increased in 2017, mostly due to enhanced reproductive success and survival in 2015.  Two-year-olds comprised 67% of total Bluegill catches in trap nets.  These younger Bluegills averaged 5.0 inches and many will approach 8.0 inches in length in 2019.   The oldest Bluegill captures were six-years-old.  Some of these older fish had grown to 10.0 inches in length.  Black Crappies can be difficult to effectively sample with trap nets in mid-summer surveys, thus low catch rates among surveys may not accurately reflect actual crappie abundance.  Age distribution of crappie captures extended to age 6.  Four-year-old and older crappies exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  The largest crappie measured during the 2017 survey was 12.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Gilchrist. However, because of the lake's small size and modest population densities, the fishery is vulnerable to over-harvest of larger fish. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain quality of the Lake Gilchrist fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Gilchrist was designated as an infested water after the discovery of Eurasian watermilfoil in 1996. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n <br> \nA DNR public access is located on the southeast shoreline of the lake.  The lake is shallow at the access site.  It can be challenging to launch or load large, heavy boats. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist is a shallow 321-acre basin located in southeast Pope County. Maximum depth is 24.0 feet. Approximately 61% of the surface area is less than 15.0 feet in depth. The East Branch of the Chippewa River runs through the basin. Water quality and habitat conditions are variable in response to a large watershed. Water level has varied as much as 5 feet between dry and wet weather cycles. Water clarity can become seasonally poor due to excessive algal blooms, especially in late summer.    <br> \n <br> \nA standard lake survey was completed during May through July 2023 to assess the current fish community. Lake Gilchrist is classified as a bass/panfish type lake and is also stocked with Walleye to supplement their natural reproduction. Various life stages (fry, fingerling, yearling) of Walleye have been stocked over the years, including high density Walleye fingerling stockings from 2003 through 2017.  Those high-density fingerling stockings failed to increase Walleye catch rates. Due to the greater success from past fry stockings, starting in 2018 Lake Gilchrist was switched back to Walleye fry stocking on an alternate year basis. Walleye catch rates increased slightly during the 2023 survey to the highest levels observed in nearly 40 years. Multiple year-classes of young Walleye should provide good Walleye fishing for several years to come. Average length of Walleye caught in this survey was 16.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Gilchrist has a history of producing large Bluegills, Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass. Starting in the spring of 2021, a special regulation was implemented that reduced the daily limit of sunfish from 20 to 10. This regulation change was intended to help maintain or improve the size of sunfish in Lake Gilchrist. Bluegill catch rates were moderate in 2023, but many of the fish were smaller. Only 3% of the Bluegill caught in the survey were over 8 inches. Lake Gilchrist has the potential to support a high quality Bluegill fishery. Bluegill up to 10.0 inches were observed in past surveys. Black Crappie catch rates were low, but many of those observed in the survey were large.  A number of crappies from 11.0 to 14.5 inches were caught in the survey. Largemouth Bass abundance also remains low to moderate, but average size is large. Over half of the bass caught during the survey were 16.0 inches or longer, and fish over 20.0 inches have been observed in recent surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates returned to near average in the 2023 survey, after very high numbers of pike were encountered in the 2017 survey. While pike up to 31.6 inches were caught during this survey, average length was only 23.1 inches. Growth rates of Northern Pike in Lake Gilchrist are above average and most of the fish caught in the survey were 2 to 4 years old. Starting in May 2018, new Northern Pike regulations allowed for the opportunity to harvest more small pike.  Lake Gilchrist falls within the north-central pike zone and anglers can harvest up to 10 Northern Pike less than 22 inches in length. Two of those pike may be longer than 26 inches, but none between 22 and 26 inches may be retained.  <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Gilchrist. However, because of its small size, the fishery is vulnerable to over-harvest of larger fish. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Gilchrist fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Gilchrist was designated as an infested water after the discovery of Eurasian watermilfoil in 1996 and zebra mussels in 2019. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

Black and yellow bullheads, carp, and bowfin have all decreased in numbers, white suckers have increased in abundance. Yellow perch populations are similar to 1980 and are very high. Despite high numbers of yellow perch, northern pike and walleye abundance has declined. There is no correlation between fry and fingerling stocking of walleyes and year class strength. Aging records would suggest natural reproduction or a natural run of walleyes into the lake in 1983. Follow up trap netting to the 1980 survey had shown the bluegills were declining in abundance and the crappie population was increasing. However, the present survey shows bluegill and crappie numbers similar to the 1980 survey. It would appear the bluegill and crappie reproduction would be adequate.

                "narrative": "<p>Total catch rate of fishes has declined dramatically since the 1980 survey.  Mean total weight per gillnet decreased from 90.8 pounds to 24.4 similarly, trapnet catches declined from 25.2 pounds/net night in 1980 to 7.2 pounds/net night. Only five walleye were captured.  This corresponds to a mean gillnet catch rate of 0.43 fish/net night, which is the lowest catch rate recorded in recent surveys.  However, walleye have never been abundant.  Catch rates averaged 5.8 fish/gillnet and 2.8 fish/gillnet in 1980 and 1985, respectively.  Apparently, walleye fingerling stockings at 1.5 lb/littoral acre in 1984, 1986, 1988 have not been successful. Walleye fry were stocked in 1985. The northern pike catch rate of 1.1 fish/gillnet was also the lowest recorded on Gilchrist.  This compares to mean catch rates of 17.0 fish/gillnet and 6.4 fish/gillnet in 1980 and 1985, respectively. Mean weight of fish collected was 1.6 pounds. Electrofishing yielded an average of 24.0 largemouth bass/hour.  The size structure of largemouth bass is very desirable from an angling perspective. PSD was measured at 100%.  RSD Q-P and RSD P-M were calculated at 59.6% and 38.5%, respectively. Growth of largemouth bass is excellent with age 5 fish averaging 14.9 inches in length.  Growth rates appear to slow after fish reach a length of 16 inches.  One fish captured was from the 1987 year class and no fish captured were from the 1988 or 1989 year classes.  This indicates little or no reproductive success in the past three years.  This is a concern with regards to fish community balance and largemouth bass population dynamics. Bluegill catch rates have remained stable over the past decade. Catch rates averaged 5.0 fish/trapnet in 1990.  This compares to 6.5 fish/net night and 6.3 fish/net night in 1980 and 1985, respectively. Size structure, as measured by PSD, declined from 90% in 1985 to 47.5% in 1990.  Mean weight declined from 0.38 pounds to 0.20 pounds in 1985 and 1990, respectively. Growth of bluegill is good with age 3 fish averaging 5.5 inches in length. There seems to be a lack of fish age 4 and older in the population.  Size structure should improve in the following years.  Abundance may limit quality angling. Only one black crappie was captured in eight trapnet nights.  This results in a catch rate of 0.13 fish/net night.  Catch rates averaged 3.9 fish/net night and 3.1 fish/net night in 1980 and 1985, respectively.  Time of sampling may have prevented an accurate assessment of the crappie population. Yellow perch abundance has declined, but average catch rates remain well above the lake classification median.  Gillnet catch rates averaged 39.6 fish/net night, compared to 65.4 fish/net night in 1985.  Size structure has remained constant since 1977.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.17 pounds.  PSD was measured at 2.6%.  This large population of 5.0-8.0 inch fish may be controlling bluegill abundance.  Intermediate size yellow perch may be too large to be utilized by small and mid-size predators. Rough fish catches have also declined from the catch rates recorded in the 1985 survey.  Black bullhead catch rates declined from 21.2 fish/gillnet night to 0.7 fish/gillnet night.  Carp catch rate decreased from 0.6 fish/gillnet night to 0.1 fish/gillnet night.  Commercial harvesters removed 76,110 pounds of carp between 1986 and 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist is a shallow, 321-acre basin located in southeast Pope County.  Maximum depth is 24.0 ft.  The East Branch of the Chippewa River runs through the basin.  Water quality and habitat conditions are variable in response to a large watershed area, river flow, and prevailing climatic conditions.   Lake level has varied as much as 5.5 ft between dry and wet weather cycles.  Water transparency in recent years has averaged 5.0 ft during summer months.  An abundant and diverse aquatic plant community helps sustain reasonably good water clarity.  One plant species is an undesired aquatic exotic species.  Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in the lake in 1996.  This invasive plant has expanded in density and coverage to nuisance levels.  Even though habitat conditions can be highly variable, and occasionally limiting to sight-feeding and nesting fishes, Lake Gilchrist is very productive and supports a diverse fishery.  Fishing attributes can be generally described as \"moderate densities of medium-size gamefishes\".    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are well suited to riverine influences on the lake.  Fingerlings are stocked in alternate years to supplement natural recruitment and increase population abundance. Gillnet catches can't be qualified as \"abundant\", but survey catch rates have been within the range of \"normal\" for similar lakes.  Walleye grow fast and are fairly long-lived, thus fishing quality in terms of average size caught is very good.  Sixty-seven percent of walleye in the capture sample exceeding 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant and growth is above average, yet few large pike are caught.  Average weight of pike captured in the 2006 survey was 2.3 lbs.  The largest captured measured 29.7 inches.   Most pike captured in surveys have been young fish less than five-years-old.  Habitat conditions likely limit survival and longevity.  Either older pike move out of the lake or don't live long enough to maximize growth potential.   <br> \n <br> \nMembers of the sunfish family, specifically largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie, also face less than optimal habitat conditions and reproductive success in any given year can be quite variable.  Such variability or limitations to abundance are not necessarily bad for anglers.   Population densities are not excessive and subsequently, growth rate and size distribution are good.    Sixty-seven percent of largemouth bass captured in 2006 survey efforts exceeded 15.0 inches in length. The largest fish sampled measured 19.0 inches.  Similarly, bluegill cannot be described as \"abundant\" but they grow comparatively fast in Lake Gilchrist.  The average length of bluegill captured during the 2006 survey was 6.4 inches.  Despite fairly heavy harvest, particularly during winter months, nine percent of bluegill measured in 2006 exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Poor sampling efficiency of black crappie undermines certainty of survey catch statistics and tends to under-represent actual population abundance.  Based on feedback from anglers, abundance and fishing success can be variable among years, but true to population attributes of other sunfishes, crappie commonly exceed 10.0 inches and are a valued component of the overall fishery. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers must help contain the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in west-central Minnesota.  Lake Gilchrist holds the only know infestation of this undesirable exotic plant within Pope County.  Please be responsible in preventing transfer to other lakes.  Remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving Lake Gilchrist. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Gilchrist supports a quality panfish fishery. In the spring of 2021, a targeted panfish survey was completed to better assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2021. The goal of the new regulation is to increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate the effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were moderate and growth rates are fast. Almost all of the Bluegill sampled were age 6 or younger. Approximately 38% of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches and 2% were over 9 inches in length. The largest Bluegill sampled was 9.2 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were also moderate and growth rates are fast. Many large crappies were observed during the survey.  Approximately 56% of the Black Crappie were over 10 inches and 15% were over 12 inches. The largest crappie sampled was 14.2 inches.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Gilchrist. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Gilchrist was designated as an infested water after the discovery of Eurasion watermilfoil in 1996 and zebra mussels in 2019. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",
