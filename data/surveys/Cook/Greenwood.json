Although Greenwood Lake has been heavily and regularly stocked with lake trout, it appeared that the stocking contributed little to the trout population.  Freshly stocked yearlings were abundant, but lake trout stocked in previous years had all but disappeared.  Most of the older lake trout collected were the result of natural reproduction.In addition to lake trout, Greenwood Lake supported good numbers of smallmouth bass (although few large fish were found), and small numbers of brook trout.  No walleye or northern pike were collected; these species are very rare (if present at all) in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The lake trout catch in Greenwood Lake in 1999 was within the normal range for lakes of this class, and it was about average for this lake historically.  Several year classes, most produced naturally, were included in the catch.  A small number of stocked (fin clipped) lake trout from the 1992 or 1990 stockings was taken, but fin clipped fish accounted for only 25% of the total catch.  Lake trout growth had been slightly slower than average for the area.  This is often the case in lakes supporting northern cisco populations.  Lake trout growth in those lakes is often slow until the fish get large enough to feed on the northern cisco.  Most of the lake trout collected in 1999 were less than 18 inches in length; however, the lake is known as a producer of trophy lake trout, and much larger fish are present.  One 34-inch fish was collected in the 1999 assessment.Smallmouth bass were abundant, but small, and smallmouth growth rates were slow.  Smallmouth bass became established in Greenwood Lake around 1980, and the period of initial expansion of the population, when growth rates were good and many large fish were produced, is over.  Most of the smallmouth bass taken in 1999 were less than 10 inches in length.The 1999 northern cisco catch was within the normal range for lakes of this class, but it was one of the lowest catches observed in this lake to date.  Northern cisco provide good forage for large lake trout, and in this lake they support a small commercial fishery.  Greenwood Lake will be open to sport netting of northern cisco beginning in late fall 2000.  </p>",

AVERAGE SIZE WAS FAIR, BUT ONE 31 IN LAKE TROUT WAS COLLECTED, INDICATING SOME TROPHY POTENTIAL.  GROWTH WAS SLOW BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. BOTH NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND STOCKING ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LAKE TROUT POPULATION IN GREENWOOD LAKE.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST 68% OF THE LAKE TROUT COLLECTED, INCLUDING ALL OF THE 1988, 1985, 1984, AND 1983 YEAR CLASSES.  THE GILLIS LAKE STRAIN LAKE TROUT STOCKED IN 1987 COMPRISED 44% OF THE 1983 STOCKING MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELATIVELY STRONG 1982 YEAR CLASS.  THE 1985 STOCKING, HOWEVER, MAY HAVE FAILED COMPLETELY (BASED ON FIN-CLIPS AND AGING). SMALLMOUTH BASS ABUNDANCE INCREASED SINCE 1986. SMALLMOUTH BASS CPUE IN GILL NETS AND TRAP NETS WAS ABOUT TWICE THE LOCAK MEDIAN; HOWEVER, SMALL- MOUTH BASS SIZE WAS POOR WITH ONLY 5% OF THE FISH COLLECTD OVER 12 IN.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, BUT THE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY THE 1987 YEAR CLASS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 60% OF THE SMALLMOUTH BASS COLLECTED.  SMALLMOUTH BASS GROWTH WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY. A SMALL, NATURAL BROOK TROUT POPULATION WAS PRESENT.  MOST OF THE BROOK TROUT COLLECTED WERE AGE I, AND SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH FOR COOK COUNTY. THE GREENWOOD RIVER IS THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF THESE FISH. FORAGE FOR GAME FISH IS PROVIDED PRIMARILY BY NORTHERN CISCO, WHICH WERE PRESENT IN AVERAGE ABUNDANCE FOR LAKES OF THIS TYPE.  NORTHERN CISCO IN GREENWOOD LAKE HAVE ALSO SUPPORTED A COMMERCIAL FISHERY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenwood Lake is currently managed primarily for Lake Trout and cisco.  The long range goal for Lake Trout (from the 2015 lake management plan) is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches present.  The goal for the cisco population is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 5.9 fish/set in deep gill net sets, to ensure an adequate forage base for Lake Trout continues to exist in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout were fairly abundant in Greenwood Lake in 2015, although most were small.  The lake has the ability to produce some very large Lake Trout (and has done so), but none were taken in this survey.  The 2015 Lake Trout gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this type, and was similar to most catches seen in this lake historically.  The catch met the goal established in the 2015 lake management plan.  The size goal from that plan was not met (no 30-inch fish were collected); however, capture of fish of that size in survey nets is rare, and the failure to collect one in any given assessment is not unusual.  Lake Trout collected in 2015 ranged in length from 7.5 to 22.2 inches, with most in the 13-17-inch range.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch.  The 2010 year class may have been moderately strong, and the catch of several one-year-old fish (unusual in most Lake Trout lakes) suggested the 2014 year class may also turn out to be a strong one.  Growth of young Lake Trout had been about average; fish reached a mean length of 11.8 inches by the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nForage for larger Lake Trout was provided by relatively high numbers of cisco.  The 2015 gill net catch was fairly high, and easily met the long range goal for the species.  Cisco collected in 2015 ranged in length from 10.0 to 18.8 inches, with most in the 12-16-inch range.  Cisco growth had been relatively fast; three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 13.3 inches by the end of their third year.  Greenwood Lake is open to sport netting of cisco; season dates are set on a 48-hour notice, and the season usually opens in mid November.  <br> \n <br> \nIt appeared that Smallmouth Bass were abundant, but small, in 2015, as has usually been the case in this lake since they first became established (in the 1980s).   Smallmouth Bass collected in gill nets in 2015 ranged in length from 6.1 to 16.3 inches, while those taken in trap nets ranged from 5.9 to 13.9 inches.  Smallmouth Bass were also sampled by night electrofishing in June 2015.  In two hours of electrofishing spread over 12 stations, 142 Smallmouth Bass ranging in length from 4.0 to 14.3 inches (most under 12.0 inches) were taken.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough most of the Smallmouth Bass taken in August were small, enough fish larger than 12 inches were present to provide a few quality-sized fish for anglers. Six year classes contributed to the August Smallmouth Bass catch (many more were included in the June catch).  Growth of young bass had apparently been slow; on average, it took fish three years to reach a length of just 5.2 inches (average for similar lakes in this area would have been 7.0 inches in three years).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were collected for the first time in this lake in 2013, and a few were still present in 2015, although their numbers were low, and the fish collected were small.  Only three age classes were included in the 2015 catch, and no fish older than three years were taken.  There was no evidence that the Northern Pike population was expanding, or that a trophy component had developed since 2013; however, Greenwood Lake provides the high-quality forage and coolwater refuge areas that could support a high quality population, given some minimal level of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nGreenwood Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Anglers and others leaving the lake should take great care to drain and clean their equipment before moving to other waters. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average size of lake trout caught was smaller than usual for this lake and among the lower values for the area.  No large lake trout were caught in this assessment.  Nine consecutive year classes (ages 1-9) were identified in the catch.  All fish resulted from natural reproduction.  Growth rates had been close to the average for this class of lake.The number of cisco caught was within the usual range for this lake, and was somewhat below average for area lakes having this species.  The average size of cisco was larger than in most area lakes.The number of smallmouth bass caught in gill nets was in the mid-range for this lake, and below the middle for the area.  Trap nets have usually caught bass in this lake, but caught none in 2005.  Bass were small and had grown slowly.  Ages were 3, 4, and 7.The one brook trout caught was four years old.Catches of yellow perch have been low for many years.</p>",

THE 1980 ASSESSMENT NETTING INDICATED GOOD LAKE TROUT NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR THE 1978 YEAR CLASS. 1980 AND 1983 NET CATCHES SHOWED NO SIGNI- FICANT DIFFERENCE IN ABUNDANCE BETWEEN STOCKED AND NONSTOCKED YEAR CLASSES. WITH GOOD NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION OCCRRING MARKING OF STOCKED LAKE TROUT MAY BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE STOCKING SUCCESS. WHEN COMPARED TO THE 1977 AND 1980 TEST NETTING THE 1983 CATCH RATE FOR LAKE TROUT LESS THAN 12 DOWN AND FOR LAKE TROUT GREATER THEN 12 SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. LAKE TROUT OVER 22 (APPROX. 4 LBS) APPEAR FAT AND IN VERY GOOD CONDI- TION. TROUT LESS THAN 18 STILL IN GOOD CONDITION. THIS APPEARS TO BE DO TO FOOD AVAILABILITY TO DIFFERENT SIZE GROUPS. GREEN- WOOD LAKE TROUT GROW AT RATES NEAR STATE AVERAGES THROUGH THE 3RD YEAR THEN DROP BEHIND STATE AVG. THROUGH THE 7TH YEAR. AFTER THE 7TH YEAR AGING AND SAMPLE SIZE IS POOR SO NO DIRECT COMPARISON OF GROWTH RATES CAN BE MADE, ALTHOUGH ONCE THE TROUT BECOME LARGE ENOUGH TO UTILIZE THE NORTHERN CISCO PRESENT THEY APPEAR TO GROW FAST AND SHOW A HIGH CONDITION FACTOR. COMMERCIAL NETTING OF N. CISCO APPEARS TO HAVE ONLY SHORT RANGE AFFECT ON THEIR POPUALTION. N. CISCO GROWTH RATES ARE SO FAST THAT 2 YEAR OLD FISH ARE MATURE AND DOMINATE THE COMMERCIAL CATCH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake trout were fairly abundant.  Although most of the lake trout taken were between 11 and 17 inches in length, some large fish (up to 35 inches and 15+ pounds) were also present.  Most of the lake trout taken had been produced naturally; stocking accounted for only 15% of the catch.  Lake trout growth had been slow; however, in this lake trout growth has increased when the fish become large enough to prey on northern cisco.Smallmouth bass were abundant but slow growing, and most of the fish collected were less than 11 inches in length.  No other gamefish species were found.  The northern cisco catch in 1996 was the lowest ever seen in this lake, but was still within the normal range for lakes of this class.  Northern cisco were the primary forage for large lake trout, but small lake trout probably have to compete with the cisco for invertebrate forage.Readers should be aware that catches of fish in gill nets listed for 1996 in the standard lake report for this lake are for shallow gill net sets only, and do not include catches in deep gill nets, which are used to sample northern cisco and lake trout.  Combined catches in deep and shallow gill nets in 1996 were: Species\t\t\tNumber/net\tAverage weightGreen sunfish\t\t0.08\t\t0.20Smallmouth bass\t\t0.25\t\t0.49Northern cisco\t\t3.42\t\t0.73White sucker\t\t0.25\t\t2.53Yellow perch\t\t0.25\t\t0.33Lake trout\t\t2.08\t\t1.98Lake whitefish\t\t0.42\t\t2.55</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenwood Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to Lake Superior via the Greenwood River and the Brule River.  Lake Trout and Northern Pike were the only gamefish species native to this lake.  Smallmouth Bass may have been stocked illegally in the late 1970s, and Cisco were apparently introduced from Lake Superior in 1926.  In the current (2015) lake management plan (LMP), Lake Trout and Cisco were designated primary and secondary management species.  The current long range goals for Lake Trout are to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep and shallow sets combined) of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches in length present.  The long range goal for Cisco is to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep sets) of 5.9 fish/set.  <br> \n <br> \nAll references to gill net catch in this narrative will be to the combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets, unless otherwise indicated. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the last of four standard surveys needed to provide baseline data for this lake as part of the MNDNR Fisheries Long Term Monitoring program (Greenwood is a Sentinel Lake in that program).  It was also the third of four standard surveys scheduled in the 2015 LMP to determine whether experimental regulations were needed to preserve or enhance Lake Trout or Smallmouth Bass populations in this lake, and to monitor attainment of long range goals for Lake Trout and Cisco.  The final survey scheduled in the 2015 plan will be done in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Lake Trout were present in 2019, although larger fish seemed to have been scarce.  The Lake Trout gill net catch was within the normal range for a Class 1 lake, but was lower than most catches seen in this lake historically (Table 1).  The catch failed to meet the goal (2.0 fish/set) established in the 2007 LMP and retained in the 2015 revision.  The size goal from that plan was also not met (no 30-inch fish were collected); however, capture of fish of that size in survey nets is rare, and the failure to collect one in any given assessment is not unusual.  Lake Trout collected in 2019 ranged in length from 7.7 to 26.0 inches, with most in the 15-19-inch range.  Nine year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, but none stood out as being exceptionaly strong.  Growth of Lake Trout collected in 2019 appeared to have been slow; fish reached a mean length of just 13.9 inches at the end of their seventh year, compared to an area average of 18.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco were fairly abundant in 2019; unfortunately, almost all were infested with the Trieanophorus tapeworm, which forms cysts in muscle tissue and greatly reduces the value of those fish for human consumption.  Larger Lake Trout would have benefited from the excellent forage provided by relatively high numbers of Cisco, but those Cisco probably competed strongly with small Lake Trout for invertebrate forage.  The 2019 Cisco gill net catch was above-average for a lake of this type, but was similar to most past catches in Greenwood Lake.  The catch in deep sets easily met the long range goal for the species.  Cisco collected in 2019 ranged in length from 9.5 to 18.2 inches, with most in the 13-16-inch range (too large to have been taken by most of the Lake Trout seen in 2019).   Eight year classes, including fish as old as eight years, contributed to the 2019 catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass survey catches were low in 2019; however, the sampling gear used does not always provide a good indication of true Smallmouth Bass abundance.  The Smallmouth Bass gill net catch was below-average for a lake of this type, but was similar to most catches observed in recent assessments of this lake.  The catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets fell below the normal range for this type of lake, and was one of the lowest catches seen in this lake.  Smallmouth Bass collected in gill nets and trap nets in 2019 ranged in length from 8.3 to 15.7 inches.  Five year classes contributed to the 2019 Smallmouth Bass catch, but no fish younger than four years were collected, suggesting reproductive success or recruitment may have been limited in recent years.  Young fish appeared to have been similarly scarce in 2017.  Growth had apparently been slow; fish reached a mean length of 7.0 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA few Northern Pike were still present in Greenwood Lake in 2019, but their numbers were probably very low.  Northern Pike were collected for the first time in this lake in the 2013 survey, and a few were still present in 2015.  None were taken in the 2017 standard survey; however, short-term gill netting done in late October of that year did capture one Northern Pike.  In 2019 one Northern Pike was taken in gill nets and another was captured in trap nets.  To date we have no evidence that the Northern Pike population has or will expand; however, Greenwood Lake provides the high-quality forage and coolwater refuge areas that could support a high quality population, given some minimal level of recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nGreenwood Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Anglers should be diligent about cleaning and drying all equipment used in this lake before they move on to another area water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenwood is a classic deep, cold, clear-water Class 1 Lake Trout lake.  It is currently managed primarily for Lake Trout and Cisco.  The long range goal for Lake Trout (from the 2015 lake management plan) is to maintain a minimum combined deep and shallow gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches present.  The goal for the Cisco population is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 5.9 fish/set in deep gill net sets. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the third of four standard surveys needed to provide baseline data for this lake as part of the MNDNR Fisheries Long Term Monitoring program (Greenwood is a Sentinel Lake in that program).  It was also the second of four standard surveys scheduled in the current (2015) lake management plan to determine whether experimental regulations were needed to preserve or enhance Lake Trout or Smallmouth Bass populations in this lake, and to monitor attainment of long range goals for Lake Trout and Cisco.  Baseline surveys will be complete after 2019, and the final survey scheduled in the 2015 plan will be done in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout remained fairly abundant in Greenwood Lake in 2017, although most of the fish present seemed to have been small.  The combined 2017 Lake Trout gill net catch in deep and shallow sets (1.5 fish/set) was within the normal range for a Class 1 lake, but  lower than most catches seen in this lake historically.  The catch failed to meet the goal set for the species in the 2015 lake management plan.  The size goal from that plan was also not met (no 30-inch fish were collected); however, capture of fish of that size in survey nets is rare, and the failure to collect one in any given assessment is not unusual.  Lake Trout collected in 2017 ranged in length from 8.4 to 18.2 inches, with most in the 12-17-inch range.  Seven year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, but none stood out as having been exceptionaly strong.  Growth of Lake Trout collected in 2017 appeared to have been slow; fish reached a mean length of just 13.5 inches at the end of their seventh year, compared to an area average of 18.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nForage for larger Lake Trout was provided by relatively high numbers of Cisco, although those Cisco may also have competed strongly with small Lake Trout for invertebrate forage.  The 2017 Cisco gill net catch was close to average for Class 1 lakes, and similar to most past catches in Greenwood Lake.  The catch in deep gill net sets easily met the long range goal for the species.  Cisco collected in 2017 ranged in length from 9.6 to 18.7 inches, with most in the 13-16-inch range.  Greenwood Lake is on the list of lakes where netting of Cisco (and Lake Whitefish) is allowed each fall.  The netting season on Greenwood Lake typically opens in early to mid November.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were again fairly abundant in Greenwood Lake in 2017, and a few quality-sized (over 12 inch) fish were available for anglers who worked hard to find them.  The Smallmouth Bass gill net catch was a little below average for Class 1 lakes, but was similar to most catches observed in recent assessments of this lake.  In contrast, the catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets was near the bottom of the normal range for lakes of this type, and was one of the lower catches seen in this lake.  Gill and trap net catches have often yielded contradictory results in this lake, suggesting that neither by itself is a good indicator of Smallmouth Bass abundance.  Smallmouth Bass collected in gill nets in 2017 ranged in length from 10.4 to 14.3 inches, while those taken in trap nets ranged from 7.7 to 15.3 inches.  In both cases most fish were under 12 inches in length.  Smallmouth Bass growth had apparently been slow; fish reached a mean length of 9.6 inches at the end of their sixth year, compared to an area average of 12.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were collected for the first time in this lake in the 2013 assessment, and a few were still present in 2015.  None were taken in this survey; however, short-term gill netting done in late October did capture one Northern Pike.  To date we have no evidence that the Northern Pike population has or will expand in Greenwood Lake; however, the lake provides the Cisco forage and coolwater refuge areas that could support a high quality population, given some minimal level of recruitment.</p>",

The mean weight for lake trout taken in 2009 was within the normal range, and was similar to means seen in the past in this lake.   Many year classes contributed to the 2009 catch.  All had been produced naturally, although none were particularly strong.  The presence of some two- and three-year-old lake trout, ages often not sampled in lake trout lakes in this area, suggested that those year classes may have been stronger than usual.  Lake trout growth had been slow; fish reached an average length of 13.2 inches at the end of their fifth year, and required 10 years to reach a length of 20 inches.  Although northern cisco were abundant, and provided excellent forage for lake trout, they may also have been competing with lake trout for the invertebrate forage used by younger fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern cisco (tullibee) were abundant in 2009.  The gill net catch was the highest seen in this lake since 1980.  From the lengths of cisco collected (and from past aging results in this lake) it was clear that much of that catch came from what was probably one exceptionally strong year class produced in 2007 or 2008.  The summer of 2009 was cool, and northern cisco were found at all depths during the 2009 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were abundant but small, as has typically been the case in this lake in recent years.  The smallmouth bass catch consisted entirely of four, five, and six-year-old fish.   Growth had been slow; four-year-old fish reached an average length of just 7.8 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an average of 9.0 inches in similar lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in this lake, a few brook trout were collected in 2009.  Brook trout in Greenwood Lake are thought to come from a resident population in the Greenwood River. <br> \n <br> \nNo walleye or northern pike were found in 2009, although small numbers of fish of both species may be present.  Both species can be found in Sunfish Lake, which flows into Greenwood Lake via a short and passable stream. <br> \n <br> \nSpiny waterflea are known to be present in Greenwood Lake.  Anglers visiting Greenwood Lake are advised to take great care to clean and wash down (or thoroughly dry) boats and trailers before moving to another lake.  In addition, all bait buckets, livewells, bilges, and engine cooling systems should be completely drained before leaving access points on the lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenwood Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to Lake Superior via the Greenwood River and the Brule River. The public access is located about 9 miles down the Greenwood Lake Road (Forest Road 309) which intersects with the Gunflint Trail about 16 miles north of the City of Grand Marais. The public access features a concrete boat launch and dock which is separated from the parking area by a short but moderately steep gravel road that is prone to washouts. The lake has seen increasing development pressure over the past 30 years, although a majority of the shoreline remains in public ownership. There is one dispersed campsite maintained by the US Forest Service present on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout and Northern Pike were the only gamefish species native to this lake. Cisco and presumably Lake Whitefish were introduced from Lake Superior in 1926. Smallmouth Bass may have been stocked illegally in the late 1970s. Lake Trout were stocked extensively from the 1920's through 1993 but stocking was discontinued after survey results indicated naturally produced fish comprised a high majority of the fish sampled in surveys. Low numbers of Brook Trout have been sampled occasionally in surveys of Greenwood Lake. Those fish are presumed to have been migrants from the Greenwood River, which supports a self-sustaining population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 lake management plan (LMP) designated Lake Trout and Cisco as the primary and secondary management species for Greenwood Lake. The current long-range goals for Lake Trout are to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep and shallow sets combined) of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 30 inches in length present. The long-range goal for Cisco is to maintain a minimum gill net catch (in deep sets) of 5.9 fish/set. This was the last of four standard surveys scheduled in the 2015 LMP to determine whether experimental regulations were needed to preserve or enhance Lake Trout in this lake, and to monitor attainment of long-range goals for Lake Trout and Cisco. All references to gill net catch in this narrative will be to the combined catch in deep (GDE) and shallow (GSH) gill net sets, unless otherwise indicated. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout abundance in Greenwood Lake has appeared stable since stocking was concluded in 1993, with gill net catches ranging from 1.47 to 2.75 fish/set between 1996 and 2019. The 2022 Lake Trout combined gill net catch was slightly above that range (2.83 fish/set) and met the catch goal after catch results from 2017 and 2019 failed to reach 2.0 fish/set. Lake Trout collected in 2022 ranged in length from 9.9 to 28.9 inches, while the average length of Lake Trout in the sample was 14.9 inches. The size goal from that plan was not met (no 30-inch fish were collected); however, capture of Lake Trout of that size in standard survey nets is rare, and the failure to collect one in any given survey has not been unusual in this area. Lake Trout from eight naturally produced year classes contributed to the catch. The higher catch result in 2022 appeared to be bolstered by the 2019 and 2018 year classes, which accounted for half the Lake Trout sampled. On average, age-4 Lake Trout measured about 12.8 inches at the time of this survey, which was comparable to growth rates observed in other Lake Trout lakes in the region. <br> \n <br> \nCisco continued to provide a good forage base for large Lake Trout, although the population may also have competed strongly with small Lake Trout for invertebrate forage. The 2022 Cisco gill net catch (12.00 fish/set) was well above average compared to similar lakes and consistent with recent catches in Greenwood Lake. Cisco collected in 2022 ranged in length from 9.7 to 17.6 inches and had a mean length of about 14.2 inches. Trieanophorus tapeworm cysts were reported in the flesh of Greenwood Lake Cisco in recent years and by 2019 nearly all the Cisco internally examined in that survey were infested. These grub-like cysts form within the fillet areas of an infected fish and can reduce human consumption appeal. All 30 of the Cisco internally examined for Trieanophorus cysts in 2022 were also infested.  <br> \n <br> \nStandard survey results for Smallmouth Bass have varied since the 1990s but in general catches in gill nets and 0.75-in-mesh trap nets have been low and comprised of mainly smaller fish (less than 12 inches). Results from 2022 were similar, as the gill net catch was below average compared to similar area lakes that support bass, and the trap net catch was one of the lowest seen for this lake. Gill nets and trap nets are generally not considered optimal sampling methods for tracking Smallmouth Bass abundance, and it seems likely the population was more abundant than these results suggest based on recent angling reports. Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2022 ranged from 7.9 to 13.9 inches in length, although most were less than 12 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species present in the 2022 standard survey included Green Sunfish, Lake Whitefish, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike; all were sampled in low numbers. Although Yellow Perch abundance appeared low, those that were sampled were of quality sizes (10 inches or larger). Northern Pike were first documented in Greenwood Lake by DNR Fisheries during the 2013 survey. They have been sampled in three of the four surveys completed since then, albeit in very low numbers. A single age-2 Northern Pike was sampled in a trap net in 2022. To date we have no evidence that the Northern Pike population has or will expand; however, Greenwood Lake provides the high-quality forage and coolwater refuge areas that could support a high-quality population if recruitment were to improve. <br> \n <br> \nGreenwood Lake is infested with Spiny Waterflea, a DNR-regulated aquatic invasive species (AIS). Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota AIS laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",
