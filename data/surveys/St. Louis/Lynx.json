The lake is within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and the 1854 ceded territory.  Motor restrictions are in effect for Loon Lake and there is no road access to the lake. Fish abundance in gill nets were mostly below the median values and generally decreased from the last investigation in 1974.  However, northern pike abundance increased dramatically from the last investigation and were much higher than the median for this lake class.  The 1997 year-class represented 43% of the northern pike that were aged and seven year-classes were present.  Few year-classes were present for other species.  Mean weights for smallmouth bass, walleyes, and white suckers were near their respective medians for class 3 lakes.  Northern pike were much heavier than the median value for similar lakes.  Growth rates for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and walleyes were greater than the area and statewide averages.    </p>",
