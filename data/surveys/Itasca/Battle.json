                "narrative": "<p>Battle Lake is a 199 acre lake located east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pickerel and Deer Lakes.  The lake has limited development, and the primary access is through a shallow channel from Pickerel Lake.  Battle Lake is managed primarily for bluegill, while northern pike and walleye are considered secondary species.  All three lakes in the chain have a conservation regulation (10 fish daily bag limit) for sunfish and a slot length limit (17-26 inch protected) for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch rate in 2010 was 9.1/net, above the management plan goal of 3.0/net but within the expected range for similar lakes.  The two highest historical catch rates for bluegill have occurred in the two most recent assessments.  A trend of increased bluegill abundance has been noted in many area lakes in recent years.  Bluegill size structure in Battle Lake has declined over the same period.  Sampled bluegill in 2010 ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches, with a mean length of 6.2 inches.  This compares to mean lengths of 6.8 inches in 2004 and 8.4 inches in 1998.  Bluegill were not aged in this assessment, but results from the two most recent spring trap-net assessments (2005, 2009) showed growth similar to the lake class average.  Additional spring assessments are planned to further evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation regulation.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for northern pike was 12.3/net, above the expected range and the highest on record for Battle Lake.  Catch rates in most recent assessments have exceeded the lake class median and management plan goal of 7.0/net.  Sampled pike in 2010 ranged from 13.0 to 27.7 inches with a mean length of 21.0 inches.  Ages 1 through 5 were represented in the sample.  Mean length-at-age was similar to the statewide average for ages 1 and 2, and above the statewide average for ages 3 through 5.  Northern pike reached 23.7 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch was 1.3/net, below the lake class expected range but similar to previous assessments.  Net catches for walleye have only exceeded the management plan goal of 2.0/net in two of the nine assessments since 1960.  Sampled walleye ranged from 16.3 to 22.2 inches, with a mean length of 19.0 inches.  Ages 5, 7 and 9 were represented in the sample, all which correspond to years of fry stocking.  Mean back-calculated length at age was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Walleye reached 16.7 inches in five years. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 black crappie gill-net catch was a historical high at 7.2/net.  The two highest catch rates for crappie have occurred in the last two surveys.  Gill-net and trap-net catches were generally below 1.0/net in most previous assessments.  The 2010 trap-net catch remained near the long-term average at 0.4/net.  Black crappie size structure was moderate.  Crappie from gill nets ranged from 4.6 to 10.9 inches, with a mean length of 8.9 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent, with ages 2 through 7 represented in the sample.  Mean length-at-age was similar to the statewide average.  Black crappie took five years to reach 9.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for yellow perch was below the expected range at 2.7/net.  The two lowest net catches for yellow perch have occurred in the two most recent assessments, and are likely related to the higher abundance of northern pike.  Although catches in past surveys have been as high as 51.3/net, historical catch rates have generally been less than 10.0/net.  Size structure of yellow perch was poor, with only one perch over 8 inches in the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included brown bullhead, largemouth bass, rock bass, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and white sucker.  Near-shore IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling with a small-mesh seine and back-pack electrofishing was conducted in 2010 in an attempt to capture smaller fishes not normally encountered with standard sampling gear.  Additional species captured in near-shore sampling included bluntnose minnow, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, and Johnny darter. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Battle Lake is a 199-acre lake located in northeast Itasca County, east of Effie, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 ft and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pickerel and Deer Lake.  The lake has limited development and a primitive carry down access on the east shore.Northern pike gill-net catch was 8.0/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net abundance in past assessments has varied from 2.5 to 11.5/net.  Most of the fish sampled in this assessment were between 17 to 19 inches, and no fish exceeded 24 inches.  Size structure has historically been poor and is similar to other small shallow lakes in the area. Bluegill trap-net catch was 15.6/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in 2004 was much higher than any of the previous assessments, which have varied from 2.8 to 4.3/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 8.5 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 7 inches by age 6.  Angler harvest can have a negative effect on bluegill size structure in a small lake like Battle Lake.  Research has shown that the size structure of a bluegill population is highly dependent on the size of the mature male bluegill.  If these large males are overharvested, it can ultimately reduce the potential of the lake to produce quality fish.  To maintain quality size structure, anglers should consider releasing bluegill 8 inches and larger.  Walleye gill-net catch was 1.7/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have generally been low, varying from 1.3 to 2.5/gill net.  Although Battle Lake is mainly a bass/panfish lake, walleye fry are stocked every other year along with Deer and Pickerel Lake.  Ten walleye were sampled in gill nets, and 8 of 10 fish corresponded to stocked years.  Size structure was good with fish up to 20 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 15 inches by age 4.Black crappie gill-net catch was 0.7/net, which was lower than expected range.  Trap-net catch was 0.5/net, which was also lower than the expected range.  Catch rates have historically been low and in all but one prior assessment have been less than 1.0 fish/net in gill nets or trap nets.  Although abundance was low, size structure was good with fish up to 12 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for ages 1 to 4, and faster than the average for ages 5 to 6.  Black crappie averaged 10 inches by age 5.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 3.3/gill net and was lower than the expected range.  Although catch rates in past assessments have been as high as 51.3/net, abundance has generally been less than 10/gill net.  Overall size structure was poor, however, a few fish up to 11 inches were sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets in low abundance.  Sampled size was too low to make conclusions about size structure.   Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and brown bullhead.  Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  </p>",

Northern pike and perch population levels have fluctuated over the years.  At present, northern pike abundance is above our local median while perch abundance is below our local median.  Walleye abundance has dropped from 1960 to the present time.  Fingerling stocking in 1977 did not improve walleye population levels.  The largemouth bass population has remained fairly stable and natural reproduction appears adequate.  Populations of panfish and crappie have fluctuated over the years and are presently down in abundance.</p>",

The lake is 199 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 5 July, 2018.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at nine sites; four using a 50-ft seine and five using a 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 13 different species; nine species by seining and 10 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 16 July, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has limited development and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pickerel and Deer Lakes.  The primary access to Battle Lake is through a shallow channel from Pickerel Lake.  The lake is managed primarily for bluegill while northern pike and walleye are considered secondary species.  A special trap-net assessment was conducted in the spring of 2009 to evaluate bluegill age and size structure.  A similar assessment was conducted in spring 2005, prior to the implementation of a conservation regulation (10 fish daily bag limit for sunfish) beginning in spring 2006.  The goal of the regulation is to maintain or improve the quality of the bluegill population.  The 2009 assessment was the first attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation regulation for sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch increased from 6.4/net in 2005 to 14.4/net in 2009.  The increased catch rate was accompanied by a decline in bluegill size structure.  Bluegill from the 2005 assessment had a maximum length of 9.8 inches and a mean length of 7.7 inches, while fish sampled in 2009 ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  The total number of sampled bluegill over 8 inches decreased from 92 in 2005 to 31 in 2009.  Six year classes were represented with fish from age 3 to 9 in the 2009 sample.  Recruitment appeared to be more consistent in 2009 than in the previous assessment, although age 4 and age 6 fish made up 20% and 40% of the sample, respectively.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 6.8 inches at age 6.  The sex distribution for examined fish was 34% female and 66% male.  <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this assessment would seem to indicate the quality of the bluegill population in Battle Lake has declined since the previous survey.  A concurrent assessment on adjacent Pickerel Lake yielded similar results.  The results from any particular assessment can be greatly affected by variability in recruitment as well as the timing of sampling.  It should be noted that historic high bluegill net catches have been recorded in many area lakes during this same time frame, likely a result of increased recruitment in response to favorable environmental conditions.  Additional assessments will be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 10 fish bag limit. <br> \n</p>",

A special trap-net assessment was conducted in the spring of 2011 to evaluate bluegill age and size structure.  Similar assessments were conducted in spring 2005 and 2009.  A special conservation regulation (10 fish daily bag limit for sunfish) was implemented beginning in spring 2006.  The goal of the regulation is to maintain or improve the quality of the bluegill population.  The 2011 assessment was the second attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation regulation for sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch has continued to increase from 6.4/net in 2005 to 14.4/net in 2009, and to 18.6/net in 2011.  The increased catch rate was accompanied by a decline in bluegill size structure.  Bluegill from the 2005 assessment had a maximum length of 9.8 inches and a mean length of 7.7 inches, while fish sampled in 2009 ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Bluegill in 2011 ranged from 3.0 to 9.2 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  The total number of sampled bluegill over 8 inches decreased from 92 in 2005 to 31 in 2009, but increased to 46 in 2011.  Bluegill PSD declined from 85 in 2005 to 64 in 2009, while PSD-P decreased from 66 to 11 over the same time period.  The 2011 sample had a similar size structure to 2009, with a PSD of 64 and PSD-P of 15.  Nine year classes were represented with fish from age 2 to 10 in the 2011 sample.  Recruitment appeared to be more consistent in 2011 than in the 2005 assessment, although age 5 and age 6 fish combined made up more than 50% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class average, with fish averaging 6.9 inches at age 6.  The sex distribution for examined fish was 36% female and 64% male.  <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this assessment would seem to indicate the quality of the bluegill population in Battle Lake has declined and then stabilized since the 2005 survey.  The results from any particular assessment can be greatly affected by variability in recruitment as well as the timing of sampling.  It should be noted that high bluegill net catches have been recorded in many area lakes during this same time frame, likely a result of increased recruitment in response to favorable environmental conditions.  Additional assessments will be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 10 fish bag limit. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is the eastern lake in a chain of navigable lakes including Deer and Pickerel Lakes.  There is no public access, however a small boat can access through the culvert from Pickerel Lake.  A special 10 fish bag limit regulation was implemented in 2006 to maintain the existing quality sunfish population.  This special assessment was conducted to evaluate the results of the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch was 20.6/net, which was similar to the 2011 assessment of 17.9/net, but much higher than the 2005 preregulation assessment catch rate of 6.4/net.  It is important to note that spring trap net catch rates are highly variable due to weather, water temperature and spawning conditions.  Size structure was good with a PSD of 93, an RSD-P of 12, and an RSD-M of 0.  Size structure was similar to 2011 which had a PSD of 64, an RSD-P of 15, and an RSD-M of 0.  A preregulation assessment in 2005 had size structure indices of a PSD of 85, an RSD-P of 66 and an RSD-M of 0.  Size structure appears to have declined slightly for fish between 8 and 10 inches, but catch rates may have increased since the special regulation was implemented.   <br> \n <br> \nFish up to age 11 were sampled indicating survival to older age classes.  The 2007 and 2008 year classes comprised 75% of the fish sampled.  Growth was slower than the lake class average up to age 5, then similar to the average for ages 6 to 8.  Bluegill reached preferred length of 8 inches by age 10, which is slower than either Pickerel or Deer Lakes.  Bluegill aged in 2005, grew much faster, reaching 8 inches at age 6.  The 2013 scales were read by two independent readers who had similar assigned ages.    <br> \n <br> \nThe results of this assessment suggest that size structure and growth has declined since the regulation was implemented.  However, catch rates have also increased, which may influence size structure and growth.  It is unknown if the regulation may be responsible for increased catch rates.  The 10 sunfish bag limit will be open for public comment and review in the fall of 2014.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Battle Lake is a 199 acre lake located east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pickerel and Deer Lakes.  The lake has limited development, and the primary access is through a shallow channel from Pickerel Lake.  All three lakes in the chain have a conservation regulation (10 fish daily bag limit) for sunfish and a slot length limit (17-26 inch protected) for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2014.  Bluegill and Black Crappie were considered primary management species because they are well suited for the lake.  Northern Pike and Walleye were considered secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in 2018 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch rate in 2018 was above the management plan goal, but within the typical range when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill numbers may be increasing in Battle Lake.  A trend of increased Bluegill abundance has been noted in many area lakes in recent years and is consistent with statewide trends.  The three highest catch rates for Battle Lake Bluegill have occurred in the most recent surveys.  Average size in Battle Lake has generally declined over the same period.  Sampled Bluegill in 2010 ranged from 3.2 to 9.2 inches, with an average length of 6.0 inches.  This compares to average lengths of 6.8 inches in 2004 and 8.4 inches in 1998.  Size structure in the most recent survey was influenced by a strong 2015 year class.  Ages 2 through 10 were represented, but age 3 fish made up 42% of the sample.  Despite the decline in average size, overall size quality remains favorable, as 27% of the sampled Bluegill exceed 8 inches.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist for Bluegills given the abundance and size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nBattle Lake typically produces a modest crappie population.  The 2018 catch was typical of Battle Lake and similar to lakes with comparable habitats.  The catch rate was below the LMP goal and had declined from the previous two surveys.  Crappie populations in northern Minnesota are often cyclical, and the Battle Lake fishery likely varies based on inconsistent year class production. At the time of this survey, the population appeared to be comprised of mostly younger fish.  Crappie from gill nets ranged from 4.2 to 11.6 inches, with an average length of 8.0 inches.  Ages 1 and 3 made up 62% of the sample, with average growth of 9.2 inches at age 5. <br> \n  <br> \nBattle Lake has a history of moderate to high pike numbers with poor size quality.  The 2018 gill net catch for Northern Pike was higher than the LMP goal, but less than the catch from the previous survey.  Reduced pike numbers are often desirable, as high numbers of small pike result in poor growth and small average size.  Size quality remained relatively poor in 2018.  Sampled pike ranged from 17.4 to 26.3 inches with an average length of 21 inches.  Poor size quality may limit the popularity of the pike fishery.  The north central pike zone regulation implemented in 2018 requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, while allowing for more harvest of small pike.  It is hoped that this regulation will improve size quality on Battle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBattle Lake typically produces a modest number of Walleye.  The walleye gill net catch remained below the expected range for similar lakes, and was similar to previous surveys.  Net catches for Walleye have only exceeded the management plan goal of 2.0/net in two of the ten surveys since 1960.  Sampled Walleye were generally large, as lengths ranged from 18.9 to 27.2 inches, with an average length of 21.6 inches.  Low numbers likely limit the popularity of the Walleye fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for Yellow Perch was below the typical range for similar lakes.  Like many Minnesota lakes, perch numbers have declined over time.  Although catches in past surveys have been as high as 51.3/net, historical catch rates have generally been less than 10.0/net.  Size structure of Yellow Perch is too poor to interest most anglers.  Low perch numbers likely limit Walleye production.   <br> \n <br> \nUnfortunately, bass are difficult to evaluate with test nets and boat electrofishing was not attempted due to the limited access and remote nature of Battle Lake.  Test netting suggests that Largemouth Bass are relatively abundant, as the trap net catch rate was higher than expected compared to similar lakes.  Bass ranged from 4.6 to 17.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Battle Lake, together with eight other lakes in the Grand Rapids fish management area with similar ecological characteristics, are grouped into ecological lake class #39.  These lakes are approximately 200 acres, moderately hard water, and shallow with 98% littoral area.  Some of the lakes in this lake class such as Murphy, Little Sand, and Shallow Pond Lakes, have histories of winterkill.  Others, such as Bass and Mabel Lakes, have not suffered winterkill and, with supplemental stocking, produce good walleye fisheries.Species catch rates (CPUE's) were compared to lake class CPUE's along with age and growth analysis to determine population status.  Tullibee, although unusual for this type of lake, have been recorded in low numbers but were not captured in this assessment.  The navigable channel with Deer and Pickerel Lakes, allows reproducing populations of fish to migrate and contribute to the stock in Battle Lake.  Northern pike populations were below the lake class median but increased in 1986 and rose above the median to 9.5 fish/gillnet in this assessment.  Trap net CPUE's have stayed slightly below the median and have been relatively stable.  In age and growth analysis all pike sampled were age III or younger with fast growth rates for age II fish.  Age II fish averaged 16.1 inches and made up 44% of the sample.  This fast growth for age II fish was also noted on Pickerel Lake.There were six species of centrarchids sampled in this assessment and their trap net catch rates were below or near the first quartile CPUE's.  Rock bass, pumpkinseed, and bluegill populations historically showed low abundance but recently their gill net catches have increased to median levels or above.  Hybrid sunfish were recorded in this assessment and a state record hybrid sunfish was caught in Battle Lake in September, 1988.The yellow perch population fluctuated greatly over the years with a high of 51.3/gillnet in 1977.  At the present time they have declined to 9.1/gillnet, below the CPUE median of 14.5/gillnet.  The walleye catch rate has remained very stable since the initial survey in 1960.  Their abundance has generally been below the lake class median and was 1.3/gillnet in this assessment.  Of the eight fish sampled in this netting, four year-classes were represented, all correlating to the last four years of fry stocking.  Interestingly, in shoreline seining done in 1986, a nonstocked year, many young-of-year were recorded.  These fish either represent natural reproduction, documented in 1957 seining when no stocking took place in Deer, Pickerel, or Battle Lakes, or migration of young-of-year from Deer and Pickerel Lakes which were stocked in 1986 with fry.</p>",

In addition to northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch, the lake also supports a modest population of walleye.  This survey was conducted, together with Deer and Pickerel, to evaluate the biennial walleye fry stocking that has occurred on the three lakes since 1989.        Walleye were sampled at their highest level (1.8/gill net) since the 1960 survey.  Most of the walleye sampled were from stocked years.  Four of the seven years evaluated were stocked, however.  The walleye ranged in length from 8.7-20.3 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.     Northern pike were sampled above the lake class median but most were small.  The average size sampled in the gill nets was only 1.1 pounds.  Most of the northern sampled (95%) were 2 and 3 years old.     Both black crappie and bluegill were of quality size in this survey.  The crappies had an average length of 9.7 inches in the gill nets and were sampled above the lake class median while the bluegills had an average size of 8.4 inches in the trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Battle Lake is a 199-acre lake located east of Effie, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and is part of a navigable chain of lakes including Pickerel and Deer Lakes.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit regulation for Walleye (with one fish over 26 inches in possession) was implemented for the chain of lakes.  All three lakes were included in the regulation because it is possible to navigate a boat from lake to lake.  Access to Battle Lake is obtained through a shallow channel from Pickerel Lake.  The specific goals of the regulation related to Walleye catch rate and size structure were focused primarily on Deer Lake.  General goals of the regulation were to provide a more stable walleye population and increase the contribution of natural reproduction throughout the chain.  The 2013 special gill-net assessment was conducted to sample Walleye to monitor the effects of the special regulation on Battle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 Walleye gill-net catch was 1.7/net, compared to a catch of 1.3/net in 2010.  This is within the lake class expected range and similar to the long-term average for Battle Lake.  As in most previous assessments, sample size was too small to calculate meaningful stock density indices.  Walleye sampled in 2013 ranged from 15.0 to 25.6 inches with a mean length of 18.7 inches.  Mean length of Walleye in the two most recent assessments was slightly higher than in pre-regulation surveys.  The number of fish over 20 inches increased slightly as well.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with Walleye exceeding 15 inches at age 4.  Seven year classes were represented with three of the ten fish corresponding to years of fry stocking.  Fry stocking in Battle Lake proper was discontinued in 2011 because it did not appreciably increase the Walleye population beyond what would be expected from natural reproduction and migration among the lakes.  Currently, the fry allocated to Battle Lake have been stocked in Deer Lake.  The results of this assessment indicate the special regulation has had limited effect on the Walleye population.  Battle Lake has never had an abundant Walleye population, but will likely continue to provide a low density bonus fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at 3.2/gill net.  This catch rate is below the lake class expected range and is considerably lower than other recent assessments.  Historical catch rates have varied from 2.5 to 12.3/net.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 16.6 to 26.8 inches with a mean length of 21.5 inches.  This was the first survey not to sample Northern Pike over 28 inches.  Age and growth data for Pike were not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for Yellow Perch was 1.0/net.  This is well below the lake class expected range and the lowest catch rate recorded for Battle Lake.  Sampled Yellow Perch ranged from 5.8 to 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill-net catch rate was within the expected range at 3.5/net.  Size structure was good; sampled Black Crappie ranged from 6.9 to 12.0 inches with a mean length of 11.0 inches.  Gill-net PSD was 95 and RSD-P was 90.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this assessment included Largemouth Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
