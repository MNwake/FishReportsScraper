This trail is a dedicated public right of way.  The remaining land surrounding the eastern third of the lake is privately owned.  There are several homes and cabins there, all set back from the lakeshore.  In the lake's mid section about half the shoreline is in private ownership, and about half is federally owned.  The western third of the lake is in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, but no portage trail accesses this area of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake's water quality and fish community are reminiscent of those of Iron and Little Iron Lakes, although Tucker Lake is over twice as deep, exceeding 40 feet in depth.  The water is stained brown.  Exposed ledgerock and boulders are common along the shoreline.  Dense beds of aquatic vegetation occur in shallow flat areas of the northeast and southeast arms of the lake.  Little vegetation is present along the steep shorelines with ledgerock and boulders.  Fish species known from the lake are walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, bluegill, pumpkinseed, blacknose shiner, and central mudminnow.  All are currently self sustaining through natural reproduction, but none are abundant. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked as early as 1930, and in nine years from 1975 through 1993.  There was no strong evidence that the heavy stocking of that recent stocking period improved the walleye population.  Results of the the 2013 assessment netting indicate a small-to-moderate population size, and a 'medium' average fish size.  The largest walleye collected measured 22 inches long.  The average weight of fish collected was heavier than in most assessments in Class 6 lakes.  Based on ages determined from the fish sampled in 2013, walleye growth rates had been fast for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were few and small in the 2013 assessment, consistent with previous netting results.  The longest fish sampled was 22 inches long.  Growth rates of pike had been slower than average for this lake class.  The lack of old fish contributes to the small average size and may indicate a high mortality rate. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch provide forage for walleye and northern pike.  The  largest perch sampled was 8.9 inches long and 5 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch in 2013 was the highest catch of this species in the six assessments conducted in Tucker Lake (which began in 1970), and followed the species' lowest catch in 1999 (the preceeding assessment).  However, this high catch remained below the median value of white sucker catches recorded for netting of Class 6 lakes.  The average weight of white sucker was typical for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were collected from Tucker Lake for the first time in 2013.  The were caught in trap nets, which had not been set in this lake before.  Only a few were caught, and none were large.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill net catches in the 1999 assessment were lower than normal for this lake; however, catches were reduced because several of the nets were set at depths were there was little or no oxygen, and so caught no fish.  Discarding the poorest sets resulted in a walleye catch (2.3 fish/gill net) that was still below the normal range for lakes of this class, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  The mean weight of walleye collected in 1999 was similar to past weights observed in this lake.  Walleye were reproducing naturally in the lake, and walleye growth rates were about average for the area.The northern pike catch was also affected by the bad gill net sets; however, it was within the normal range for lakes of this class.  With the bad sets discarded, the catch would have been the highest ever observed in this lake.  The mean weight for northern pike collected in 1999 was similar to weights observed in the past on this lake.  Northern pike growth rates were about average for the area, despite the lack of forage fish.</p>",
