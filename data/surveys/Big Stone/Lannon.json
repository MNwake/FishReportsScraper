                "narrative": "<p>Lannon is a shallow, winterkill prone lake located one half mile south of Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  US highway 75 divides it into east and west basins.  The west basin is connected to East Toqua Lake by a culvert through County Road 20.  Fish movement occurs among the three basins and their fish assemblages have been similar. Lannon Lake can provide valuable spawning and nursery habitat for fish from East Toqua, especially Northern Pike during springs with sufficient water levels.  No public boat ramp is present on Lannon Lake and access is limited to foot travel from public road right-of-ways.  This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, standard trap nets and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Lannon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017 Walleyes were abundant.  Multiple year classes were present, though the majority were from 2016 and 2014.  These fish averaged 10 and 17 inches, respectively.  Walleyes up to 26 inches were also caught.  Walleye fry are routinely stocked into Lannon and East Toqua Lakes to create a fishery and reduce the numbers of carp and bullheads.         <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Northern Pike were moderately abundant.  Perch measured 7 to 11 inches, averaging 8 inches.  Pike measured 19-32 inches, averaging 25 inches.  Although pike grow quickly in Lannon Lake, they tend to be short lived due to a lack of a cool water refuge during the heat of summer.  Few pike have been sampled older than age three.  Adult Black Crappies were caught in low numbers, but young-of-the-year crappies were abundant.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included moderate numbers of Black Bullheads and Common Carp, as well as low numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo, White Suckers and Yellow Bullheads.  Bullheads up to 12 inches long were caught. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lannon is a shallow, winterkill prone lake located near the city of Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  US highway 75 divides it into east and west basins.  The west basin is connected to East Toqua Lake by a culvert through County Road 20.  Fish movement occurs among the three basins and fish assemblages are somewhat similar.  <br> \n <br> \nLannon Lake can provide valuable spawning and nursery habitat for East Toqua, especially for northern pike during springs with sufficient water levels.  Public access is limited to carry-in areas along U.S. Highway 75. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant in 2014.  The majority were around six inches, but fish up to 11 inches were present.  Anglers can expect the perch to measure 9-10 inches by fall, 2015. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were moderately abundant and measured 14-29 inches.   Although pike grow quickly in Lannon Lake, they tend to be short lived due to a lack of a cool water refuge.  Few pike have been sampled older than age three.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and walleye were caught in low numbers.  Walleye fry are stocked annually to maintain the population and in an attempt to reduce recruitment of carp and bullheads through predation. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included moderate numbers of black and yellow bullhead, and common carp, as well as low numbers of bigmouth buffalo and white sucker.  Bullheads were caught up to 11 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lannon is a shallow, winterkill prone lake located near the City of Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  In years with normal or above normal water levels, connectivity to East Toqua Lake allows for fish passage.  However, due to frequent winterkill, Lannon Lake has received minimal fishing pressure.     An ice-out investigation indicated a winterkill occurred in 2004.  Thousands of dead carp along with numerous bigmouth buffalo, crappie, northern pike, white sucker and yellow perch, and two walleye were observed along the north shore of the west basin.  Spring and summer test nets confirmed that the winterkill was extensive.  However, the kill was not complete as abundant live black bullhead, and low numbers of bigmouth buffalo, carp and white sucker were sampled.  Length frequencies of these species indicated only one or two year classes present, likely the result of frequent winterkill.         As part of the Accelerated Walleye Program, walleye fry were stocked into Lannon Lake in 2004.  Under this program, walleye are harvested during the fall and stocked into other lakes.  Four hundred pounds of fingerling walleye (9,784 fish) were harvested in 2004.  Heavy rainfall in late September increased water levels by over two feet.  The increased water level allowed for fish passage from East Toqua Lake and increased abundance of bigmouth buffalo, carp, and white sucker.  Numerous black and white crappie, as well as a few adult walleye were also sampled.  Most crappie measured 8-10 inches, and most walleye 10-12 inches with a couple individuals up to 18 inches.     Management plans for Lannon Lake include continued walleye rearing, particularily in years following winterkill.  If consecutive years without winterkill occur, carry-over walleye will likely provide enhanced angling opportunity.  Due to the frequency of winterkill, anglers would be encouraged to keep a higher percentage of walleye they catch.</p>",
