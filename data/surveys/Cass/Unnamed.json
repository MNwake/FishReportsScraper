The median for similar lakes (lake class 28) is 6.0/lift.  They ranged in length from 19 to 34 inches, with the mean length being 25.7 inches. Growth was good for all ages.  The only other fish that were caught in the gillnets were: 1 cisco, 1 black bullhead and 1 bluegill.Bluegill were captured in the trapnets at 10.5/lift.  This was between the first quartile and the median of lake class 28.  There was a good variety of lengths, ranging form 2.5 to 9 inches.  The mode was 4.5-4.9 inches. The PSD was only 21.  The growth was slow for the first three years, then good after that.Five black crappie were caught, ranging in length from 6.5 to 9.5 inches.  Other species caught in the trapnets were: 1 northern pike, 4 yellow bullhead, 3 brown bullhead, 6 pumpkinseed, and 1 largemouth bass.</p>",
