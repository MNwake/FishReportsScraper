                "narrative": "<p>Pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass were caught in all three parts of the lake in the trapnets and gillnets, except that largemouth bass were not caught in the gillnets in Lower Mantrap.  The catches of pumpkinseed, bluegill, and crappie were good in both the trapnets and gillnets, with the catches of largemouth bass being better than the statewide figure for trapnet catches.  All of the smallmouth bass were caught in the gillnets and none were caught in Upper Mantrap.  The bulk of the yellow perch, northern pike, and yellow bullhead were caught in the gillnets in better than average numbers, but the amounts from one part of the lake to another varied considerably.  Common suckers were caught in fair numbers in the gillnets.  The growth of the centrarchids was slow, but a good number of the larger-sized fish were also present.Discussion and Summary:Mantrap Lake was once noted for its muskellunge fishing.  However, with the introduction of northern pike, the musky has virtually disappeared from these waters.  Efforts to create a musky fishery through costly maintenance stocking of fingerlings cannot be expected to produce a self-sustaining fishery unless the factors which caused the decline of the native stock can be corrected.It is likely that this lake will produce more \"trophy-sized\" northern pike from naturally spawned fish than it will muskies from artificially stocked fish.Mantrap Lake can produce good annual sustained yields of bass, panfish, and northern pike without artificial stocking.Fish Stocking:Musky stocking cannot be expected to produce a self-sustaining fishery unless the factors which caused the decline of the native stock can be corrected.Reproduction is not a limiting factor of bass and panfish populations.Stocking Record:Before the 1950 bass, walleye, crappie, northern pike, and muskellunge were stocked at various times.  Since then the stocking records are as follow:Species\t\tYear\t\tNumber\t\tSizesLargemouth Bass 1952\t\t   90\t\tfingerlingMuskellunge 1957\t\t  504\t\tfingerlingMuskellunge 1958\t\t  220\t\tfingerlingLargemouth Bass 1958\t\t9,129\t\tfingerlingSpecial Regulations:Continued musky stocking should be accompanied with at least a 30-inch size limit for this species.Past Special Regulations:The lake was open to experimental angling for crappies and rough fish from 1951 to 1953.The lake was closed to darkhouse spearing from 1944-1945 to the 1950-1951 season.Spawning beds were posted in 1959.Mirror Bay was closed to any manner of fishing from 1942 to 1951.Special Projects and Activities:A permit to destroy aquatic vegetation was issued in 1957.  There was a cooperative rearing pond for black bass in 1955.History from Previous Investigations and Surveys:A range of secchi disc readings from 11.5 to 15.5 feet was recorded on June 22, 1938.  Several surface water samples showed a range of 142 to 199 ppm in total alkalinity.  The growth was calculated for bluegill, pumpkinseed, crappie, and largemouth bass, and growth was the same as calculated for those species in 1959.  Muskellunge were reported in 1938, but not caught in 1959.  Muskellunge were reported in 1938, but were not caught in 1959.  Information collected by the lake survey crew indicated that muskellunge were present in the lake in 1959.  Northern pike were not reported in 1938.Local Fishing Report:According to local reports the most commonly caught species of fish are crappie, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  The fishing success in the 1959 season was considered to be good for panfish and poor for nothern pike and bass.  Information indicates that before northern pike were introduced the lake was considered to be a good muskellunge-panfish lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mantrap Lake (Big Mantrap) is located in central Hubbard County, two miles east of Emmaville. Mantrap is 1618 acres with a maximum depth of 68 feet.  There are two state owned public accesses on Mantrap.  The main access is located on the south side of the west basin and has two concrete ramps.  The second is located on the south end of the north arm, with a shallow and soft earthen ramp.  Mantrap provides angling opportunities for Muskellunge, Northern Pike and Black Crappies. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Mantrap Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Belle Taine, Little Mantrap, and Spider Lakes.  <br> \nMuskies are a very popular fish in Mantrap, but are not well sampled with normal gear types.  Special spring sampling has taken place in recent years, and has shown the population is very good with the biggest fish reaching 52 inches. <br> \nThere is a special regulation for Northern Pike.  All pike 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released, with a possession limit of three, and only one over 36 inches.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike with an average size of 24 inches and 3.3 lbs.  Northern Pike were sampled in good numbers up to 34 inches long, with most fish 19-28 inches. <br> \nMantrap is a popular lake for panfish, especially for Black Crappies.  There is a special regulation for crappie of a five fish possession limit.  Black Crappies were sampled in all sizes from 5 to 14 inches, with the majority being 8-9 inches.  Most Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were from 3-8 inches, with no fish exceeding 9 inches. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Mantrap. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (0.05 fish/gillnet and 0.35 lbs/gillnet) fell below the first quartile for lake class 25 of the Schupp Classification System.  Only one walleye was sampled in both 1991 and 1988, the only years they showed up in the surveys.  Walleye are not stocked into Big Mantrap Lake.Number of northern pike sampled (5.83 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range, while 18.64 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 3.20 lbs.  Both numbers and sizes of northern pike have fluctuated from below normal to within the normal range since 1959.  The size structure (PSD=89, RSD-P=11) appears favorable to anglers, however, the population is unbalanced with a large proportion of stock length fish.  Small northern pike (<17.0 inches) may not have been efficiently sampled, leading to the high PSD.  Northern pike exhibit good growth, averaging 20.04 inches at age 3.  Recruitment appears strong for all year classes sampled.Number of muskellunge (0.50/gillnet) sampled was also within the normal range, while 2.92 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile.  Mean weight of muskie sampled was 5.84 lbs.  Muskellunge fingerlings are continually stocked into Mantrap Lake.Largemouth bass and rock bass catch rates were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification and generally have been since 1959.  Catches of smallmouth bass fell below the first quartile.  Smallmouth bass were first sampled in Mantrap in 1988 when catches were also below the first quartile.  Black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed catch rates were above the third quartile in 1991.  Densities of black crappie and pumpkinseed have been above the third quartile since 1959, but this was the first year bluegill abundance was above the third quartile.  The size structure for all three species is small (black crappie PSD=26, bluegill PSD=34, pumpkinseed PSD=27).  The poor size structures may be the result of slow growth rates.  Mean length at age 3 for black crappie is 5.23 inches, for bluegill is 4.23 inches and for pumpkinseed is 3.52 inches.  Number of yellow perch sampled was above the third quartile, but total pounds sampled was within the normal range.  These catch rates are indicative of the small size distribution (PSD=3).  Abundance of yellow perch has been above the third quartile since 1959.Cisco and shorthead redhorse catch rates fell below the first quartile for lakes of this class and have been below since 1959.  Golden shiner abundance has shown an increase since 1984 and catches climbed above the third quartile in 1991.  Catches of white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were all within the normal ranges.  Black bullhead densities were high in 1974 before their removal in 1975.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Mantrap Lake is located two miles east of Emmaville in central Hubbard County.  Big Mantrap has a surface area of 1,556 acres and a maximum depth of 68 feet.  Big Mantrap is a diverse lake with numerous bays, islands, and channels and over 22 miles of shoreline.  There are two public boat accesses located on the lake.  The more popular and developed access is located in  the State Forest Campground on the \"west arm\" of the lake.  The other public access is located on the \"north arm\" of the lake and has an earthen ramp.  Big Mantrap is well known for it's muskie fishery but also supports fine fishing for northern pike and black crappie.The muskellunge population in Big Mantrap has changed significantly over the past ten years. Big Mantrap had an abundant muskie population from the 1960s to the early 1980s.  While muskie numbers were high, size of fish was small, with many 30 inch fish, but few over 40 inches in length.  The reason for the small size is that a genetic strain of muskie called \"Shoepac\" were stocked into Big Mantrap during that period.  This strain of muskellunge survived and did well in Big Mantrap, but were never capable of growing to large sizes (over 40 inches).  Starting in 1988, \"Leech Lake\" strain of muskellunge were stocked into Big Mantrap.  The Leech Lake strain has the genetic capability to grow fish to 50 inches or more in length.  To adequately assess the muskellunge population in Big Mantrap, special sampling such as spring trapnetting is done.  After ice-out and when the surface water temperature is near 50 F, muskellunge are moving to shallow water areas looking for suitable spawning areas.  This shallow water movement by muskie makes them more susceptible to sampling with trapnets.  Since 1988, spring trapnet sampling has shown an increase in the size structure of the muskie population.  Average length and the numbers of fish over 40 inches has increased for both male and female muskie.  Muskie anglers are reporting seeing and releasing a few 50 inch fish.  Big Mantrap is stocked with muskellunge (Leech Lake strain), in even years (750 fish).  Natural reproduction is also contributing substantially to the muskellunge population in Big Mantrap.Big Mantrap supports an excellent northern pike fishery.  While not known for producing big pike (over 10 pounds), Mantrap has good numbers of northern pike in the 3 to 5 pound range.  The 1999 surveys showed that northern pike were at their highest abundance for all surveys done on Big Mantrap (9.1 northern pike/gillnet).  Due to high northern pike abundance, average weight of northern pike was smaller, 2.0 pounds compared to over 3.0 pounds in past surveys. The black crappie fishery is popular year around on Big Mantrap.  The 1999 survey showed black crappie abundance within the \"normal\" range for this lake class, but down from past surveys.  Black crappie catch rates from previous surveys have been above the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  There has been some concern by area anglers that heavy fishing pressure and harvest of black crappie in the past two winters may be reducing both the numbers and average size of black crappies in Big Mantrap.  At this point it is too early to tell if the black crappie abundance or size has changed significantly.  Big Mantrap has an abundant bluegill and pumpkinseed population, however size tends to run small.  The number of bluegill and pumpkinseed over 7.0 inches is low.  Big Mantrap also supports a moderate largemouth bass population.  Good largemouth bass habitat is found in the \"north arm\" around the islands and bays.   Smallmouth bass are also present in low numbers and tend to be found in the \"main lake\" basin.  </p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 10 - 11, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Eighteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, six sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at eight sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 18 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on June 26, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Mantrap Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Mantrap Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Mantrap is located two miles east of Emmaville in central Hubbard County.  Big Mantrap has a surface area of 1,556 acres and a maximum depth of 68 feet.  Big Mantrap is a diverse lake with numerous bays, island, and channels and has over 22 miles of shoreline.  There are two public boat accesses located on the lake.  The more popular and developed access is located in the State Forest Campground on the \"west arm\" of the lake.  There are two concrete ramps and spacious parking at this access.  The other public access is located on the \"north arm\" of the lake and has an earthen ramp.  Big Mantrap is known for its muskie fishery, but also supports fine fishing opportunities for northern pike and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge population in Big Mantrap has changed significantly over the past twenty years.  Big Mantrap had an abundant muskie population from the 1960's to the early 1980's.  While muskie numbers were high, size of fish was small, with many 30-inch fish, but few over 40 inches in length.  The reason for the small size is that a genetic strain of muskie called \"Shoepac\" were stocked into Big Mantrap during that period.  This strain of muskie survived and did well in Big Mantrap, but were never capable of growing to large sizes (over 40 inches).  Starting in 1988, \"Leech Lake\" strain of muskellunge were stocked into Big Mantrap.  The Leech Lake strain has the genetic capability to grow fish to 50 inches or more in length.  To adequately assess the muskellunge population in Big Mantrap, special sampling such as spring trapnetting is done.  After ice-out and when the surface water temperature is near 50 F, muskellunge are moving to shallow water areas looking for suitable spawning areas.  This shallow water movement by muskie makes them more susceptible to sampling with trapnets.  Since 1988, spring trapnet sampling has shown an increase in the size structure of the muskie population.  Average length and the numbers of fish over 40 inches has increased for both male and female muskie.  Muskie  anglers are reporting seeing and releasing a few 50 inch fish. A 52.7 inch muskie was sampled in the spring of 2007.  Big Mantrap is stocked with muskellunge (Leech Lake strain) in even numbered years (750 fish).  Natural reproduction is also occurring with sporadic and limited contribution to the muskellunge population in Big Mantrap. <br> \n <br> \nBig Mantrap supports an excellent northern pike fishery.  While not known for producing big pike (over 10 pounds), Mantrap has good numbers of northern pike in the 3 to 5 pound range.  Starting in 2003, a special length limit regulation that requires the release of all northern pike from 24.0 to 36.0 inches (24-36 inch protected slot) was implemented.  The 2007 survey showed good numbers of northern pike within the 24-36 inch protected slot.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 25.7 inches and 4.3 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.4 inches.  It will take several more years to see if the regulation has an effect on the northern pike size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing is popular year around on Big Mantrap.  Black crappie were abundant and sampled in high numbers for all gear types.  While black crappie numbers were high, the number of larger crappie (over 10 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Starting in the spring of 2006, a 10-inch minimum size length limit and a possession limit of 5 crappie was implemented.  At this point, it is too early to tell if black crappie abundance or size has changed significantly. <br> \n <br> \nBig Mantrap has an abundant bluegill and pumpkinseed population, however, size tends to run small.  The number of bluegill and pumpkinseed over 7 inches is low.  Big Mantrap also supports a moderate largemouth bass population.  Good largemouth bass habitat is found in the \"north arm\" around the islands and bays.  Smallmouth bass are also present in low numbers and tend to be found in the \"main lake\" basin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mantrap Lake (Big Mantrap) is located in central Hubbard County, two miles east of Emmaville. Mantrap Lake is 1,618 acres with a maximum depth of 68 feet.  There are two state owned public accesses on Mantrap.  The main access is located on the south side of the west basin and has two concrete ramps.  The second is located on the south end of the north arm, with a shallow and soft earthen ramp.  Mantrap provides angling opportunities for Muskellunge, Northern Pike and Black Crappies. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Mantrap Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Belle Taine, Little Mantrap, and Spider Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskies are a very popular fish in Mantrap but are not well sampled with normal gear types.  Special spring sampling has taken place in recent years and has shown the population is very good with the biggest fish reaching 52 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a special regulation for Northern Pike on Mantrap Lake.  All pike 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released, with a possession limit of three, and only one over 36 inches.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike with an average size of 24 inches and 3.4 lbs.  Northern Pike were sampled in good numbers up to 35 inches long, with most fish ranging from 19-28 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMantrap is a popular lake for panfish, especially for Black Crappies.  There is a special regulation for crappie of a five fish possession limit.  Black Crappies were sampled in all sizes from 5 to 13 inches, with the majority being 8-9 inches.  Most Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were from 3-8 inches, with no fish exceeding 9 inches. <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil has been identified in Mantrap. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mantrap Lake, as well as all lakes in the Mantrap chain, were native muskie lakes and along with the largemouth bass were the only predator species present.  No northern pike were sampled in a 1938 lake survey and during the 1959 lake survey the muskie was not sampled.  Shoepac muskies were stocked in Mantrap Lake starting in 1959 until 1983.  Wisconsin strain muskies were stocked in 1987 with Leech Lake strain muskies being stocked since 1988.  Mantrap Lake was used as a muskie egg source from 1966 to 1984 with some of these muskies used in stocking Mantrap Lake.  Muskie population has been subjected to various minimum harvest size regulations from 30 to 36 and now to 40 inches.  The average size of adult muskies sampled in spring trapnetting has increased with the increase of minimum legal harvest size, along with the decrease in stocking rates and the change in muskie strain.  The present muskellunge gillnet abundance of 0.4 per set has been stable for the past three population assessments going back to 1988.  Their mean weight in 1994 was 5.4 pounds compared to 5.8 pounds in 1991 and has increased from the previous high of 3.9 pounds in 1988.  Only six walleyes were sampled during 1994, but this was more than all other surveys combined.  They ranged in size from 24.1 to 26.7 inches and had an average weight of 5.4 pounds.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 6.7 per set was slightly higher than the 1991 and 1988 assessments.  Their average size was 24.2 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass have not been sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance or size structure.  However, this small sample is consistent with previous recent surveys.  Black crappies have been well sampled by gillnets and trapnets and appear to have a stable high population with about 50% eight inches or more.  Bluegill trapnet catches are high exceeding the third quartile for the 1994 and 1991 surveys.  Their size structure is small at 7.4 inches or less.  Yellow perch are abundant and provide an excellent forage base for the predator species.  Their size structure is small with only 18% exceeding 8.0 inches and none more than 9.3 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mantrap Lake is a 1,618 acre lake located near Emmaville, MN that has over 26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 68 feet.  There are two Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public accesses, one is located on the south side of the west basin and the other one is located on the south end of the north Arm.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Mantrap Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area are Belle Taine, Little Mantrap, and Spider Lakes.      <br> \n <br> \nBig Mantrap is known as an excellent muskellunge lake.  Big Mantrap is stocked with Leech lake strain of muskellunge during even-numbered years with 750 fingerlings, which has resulted in a shift of larger sizes of muskellunge.  No sampling was conducted in 2012 to target muskellunge; however, special sampling will be done in 2013.        <br> \n <br> \nBig Mantrap supports an excellent northern pike fishery.  Currently, there is a special length limit for northern pike which means all northern pike between 24 to 36 inches have to be released.  This regulation was implemented in 2003.  The average length of fish sampled was 24 inches but fish up to 35 inches were caught.       <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population seems to be abundant in Big Mantrap; however, the size consists of smaller fish.  In 2006, a special regulation (minimum size of 10 inches and bag limit of 5) was implemented to see if the size structure can be shifted to larger fish.  It is still early to see if the size structure has responded to this special regulation.     <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Mantrap Lake, but the banded mystery snail are present which is an exotic.  Aquatic invasive species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",
