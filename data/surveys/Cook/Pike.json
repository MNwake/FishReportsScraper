Smallmouth bass growth rates had been about average for the area; five-year-old fish had a mean length of 11.5 inches at the end of their fifth year.Northern pike were also abundant and above-average in size.  Northern pike had been rare in this lake prior to 1999, but the species now appears to have become well-established.  Several year classes were present in 2002, indicating reproductive success had been good.  Northern pike growth had been fast, thanks to forage provided by a dense population of small lake whitefish.  Northern pike as large as 44 inches were collected, but most were between 22 and 30 inches in length.One muskellunge was taken in 2002 (42 inches, 23.3 lb).  Muskellunge have only rarely been taken in assessments in this lake.  They were last stocked in 1977, and it appeared that the fish taken in 2002 had been produced naturally.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 30.1 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.3?C (46.9?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for both species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Whitefish and Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1969 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike population is apparently a \"booming\" population, as only one fish captured during any other DNR assessment of this lake has been identified as a northern pike (1989).Anglers report catching muskellunge as recently as 1998, and muskellunge fry were stocked in 1977, but only one fish captured during any DNR assessment has been identified as a muskellunge.    East Pike Lake is within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and angling pressure is probably fairly light.</p>",
