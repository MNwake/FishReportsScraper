                "narrative": "<p>Round lake is a small and relatively shallow lake.  Water clarity is poor during summer months andaquatic vegetation is limited.  These conditions provide only marginal habitat for most gamefish. Northern pike are abundant in Round Lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 14.7 fish/net which exceeds thenormal range of mean catch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (2.3 -9.2 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches ranged from 5.5 - 7.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to1979.  Average weight of fish captured was 2.2 pounds.  Approximately 50% of the fish captured werebetween 21 and 28 inches in length.  Cohorts of the 1990 and 1991 year classes (ages 3 and 4) comprised70% of the fish captured in 1994.  In contrast, most lakes in the Glenwood Management Area experiencedpoor reproductive success due to low water levels during these years.   Electrofishing yielded 12.0largemouth bass per hour in 1994.  The length frequency distribution of captured fish was skewedtowards larger length groups.  Seventy percent of the fish captured were 12 inches or greater in lengthand 30% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.6 pounds.  Age class distribution andsize structure of captured fish suggests erratic natural reproduction and/or recruitment.  Panfishpopulations are limited in Round Lake.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.2 bluegill/net and 0.2 pumpkinseedsunfish/net.  Black crappie were not captured in either trapnets or gillnets.  Catch rates for thesespecies are below the respective normal ranges of mean catch rates for similar lakes.  Bluegill andblack crappie were relatively abundant in previous years.  Trapnet catches averaged 23.0 and 74.7bluegill/net in 1984 and 1979, respectively.  Black crappie catches averaged 36.5 and 32.3 fish/trapnetin 1984 and 1979.  Observations recorded in previous lake survey reports do not indicate anysignificant changes in water quality or habitat that would explain the demise of bluegill and blackcrappie populations.  Winterkill was suspected during the winter of 1988-89, however there was nodocumentation of critical dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months.  Other species capturedin survey nets included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, white sucker, common carp, bowfin, greensunfish, and yellow perch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 66-acre shallow, fertile lake located six miles north of Holmes City.  Two-wheel drivevehicles towing large boats may have problems with the sandy public access.  Round Lake receives mostof it's fishing pressure on windy days when anglers get blown off larger lakes in the area.    Round lake has a history of poor water clarity and degraded aquatic habitat.  Turbid water limits theabundance and diversity of aquatic plants that are vital to healthy fish communities.  Water qualitymeasurements indicate that phosphorus driven algal blooms may not be solely responsible for the turbidwater conditions.  Suspended silt and clay may be an important factor in reducing water clarity.Anglers normally target northern pike on Round Lake.  Northern pike were very abundant in 1999, themajority of fish being two and three years old and averaging 19 inches in length.  The largest fishsampled was over 29 inches.  This lake would be a great place to introduce kids to trolling during openwater or tip ups in the winter.  Round Lake can provide quality black crappie fishing in early spring.  Anglers fish from shore alongState Hwy 27 to the west of the public access.  Black crappie were abundant in 1999, however averagesize of the fish was small.  Several year classes are present and size structure should improve in thenext few years.   Bluegill are present in moderate numbers.  However, the fish are relatively small andslow growing.  Most of the fish were between 4.0 and 6.5 inches in length.Largemouth bass are also present in good numbers, yet average size is small.  Size structure of thelargemouth bass population should improve in the near future.  Most of the fish were ages one and two,and are experiencing good growth rates.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 75-acre, shallow lake located south of Garfield and Lobster Lake.  Water quality and fish habitat conditions have been poor, but recent survey statistics depict improvements in water clarity and aquatic vegetation diversity and coverage.  Habitat changes are conducive to expansion of largemouth bass and other members of the sunfish family.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass have become moderately abundant.   Growth has slowed as population density and competition for available prey have increased.  Average size of bass captures was 11.7 inches.  The largest bass measured 19.5 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie catches have moderated in response to irregular annual recruitment of young fish into the fishery and increased exposure to predation by largemouth bass.   Bluegill averaged 6.0 inches in length.   Only four of 72 bluegill caught were 8.0 inches or larger.   Crappie fishing quality, in terms of catch rates and size, has been inconsistent and dependent upon addition of periodic strong age classes.   Age distribution of the 2009 crappie catch indicates a strong year class was established in 2007.  Cohorts of this age group comprised more than half of all captures.  Lengths of crappie catches ranged from 7.2 to 10.9 inches.  Nineteen percent of crappie measured exceeded 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are not abundant, but the population can provide good fishing.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.7 pike/net.   Mean length of sampled fish was 23.4 inches.  The largest pike measured was 31.6 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Catch rate values recorded in earlier surveys ranged from 4.0 fish/gill net in 1966 to 7.0 fish/gill net in 1984. Although relative abundance has remained stable, size structure has improved. PSD increased to 82.0 percent. PSD ranged from 9.0 to 57.0 percent in previous assessments. Mean size of the Northern Pike captured was 3.62 lbs. Growth of Northern Pike is slow. Age 6 pike average 27.2 inches in total length. Northern Pike in Round Lake appear to be long-lived considering the small size and depth of the lake. Bluegill trap net indices have decreased from 74.67 fish/net in 1979 to 0.50 fish/net in 1989. This decrease in relative abundance may be due to the water clarity during the assessment. Prior surveys indicated abundant, slow growing, Black Crappie populations. There are no records of Walleye in Round Lake. Electrofishing gear was used to sample the Largemouth Bass population. Only one Largemouth Bass was captured in 45 minutes of effort. Black and Yellow Bullhead were too small to have commercial value.</p>",

This was the first targeted spring panfish survey on Round Lake and will be used as a baseline to evaluate the effects of the new Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI) regulation.  On March 1, 2022, a special regulation was implemented that reduced the daily limit of sunfish from 20 to 5.  The goal of the new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey also offered the opportunity to sample larger Black Crappie, which can be difficult to sample in standard summer surveys.\n\nRound Lake supports a quality Bluegill and Black Crappie fishery.  Survey results suggest both populations exhibited moderate abundance and good size structure.  Almost 36% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 8 inches and almost 35% of Black Crappie sampled exceeded 10 inches.  The largest fish measured was just over 9 inches for Bluegill and just over 13 inches for Black Crappie.\n\nPanfish anglers fishing Round Lake are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of this fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundance smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help maintain fish community balance as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a small, fertile basin located about 8 miles southwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Round Lake has a history of poor water quality, degraded aquatic habitat, and a highly variable fish community.  Recent lake surveys and field observations suggest improving water clarity, an increase in the abundance of aquatic vegetation, and a shift to a fish community dominated by bass and panfish.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie were all relatively abundant and reached sizes that would be acceptable to most anglers.  Most of the largemouth bass sampled with electrofishing were between 12 and 16 inches in total length.   About one-half of the bluegill captured in trap nets were 6.0 inches in length or greater and a few exceeded 8.0 inches.  Black crappie ranged from 4.0 to 13.5 inches in total length and about one-half exceeded 8.0 inches in length.Northern pike numbers have decreased in recent years.  Gill net catches averaged only 5.3 fish/net in 2004, compared to 29.3 fish/net in 1999 and 14.3 fish/net in 1994.  Fish ranged from 20.2 to 25.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight was 2.2 pounds.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is an 81-acre, shallow basin located in central Douglas County north of Holmes City.  Maximum depth is 30.0 feet.   A small, unimproved public access with limited parking is located on the south shoreline off County Highway 27.  This shallow, earthen access does not have a dock and is best suited for smaller watercraft. <br> \n  <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed during early June 2019 to assess the fish community of Round Lake.  Survey methodology included electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  Survey results were indicative of a relatively simple bass-panfish fishery found in small, vegetated basins in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were abundant and catches were largely comprised of small- to medium-size fish.  Bluegill and Black Crappie were moderately abundant.  Size structure of both populations has improved in recent years.  Mean length of Bluegill captures was 6.5 inches.  The largest Bluegill captured measured 9.3 inches.  Mean length of crappie captures was 9.8 inches, but length distribution extended to 12.9 inches.  Yellow Perch were also present but this population is extremely limited and is typically not targeted by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during the 2019 survey include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  Muskellunge have never been sampled in Round Lake during standard DNR surveys but anecdotal angler reports suggest they may be present.  This species likely emigrated from Lobster Lake, a connected basin that is stocked with Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nThe next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2029.  Anglers are reminded that new statewide Northern Pike harvest regulations were implemented in 2018.  Round Lake is located within the North-central Zone where anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Round Lake is supporting a surplus of harvestable-size pike.  Greater harvest of small pike may help improve size structure of this population.  Round Lake is also designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil, which was first confirmed in 2013.  Dense mats of this invasive plant were evident throughout this basin during the 2019 survey.  For more information regarding this invasive species in Minnesota see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquaticplants/milfoil/index.html  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
