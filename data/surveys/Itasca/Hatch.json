                "narrative": "<p>The 1992 Hatch Lake management plan lists smallmouth bass as the primary species for management with walleye and northern pike as secondary species.Smallmouth bass were first sampled with spring nighttime electrofishing on Hatch Lake in 1993, for a catch rate of 18.8 per hour on-time.  The 2000 catch rate of 51.5 per hour on-time was much higher and is considered to represent a dense population.  Size structure was also excellent, with a PSD (11 inches) of 86, a RSD-P (14 inches) of 51, and a RSD-M (17 inches) of 9.  Growth rates were below statewide averages for ages 1-6 (>15% below for ages 2, 5, and 6).  The oldest individual was 18.6 inches and 13 years old.Largemouth bass were first sampled with spring nighttime electrofishing in 1993, for a catch rate of 1.5 per hour on-time.  The 2000 catch rate of 29.5 per hour on-time was much higher and is considered to represent a fairly dense population.  However, size structure was extremely poor, with a PSD (12 inches) of 7 and a RSD-P (15 inches) of 0.  Growth rates were similar to statewide averages.  The largest individual was 13.4 inches and 5 years old.Northern pike catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 1.0 to 8.0 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 4.5 per gill net was about average, and the mean weight of 2.9 pounds was the highest on record.  Size structure was fair, with a PSD (21 inches) of 58 and RSD-P (28 inches) of 12.  Growth rates were similar to statewide averages.  The largest individual was 34.5 inches and 8 years old.Walleye catch rates have been low during all historical assessments, ranging from 0.3 to 2.2 per gill net. The 2000 catch rate of 0.3 per gill net was the lowest on record, as was the mean weight of 2.8 pounds (which is still high).  Only two walleye were sampled, measuring 18.9 inches and 21.5 inches.  Growth rates for these two fish (which may have been immigrants from Turtle Lake) were good. Bluegill catch rates during historical assessment have ranged from 1.0 to 17.1 per trap net, and those for pumpkinseed have ranged from 0 to 2.5 per trap net.  The 2000 bluegill catch rate of 17.1 per trap net was the highest on record, and the 2000 pumpkinseed catch rate of 2.3 per trap net was nearly so.  Bluegill size structure was poor, with a PSD (6 inches) of 36 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 1, and pumpkinseed size structure was poorer still, with a PSD (6 inches) of 14 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 0.Shoreline owners can directly help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by following lakeshore development best management practices, such as maintaining or upgrading septic systems, minimizing nutrient inputs from fertilizer use, and leaving aquatic vegetation and terrestrial vegetation within at least 50 feet of the shoreline intact or restoring such vegetation to its native state.  Poorly-maintained septic systems and fertilizers contribute excess nutrients and bacteria to the lake, and removal of upland and aquatic vegetation can cause additional ecological problems.  Symptoms of impaired water quality can include increases in winter kills, summer kills, algae, aquatic plants, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Conversely, a fully natural (not mowed grass) vegetated shoreline provides cover for young and adult fish, removal of nutrients before they reach the lake, reduced erosion, food for invertebrates, and food and habitat for other wildlife.

                "narrative": "<p>Hatch Lake is a 243-acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Marcell, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 88 feet and 49 littoral acres.  Hatch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 23.  These are relatively deep, medium-sized lakes with clear water.  Other area lakes in Class 23 include Big Too Much, LaCroix and Ruby Lakes.  The lake management plan lists Smallmouth Bass and Northern Pike as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was used to sample Smallmouth Bass since this method is often more effective than standard test netting.  The 2013 catch rate was 54.2 fish/hour of on-time.  This is a relatively high catch rate indicating a strong bass population.  Similar sampling in 2000 yielded a catch rate of 51.5/hour.  Size structure was good; electrofished Smallmouth Bass in 2013 ranged from 5.6 to 19.6 inches with a mean length of 14.9 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent with fish up to age 18 estimated from scales and otoliths.  Growth was average with fish reaching 15.3 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for Northern Pike was 3.5/net.  This catch is within the lake class expected range but lower than other recent assessments.  Size structure was moderate, with a few fish over 28 inches in the sample.  Northern Pike ranged from 17.5 to 38.2 inches with a mean length of 23.1 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 and 12 were represented in the sample.  Growth appeared similar to the statewide average, with fish reaching 26.3 inches at age 6.    <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most abundant species in the gill nets, sampled at 22.0/net.  This catch is above the lake class expected range and higher than any previous survey.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 7.7 to 17.7 inches, with a mean length of 12.5 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species for larger gamefish like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for Lake Whitefish was within the expected range 1.8/net.  This is similar to the catch rate in the 2000 assessment and the historical average for the lake (1.7).  Sampled fish ranged from 15.2 to 22.8 inches with a mean length of 19.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most numerous fish in the trap nets with a catch rate of 3.4/net.  This is below the lake class average and considerably lower than the 2000 catch rate of 17.1/trap net.  Size structure was poor; sampled fish ranged from 3.0 to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 5.0 inches.  Age structure showed a high proportion of young fish, with a dominant 2010 (age 3) year class.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with Bluegill reaching 6.4 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Black Crappie, Bowfin, Common Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike abundance is high at 7.6/gillnet, but still falls within the first and third quartile (2.3-8.3) for Schupp's lake class #23.  Mean size of northern pike is good, indicated by a gill net proporational stock density (PSD) of 61.  A wide range of ages were sampled, indicating there is adequate reproduction most years; age II-VII represented.  Age III comprised 41% of the gill net sample.  Growth approximates the statewide average; age II-15.6\", III-18.9\", IV-20.5\", V-24.0\", VI-24.6\", VII-28.8\".Tullibee are abundant, evidenced by a gill net CPUE of 10.2, which is almost double the lake class #23 median of 5.8.  This is still within the first and third quartile (1.3-13.85) for lake class #23 however.  Maintaining a healthy tullibee population as forage is important in this lake, because of the low yellow perch abundance; 0/gillnet, 1.5/trapnet.  Length-frequency distribution of tullibee showed that a wide variety of sizes were sampled; (modes at 7\" and 12-13\").Smallmouth bass were sampled in typically low numbers, but the gill net CPUE of 1.2 is greater than the third quartile (1.0) for lake class #23.  The sample (n=6) was comprised of large individuals, 5 of 6 fish were >16\"; PSD=83.  Most fish were VII-IX years old.  Smallmouth bass were also sampled while shoreline seining.The bluegill trap net CPUE was 13.0, which is below the lake class median of 17.2, but still within the first and third quartiles (9.8-38.7).  There has been a substantial increase in bluegill abundance compared to historical trapnet CPUE's; 1973-2.0, 1978-2.2, 1983-1.0, and 1991 up to 13.0.  Most bluegills sampled were small sized; the length-frequency distribution mode was 3.5\".  The proportional stock density is only 8.  Growth is slow, age II-2.4\" (n=9), III-3.6\" (n=14), IV-5.0\" (n=4).Walleye were sampled in low numbers.  The gillnet CPUE was 0.4, which is considerably below the statewide average of 3.6, and below the first quartile (0.89) for lake class #23.  The two walleye sampled were large individuals, 22\" and 28\".  The gillnetcatch has dropped from past assessments, which have averaged around 1.5-2.0/lift.  Hatch Lake is locally known as a trophy walleye lake; this and past assessments have reflected this with large fish sampled in each assessment.Other fish species sampled include largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, lake whitefish, white sucker, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.</p>",
