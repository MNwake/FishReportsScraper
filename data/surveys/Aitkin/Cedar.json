The trap net indices for carp and rock bass were below the respective lake class 39 first quartiles. Northern pike sampled ranged from one to three years of age with a strong year class in 1989. The growth rate for the first increment was faster than normal. Bluegill sampled ranged from one to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989. The growth rate for the second increment was slower than normal. Black crappie sampled ranged from one to three years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989. The growth rates for the second and third increments were slower than normal. These fish may have been stocked, however, and may not be an indicator of growth in this lake. Indications are that Cedar Lake had at least a partial winterkill in the winter of 1988-89. A local resident commented that fish (primarily bluegill and black crappie) were reintroduced during the summer of 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a moderately fertile 232 acre lake located in south central Aitkin County just east of Mille Lacs Lake.  Because a public access is currently not available, anglers will have to gain access through private land owners.  The shoreline surrounding the lake is minimally developed with most of the shoreline composed of undeveloped forest or woodland, marshland, and grassland.  The surrounding watershed is characterized by the following land uses listed in order of abundance: undeveloped forest or woodland, bogs, rural residential development, marshland, and grassland.  Since shallow water depths are characteristic of this basin along with good fertility, this type of lake may experience low oxygen levels during the winter season which can cause partial or complete fish winterkills.  According to historical DNR Fisheries surveys, known fish winterkills occurred in 1978/79 and 1988/89.  Since 1993, the Cedar Lake Association has operated an aeration system as an effort to prevent or reduce winterkill.  Due to the varying intensities of winterkill and the unknown effectiveness of the current aeration system, small partial winterkills may go undetected.  Hence, the fish community in Cedar Lake may be subject to consistent change and periodically dominated by an abundance of low oxygen tolerant species such as bullhead.  Currently, Cedar Lake is managed for black crappie and bluegill sunfish with northern pike as the secondary management species.During the open water season of 2001, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the present status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  The evaluation of the fishery used gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data also collected based on these guidelines.  Bluegill sunfish and black crappie numbers were found at normal levels for lakes of this type, but their sizes were small.  Northern pike abundance was found at a normal level along with the average weight, at 2.5 pounds.  Measured northern pike ranged from 17.3 to 27.5 inches with an average length of 22.8 inches.  Walleye were first sampled in Cedar Lake in 1992 which was before any type of walleye stocking took place.  These fish most likely originated in Mille Lacs Lake and entered Cedar lake via Cedar Creek during spring high water levels.  Since the DNR does not stock walleye in lakes without a public access, the Cedar Lake Association began walleye stocking in 1993 after obtaining a permit from DNR Fisheries.  A total of 1,200 walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1993 and 350,000 walleye fry in 2000.  During the 2001 survey, four walleye from the 1993 year class were sampled with their lengths ranging from 18.9 to 21.9 inches.  Five largemouth bass that ranged from 5.5 to 18.4 inches were captured in gill and trap nets.  Since the sampling methods utilized are not the most effective for sampling largemouth bass, the sampled fish probably do not adequately represent the true population.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were found in low numbers.  The sampled fish community also included black and brown bullhead, dog fish, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  When compared to similar lakes, black and brown bullhead, dog fish, common carp, and pumpkinseed sunfish were within a normal abundance range.An angler fishing Cedar Lake may encounter a nice sized northern pike, an occasional nice walleye or largemouth bass, an abundance of small sunfish, or a fair number of smaller crappie.  Since Cedar Lake is a moderately fertile lake and land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can improve or maintain water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline. </p>",
