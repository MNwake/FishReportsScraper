                "narrative": "<p>Bowen Lake is 176-acres with a maximum depth of 25 feet and 49 acres less than 15 feet (littoral acres) located about one mile southeast of Backus, Minnesota. Bowen Lake is on the Pine River a state Water Trail Canoe Route. There is a Minnesota DNR-owned public access on the south shore about a half mile east of State Highway 371. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Bowen Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally clear, moderately productive, and moderately deep.  Other local waters in this classification include Child, Widow, and Five Point Lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie, with secondary management species being Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Perch, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant and averaged 22 inches long. Most Northern Pike were 18 to 26 inches in length with fish up to 31 inches sampled. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant Northern Pike less than 22 inches in this lake. Largemouth Bass abundance is generally low with only one 16-inch fish sampled. Bluegill abundance is moderate with several quality-sized and large fish present. Black Crappie abundance was moderate with lengths ranging from 4 to 13 inches. Yellow Perch are less abundant than the historical average; sizes are generally small with few fish 8 inches or longer sampled. Walleye abundance was below the management goal of four fish per gillnet despite fry stocking during odd-numbered years. Lengths ranged from 11-23 inches with an average length of 17 inches. The majority of the sample was comprised by the 2015 year class which averaged 15 inches long. Other species found in 2019 were Bowfin (Dogfish), Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Brown Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently there are no aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Bowen Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowen Lake is a 176-acre lake located near Backus, MN that has 2.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the south shore off of Highway 371.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Bowen Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and cisco.      Northern pike are abundant in Bowen Lake.  The mean length and weight for northern pike sampled were 22 inches and 2.3 pounds and fish up to 27 inches were sampled.  Few largemouth bass were sampled in Bowen lake, however bass up to 18 inches were present.  Bowen Lake supports a good self sustaining walleye population.  The walleye mean length and weight are 17 inches and 2.2 pounds and fish up to 26 inches were sampled.  The two most abundant year-classes are 1995 and 2001 year-classes, which will provide some fishing opportunities on Bowen Lake.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, cisco, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Bowen Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Bowen Lake on July 10, 2019 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) program staff.  Sampling methods targeted nearshore, small-bodied fish and included seining and backpack electrofishing. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, with three sites surveyed from the boat due to deep water and soft substrate.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and a substantial community of wild rice and soft substrates prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted survey is combined with data from a standard gill net and trap net survey conducted during the same week to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. Fish community diversity and composition metrics can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Bowen Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore and littoral fish community, as well as coldwater habitat, in Bowen Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 23-24 August 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with three sites sampled from the boat due to deep water and dense wild rice and lilies. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four sites, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 23-24 August 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Eight trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types. Yellow Perch and Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and White Sucker, Bluegill, and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was near but above the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 6.1 inches, with 37% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Bowen Lake on August 8th, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 19 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 12.2 feet, which was above the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 22.2?C (72.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nA TDO3 value warmer than 21.5?C indicates that oxythermal conditions are stressful for Cisco. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) near the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would limit Cisco distribution within the water column. Data collected in 1967 further indicates poor oxythermal habitat. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the warmwater fish community in Bowen Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. However, the TDO3 value indicated coldwater habitat conditions were stressful and not favorable to support Cisco at the time of the survey. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community, and the coldwater habitat, to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

THE PERCENTAGE OF QUALITY SIZE BLG (7 INCHES AND LARGER) SAMPLED IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN DURING THE 1967  - 6% COMPARED TO 70%.  THE NUMBER OF LMB AND BLC SAMPLED WAS LOW, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE SAMPLING GEAR USED AND THE TIME OF YEAR. THE BLC SAMPLED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 10 TO 12 INCHES.  THE YEP POPULATION APPEARS TO BE VERY HIGH.  THE 1988 GILLNET CATCH WAS 117 COMPARED TO 160 DURING 1967.  THE WAE GILLNET CATCH OF 6.0/GN IS HIGH FOR A LAKE SUCH AS BOWEN.

                "narrative": "<p>Bowen Lake is a 176-acre lake located about one mile southeast of Backus, Minnesota. There is a Minnesota DNR-owned public access on the south shore about 0.5 miles east of State Highway 371. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Bowen Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally clear, moderately productive, and moderately deep.  Other local waters in this classification include Child, Widow, and Five Point Lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie, with secondary management species being Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Perch, and Walleye. <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Bowen Lake.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in 2014 was about 21 inches; however fish up to almost 34 inches were present. Few Largemouth Bass were sampled in DNR test nets in 2014, though fish over 18 inches were found.  The number of Bluegill and Black Crappie sampled was low compared to previous surveys and compared to other area lakes in this Class.  The average size of Bluegill was almost 7 inches, and the average Black Crappie was just under 11 inches.  The number of Walleye sampled in Bowen Lake compared favorably with other Lake Class 31 waters.  Sizes ranged from 8 to 20 inches with the mean length being 13 inches. The number of Yellow Perch found in 2014 was similar to other lakes in Lake Class 31, however most fish sampled were relatively small.  Tullibee (Cisco) abundance in Bowen Lake was comparable to other Lake Class 31 waters, and Tullibee from 6 to 20 inches were present.  Both Yellow Perch and Tullibee provide an important food source for Northern Pike and Walleye.  <br> \nOther species found in Bowen Lake in 2014 were Bowfin, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently there are no aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Bowen Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowen Lake is a moderately shallow lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake bottom along the shoreline iscomprised of sand and marl.  Within the lake there is an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.Bowen Lake has an abundant walleye population when compared to other similar area lakes.  Sampled walleye rangedin length from 8 - 24 inches with an average length of 15 inches.  The 1991 year class was the strongest yearclass present and should provide excellent angling opportunities in upcoming years.Northern pike were found to exist in numbers typical of lakes similar to Bowen.  These northern pike were smallhaving an average length of 18 inches.Yellow perch are quite abundant and are usually 6 - 7 inches long and along with white suckers and cisco providean excellent food source for larger predator fish such as walleye and northern pike.The abundance of bluegill has changed little over the years in Bowen Lake and is typical of other similar arealakes.  The average size has declined although some quality size (> 7 inches) bluegill still remain.  Regulationscontrolling the number of large bluegill harvested may help maintain and/or improve the quality of bluegill inBowen Lake.A small sample of largemouth bass was capture during spring electrofishing.  These bass showed excellent size withover 33 percent of the bass measuring more than 15 inches long.To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on Bowen Lake, lake shore residents and other users of the lakeshould protect fish habitat by preserving natural shoreline, aquatic vegetation, and lake bottom.  Lake shoreresidents can also help preserve Bowen's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintainedseptic system; by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer stripof natural vegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing \"Catch andRelease\" of larger fish including panfish.</p>",
