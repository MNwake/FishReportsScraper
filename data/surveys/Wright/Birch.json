                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance was high compared to the local medians. Lengths ranged from 14 to 31 inches with a median length of 19 inches. Age 3 and 4 fish dominated the catch. Females were six times as abundant as males and showed good growth at early ages but slow growth at age 4 and older. The Walleye catch remained below the statewide median. Three Walleyes aged 5 to 7 were caught and may represent limited natural reproduction following the 1979 fingerling stocking. Adult and young of year Largemouth Bass were captured in shoreline seining. Young of year Largemouth Bass averaged 2.0 inches in length and ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 inches in late August. \n\nBluegill abundance was similar to 1983 and remained slightly below the local median. Gill net and trap net catches of Bluegill were similarly below the local median. Gill net and trap net catches of Bluegill were similar to each other in 1983 and in 1989. Bluegills in 1983 ranged in length from 3 to 5 inches with a median length increment of 3.5-3.9 inches. In 1989, Bluegills ranged from 2.5 to 7.4 inches in length with a 5.0-5.4 inch median length increment. Moderate numbers of young-of-year Bluegills were collected in the shoreline seine. Black Crappie catch increased from 1983 but remained below the local median. All sampled Black Crappies were 8-10 inches in length, indicating possible year class failures. Two young-of-year Yellow Perch were collected in shoreline seining. \n\nSeveral minnow species were also taken in low numbers. Bowfin abundance was about average for the area. Yellow Bullheads ranging from 7 to 12 inches in length were captured at 9.7/trap net, a rate well above the local median. Black and Brown Bullheads from 8 to 12 inches in length were taken in gill nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 76 acre lake located in north central Wright County with a maximum depth of 52 feet.  Dissolved oxygen was present to 17 feet in mid-July.  The secchi depth was 11.0 feet.  The aquatic plant community was diverse with 17 submersed species, some of which grew to a depth of 18 feet.  Northern milfoil, flatstem pondweed, Elodea and coontail were common or abundant.  The lake is managed for naturally occurring species.   <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first survey since 1989. <br> \n <br> \nEighty largemouth bass were taken in slightly less than one hour of electrofishing during the evening of 5/4/09.  The catch rate of 82.4 fish per hour was greater than average for Wright County lakes.  Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller sized largemouth.    Largemouth bass grew slowly so it is important to release a portion of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant and the catch was above the normal range for lakes like Birch Lake.  Birch Lake fits a recognizable pattern, i.e. a clear-water lake with abundant vegetation where small northern pike, largemouth bass and sunfish are abundant and perch and crappies are not.   Anglers can expect good fishing for small northern pike which will average 18 inches and about one and a half pounds.  Northern pike growth was similar to statewide averages.  Female northern pike reached 23 inches in four years, whereas males reached 21.5 inches in the same length of time.  Two percent of northern pike were longer than 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of bluegill was similar to 1989 and within the range of expected values.  Bluegill ranged from 4 to 7 inches and averaged 0.12 pounds.  Growth was slower than statewide averages.  Bluegill grew to length of six inches in seven years. <br> \n <br> \nNo black crappies were taken in trap nets.  Gill net catches were low continuing a pattern since 1983.  Black crappie grew at a rate close to the statewide average and grew to a length of eight inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were collected by any gear.  Blacknose shiners and banded killifish, sensitive species, were sampled by shoreline seining. Other fish collected in 2009 were black, brown and yellow bullheads, common carp, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

Walleye are present in low numbers (0.5/gill net). Only one Walleye from the 1979 stocking was collected. The population of Largemouth Bass (1.2/gill net) appears to be about average. Ages 0, 3, 5 and v6 were sampled. Bluegill abundance (23.2/trap net) has declined from the 1972 survey (45.7/trap net) but is about average compared to the local median. Ages 3-4 were sampled and growth is very slow. Black Crappie numbers (0.5/trap net) are lower than in 1972 (4.3/trap net). Growth appears to be about average. Three bullhead species were collected. Black Bullhead abundance (7/gill net) has declined since 1972 (85/gill net). Brown and Yellow Bullheads are also present. Almost all of the bullheads collected were greater than 7 inches in length.</p>",
