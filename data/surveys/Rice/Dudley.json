                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Kelly & Dudley Lake was conducted on June 15, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Abundant water lilies and emergent vegetation limited sampling at some stations. Backpack electrofishing was completed at nine sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Kelly-Dudley Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Cannon River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A minimum size limit of 30 inches (limit 1 fish) for northern pike was placed on Kelly-Dudley, Reeds, and St. Olaf lakes in 1998 to determine if preventing angler harvest of fish less than 30 inches could increase the number of large northern pike by reducing mortality of pike less than the minimum size limit.  At this time, Kelly-Dudley supports viable population of northern pike comprised of a moderate proportion of older, quality-sized individuals.  The population contains a strong spawning stock and reproduction and recruitment appear to be good.  Northern pike are relatively abundant and the population is likely at or near the carry capacity for this species.  The implementation of the 30-inch minimum size limit appears to have contributed to a fishery for quality-sized pike.  Slow growth and the inability to frequently produce pike of preferred size is greatest limit to the fishery potential of pike in Kelly-Dudley. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nKelly-Dudley supports an extremely high bluegill density with poor size distribution characteristic of a stunted population.  Although the high numbers provide good angling opportunity, the lack of quality-sized individuals limits the fishery potential of this species.  Black crappie occurred in low density and were generally small in size.  Although only one largemouth bass was sampled during the survey the lake is known to be popular with bass anglers, providing good recreational opportunity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nKelly & Dudley Lake is a small (128 acre) lake located approximately 2 miles east of the town of Shieldsville in Rice County. It has a maximum depth of 60 feet, with approximately 66% of the lake classified as littoral area. Kelly & Dudley Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie. The management plan includes no stocking of any kind. Kelly & Dudley Lake was surveyed the week of June 6, 2016 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 5 gill nets and 11 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 483 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 43.9/net, which represents the lowest catch rate since 1993. Since 1986, catch rates have varied from 14.3/net in 1988 to 203.0/net in 2006 with an average of 84.2/net. In 2016, lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. An additional 93 Bluegills ranging from 4.1 to 7.3 inches long were sampled with gill nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 11 years old with 9 year-classes present. Approximately 56% were 5 and 7 year old fish. On average, fish did not exceed 6 inches until 6 years old, indicating poor growth relative to other area lakes. Overall, Bluegills in Kelly & Dudley Lake remained abundant and small in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nA total of 55 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 50.2/hour. This was only the second time using electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass in Kelly & Dudley Lake. The previous sample was conducted in 2007 where we caught 43.5/hour. Lengths in 2016 ranged from 3.0 to 20.1 inches with an average of 10.8 inches. Three additional fish ranging from 12.7 to 13.7 inches were sampled with gill and trap nets. Fish from all gears ranged from 1 to 11 years old with 11 year-classes present. Two and three year old fish comprised 44% of the sample. On average, fish did not exceed 12.0 inches until 6 years old, indicating moderate growth. In 2016, the Largemouth Bass population in Kelly & Dudley Lake remained stable and diverse, with memorable length fish (? 20.0 inches) present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nA total of 26 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.2/net, which represented the lowest catch rate since 1996. The highest catches on record were recorded in 2006 (10.7/net) during the experimental 30 inch minimum length regulation period and in 2011 (10.0/net) only 3 years after the regulation was discontinued. Before the regulation between 1986 and 1996 catch rates averaged just 4.9/net. Sizes were favorable and fish ranged from 2 to 12 years old with 9 year-classes present. On average, fish did not exceed 21.0 inches until 4 years old, indicating slow growth relative to other area lakes. Overall, in 2016 the Northern Pike population returned to pre-special regulation levels and was dominated by slow growing fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nJust 19 Black Crappies ranging from 6.9 to 12.0 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.8/net. Since 1986, Black Crappies have not been sampled at a high rate, averaging just 1.2/net over that time. Fish ranged from 2 to 9 years old with 8 year-classes present. On average, fish did not exceed 8.0 inches until 5 years old, indicating slow growth relative to other area lakes. Black Crappies remained a small but fishable member of the Kelly & Dudley Lake fish community. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nOnly 2 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4/net. Since 1986, catch rates have varied from 0/net in 1986, 1987, and 1996 to 2.8/net in 1993 with an average of 0.8/net. The absence of a viable Yellow Perch population remains a concern in the lake and is likely responsible for slow growing Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nBullhead Species <br> \nBoth Black and Yellow Bullheads were sampled lightly in 2016, with respective gill net catch rates of 0/net and 0.6/net.  This was consistent with catch rates since 1986, where Black Bullheads averaged just 0.2/net and Yellow Bullheads averaged 2.2/net. Although Bullheads can play a positive part in a fish community, high abundance of either species is usually considered undesirable. For that reason, the low catch rates of both species in Kelly & Dudley was considered favorable to fish management goals. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \nSince 1986, very few Common Carp have been sampled in Kelly & Dudley Lake. None were sampled in 2016, although some were observed during the boat electrofishing sample on May 5, 2016. Common Carp are nonnative and can negatively impact a lake in a number of ways. However, in 2016 they continued to maintain a low presence in the lake, limiting their impact. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2016 include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kelly & Dudley Lake is a 128-acre lake located approximately 2 miles east of the town of Shieldsville in Rice County. Kelly & Dudley Lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet, with approximately 66% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Kelly & Dudley Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie. The management plan includes no stocking of any kind. A special regulation protecting Northern Pike under 30 inches from harvest was enacted in 1998 but was rescinded in 2008 after results showed only marginal improvements in size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nKelly & Dudley Lake was surveyed the week of 7 June 2021 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 409 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 45.4/net which was between the lake-class median (24.6) and third quartile (59.6). Bluegills ranged from 3.5 to 9.3 inches with a mean of 6.8 inches. Size structure was good. Bluegills ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present. Approximately 78% of Bluegills sampled were 2 to 4 years old. On average, fish exceeded 6 inches by age 3, indicating good growth. Overall, Bluegills in Kelly & Dudley Lake were of high quality. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 27 Largemouth Bass were sampled with daytime boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 27.9/hour. Largemouth Bass were difficult to sample due to high water clarity. Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.8 to 12.6 inches with a mean of 9.1 inches. Seven additional Largemouth Bass, ranging from 5.3 to 13.2 inches, were sampled with gill and trap nets. Fish from all gears ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present. On average, Largemouth Bass did not exceed 12 inches age 4, indicating slow growth. In 2021, the Largemouth Bass population in Kelly & Dudley Lake appeared to be below quality size. However, because of difficult sampling conditions, only part of the population is likely represented. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 44 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 7.3/net. The highest catches on record were recorded in 2006 (10.7/net) during the experimental 30 inch minimum length regulation period. In 2021, Northern Pike ranged from 10.5 to 29.7 inches with an average of 21.0 inches. An additional 16 Northern Pike ranging from 12.2 to 19.5 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 10 years old with 8 year-classes present. On average, Northern Pike did not exceed 21 inches until age-4, indicating slow growth relative to other area lakes. Overall, in 2021 the Northern Pike population was dominated by small, slow growing fish. Kelly Dudley Lake is included in the Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are limited to 2 Northern Pike daily which must be at least 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, 41 Black Crappies ranging from 5.2 to 10.1 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 4.6/net which was below the lake-class median (5.0/net). Since 1986, Black Crappies have not been sampled at a high rate, averaging just 1.5/net over that time. Black Crappies from both gears ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present. On average, fish did not exceed 8.0 inches until after age 4, indicating slow growth relative to other area lakes. Black Crappies remained a small but fishable member of the Kelly & Dudley Lake fish community. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 35 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.8/net. Yellow Perch catch rates in 2021 were the highest since 1986. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 inches to 7.0 inches in length. The low numbers of Yellow Perch population remain a concern in the lake and are likely responsible for slow Northern Pike growth. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black Bullheads (11.2/net) and Yellow Bullheads (2.7/net) were sampled in 2021. This was the highest catch rate of Black Bullheads on record. Black Bullheads ranged from 6.4 to 9.5 inches in length. Four Brown Bullheads were also sampled in trap nets. Although bullheads have a niche in every lake, a presence in high numbers can be detrimental to the lake ecosystem. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1986, very few Common Carp have been sampled in Kelly & Dudley Lake. No Common Carp were sampled in 2021. Common Carp are nonnative and can negatively impact a lake in several ways.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kelly-Dudley Lake is a 128-acre lake located in Rice County near the City of Faribault.  Kelly-Dudley Lake is a small, deep and relatively clear lake that features a diverse plant community which provides valuable cover and spawning habitat for a variety of fish species.  Residential development around the perimeter of Kelly-Dudley Lake is limited, resulting in an undisturbed shoreline and riparian zone.  The majority of the shore is surrounded by a forested riparian zone with cattail marshes being present at the northern shores of the lake.  Kelly-Dudley Lake is accessible to the public via a public ramp on the south shore of the lake.  The sport fish community is relatively simple, consisting of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Fish populations in Kelly-Dudley Lake are self-sustaining, as stocking has not occurred since 1983.  Kelly-Dudley Lake was surveyed the week of 6/6/2011 to monitor the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike continue to be present in good numbers in Kelly-Dudley Lake.  Gill net catch rates in 2011 (10.0/gill net) were unchanged from the last survey done in 2006 (10.7/gill net), with catches well above average for lakes similar to Kelly-Dudley Lake.  Mean weight of northern pike increased from 2.7 pounds in 2006 to 3.4 pounds in 2011.  Northern pike ranged from 14.0 to 33.7 inches in total length and averaged 23.6 inches.  The abundant pike population in Kelly-Dudley Lake could provide some good angling action with the opportunity to catch a fish over 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish continue to be extremely abundant in Kelly-Dudley Lake but are relatively small.  Although bluegill catch rates decreased from 203.0/trap net in 2006 to 113.7/ trap net in 2011, numbers were still well above average for similar lakes.  Bluegill size structure was small with bluegills ranging from 3.1 to 8.0 inches in total length and averaging 5.4 inches.  Approximately 97% of the bluegills sampled were less than 7.0 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed catch rates increased substantially from 5.0/trap net in 2006 to 25.1/trap net in 2011.  Size of pumpkinseeds was also small, with 95% being less than 7.0 inches in length.  Black crappie were sampled at a rate of 5.3/gill net in 2011, compared to 2.3/gill net in 2006.  Size structure was small, with the majority of black crappies being below 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass population was assessed in mid-May of 2007 using boat electrofishing.  Catch rates were high, averaging 36.0/hour.  The sample was dominated by small fish, as only 25% of the fish captured were greater than 12.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBowfin, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, golden shiner, and hybrid sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Kelly-Dudley Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

This lake is noted for above-average abundance of northern pike, which are dominated by young fish at 16-22 inches, which indicates heavy fishing pressure.  Anglers report a fair largemouth bass population, which is dominated by fish at 0.5-1.5 pounds.  The lake is known for its clear water and lush weed beds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kelly - Dudley Lake is a small (125 acres), deep lake located northwest of Faribault in Rice Co.  Kelly - Dudley Lake is characterized by clear water and a diverse and abundant plant community.  A minimum size limit of 30 inches (limit 1 fish) for northern pike was placed on Kelly - Dudley Lake to determine if preventing angler harvest of fish less than 30 inches could increase the number of large northern pike in the study lakes by reducing mortality of pike less than the minimum size limit.  The 30-inch minimum size limit was started in May 1998.  Based on spring trap net samples, mean fish size increased from 1997 to 1998 by 2.1 inches to 18 inches, and marginally increased by 1.1 inches from 1998 to 1999 (20 inches), and remained similar from 1999 to 2002 (around 20 inches).  Northern pike gill net catch per net was unchanged in the last three surveys (1993, 1992, 2002).  However, the mean length of gill net caught northern pike showed a significant increase over the same period, increasing from 19 inches in 1993, to 22 inches in 1999, to 24 inches in 2002.  Many northern pike in St. Olaf Lake are marked with individually numbered tags as part of the assessment of the effectiveness of the 30-inch minimum size limit.  The yellow tags are located on the back of the fish adjacent to the dorsal fin.  Anglers who catch tagged northern pike and are able to read the tag number should contact the DNR Waterville Fisheries Office.  Bluegill are abundant in Kelly - Dudley Lake, but tend to be small.  Black crappie are less numerous but larger.  Largemouth bass fishing is also good.</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE LENGTH FREQUENCIES REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM 1983 AND 1986 NETTING WITH SMALL FISH DOMINA- TING THE SIZE STRUCTURE. NORTHERNS ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS. IT APPEARS SMALL NORTHERNS ARE BEING REMOVED BY ANGLERS. SETTING A MINIMUM SIZE LIMIT MAY BE A SOLUTION TO IMPROVE THE NORTHERN FISHERY. THE BLUEGILL CATCH RATE IS SIMILAR TO THE 1986 NETTING, NOW AVERAGING 14.25/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 19.00/TRAPNET IN 1986. GROWTH RATES REMAIN SLOW FOR BLUEGILLS WITH FEW FISH EXCEEDING 6.9 INCHES. THE BLUEGILL POPULATION IS REPRESENTED BY 2-8 YEAR OLDS WITH AGES 4-7 MOST ABUNDANT. PUMPKINSEED REMAIN AT RELATIVELY LOW ABUNDANCE, NOW AVERAGING 1.00/TRAP NET AND 2.75/TRAP NET IN 1986 COMPARED TO 16.00/TRAP NET IN 1983. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATES REMAIN LOW, AVERAGING 0.50/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 1.25/TRAP NET IN 1986. THE FEW CRAPPIES SAMPLED WERE REPRESENTED BY LAR- GER FISH. AGE-GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATE AGES 2-4 WERE SAMPLED. ONE SMALL LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS SAMP- LED, COMPARED TO NONE SAMPLED IN 1986 AND TWO SAMPLED IN 1983. ANGLERS REPORT FEW LARGE BASS CAUGHT WITH MOST FISH 1/2 - 1 LB. ONE WALLEYE WAS CAPTURED, COMPARED TO TWO LARGE WALLEYES CAP- TURED IN 1983. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THESE FISH MIGRATED UP THE OUTLET FROM FRENCH LAKE.</p>",
