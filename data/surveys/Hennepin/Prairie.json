Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 2 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 7 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including 1 species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Bryant Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey contributed biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Lower Minnesota River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bryant Lake is a 161-acre lake located in Eden Prairie, Hennepin County.  It is part of the Three Rivers Parks system and they maintain a concrete ramp on the NE shore within Bryant Lake Park.  Tiger muskellunge stocking began in 1985, with a plan to stock fingerlings every third year.  Variation from this plan occurred in 1991, 1996, 1998, and 1999, when either yearlings (1991) or fry were stocked.  Triennial fingerling stocking resumed in 2001.  Walleye were stocked for the first time in 2004 as fingerlings (total of 4138) and in 2006 as fingerlings (50 total), yearlings (13 total), and adults (95 total).  The previous survey of Bryant Lake in 1999. <br> \n <br> \nThe present population of yellow perch shows above average numbers and average weights, with all fish being 5.5-8 inches in length and averaging 0.12 lbs each.  Bluegills were present in average numbers for this lake, with 55% of the total fish sampled being above 6.0 inches, compared to 4% during the 1999 survey.  The black crappie in Bryant Lake have seen an increase in total numbers and an increase in lengths since the last survey.  Of the black crappie sampled, 41% were above 8 inches comparing to 12% 1999. <br> \n <br> \nAs walleye year class strength cannot confidently be assessed until the fish are age-3, the fate of walleye stocked in 2004 cannot yet be evaluated.  The age-2 walleye that were caught were all 11-13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTwo age-5 tiger muskellunge (from the 2001 fingerling stocking) were sampled during this survey, both over 36 inches and 12 lbs.  The last survey returned similar results, suggesting a stable population.  Northern pike were sampled at a slightly higher abundance than in 1999, but still below average numbers for this lake type.  Northern pike size ranged from 17-34.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile the gears used do not target largemouth bass, there were a total of 14 caught.  They ranged from 6.0-21.5 inches and averaged 1.15 lbs.  To better evaluate the largemouth bass population, spring electrofishing should be conducted.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp and yellow bullhead were sampled during the survey.  The carp were sampled in average numbers for this lake and ranged from 12-24 inches in size. <br> \n <br> \nOxygen levels sufficient to support fish in summertime usually ceases less than 20 feet from the surface, and has had a recent trend of shrinking further; oxygen levels of at least 2 ppm extended to a 17-ft depth in 1994, a 13-ft depth in 1999, and a 9-ft depth in 2006 at the mid-July survey dates.Oxygen amounts levels vary depending on weather, climate, and water levels, and water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bryant Lake is a 161-acre lake located in Eden Prairie.  It is part of the Three Rivers Parks system, and they maintain a concrete ramp on the northeast shore within the park.  Bryant Lake offers a diverse sport fish community composed of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Tiger Muskellunge, and panfish.  Tiger Muskellunge stocking began in 1985, and are stocked in odd-numbered years. Walleye were stocked for the first time in 2004; stocking is planned for even-numbered years.  Spring electrofishing and summer gill netting and trap netting were conducted in 2017 to monitor the game fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 5.3 fish per net in 2017, which was above average for similar lake types.  The fish averaged 24.1 inches and 3.36 pounds, with the largest fish measuring 32.6 inches.  Eighty-one percent of the catch exceeded 21 inches, and 25% of the catch exceeded 26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass averaged 10.6 inches and 0.84 pounds during springtime sampling.  Fourteen percent of the sample exceeded 15 inches, and the largest fish was 19.5 inches long. The Largemouth Bass population is healthy, with many year classes of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye are not highly abundant, the fish are of good size.  Average size of Walleye in 2017 was 17.0 inches and 1.81 pounds, with the largest fish measuring 21.7 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of the Walleye exceeded 15 inches in length, and 20% exceeded 20 inches.  The Walleye population in Bryant is maintained through stocking and not supported by natural reproduction.  <br> \n  <br> \nAlthough Standard Survey methods do not effectively sample Tiger Muskellunge, five of the fish were incidentally sampled during the summer survey of 2017.  Their lengths ranged between 17.4 and 34.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were very abundant and of small size.  Only 12% of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches, and 1.8% of the catch exceeded 10 inches.  Average size was 6.1 inches and 0.13 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in average abundance, however, the population is mostly composed of smaller individuals.  Fish ranged between 3.2 and 7.6 inches, and the average size of Bluegill in 2017 was 4.8 inches and 0.09 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance during this survey include Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bryant Lake was conducted on August 21-22, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and steep drop offs. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured six species of fish including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish) and no species classified as intolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured five species of fish. Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Bryant Lake is adversely impacted by watershed and/or shoreline stressors as indicated by an FIBI score that is below the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bryant is a 180-acre (64 littoral acres) lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet. Bryant Lake is located in the northeast corner of Eden Prairie, in southwest Hennepin County. Bryant is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass. Walleye are fingerling-stocked at 2 pounds per littoral acre (128 pounds) in even-numbered years. In addition to the primarily managed Walleye and Largemouth Bass, Bryant also supports catchable populations of Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by Three Rivers Parks on the northeast side of the lake within the regional park (up to 20 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Bryant Lake during the week of 7/18/2022 to assess the fishery. Bryant Lake had moderate water clarity, measured at 9 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was 0 parts per million (ppm) below 20 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil, zebra mussels, and brittleleaf naiad have all been found in Bryant Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at moderate numbers (4.5/net), compared to similar lakes in the metro. However, the 2022 survey marked the highest catch rate of Walleye in Bryant Lake in the previous 25 years. There were 27 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 19.7 inches and the largest measured at 26.2 inches. Walleye numbers and sizes describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Growth rates were fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 19.7 inches by age 5. While not naturally occurring, stocked Walleye in Bryant Lake have created a healthy, robust fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Bryant Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2022 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 4 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 9.0 inches and the largest measured at 17.2 inches. Future surveys will include a targeted spring boat-electrofishing component. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (6.2/net), near the expected catch rate of similar lakes across the metro. There were 37 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 23.6 inches and the largest measured at 32.7 inches. While Northern Pike are typically not the primary draw to Bryant Lake, anglers still have the opportunity to catch some nice sized (32\"+) individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (101.8/net). There were 916 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 5.4 inches and the largest measured at 6.7 inches. High numbers of Bluegill are likely increasing competition amongst other Bluegill decreasing growth rates and keeping sizes small. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (10.7/net) and trap nets (3.0/net), near the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 91 Black Crappie sampled during the 2022 survey, with an average length of 6.9 inches and the largest measured at 11.8 inches. The majority of Black Crappie sampled were small, with the exception of 1 large individual. Despite a small average size, the potential for desirable sizes (10\"+) exists on Bryant Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Tiger Muskellunge, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWith multiple invasive species found in Bryant Lake, anglers can help stop the spread by following three steps every time they leave a lake or river - whether or not it's infested: <br> \nClean all aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other invasive species from boats, trailers, and water-related equipment. <br> \nDrain water from your boat, ballast tanks, motor, live well and bait container. Remove drain plugs and keep drain plugs out while transporting equipment. <br> \nDispose of unwanted bait in the trash. To keep live bait, drain the water and refill the bait container with bottled or tap water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bryant Lake is a 161-acre lake located in Eden Prairie.  It is part of the Three Rivers Parks system and they maintain a concrete ramp on the NE shore within the park.  Bryant Lake offers a diverse sport fish community composed of northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, tiger muskellunge, and panfish.  Tiger muskellunge stocking began in 1985, and are stocked on odd numbered years. Walleye were stocked for the first time in 2004, and are stocked every other year. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high abundance, at a rate of 10.0 fish per gill net.  This is a noticeable increase from the abundance of northern pike in past years.  During the previous 4 surveys (1989 \u0013 2006), catch rate of northern pike has ranged between 0.5 and 3.5 fish per gill net.  Northern pike were of good size; average length and weight of the sampled fish was 23.6 inches and 3.30 lbs.  Forty-two percent of the fish were greater than 24 inches in length, and 10% were greater than 28 inches.   The largest northern pike measured 35.8 inches in length.  By age three, northern pike attained an average length of 20.9 inches, and by age 6 they had attained an average length of 29.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing targeted the largemouth bass population.  Thirty-three fish were sampled, at a rate of 22.7 fish per hour of on-time.  The average length and weight of fish was 12 inches and 1.29 pounds.  Fifty-five percent of bass sampled were greater than 12 inches in length and the largest bass measured 18.4 inches in length.  By age 5, bass had reached an average length of 11.8 inches, and by age 7, they had reached an average length of 15.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in higher than average abundance for this type of lake.  The average walleye weighed 2.08 pounds and measured 17.5 inches in length.  Seventy-four percent of sampled walleye measured more than 15 inches in length, with the largest fish measuring 24.3 inches.  The majority of sampled walleye were 4 years old, and originated from a fingerling stocking in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nSix tiger muskellunge were sampled during the summer population assessment, 2 in gill nets and 4 in trap nets.  Their lengths ranged between 12.7 and 32.4 inches.  Smaller fish were aged 1 and 3 years, while the two larger fish were aged 5 and 8 years.  The previous survey, in 2006, returned similar results, suggesting a stable population. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty black crappie were sampled by gill nets and trap nets.  The fish averaged 5.9 inches in length, with the largest fish measuring 7.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were present in above average numbers for this lake, with 35% of the fish sampled exceeding 6.0 inches, compared to 55% during the 2006 survey.  Only 1% of the sampled bluegill measured 7 inches or greater in length.  There is a very strong 2009, age-3 year class; 43% of the trap net catch came from this age group.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has declined over the years.  During the previous survey, in 2006, yellow perch were caught at a rate of 21.8 fish per gill net.  During the survey of 2012, yellow perch were caught at a rate of 1.3 fish per gill net.  Average length of perch was 6.3 inches, and the largest perch measured 7.4 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches in length with the largest individuals sampled being only 6.8 inches. Pumpkinseed are also present in above average numbers and average 5.0 inches in length. Black crappie averaging about 7.25 inches in length are also present in good numbers. Largemouth bass were captured in relatively high numbers in trapnets, but the average size was small. Northern Pike are present in relatively average numbers with an above average size structure. The average size northern pike sampled during this survey was 27.0 inches in length. Hybrid Muskellunge are also present through an every third year stocking program. The average size Hybrid Muskie sampled was 33.9 inches in length and 9.5 pounds. No Hybrid Muskies above the minimum legal harvest size were captured during this survey. Growth rate of northern pike and Hybrid Muskellunge was found to be average for regional waters. A good population of 6-7 inch yellow perch appears to support the present predator population.Black and yellow bullheads averaging 10 inches in length are also common in the lake. White suckers and carp are also present. The average carp sampled was in excess of 21 inches and about 5 pounds in weight.</p>",

Bluegill averaged 5.1 inches in length with the largest individuals sampled being only 6.3 inches. Only 4 percent of all bluegills captured measured 6.0 inches or more in length. Although not abundant, pumpkinseed sunfish are also present and average only 4.4 inches in length at the time of this assessment. Black crappie averaging 7.15 inches in length (0.16 pounds) are also present in good numbers. Largemouth bass were captured in moderate numbers by night  electrofishing. The average size fish observed was 12.6 inches in length and 1.3 pounds. Bass up to 4.1 pounds and 18.9 inches in length were captured. Northern Pike were sampled in relatively low numbers but exhibited an above average size structure. The average northern pike captured was 27.6 inches in length and 5.4 pounds. Hybrid Muskies are also present through an every third year stocking program. No Hybrid Muskies above the minimum legal harvest size of 40 inches were observed during this assessment. Growth rates of northern pike and Hybrid Muskies was found to be very good for regional waters. Yellow perch were also observed in normal abundance, but they averaged only 6.2 inches in length.  The abundance of both black and yellow bullheads was observed to be down from the levels previously recorded in 1994. </p>",
