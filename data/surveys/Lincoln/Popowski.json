                "narrative": "<p>This was an initial fish survey conducted on Popowski Lake.  Above normal precipitation has greatly increased the size and depth of Popowski Lake over the last 15 years.  A 1967 game lake survey recorded a maximum depth of 1.5 feet compared to a 12.0 foot maximum found in 2001.       Anglers harvested high numbers of large yellow perch during the winters of 1997 and 1998.  Perch were sampled in low abundance in 2001.  Perch were small, measuring 5-7 inches.  Reproduction should increase as small perch become mature.  However, a quality perch fishery is a few years away.     Black crappie were also sampled in low abundance.  Crappie measured 5-12 inches, with the majority 8-10 inches.  Black crappie growth was exceptional.  Age 4+ fish averaged 11.8 inches compared to the southern Minnesota average of 8.3 inches.       Five walleye and one largemouth bass were caught in the 2001 survey.  Walleye measured 16-23 inches and the bass measured 13.7 inches.  Due to the low abundance of these two species, it is unclear whether self-sustaining populations exist.       Black bullhead, fathead minnow and white sucker where also sampled during the 2001 survey.  Black bullhead were abundant and most measured 5-8 inches.  Young-of-year bullhead were sampled in low abundance.       Fisheries management activities for Popowski Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fishing pressure counts, and development of a management plan.   </p>",

Popowski is approximately 140 acres and does not contain a public boat ramp.  A large portion of the lake lies within the boundaries of a State Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and is subject to WMA regulations. <br> \n     Historically Popowski was a high quality waterfowl lake with shallow, clear water and abundant vegetation.  During the past 30 years Popowski's depth increased from two to 12 feet.  Its water clarity declined and dense phytoplankton blooms have frequently occurred. <br> \n     Walleye were abundant in 2012 with most fish measuring 14 or 20 inches.  Walleye growth has been good with fish reaching 14 inches after only two summers.  Yellow perch were abundant with many fish present from 5-13 inches.  Both species have experienced very sporadic, but at times very good, recruitment.  Black bullhead were abundant but somewhat small with most fish less than eight inches.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were not caught in 2012, although they were present during the last assessment conducted in 2001. <br> \n     Future management activities include fish population assessments.</p>",
