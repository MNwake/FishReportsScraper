The landscape surrounding this lake is dominated by birch trees with some aspen and balsam fir also present. The shoreline is wooded close to the water's edge with a few areas of ledgerock found on some of the point areas. There are two campsites present. <br> \n <br> \nThe most common access used is by a 130 yard portage from a parking area off the Glippi Forest Management Road on the north side of the lake. There is no signage located at the parking area. There is another portage located on the southwest shore from the North Kawashiwi River and a snowmobile trail from Garden Lake through Pickerel Lake to cabins on Greenstone Lake can be found during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2014 (7.5/gill net) was over four times higher compared to past assessments on this lake. Walleye averaged 15.8 inches long and about three years old. The largest walleye sampled was 23.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2014 (6.2/gill net) was more than two times lower (14.0/gill net) compared to past assessments on this lake. Pike sizes averaged 21.2 inches and the largest pike sampled was 29 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance in 2014 (0.3/gill net) was similar to past surveys. One yellow perch was sampled and white sucker were sampled in slightly lower numbers than in the past. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Pickerel Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it has harder (more mineralized) water and a more regular (round) shoreline shape.Pickerel Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 07/07/98 with a bottom temperature 4 F cooler than the surface temperature.  Adequate oxygen (more than 2 ppm) was retained to within a foot of the bottom.  A small inlet drains local wetlands.  The outlet to the Kawishiwi River has beaver dams and rapids that limit fish movement.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is 25% rubble, 19% muck, 18% gravel, 17% boulder, 12% sand, and 7% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft; the most common plants are various pondweeds, bladderwort, and water milfoil.The 1998 fish population assessment consisted of 6 gillnet sets.  Three previous assessments, dating back to 1964, consisted of 3-8 gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been used on Pickerel Lake due to the difficult portage access.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 25 fish/net (52 lb/net) was higher than normal for this lake class, and was similar to catches in the 1989 and 1984 assessments, but was higher than than the 1964 assessment catch.Fish populations in 1998, as in previous assessments, were dominated by northern pike and white sucker.  Low numbers of other species were present.Northern pike numbers in 1998 (16.5/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to catches in 1989 and 1984, but were higher than the 1964 catch.  Pike sizes in 1998 averaged 21\"; the largest was 27\".  Pike reproduction has been very good in most years.  The growth of pike captured in 1998 (21\" at age four) was normal for the area, but older pike appeared to grow more slowly than normal.Sucker numbers in 1998 were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous catches.  Walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and rock bass numbers were lower than normal for this lake class.  The walleye caught in 1998, as in previous assessments, were mostly large and old.  Walleye growth (18\" at age three) was much faster than normal for the area.  Yellow perch may be more abundant in Pickerel Lake than indicated by the gillnet catch, as many perch have been observed in the stomachs of northern pike and walleye and many small perch have been observed following fishing lures.Some of the northern pike examined in 1998 had neascus (black spot), and some of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are usually removed by filleting, and are killed by temperatures used when cooking fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel is a 182-acre lake located nine miles east of Ely down the Glipi forest road off the Fernberg Trail. It is a shallow, relatively productive walleye lake similar to Everett, Perch, and Western in the Tower area. The access is carry-in and best suited to canoes and kayaks. A boat with portage wheels is challenging with the rocks present. Typically, the lake is brown with bog-stain. At the time of the 2023 survey the survey crew found the max depth to be 12.3 feet and the water had a green tint. A beaver dam below the outlet appeared to have blown out during the high water of 2022 and dropped the lake level as a result.  Pickerel was not stratified on 7/17/2023 and had a temperature of 68F. Oxygen levels sufficient for fish were present to the bottom. Secchi visibility was 8 feet and submerged vegetation is abundant.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey consisted of four gill net and six trap nets sets over two nights. Gill net catches were dominated by walleye and northern pike, with small numbers of smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass, and a lone white sucker also sampled. Trap nets primarily captured walleye as well, with bluegill secondary, and low numbers of northern pike and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (26.8/gill net) was far above average and ranks second for the highest Tower Area catch rate. Lengths ranged from 8 to 24 inches with a mean of 17 inches. Walleye growth was excellent and natural reproduction is consistent. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (4.8/gill net) was average compared to similar Tower area lakes. Pike lengths ranged from 21 to 30 inches with a mean of 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA few smallmouth bass (1.3/net) were captured, but they are likely more abundant in Pickerel than this survey suggests. Standard survey nets often underrepresent bass. Lengths ranged from 13 to 16 inches with an average length of about 14 inches. <br> \n</p>",
