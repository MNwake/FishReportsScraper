THIRTEEN QUALITY-SIZE BASS WERE CAPTURED IN 1 1/2 HOURS OF ELECTROFISHING. BLUE- GILL NUMBERS WERE ONLY 37% ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE BUT THE RATE OF GROWTH HAS CONTINUED TO BE SLOW WITH THE AVERAGE SIZE STILL BEING SMALL. BLACK CRAPPIES WERE MUCH TOO ABUNDANT ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WHILE GROWTH WAS TYPICALLY SLOW. WHITE CRAPPIES ALSO WERE VERY ABUNDANT, SLOW- GROWING FISH ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME LARGER, OLD INDIVIDUALS PRESENT. NOT A SINGLE CHANNEL CATFISH WAS TAKEN IN ANY OF THE GEAR, THEREFORE, IF SOME WERE PRESENT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SCARCE. LARGE CARP AND WHITE SUCKERS WERE VERY ABUNDANT. A GOOD POPULATION OF QUALITY-SIZE BLACK BULLHEADS WAS PRESENT. MOST LIKELY THE LARGE POPULATION OF ADULT BASS HAS KEPT THE BULLHEADS IN CHECK. IN GENERAL, THE OVERALL QUALITIES OF THE FISH POPULA- TIONS IN EAST SIDE LAKE WERE SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS, WITH THE MAIN IMPROVEMENT RE- SULTING IN THE LARGEMOUTH BASS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Lake Management Plan for Eastside Lake calls for fish population assessments to be completed ever 5 years starting in 2002.  The lake was sampled with 6 overnight trapnet sets.  Two stations were also electrofished with a boat boom shocker to sample the bass and catfish populations.  The nets were set during the third week of July, and the electrofishing was completed in early September.  No shoreline seining was done during this or the previous (1997) assessment.  Scales were taken on all species of game fish and used to determine fish ages and growth rates.  A dissolved oxygen profile, temperature profile and secchi disc reading were also taken on the first day of the survey (July 21, 2003).     The number of largemouth bass has decreased considerably since 1997, however the average size of the fish has increased from half a pound apiece to almost a full pound apiece in 2003.  The largest fish sampled was 15.4 inches in total length and weighed 1.75 pounds.  Including 2003 there has been only one year since 1997 when there were no natural hatches of largemouth bass in Eastside Lake.  A dramatic decline in floating leaved aquatics has taken place in the northeast corner of the lake since the 1997 assessment was completed, which at one time provided excellent cover for largemouth bass and other species.      Smallmouth bass exist in the lake, but as with the northern pike, yellow perch, and white bass little is known regarding their contribution to the fishery in Eastside Lake.     The numbers of both species of crappie are at all time highs for Eastside Lake.  Both species are dominated by the 2001 year-class (4\" - 6\" in length), which contributes to average weights of both species being lower than the past survey (1997).  The lake does have quality size fish of both species; the largest black crappie sampled was 14.4 inches long weighed 1.73 pounds and the largest white crappie was 12.9 inches long and weighed 0.97 pounds.  The large 2001 year-class moving through the Eastside Lake system should provide for excellent crappie fishing in the next couple of years.     The number of bluegills in Eastside Lake are down slightly from the 1997 survey.  The average size of these fish however have declined considerably in the last 6 years with the majority of the fish in 2003 being from 3\" - 5\" while the majority of the bluegills captured in 1997 were between 5\" - 7\" in length.  Very few bluegills (n-4) were captured in 2003 that would be considered acceptable to fisherman (>6\").     No channel catfish were seen in any of the Eastside Lake assessments since 1983.  The attempt at re-introducing catfish with stockings in 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1998 appears to have been a failure.  Stocking was discontinued in 1999 after a special nighttime electrofishing survey that was specifically targeted at catfish failed to sample any fish.     Very few \"rough\" fish species were seen in Eastside Lake in 2003, as has been the case in the past surveys.  The two species that commonly take over these types of lakes and dominate the fishery (bullheads & carp) were found in very low numbers in 2003 as they have been in the past.  The white sucker population remains as one of the constants in Eastside Lake, rarely fluctuating above or below the relative abundance seen in 2003 of 8.8 fish per set.  Three other non-game species were present in 2003: golden shiner, orange spotted sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Side Lake is a small (39.0 acre) lake located in the Town of Austin in Mower County. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of East Side Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge, which limits the functionality of the riparian buffer. East Side Lake is unique in that it is situated in a part of Minnesota that has very few lakes, and because it provides an urban fishery opportunity for the Town of Austin. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in the City Park. East Side Lake provides ample shoreline angling opportunities because the city park encompasses the entire east side of the lake. Natural reproduction is sufficient to maintain crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill populations; however, walleye fingerlings and adults were stocked in 2007 and 2011 to maintain the walleye population. Primary management species in East Side Lake include bluegill and black crappie, and secondary management species include walleye and largemouth bass. A population assessment was conducted on 8-15-2012 to monitor fish populations in East Side Lake using 1 gill net and 6 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality was poor at East Side Lake during the assessment. The brown/green water was turbid and had a secchi depth of 1.0 feet. The turbid water color was likely caused by algae blooms and runoff events. Dissolved oxygen was good ranging from 21.0 ppm at the surface to 10.5 ppm at 3.0 feet deep.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have decreased significantly in the last decade. In 2003, 2007, and 2012, black crappies were captured at rates of 119.5, 72.5, and 17.8/trap net, which are high compared to similar lakes. Black crappie size structure was small with lengths ranging from 2.6 to 8.2 inches and averaging 7.3 inches. White crappies were also present but occurred in lower numbers than black crappie (4.3/trap net) which is about average for similar lakes. White crappies were small with all of them being less than 9.5 inches in length. The 2012 white crappie catch rate was the lowest observed catch rate on East Side Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 bluegill catch rate (2.3/trap net) decreased since the 2007 survey (29.7/trap net), which is low when compared to similar lakes. The size of bluegills was decent with lengths ranging from 5.2 to 7.1 inches and averaging 6.1 inches. The 2012 bluegill catch rate was the lowest ever observed on East Side Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and crappie catch rates were the lowest that have been documented on East Side Lake and were likely the result of a summer fish kill reported on July 24, 2012. Locals reported thousands of dead black crappies, largemouth bass, bluegills, and minnows.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are a secondary management species in East Side Lake and are periodically stocked to maintain the existing population. In 2007, walleyes were captured at a rate of 2.0/gill net and increased to 6.0/gill net in 2012 which was relatively high compared to similar lakes. Otolith ages indicated a successful stocking in 2011, as all of the walleyes collected were age-1. The walleyes exhibited good growth ranging in length from 9.5 to 11.7 inches after their first year.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker have historically been abundant in East Side Lake and the trend continued as they were caught at a rate of 23.0/gill net and 9.8/trap net. Common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, black bullhead, and green sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish survey was conducted on Eastside Lake during the summer of 1997 in order to update the current lake management plan (1993).  Seven areas of the lake were fished with trap nets in mid-July and entire shoreline was electrofished using a boat-mounted generator on early September.  Scale samples were removed from a sample of the gamefishes and panfish species collected during the survey.  The scales were then read to determine ages and growth rates for the various species.  The last fish survey was conducted in 1992.The largemouth bass population has increased slightly from the last survey.  The size structure of the bass population is very favorable; thirty-five percent of the adult bass are larger than 12 inches in length.  The largest bass sampled was 17 inches long and weighed nearly three pounds.  Bass reproduce very well in the lake and there have been at least eight continuous, natural hatches of bass.  Bass generally grow at a rate somewhat higher than statewide averages in Eastside Lake.Bluegill numbers have also increased to near lake record highs (similar to the population in 1979).  However, the average size of adult fish is only 5.9 inches and only 40 percent of the fish are larger than 6.0 inches.  Bluegill generally grow faster than statewide averages, at least through the first three years of growth.Both species of crappie are available in Eastside Lake.  Black crappie were at an all-time high in 1997.  We caught more than twice the number we did in 1987, the former high catch.  Unfortunately, most of the fish are smaller; average size caught in the nets was only about six inches.  We did not catch any black crappie larger than nine inches.  In contrast, the white crappie population appears to be at an all-time low.  Our survey information also shows, interestingly enough, that when bluegill numbers are high, white crappie numbers tend to be lower.  The reason for this trend is unkown, but it is not due to bluegills eating the white crappie.  Yellow perch are also present in the lake, but only at very low abundance.  We caught only 12 perch in the nets and we believe that they were accidentally introduced in 1992.Although we continue to stock channel catfish into Eastside Lake, none were found in this fish survey.  Some local anglers, however, have reported catching channel catfish on rare occaisions.The lake also contains fairly high populations of what are generally considered to be \"rough\" fishes.  White suckers and carp are in present in good abundance, but the black bullhead population is near an all-time low.       </p>",

It's shoreline is highly developed with frequent occurance of rip-rap, and little or no natural terrestrial or aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and crappie were the dominant species sampled in the survey.  Some crappie were notably 13 inches.  Two walleye were sampled in the 14 inch size range.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2006 and 2007, and are proposed in 2008.  Further evaluation may be necessary to determine the effectiveness of fingerling stocking in this system. <br> \n <br> \nOrangespotted sunfish were notable in the survey and bluegill were observed in good numbers.  Other species included bullheads, carp, golden shiners, green sunfish, and largemouth bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Side Lake is a small (39.0 acre) lake located in the Town of Austin in Mower County. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of East Side Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge, which limits the functionality of the riparian buffer. East Side Lake is unique in that it is situated in a part of Minnesota that has very few lakes, and because it provides an urban fishery opportunity for the Town of Austin. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in the City Park. East Side Lake provides ample shoreline angling opportunities because the city park encompasses the entire east side of the lake. Natural reproduction is sufficient to maintain crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill populations; however, walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked in 2011and 2015 to maintain the walleye population. Primary management species in East Side Lake include bluegill and black crappie, and secondary management species include walleye and largemouth bass. An electrofishing survey was conducted on 8-30-18 to monitor fish populations in East Side Lake.\n\nA targeted survey was completed the week of August 30, 2018 using 36 minutes of boat electrofishing to assess the current state of the fishery and to guide future management of the Cedar River system. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys.\n\nThere appears to be a high abundance of bluegills present in East Side Lake. The sizes of the bluegills captured were between 3.5 and 7.5 inches in length. other panfish present in the lake included green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, black crappies and white crappies.  There fair number of crappies captred during the survey ranging from 4.7 inches to 9.4 inches.\n\nBoth largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in East Side like. there appears to be good natual reproduction as many schools of young of the year bass were seen during the survey.  Largemouth bass were plentiful and ranged in sizes to 16.7 inches.  There were fewer smallmouth bass captured but the largest captured was 17.7 inches. It is very possible that larger fish of both species may be present in the lake.\n\nWalleye are stocked in East Side Lake as needed, typically after a winterkill situation. A few larger walleye were captured during the survey. They ranged in size from 18.7 to 22.6 inches in length.\n\nOther fish present included common carp, white sucker, quilback, and minnow species.  Fisheries personnel did not observe any bullheads or northern pike during this survey.</p>",
