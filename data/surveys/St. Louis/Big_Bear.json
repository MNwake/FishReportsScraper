                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is located 12 miles northwest of Two Harbors off state highway 44.  Bear Lake is 130 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  There is a state owned concrete boat access on the southwest shore of the lake.     The fish community has changed greatly from 1965 to 2001.  Walleye abundance was 0.25 per gillnet lift in 2001 and has ranged from 0 per lift (1980, 1990) to 16.5 per lift (1965).  Age and growth were not evaluated in 2001 because of the small sample size, but previous growth has been fast.  Natural reproduction is limited in Bear Lake, and a walleye population has been maintained by biennial fingerling stocking.       Northern pike currently provide the best angling opportunities in Bear Lake.  Abundance has fluctuated over past assessments and surveys but has always remained within normal ranges, compared to similar lakes within the Duluth Area.  While size structure has fluctuated over time, growth rates have remained fast.  Average length from all northern sampled was 25.2 in 2001.  Sixty-seven percent of the northern pike sampled were from the 1998 year class, which should provide good future angling opportunities.     Other fish species sampled during this investigation include pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and black bullhead.  Rock bass, black crappie, bluegill, Iowa darter, and various minnows have been sampled in past surveys and assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Species distribution and abundance has changed in Big Bear from 1980 to 1996.  Walleye, which were absent from 1980 and 1990 assessments, were captured in 1996.  Conversely, black bullhead, which were very abundant from 1980 and 1990 assessments, were not sampled in 1996.  Walleye catch rates from 1996 were within an acceptable range when compared to similar lakes, while growth rates were among the fastest when compared to other walleye populations in the Duluth Area.  Mean length of walleye in 1996 was 15.8 inches.  Walleye aged from the 1996 assessment showed that all fish were born in years that walleye were stocked.  other species sampled from Big Bear in 1996 include northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish.  All these species have been sampled at similar abundance in past assessments.     Increases in water level may be responsible for the shift in species composition of the Big Bear fish community.  Water levels on Big Bear increased 2.4 feet from 1990 to 1996.  It is speculated that this increase in water level has reduced the severity of low winter-dissolved-oxygen events, which increased survival of northern pike and walleye.  Increased abundance and size of predators has probably resulted in heavier predation on bullheads causing their abundance to decline.     Current conditions in Big Bear are favorable for a walleye fishery maintained by stocking fingerlings.  Walleye growth rates were fast and natural reproduction was limited, while yellow perch were abundant.  Preservation of a fishery similar to the one currently present may depend on maintenance of water at or near current levels.</p>",

Big Bear Lake is located 4.5 miles southwest of Rollins, Minnesota.  Big Bear Lake has a concrete, back-in public access off County Road #44 on the Big Bear Lake Road.  A population assessment was conducted on Big Bear Lake during the summer of 2009 to evaluate walleye natural recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift had increased since 2002 (0.3) but was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 21.1 inches was large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes represented from 2001 through 2004 and no fish younger than age-5. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.3 per gillnet lift had increased slightly since 2001 (3.8) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 19.1 inches was considered small.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2001 (8.5) had also fallen to below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.2 inches was considered typical.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were identified for the first time in trapnets during the 2009 assessment.  Bluegill abundance of 1.4 per trapnet was considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.   <br> \n  <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance, which had been very high in the 1980's and 1990's investigations, had fallen to 0.2 per gillnet lift in 2009.  This was considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  A new water control structure constructed at the outlet in 1998, which replaced the failing structure constructed in 1960, maintains the water levels higher than during the years that correlate to high bullhead abundance.  It is presumed that the higher water level reduces low oxygen stress during the winter, which benefitted the black bullhead population. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big bear Lake is a 130 acre lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet. The lake lies within the Cloquet Valley State Forest but is accessible only by a private road.  A public road is due to be constructed in the near future.  There are no flowing inlets and a dam at the outlet maintains a higher level than in the past.  Shoal water soils are about one-half gravel and rubble with the remainder muck except for some sand.  Wild forest land surrounds the lake and the only development consists of three private cabins.Water levels are held relatively stable.  Emergent bulrush and cattails occur in the shallow bays and shoreline areas.  Submerged vegetation is distributed rather uniformly over the bottom to a ten foot depth.test netting indicated an abundance of walleyes, about 5 times the state median per set and averaging two pounds.  Northern pike were taken at about six times the state median.  Netting also showed greater than normal numbers of sucker, perch, rockbass and pumpkinseed sunfish present.  Black crappie and bluegill were also taken during the survey.Spawning areas are excellent for walleye, fair for northern pike and panfish and fair to poor for bass.Big Bear Lake has little fishing pressure, almost all coming through the private access.  A state forestry road open to the public is proposed for construction during 1966.</p>",
