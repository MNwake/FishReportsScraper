                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Potato Lake has a surface area of 2,100 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  There are two public accesses located on the lake, one on the north shore and one on the west \"arm\".  Boating access is also available from Eagle Lake downstream through the river and into Potato Lake.  There is a dam at the outlet of the lake and seasonal adjustments are made to regulate the water level.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Potato Lake is in lake class 22.  Other Park Rapids area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Long.  Potato Lake is well known for its walleye fishery and is one of the more popular fishing lakes in the Park Rapids area.  Walleye were sampled in good numbers (6.4/gillnet), within the \"normal range\" for this lake class and similar to the 1993 survey.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been lower, but still within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Size of walleye was good, with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 1.7 pounds, respectively.  Potato Lake has a plentiful forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) which reflected in good walleye growth rates for this area.  Strong 1994 and 1995 year classes (14 to 17 inches)  made up 56% of the walleye sample.  Potato Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years, however, natural reproduction contributes heavily to the population with 61% of the sample (57 fish) corresponding to non-stocked years.  Fall electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Potato Lake to assess the abundance of young walleye produced through natural reproduction.  While catch rates were good for adult fish, only one walleye from the 1998 year class was sampled.  Future fall electrofishing is planned to monitor the population of young walleye.Northern pike numbers were up considerably from past surveys.  Northern pike were sampled at the upper end of the \"normal range\" for this lake class, while past surveys have generally been at the low end of the range.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small fish, averaging 19.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Northern pike numbers have been bolstered by several bumper year classes in Potato Lake as well as other surrounding lakes.  Increase in northern pike abundance is due to higher water levels in recent years porviding excellent shallow water spawning areas for pike.Potato Lake supports both a smallmouth bass and largemouth bass fishery.  Smallmouth bass are more abundant in the rock and gravel bars of the main basin, while largemouth bass are more common around the bulrush stands and submerged aquatic vegetation beds of the west and east \"arms\".  Smallmouth bass had not been sampled prior to 1988.  Many smallmouth bass were observed during fall electrofishing for walleye and reports from anglers say that the smallmouth bass population is increasing.The panfish fishery in Potato Lake is probably known more for its quality than quantity.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, but anglers report catching nice-size fish early in the spring.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers were very low, but average size was large.  Bluegill up to 9.0 inches were sampled.Other species sampled in moderate numbers include rock bass and white sucker.  Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and shorthead redhorse were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Potato Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Potato Lake has a surface area of 2,100 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore and a county-owned access is located on the west \"arm\" of the lake.  Boating access with small craft is also available from the river connecting to Eagle Lake.  There is a fixed crest dam at the outlet that prevents boat travel downstream.  The fixed crest dam was installed in 2004 and the design allows for fish passage.  Potato Lake is a very popular fishing lake in the Park Rapids area.  Potato Lake is well known for its walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for northern pike smallmouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Potato Lake is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Long. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (6.3 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye gillnet catch rates since the early 1980's have been similar, fluctuating within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and around the current management goal.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-18 inch size range, with walleye measured up to 27.9 inches.  Potato Lake is currently stocked with walleye during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch abundance (3.9 perch/gillnet) was down from past surveys.  Average size of yellow perch is small (5.5 inches), however, a few larger perch are present with fish measured up to 11.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (7.3 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to other surveys since the late 1990's.  Northern pike abundance fluctuated from low to moderate numbers in earlier surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.3 pounds.  The number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) sampled was higher than past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nPotato Lake supports both a smallmouth bass and largemouth bass fishery.  Smallmouth bass are abundant in the rock and gravel bars of the main basin, while largemouth bass are less abundant, and are found in the bulrush stands and submerged aquatic vegetation beds of the west and east \"arms\".  Good numbers of larger smallmouth bass (>15.0 inches) were sampled when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish fishery in Potato Lake is probably known more for its quality than quantity.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers have reported catching nice-size crappie early in the spring.  The west and east \"arms\" of the lake provide the best black crappie habitat.  Bluegill abundance (10.8 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Prior to the 2005 survey, bluegill were sampled in low numbers in Potato Lake.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include high numbers of rock bass, and moderate numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, and shorthead redhorse.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

Other species are found in numbers below the statewide average.  The average weights of walleyes and northerns indicate the fish are smaller than the statewide average.Stocking Recommendations:Stocking should be limited to walleye pike only in years when natural reproduction is poor.  100,000 fingerlings should be planted in such years.Control of fish populations:No species is in urgent need of control.Recommended Regulation:Open to tullibee netting to utilize a species which now is neglected, and which is abundant enough to yield a good harvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Potato has a surface area of 2,096 acres and a maximum depth of 87 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore and a county-owned access is located on the west \"arm\" of the lake.  Boating access with small craft is also available from the inlet river connecting to Eagle Lake.  There is a fixed crest dam at the outlet that prevents boat travel downstream.  The fixed crest dam was installed in 2004 and the design allows for fish passage.  Potato Lake is a very popular fishing lake in the Park Rapids area.  Potato Lake is known for its Walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.   Potato Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes have the characteristics of being deep, having hard water, and small littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Lower Bottle. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted on Potato Lake during the summer of 2019 to gain information primarily about the Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike populations.  Gill nets were the only sampling equipment used. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye abundance was similar to the previous survey in 2016, but down somewhat from previous surveys and below the current management goal.  Walleye abundance since the early 1980's has been steady, with gill net catch rates fluctuating within the range for similar type lakes and around the management goal.  Good numbers of Walleye in the 14-18 inch size range were sampled, with fish measured up to 25.9 inches.  Abundance of Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, was up from recent surveys and near the current management goal.  Yellow Perch are small in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was the highest recorded for thirteen surveys dating back to 1950.  Northern Pike numbers have been high since the 2013 survey, while abundance in earlier surveys fluctuated at moderate levels for this lake class.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 38.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Potato Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

There is a good spread in the size frequency of all species.The growth rates of northern pike is greater than the figures for the statewide median.  There are no missing year classes in the range of year classes taken by the nets.  Most of the northern pike catch is composed of one year class (age I).Potato Lake is a hard-water lake with good natural spawning areas.  A large portion of the lake is greater than thirty feet in depth which is a major limiting factor of fish productivity.  Test netting indicates: (1)Small populations of panfish (2) average populations of northern pike and walleyes and (3) high populations of tullibee and suckers.Nine resorts and 150 cottages were counted in 1950 indicating a high fishing intensity.Fish Stocking:Nearly 900,000 walleye fingerlings (143 per acre) were stocked in the eight year period 1948 through 1955, however, the density of the walleye population as indicated by experimental gillnettting declined from 5.9 per lift in 1950, to 3.1 per lift in 1955.  It appears that walleye reproduction in not the limiting factor and that walleye stocking is not contributing greatly to the anglers catch.</p>",

A state-owned public access is located on the north shore and a county-owned access is located on the west \"arm\" of the lake.  Boating access with small craft is also available from the inlet river connecting to Eagle Lake.  There is a fixed crest dam at the outlet that prevents boat travel downstream.  The fixed crest dam was installed in 2004 and the design allows for fish passage.  Potato Lake is a very popular fishing lake in the Park Rapids area.  Potato Lake is known for its Walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.   Potato Lake is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes have the characteristics of being deep, having hard water, and small littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Lower Bottle. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted on Potato Lake during the summer of 2022 to gain information primarily on the Walleye and Yellow Perch populations.  Gill nets, fall electrofishing, and fine mesh gill nets were the only sampling equipment used.   <br> \nWalleye abundance was similar to the previous survey in 2016 and 2019.  Good numbers of Walleye in the 14-18 inch size range were sampled, with fish measured up to 27.2 inches.  Abundance of Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, was similar to recent surveys.  Yellow Perch are small in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Potato Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of the walleyes sampled was 1.3 pounds and 57% were in the 15 to 22 inch length range.  Natural  reproduction or migration are contributing to the walleye population as 40% of the aged walleyes were from non stocked year classes.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to similar lakes.  The average size of northern pike sampled during 1993 was 20.8 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and black crappies were not sufficiently sampled with standard gear to assess their abundance and size structure, however, historically they have been low.  Bluegill numbers appear low with slow growth rates even with the low population density.  The yellow perch are abundant in Potato Lake and provide an excellent forage base for the walleye and northern pike.  Few yellow perch sampled were of quality size as only 12% of the samples exceeded 8.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Potato Lake has a surface area of 2,100 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore and a county access is located on the west \"arm\" of the lake.  Boating access is also available from the river connecting to Eagle Lake.  There is a fixed crest dam at the outlet that prevents boat travel downstream.  The fixed crest dam was installed in 2004 and the design of the dam now allows for fish passage.  Potato Lake is a very popular fishing lake in the Park Rapids area.  Potato Lake is well known for its walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Potato Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Long.Walleye abundance was down, with the gillnet catch rate of 5.2 walleye/gillnet below the current management goal of 6.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye gillnet catch rates since the late 1970's have been similar, generally fluctuating within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and around the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 30.4 inches.  While Potato Lake has excellent water quality and walleye spawning substrate, contribution from natural reproduction has been very sporadic in recent years.  Recent surveys have shown that walleye fingerling stocking is contributing heavily to the walleye population in Potato Lake.  The DNR has identified Potato Lake as a \"Core\" walleye lake that would benefit from increased walleye stocking.  Potato Lake is a good candidate for increased walleye stocking due to its popularity as a walleye fishery and for having a good forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) that helps in the survival of stocked walleye fingerlings.  Starting in the fall of 2005 the walleye fingerling stocking rate on Potato was increased.Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (6.4 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.   Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.7 pounds.  The proportion of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) sampled, was low when compared to other area lakes.Potato Lake supports both a smallmouth bass and largemouth bass fishery.  Smallmouth bass are abundant in the rock and gravel bars of the main basin, while largemouth are less abundant, but are found in the bulrush stands and submerged aquatic vegetation beds of the west and east arms.  Anglers have reported that the smallmouth bass population has been increasing since the late 1980's.  The panfish fishery in Potato is probably known more for its quality than quantity.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers have reported catching nice-size crappie early in the spring.  Bluegill abundance (27.6 bluegill/trapnet) was up from past surveys.  Bluegill have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range were common.  Other species sampled included high numbers of rock bass and moderate numbers of white sucker, shorthead redhorse, and yellow bullhead.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Those caught below the average were: yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, tullibee, northern pike, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie.Management Recommendations:In view of the extremely high perch population, walleye fingerling stocking should continue.  The northern pike population is very low, not only indicated by the survey, but also information gathered from the public.  This no doubt is due to poor fish runs up into Rice Lake in years of 1975, 1976, and 1977.  Winter rescue northern pike should be stocked if they become available.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake (29-0243-00) is a 2,096-acre lake with a maximum depth of 87 feet located north of Park Rapids, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 6 - 8 July 2016 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, eight sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and eight were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at eight sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 24 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including seven species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, and Mottled Sculpin.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Weed Shiner, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 25 July 2016, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Potato Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Potato Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Potato Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Potato Lake has a surface area of 2,096 acres and a maximum depth of 87 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore and a county-owned access is located on the west \"arm\" of the lake.  Boating access with small craft is also available from the inlet river connecting to Eagle Lake.  There is a fixed crest dam at the outlet that prevents boat travel downstream.  The fixed crest dam was installed in 2004 and the design allows for fish passage.  Potato Lake is a very popular fishing lake in the Park Rapids area.  Potato Lake is well known for its Walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Potato Lake is in class 22.  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Big Sand, Lower Bottle, Kabekona, and Long.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down slightly from recent surveys and below the current management goal.  Walleye abundance since the early 1980's has been steady, with gill net catch rates fluctuating within the range for similar type lakes and around the management goal.  Good numbers of walleye in the 14-18 inch size range were sampled, with fish measured up to 28.8 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow Perch abundance has been low since the 2010 survey.  Sampled Yellow Perch had an average length 6.6 inches with fish measured up to 9.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was up from recent surveys and above the range for similar type lakes.  Northern Pike numbers have been high in Potato Lake since the 1998 survey.  Northern Pike abundance fluctuated from low to moderate numbers in earlier surveys.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 35.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPotato Lake supports both a Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass fishery.  Smallmouth Bass are abundant in the rock and gravel bars of the main basin, while Largemouth Bass are less abundant, and are found in the bulrush stands and submerged aquatic vegetation beds of the west and east \"arms\".  Good numbers of larger bass (> 15.0 inches) of both species were sampled compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth Bass up to 19.2 inches and Largemouth Bass up to 19.9 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, and Yellow and Brown Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Potato Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
