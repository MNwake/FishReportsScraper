Bluegills are present in good numbers at 27.25/trapnet.  Growth is good for bluegills.  Northern pike were not sampled in this assessment.  Largemouth bass are known to be present and an excellent hatch was observed, although this is not reflected in the shoreline seining catches.  Rough fish are present in very low numbers.  Fishing pressure is considered light to moderate.  \n</p>",

The current Lake Management Plan listed Northern Pike and Black Crappie as primary management species while Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were listed as a secondary species.  Water clarity was poor on June 3rd, with a secchi disk reading of 2.1 feet.  Little Swan's lakeshed (328 acres) was dominated (59%) by pasture.   Approximately 62% of the shoreline was developed with private homes and lawns.  Coontail was the only submergent vegetation that was ranked as abundant.  Yellow water lilies were common on Little Swan.  The aquatic plant community was of a moderate diversity and better than many other area lakes.  The maximum depth at which submergent vegetation was found was 14.1 feet.  For shoalwater substrates, sand was common.  Most of the shoreline that could be developed was, with 33 homes/cabins being counted.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not gill netted in 2013, but 1 was sampled in a trap net and that fish was 24.1 inches long.  Walleye were last stocked in 1997 and a substantial fishery has not existed since the late 1990's.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 43 Northern Pike for a catch rate of 7.2/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2013 catch rate was the second highest on record for Little Swan Lake.  The last three catch rates indicated a slightly increasing trend in abundance for Northern Pike.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) ranged from 1.3 to 9.8/net with an average of 4.1.   In 2013, gill netted Northern Pike were 20.1 to 34.1 inches long with an averge of 24.7.  An impressive 16% (7 fish) of the gill net sample was 30 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled five fish that were 29\" or longer, with a maximum length of 35.9 inches.  Numbers, size distribution, and maximum lengths indicated that a quality population was present.  Northern Pike were age-2 through age-11 with 8 year-classes present.  Age-2 through age-5 fish were well represented, accounting for 91% of the gill net sample.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 95 Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 15.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 155.5/net with an average of 31.4.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 7.4 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Yellow Perch are likely an important forage item for predatory fish at Little Swan.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 285 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 47.5/net, which was above the normal range for a lake of this type.  Black Crappie were the most abundant fish sampled by the gill nets in 2013.  The 2003 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 1.8 to 47.5/net with an average of 15.1.  In 2013, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.3 to 8.4 inches long with an average of 5.5.  Trap nets sampled 60 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 6.7/net, which was within the normal range.  The 2003 trap net catch rate was similar at 5.3/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 1.7 to 29.4/net with an average of 10.5.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.5 to 12.99 inches long with an average of 8.5.  Approximately 40% of the trap net sample was 9 inches or longer.  Size distributions indicated that a quality population was present in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 417 Bluegill for a catch rate of 46.3/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in the trap nets.  The 2003 catch rate was similar at 32.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) were mostly moderate in size, ranging from 16.5 to 69.7/net with an average of 39.4.  In 2013, trap netted Bluegill were 3.1 to 7.3 inches long with an average of 5.6.  Approximately 3% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, while 42% were 6 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 60 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 72.0/hr of electrofisher on-time, which was the highest ever measured at Little Swan Lake.  The catch rate in 2009 was similar at 59.9/hr.  The three most recent catch rates indicated an increasing trend in abundance of Largemouth Bass at Little Swan Lake.  Catch rates from 1993 to 2013 (n=6) were somewhat similar, ranging from 34.7 to 72.0/hr of electrofisher on-time with an average of 50.8.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 5.7 to 21.3 inches long with an average of 13.2.  Approximately 45% of the catch was 15 inches or longer.  The length frequency distribution and good numbers of fish indicated that a high quality population was present.  Largemouth Bass were age-2 through age-16 with 11 year-classes being present.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 24 Black Bullhead in 2013 for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was below the normal range for a lake of this type.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2013 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 1.5 to 22.0/net with an average of 9.8.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 4.9 to 13.4 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Black Bullhead were not sampled in the trap nets in 2013.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2013 were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 17.6/net with an average of 2.9.        <br> \n <br> \nCarp were not sampled in 2013.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake is a 45 acre lake north of Dassel in Meeker County.  It has a maximum depth of 31 feet and good water quality.  It also has diverse fish and aquatic vegetation communities.  Little Swan Lake usually produces good catches of panfish and occasionally walleye and northern pike.  Many species of fish showed good numbers of younger individual which will provide good angling opportunities over the next few years.  A state-owned access ramp is on the west side off of county highway 4.  A fisheries survey conducted in 1996 sampled above average numbers of black crappie.  The large numbers of age 1 fish kept the average length under 6 inches, but should provide good angling in the next several years.  Similarly, bluegill catches were above normal with the average length under six inches.  Age 4 fish were the largest group, but there were also good numbers of age 2 fish which should provide good angling in the near future.  Good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  Average length was 11 inches with some fish over 15 inches sampled.  Catches of both black and yellow bullheads are consistently lower than average, but within the normal range for this class of lake.  Average lengths for both fish were over 10 inches with some fish over 13 inches sampled.  Yellow perch numbers have fluctuated, but were above average in 1996.  Again, good numbers of younger fish and good average size (over 7 inches) should provide angling opportunities for yellow perch in the near future.  Walleye numbers typically fluctuate, but were the highest ever sampled on Little Swan Lake.  These populations are maintained through stocking and the most recent stocking was fingerlings in 1992.  Average lengths were good at almost 17 inches with some fish over 24 inches being sampled.  Northern pike numbers also typically fluctuate.  This years catch was below average, but within the normal range.  Average lengths were good at 26 inches with fish over 34 inches being sampled.  The last time fish were stocked was 1989 as adults.</p>",

Three northerns (age 3) and one walleye (age 5) were taken during survey.  Growth seems to be above statewide average.  Spawning for these two species is poor to fair.  Four largemouth bass (age 3) were taken in trapnets.  The growth was somewhat slower than the state average.  There were a number of young of the year largemouth bass taken during shoreline seining.  Spawning areas are fair to good for largemouth bass.  There are good populations of panfish.  Bluegills were all in age group 3.  Black crappies and white crappies were divided between age groups 2 and 3.  Good numbers of young of the year pumpkinseeds and bluegills were taken during shoreline seining.  Spawning areas are good for panfish.  Most fishing is done for panfish.  There were very few bullheads taken if compared to other lakes in the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Little Swan Lake in Meeker County, with netting begining on 6/02/03, to evaluate the fish population.  Spring night-time electrofishing (EF), targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 4/29/03.  Little Swan Lake is 45 acres and has a maximum depth of 31 feet.  A small public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Water clarity was good (6.5 feet) in early June.  Yellow waterlily and coontail were two of the more abundant plants sampled in 2003.  Little Swan Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie.  Gill netting in 2003 indicated moderate numbers of northern pike (4.7/net) to be present, when compared to similar lakes across the state.  That catch rate was very close to the lakes historical (1975-2003) average of 5.0/net.  Pike were 19.9-33.1 inches long averaging 24.3 inches.  The EF assessment sampled 29 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 42.7/hour of electrofishing, indicating good numbers of bass for lakes in the Meeker and McLeod County area.  Not only were there good numbers, but there were also several big fish.  Largemouth bass were 4.0-20.2 inches long, averaging 10.8 inches and there were three fish over 19 inches.  Good numbers of bluegill were sampled with trap nets (32.8/net) in 2003, unfortunately most of them were small.  Only 4% of the fish sampled were 7 inches or longer.  The majority of the bluegill trap netted were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  A total of 48 black crappie were sampled (5.3/net) which was near the lakes historical average of 6.4/net.  Black crappie were 5.6-11.6 inches long averaging 7.5 inches in 2003.  Approximately 33% of the sample was 8 inches or longer.  A total of 3 walleye were sampled which indicates that the population is probably small.  Gill netted walleye were 19.2-21.3 inches long and were 7 and 8 years old.  Walleye were last stocked in 1997.  The present fish population looks fair to good for most species at Little Swan Lake.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan is a small sized lake (51 acres) located north of the City of Dassel in Meeker County. Little Swan has about one mile of shoreline and a maximum depth of 31 feet. A state-owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a very small amount of parking is present on the west shore. Water clarity is typically fair to moderate and submergent vegetation is often moderate in abundance at Little Swan. A spring trap netting survey was conducted during early June 2022. Trap nets were used to target Bluegill and Black crappie. Spring trap net data should not be compared to historical summer trap net data as summer nets often do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were collected and fish were 3 to 7 inches long, averaging 6 inches. Less than 1% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that most of the fish were on the small side. Bluegill were age-2 to age-9 with eight year classes being present. Bluegill anglers can find the sunfish throughout Little Swan's vegetation beds and lily pads.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were collected, averaging 7 inches in length. The longest crappie collected was just over 9 inches in length and very few of fish sampled reached that length. Black Crappie were age-2 to age-9 with seven year classes being present.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish were captured, averaging 6 inches in length. The longest Pumpkinseed Sunfish was just over 7 inches long. Only about 7% of the catch was 7 inches or longer. Pumpkinseed were age-2 to age-7 with five year classes being present. The same fishing techniques that catch Bluegill will also take Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake is a small lake of just 45 acres with a maximum depth of about 30 feet.  It has a diverse fish population that includes northern pike, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed and bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.       The 1993 survey had a northern pike catch that was below average for lakes of this type.  Historic catches of northern pike have fluctuated in Little Swan Lake and are currently low in many Hutchinson Area lakes.  This may be due to drought conditions of the late 1980's and northern pike numbers may rebound with increasing water levels.  Northern pike abundance may be affected in the long-term in many areas due to continuing ditching and draining of wetland areas, thereby reducing available spawning habitat.  Although northern pike numbers were low, several age classes of pike were present and the average length of northern pike taken in gillnets and trapnets was 25 and 32 inches, respectively.      Black bullhead (20 per gillnet) were near average for this lake type.  The average size of black bullhead (9.3 inches) was large enough to be attractive to anglers interested in fishing for this species.  Yellow bullhead were also present in low numbers, but averaged nearly 10 inches in length.       Bluegill sunfish abundance was above the lake class average and nearly one-third were longer than 6.5 inches.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be adequate and should provide for consistent angling success.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also present in average numbers, though most were less than six inches long.     Black crappie were abundant, but growth was slower than some area lakes and average length was about 8 inches.  Only one white crappie was captured in the survey.      Yellow perch numbers were high in the 1993 survey but most were not large enough to interest anglers.  The walleye gillnet catch of 3.5 per net was slightly above the lake class average but within the normal range for this lake.  Recent walleye stocking has consisted of fingerling stocking every other year. Walleye growth was good with fish reaching 15 inches by age three.  Average length of the walleye captured in gillnets was 18.3 inches.       Largemouth bass populations were assessed by spring electrofishing.  This effort captured 76 largemouth bass and nearly 90% were age two and three.  Growth was normal with age three bass averaging about nine inches long.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan is a small lake (51 acres) located north of the City of Dassel in Meeker County. A state-owned access with limited parking and a single cement boat ramp is present on the west shore. Little Swan has approximately one mile of shoreline and a maximum depth of thirty-one feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Little Swan is a class 30 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Little Mud and Dunns Lakes in Meeker County. Little Swan's 2014 lake management plan listed Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass as primary management species. Gill nets were set in 2023 to monitor the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Northern Pike were netted with fish averaging 27.7 inches in length. Approximately 70% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. Northern Pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats, population abundances and size structures. Three management zones were established for Northern Pike, with their own bag limit and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone, where Little Swan is found, anglers can keep up to ten Northern Pike, but no more than two fish can be longer than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released. Darkhouse spear fishermen are allowed to have one pike within the protected slot limit in their possession. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium and large sized pike.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were netted in 2023, with fish averaging 7 inches in length. Only 1% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer. The longest Black Crappie sampled in the summer gill nets was 9.5 inches. Low numbers of Yellow Perch were netted and most were small. Average length was 6.5 inches, and the longest perch sampled was 7.9 inches. Perch play an important role as forage in this lake. Walleye were not sampled in 2023 or in the previous survey's (2013) gill nets, and are possibly no longer present at Little Swan Lake. Walleye were last stocked in 1997. Low numbers of Bluegill were netted, but that species typically does not sample well in gill nets. Average length was 5.9 inches and maximum length was 7.1 inches. Very low numbers of Largemouth Bass were netted, but that species typically does not sample well in gill nets. Largemouth Bass were 9 and 15 inches long. Additional fishes sampled in the gill nets included Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n  <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNorthern pike numbers are above local, regional and state medians, with good growth in year classes 3, 4, and 5.  Access to adequate spawning area is limited to years of high spring water levels.  Numbers are maintained by stocking of adult and fingerling northern pike.  Walleye numbers are below local, regional and state medians.  Low numbers may indicate competition with other predator fish, such as northern pike and largemouth bass.  Numbers are maintained by alternate year stocking of fingerlings.  The status of the largemouth bass population is determined only from shoreline seining.  Natural reproduction is adequate, with year class 1 also represented.  Older year classes are poorly represented in trapnets and gillnets.  Bluegill numbers are above local, regional and state medians.  Growth is good in year classes 2, 4, and 5.  Bluegill natural reproduction was excellent in 1989.  History indicates that natural reproduction is erratic, and could explain the present weak year classes, 1 and 3.  During the last 10 years, bluegill numbers have decreased and black crappie numbers have increased.  Water quality, spawning habitat deterioration or predator-forage relationships might be involved in the decrease of bluegill.  Black crappie numbers are above state and regional medians, but below the area median.  Growth is good in year classes 1, 4, and 5.  It is hard to explain the steady rise of black crappie numbers in the last 10 years.  Natural reproduction appears to be poor or nonexistent.  However, year class success corresponds to gaps in shoreline seining data.  Bowfin, carp, black bullhead and white sucker don't pose serious limitations on gamefish success.  Numbers of hybrid sunfish are low, reflecting the low populations of green sunfish and pumpkinseeds.  Yellow perch numbers have decreased in the last 10 years.  The 1989 netting captured no yellow perch.  Absence of this forage species could affect major predator species.  Minnows are represented by four species.  Sand shiners are the most abundant minnow, with numbers adequate to supply forage for major predator species.</p>",
