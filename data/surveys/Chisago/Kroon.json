                "narrative": "<p>Kroon is a 192 acre, moderately fertile lake located in southern Chisago County. Although most of the lake is littoral with a mean depth of 5 feet, it has never winter killed in recent history. The lake is assigned to lake class 24 and is managed primarily for Northern Pike. No stocking is conducted on this lake and all populations are self-sustaining. Electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted in May and nets were set in June. The previous survey was conducted in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Northern Pike at a rate of 9.1 fish per net which exceeds the third quartile for the lake class. This rate was lower than the previous survey's rate of 12.8 fish per net. Mean weight also decreased from 4.47 lbs. to 1.82 lbs. This puts average size beneath the 25th percentile for the lake class. Fish ranged from 15.3 to 35.2 inches in length with an average of 20 inches. Only one fish exceeded 30 inches and only four exceeded 23 inches. One 39 inch long fish was sampled in the trap nets. All year classes from 2007 to 2014 were represented with the exception of 2008. Growth appears to be sufficient to produce larger fish but harvest may be playing a role in limiting the number of fish in the upper end of the population's size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught in low numbers averaging 1.1 fish per trap net. While the 4.6 fish per net catch in gill nets was higher, both are still lower than average for the lake class. Mean size in trap nets, 0.31 lbs., was about equal to the 75th percentile for the lake class. Fish ranged from 4.9 to 11.1 inches with a mean of 7.88. Catch of Black Crappies has historically been fairly low. Trap nets were often set in dense vegetation and may not have accurately reflected the abundance of crappies in this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was also low with a catch rate of 11.7 fish per net putting it below average for the lake class. Mean size was also low for the lake class. Fish ranged from 2.8 to 8.1 inches long and averaged 5.3 inches. Catch rates of Bluegill have been historically variable but this is the lowest recorded.  <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 65 fish per hour. This was much lower than the previous surveys rate of 108 fish per hour but similar to other surveys. Mean weight on the other hand nearly doubled from .78 lbs. to 1.4 lbs. Bass ranged in length from 8.7 to 20.2 inches and averaged 13.43 inches. Fifty seven percent of fish were clustered between 12 and 15 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Yellow Perch was sampled in this survey which is consistent with historical catch rates. Walleye have been caught in very low numbers in previous surveys but none were observed this time. Other species sampled were; Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, and Bowfin.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kroon Lake is a fertile 192-acre lake located in Chisago County just south of the town of Lindstrom.  A public water access is located off Chisago County Road 24 along the east shore of the lake.  Parking for 10 vehicles with trailers is available.  Kroon Lake has experienced only one partial fish winterkill in 1961/62 despite the lakes abundance of shallow water acreage.  The fishery in this lake is managed for northern pike primarily with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.A population assessment was conducted during the open water season of 1999 to evaluate the current status of the fish population.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing, six gill nets, nine trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  Northern pike numbers were above normal while the average weight, at 2.5 pounds, was within a normal range for this type of lake.  Lengths of captured northern pike ranged from 11.9 to 30.4 inches with 45% of the fish either at 22.0 inches or greater.  Northern pike growth was typical of normal.  Spring night electrofishing sampled 26 largemouth bass.  The 1999 bass catch rate was down from 1994; however, variability in water temperature during sampling years may have effected capture success in 1999.  The largemouth size structure was found to include fish from 5.4 to 16.2 inches with an average length of 12.0 inches.  Kroon Lake largemouth growth at all ages was determined to be normal.  All panfish species, bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and pumpkinseed sunfish, were found to be within a normal abundance range for a lake of this type.  Their lengths extended from 3.2 to 8.2, 3.6 to 10.2, and 3.4 to 7.7, respectively.  When compared to previous surveys, bluegill numbers decreased from high to normal abundance while black crappie numbers went from below normal to normal in abundance.  During the 1999 survey, five walleye with an average weight of 3.6 pounds were caught.  Walleye lengths extended from 20.4 to 24.1 inches.  Historical records indicated that walleye were only sampled during one other survey (1984) and previous stocking efforts did not include walleye stocking.  The origin of these fish probably occurred either from immigration via the outlet to Chisago Lake during high water periods or from unauthorized stocking.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were once again found in low numbers.  According to previous surveys, perch numbers have always been low.  Reproductive success for black crappie, bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass was good while northern pike and yellow perch showed some success.  Other fish species found during the survey included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.An angler fishing Kroon Lake may encounter an abundance of nice sized northern pike, an occasional nice largemouth bass or walleye, or smaller sized black crappie and bluegill sunfish.  Release of larger northern pike and largemouth bass is encouraged to enhance and maintain their current quality.  Because yellow perch numbers have consistently remained at low levels, northern pike probably are utilizing bluegill sunfish as their main food source.  Bluegill numbers may be decreasing as a result of high predation from a dense northern pike population.  If smaller pike are targeted during angler harvest instead of larger pike, this may decrease pressure on the bluegill population since larger northern pike are known to prey on smaller northern pike.  Kroon Lake lies within a highly developed watershed.  Water quality is influenced by land use within a surrounding watershed.  A decline in water quality can affect the overall health of a lake.  Because Kroon Lake is a lake with good fertility, additional nutrient input would decrease the quality of this lakes water and ultimatly its overall health.  Nutrient loading can be kept to a minimum by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline, updating failing or outdated lake-home septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer on surrounding lawns, agricultural fields or golf courses, limiting aquatic plant removal, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kroon is 192 acre lake located in southern Chisago County near Lindstrom.  The lake has a maximum depth of 30 feet. Seventy eight percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A state owned public boat access is located on the east side of the lake.  Much of the lakeshore has sand substrate and is fringed with cattail and lily pads.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and receives low to moderate angling pressure.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on 2009 field results, anglers should find good stocks of largemouth bass and northern pike.  Bass averaged 11.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Quality sized bass are available with 41% of measured fish breaking the 12 inch mark.  Northern pike were more abundant and with a larger average size than in the past three samples.  Most northern (61%) were between 22 and 28 inches in length.  Although bluegill abundance returned to a more historic level, size may be an issue with some anglers.  Few of the 189 bluegill measured exceeded 7 inches and none were over 8 inches.  Black crappie levels in the gill nets, while typical for lakes similar to Kroon, were lower than in the past three assessments.  Crappies were larger than in 2004 with 64% of the catch exceeding 7 inches.  Yellow perch were not sampled during the 2009 netting.  Their low abundance is likely an effect of the burgeoning northern pike population.  One large walleye was netted, likely a migrant from Chisago Lake.  Other species present in 2009 included; brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

The bluegill at 187.00 and pumpkinseed at 13.25 per set had extremely high and very high populations respectively.  The black crappie was low at 7.25 in the trapnet but was quite high in the gillnet at 28.33 per set.  The general panfish population would be considered as small size, with very few in the good to large size class.  The bowfin was very high at 3.25 per set, while the white sucker was low at 0.17.  The yellow bullhead was about average with the black and brown bullheads having low populations of good to large size fish.  The golden shiner was also low at 2.0 per set.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> In June 1989 a population assessment was conducted on Kroon Lake.  Four (4) gillnets and four (4) trapnets were set to obtain data of the present fish population.  Shoreline seining efforts were conducted in late August to evaluate natural reproduction of the present fish population.\n  Based on respective local medians from test net indices, the present fish population is as follows: the northern pike (10.75/set) net catch was up from the previous survey catch (5.67/set) in 1984 and remained above the local median catch (3.50/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 16.0 to 38.9 inches with a median length group of 25.0-25.9 inches.  The mean weight was 4.4 pounds compared to 4.0 pounds from the previous survey.  The northern pike was represented by age groups III-IX taken in the test nets.  These fish exhibited normal growth when compared to statewide averages.\n  The largemouth bass (1.00/set) net catch was up from the previous survey catch (0.25/set) and local median catch (0.29/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.5 to 13.9 inches.  Age groups II-V were represented by the net catches.\n  The bluegill sunfish (87.50/set) net catch was down considerably from the previous survey (187.00/set) but remained well above the local median catch (20.00/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.  Age groups II-VI were represented by the net catches.\n  The pumpkinseed sunfish (9.50/set) was down from the previous survey (13.25/set) but remained above the local median catch (3.00/set).  The length group frequency ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.  Age groups II-VI were represented by the net catches.\n  The green sunfish (0.25/set) net catch was considered low and this was a reflection of how the species has been doing in Kroon Lake over the years.  Hybridization seems to occur frequently among the sunfish species (bluegill, pumpkinseed, and green).  These crosses were observed and recorded in the net catches listed as hybrid sunfish (10.50/set). \n  The black crappie (2.00/set) net catch was down from the previous survey (7.25/set) and fell below the local median catch (5.75/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 6.5-6.9 inches.  Age groups II-V were represented by the net catches.\n  The yellow perch was absent in all of the test netting gear.  Historically they have been caught in very low numbers.\n  One walleye was caught in a trapnet.  It measured in the 21 inch length group and was of age X (ten).  Walleyes have not been stocked in Kroon Lake by the State of Minnesota.  The presence of walleyes in this lake are most likely due to other sources.\n  Five (5) other species were taken in the test nets (bowfin, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead) and were not substantially above or below their respective local median net catches.  All bullhead species were considered to be fairly large (in length) in comparison to other area lakes.  Length ranges of 10 to 14 inches was the norm. \n  Shoreline seining efforts recorded a copious amount of young-of-year bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kroon is 192 acre lake located in southern Chisago County near Lindstrom.  Despite an increase in lake shore developement, water clarity and phosphorus levels have improved since the 1994 analysis.  A public boat access is located on the east side of the lake.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and recieves low to moderate angling pressure.  Based on 2004 field results, anglers should find good stocks of largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill.  Bass averaged 11.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Quality sized bass are available with 28% of measured fish breaking the 15 inch mark.  Although bluegill were also abundant, size may be an issue with some anglers.  Few of the 586 bluegill caught in the trap nets exceeded 7 inches and none were over 8 inches.  Northern pike were more abundanct with a larger average size than in the past two assessments.  Most northerns were between 22 and 26 inches in length.  Black crappie remain at typical levels for Kroon and similar lakes.  Most crappies were under 7 inches long which may not appeal to all anglers.  Yellow perch abundance was the highest recorded since 1962.  The bulk of the perch (77%) were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches and should provide an additional forage base for bass and northerns.  Three large walleye were netted.  They likely migrated from Chisago Lake.  Other species present in 2004 included; black, brown, and yellow bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and logperch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kroon Lake fish populations appear to fall within the normal range for its lake type, with a species complex indicative of a healthy system.  Northern pike, the primary species for which the lake is managed ranged from 15 to 30 inches, with a mean of 20.2 inches.  Northerns have declined  somewhat in number and size from the last (1989) survey.  Largemouth bass populations are best assessed by electrofishing.  This survey's  catch of  69.3 fish per hour on-time electrofishing seems good, although indices that could be used to compare electrofishing catch rates for specific lake types have not yet been developed.  Largemouth bass caught by electrofishing ranged from 7 to 17 inches with a mean of 11.2 inches.  Largemouth catch per set in gillnet was high for the lake type.  Young of the year  largemouth were present in shoreline seining, indicating that some reproduction took place in 1994.  Bluegill numbers per trapnet set were normal for the lake type, and averaged 6.6 inches.  Bluegills were somewhat less abundant than in previous assessments, but typically somewhat larger in size.  Black crappie numbers per trapnet set were similar to the 1989 assessment, and somewhat higher than in the 1984 and  1978 surveys, but within the normal range for the lake type in all cases.  Bluegill and black crappie also reproduced in 1994.  Young of the year of both species were captured in shoreline seining. Discussion and Status written by Steve Morse.  </p>",
