                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 918 acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota. Big Portage Lake has 7.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. The lake has extensive vegetation with 98 percent of the lake area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes. There is a public access on the east shore off of State Highway 87.  <br> \nBig Portage Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of fish species.  Northern pike are abundant with quality size fish present. The average length of pike sampled in 2012 was 19 inches with fish up to 35 inches captured.  Bluegill abundance is average compared to similar lakes in the area. A few fish over 8 inches in length were sampled in 2012 but the majority were between 5 and 7.5 inches. Walleye numbers are below average with larger fish present. The average length of walleye sampled was 18 inches and fish up to 26 inches were sampled.  Historically black crappie abundance has been low, but the 2012 sample saw better numbers than previous years. Fish up to 13 inches long were caught.  Because the lake has extensive areas of shallow water with an abundance of vegetation, largemouth bass have been difficult to sample. The same probably could be said for bluegill and black crappie. There was only one largemouth bass caught in the 2012 sampling, it was 16 inches long. Historically, largemouth bass have been sampled up to 19 inches in length.  Yellow perch numbers are similar to other Lake Class 39 lakes with fish up to 10 inches in length present.  Other species sampled were bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Portage Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 918-acre lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  It is located one mile north and three miles east of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources hasclassified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Portage Lake is in lake class 39.  Approximately 98% of the lake is fifteen feet or less in depth. There is a DNR public access on the east shore just off of state highway 87.Northern pike abundance was similar to that found in past surveys as well as that in other  lake class 39 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 10 to 30 inches with a average length and weight of 19.9 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Natural reproduction was consistent with several different year classes represented in the sample.  There is excellent spawning habitat around the entire lake.  In the spring, the abundant wild rice provides an excellent place for northern pike eggs to adhere, develop, and hatch.Walleye abundance has been consistent during all the surveys and was also typical of other lake class 39 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 12 - 25 inches with an average length and weight of19.4 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Forty-eight percent of the sampled fish were 20 inches or longer. There were many year classes present in the sample.  Fisheries surveys have shown that BigPortage Lake walleye have good natural reproduction and stocking is not needed to sustain their population.  There has been no stocking since 1991.  Growth was good with a five-year-old fish being 18 inches in length. Largemouth bass sampled in the 1997 survey ranged in length from 5 to 18 inches with an average length and weight of 10.0 inches and 0.8 pound.  There was good natural reproduction occurring with a variety of year classes present in the sampled fish.Black crappie abundance was good and was typical of other lake class 39 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 8.1 to 12.6 inches with an average length and weight of 10 inches and 0.6 pound. Three-  and six-year-old fish made up 83% of the sampled fish.  Growth was good with an age five fish being 10 inches in length.Bluegill abundance was typical of previous surveys and typical of other lake class 39 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 3.5 to 9.8 inches with an average length and weight of 6.7 inches and 0.3pound.  The size of the bluegill sampled in 1997 has not changed since the first survey in 1962. Thirty-four percent of the sampled fish were eight inches or larger.Yellow perch abundance was comparable to past surveys and typical of other lake class 39 lakes. Yellow perch are being utilized as a food fish by predator fish.  Fish ranged in length from 3.2 to 9.8 inches with an average length and weight of 7.3 inches and 0.18 pound.Other fish sampled were bowfin, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.There has been a fourfold increase in the number of lake homes on Big Portage Lake since 1962. With more homes being constructed the lake, it is important that lakeshore owners manage theirshoreline in a natural condition.To help maintain quality fish populations in Big Portage Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Big Portage Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.  More detailed information on protecting shoreline habitat is available from your local DNR fisheries office.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fishpopulation and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 918-acre lake located near Backus, MN that has 7.0 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  There is a DNR public access on east shore just off of State Highway 87.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39; lakes in this class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, bluegill, and walleye and secondarily for black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.    Walleye population in Big Portage Lake has been stable since 1962.  The size of walleye sampled ranged from 9 to 27 inches with mean length of 16 inches.  Currently, the 1996 and 1999 year-classes of walleyes are the most represented in Big Portage Lake.  Northern pike ranged from 11 to 32 inches.  Though most bluegill were small (average length - 5 inches), individuals up to 9 inches were found.Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bowfin, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Big Portage Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 918-acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota. Big Portage Lake has 7.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. The lake has extensive weed beds with 98 percent of the lake area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes. There is a public access on the east shore off of State Highway 87.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Portage Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of fish species.  Northern pike are abundant with quality-size fish present. The average length of fish sampled in 2007 was 21 inches with fish over 36 inches in length in the sample.  Bluegill abundance is low. Few fish over 8 inches in length were sampled in 2007. The lake has had a history of producing bluegill up to 10 inches in length.  Walleye are moderately abundant. Larger fish are present and the average length of sampled fish in 2007 was 21 inches with fish up to 26 inches sampled.  Black crappie abundance is low. No fish greater than 10 inches were sampled in this survey. Historically fish have been sampled up to up to 13.0 inches in length.  Because the lake has extensive areas of shallow water with an abundance of vegetation, largemouth bass have been difficult to sample. The same probably could be said for bluegill and black crappie. The average length of sampled largemouth bass in 2007 was 9 inches and the lengths ranged from 5 to 13. inches. Historically, largemouth bass have been sampled up to 19.0 inches in length.  Yellow perch are abundant with fish up to approximately 10 inches in length present.  Other species sampled were bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Big Portage Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 902-acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota. Big Portage Lake has 7.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. The lake has extensive vegetation with 98 percent of the lake area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes. There is a public access on the east shore off of State Highway 87. Similar Lake Class 39 lakes in the Walker area include Little Sand (11-0092) and Town Line (11-0190). The purpose of this survey was to assess Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch populations. <br> \n <br> \nBig Portage Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of fish species.  Northern Pike are abundant with quality size fish present. The average length of pike sampled in 2017 was 18 inches with fish up to 35 inches captured.  Walleye numbers were near average with larger fish present. The average length of Walleye sampled was 20 inches and fish up to 25 inches were present.  Yellow Perch numbers are similar to other Lake Class 39 lakes with fish up to 12 inches in length present.  Because the lake has extensive areas of shallow water with abundant vegetation, Largemouth Bass have been difficult to sample, as well as Bluegill and Black Crappie. There were only five Largemouth Bass caught in the 2017 sampling and the lengths ranged from 9 to 12 inches. Historically, Largemouth Bass have been sampled up to 19 inches in length.  Sunfish abundance is average compared to similar lakes in the area. No trap nets were used to sample Sunfish and Black Crappie in 2017; previous surveys have observed most Sunfish were between 5 and 7.5 inches long with large individuals present. Historically Black Crappie abundance has been low, but the 2017 sample saw better numbers in gill nets than in previous years with fish up to 10 inches long being caught.  Other species sampled were Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Portage Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage Lake is a 902-acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota. Big Portage Lake has 7.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. The lake has extensive vegetation with 98 percent of the lake area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes. There is a public access on the east shore off of State Highway 87.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Portage Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of fish species.  The purpose of this assessment was to determine the status of the Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations in Big Portage Lake. Bluegill abundance is average compared to similar lakes in the area. A few fish over 8 inches in length were sampled in 2016 but the majority were between 5 and 8 inches. Bluegill sampled in the 2016 spring assessment averaged 7 inches long and lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches. A total of twenty-five largemouth bass were sampled from trap nets and electrofishing. Most largemouth Bass in the sample were less than 10 inches long, but four fish were longer than 15 inches. Largemouth Bass average length was 9 inches and lengths ranged from 6 to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Portage Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website ( www.dnr.state.mn.us ) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Portage (Rice Portage) Lake is a 902-acre lake with 7.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet located northeast of Backus, MN. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Portage Lake is in Lake Class 39. Other area lakes in this class include Brockway, Island (Bucker) and Townline. A State-owned public access is located on the south shore and most of the lakeshore is privately owned. Big Portage Lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Bluegill and Walleye, and secondarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. A special regulation for Sunfish (daily limit 10 fish, 20 in possession) and Black Crappie (daily limit 5 fish, 10 in possession) was implemented in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Portage Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity. Northern Pike abundance met management goals with fish ranging in length from 10 to 34 inches and averaging 19 inches long. Bluegill abundance met management goals with an average length of seven inches and fish up to nine inches long sampled. Walleye were sampled in low numbers and did not meet the management goal. Walleye averaged 24 inches long and fish ranging from 21 to 28 inches were sampled. Black Crappie ranged in length from four to 12 inches long. Largemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers with an average of length of 15 inches and fish ranging from 12 to 19 inches. Management goals for Largemouth Bass are based on spring electro-fishing which was not conducted in 2023. Yellow Perch catches did not meet management goals. Sampled perch ranged from five to nine inches and averaged six inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Portage Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
