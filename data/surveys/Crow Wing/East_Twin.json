Average size was 18.6\" and 2.2 lbs. and all of the fish were 16\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was average (12.0/gill net).  Size averaged 19.2\" and 1.6 lbs., with 8% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass catch rate was average in gill nets (0.8/gill net) and high in trap nets (1.8/trap net).  With both sampling gears combined, 53% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was average (35.9/trap net).  Average length was 7.6\" and 80% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  The higher numbers of big fish could have been due to the fact that we were sampling in early summer when the larger fish are in shallow to reproduce. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were caught in average numbers (2.2/gill net).  Length averaged 8.0\" and 64% of the fish were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Only one black crappie was captured. <br> \n</p>",

Average size dropped from 4.1 lb in 1986 to 1.95 lb. in 1991. Median size also fell 2 inches to 20 14-30 age 3 and 25% age 4.  Growth was good for all age classes.  Walleye catch rose to the lower quartile (0.67/gillnet).  The two fish caught were 17 and aged to the 1986 year class, the last year fry stocking.  Largemouth bass abundance remained high (3.75/trap- net) and was similar to 1986 (3.0/trap).  Only younger fish were sampled in trapnets.  Age 2 and 3 were present and growth bordered on slow.  Bluegill remained abundant (123.5/trapnet).  Average size fell from 0.18 lb. in 1986 to 0.14 lb., the same as in 1981.  Median lengths (6.0 7.9 measured fish at least 7.0 inches long has risen to 18% in 1991 compared to 12% in 1986 and 10% in 1981.  Black crappie abundance fell from 3.25/trapnet in 1986 to 0.75/trap in 1991 but remained for the lake class.  As seen in previous nettings, only a few year classes were sampled, suggesting typically variable spawning success.  Yellow perch were not sampled in 1991, after being caught at a rate of 14.3/gillnet in 1986.  Yellow perch were also absent from the catch in 1974 but were caught at a rate of 15.67/gillnet in 1981.  This pattern suggests an inherent instability in the perch population.</p>",

A public access is located on the west side.  Water clarity is excellent with a secchi disk reading of 20'. <br> \n <br> \nAn average of 70 lbs of walleye fingerlings are stocked by private citizens into East Twin in odd-numbered years.  The walleye gillnet catch of 2.7/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in size from 13.2\"-22.4\", with an average length of 17.4\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers in gillnets at 11.2/net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 19.4\", with only 4% at least 24\" in length. New northern pike regulations effective March 1st, 2018 include a possession limit of 10 fish.  Only 2 may be over 26\" and all fish between 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the harvest opportunity for pike and improve the fish community composition. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring night electrofishing at a rate of 65.5/hr run time indicating a moderate density.  Average length was 13.2\", with 67% at least 12\" in length.  Gillnets sampled largemouth bass in average numbers at 1.0/gillnet.  Average length was 13.9\". <br> \n <br> \nTrapnets sampled bluegills in average numbers at 15.6/net.  Some nicer bluegills are available with an average length of 6.3\".  Bluegills at least 7\" in length made up 29% of the catch.  Black crappies were sampled in low numbers in both net types, with 40% of the crappies sampled measuring at least 8\" in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in East Twin Lake, but they are located in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 45'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore survey took place on 25 July 2017, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at six stations, with the 50' 1/8th inch seine used at an additional two sites.  Two sites had heavy vegetation which prohibited seining.  In total 12 species were sampled including intolerant species, Iowa darter, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, blackchin shiner, and mimic shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 19-21 June 2017 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of East Twin Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Twin is a 146 acre lake located about two miles north of Nisswa.  A public access is present on the west shore.  The lake has an maximum depth of about 45 feet.  Roughly 61% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for this area.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand.  A relatively diverse aquatic plant community is present.  Emergent aquatics, like bulrush, are present and enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish, as well as helping to maintain water quality.  Submerged plants provide important food resources and cover for a variety of fish species in the lake.Northern pike and largemouth bass were caught in high numbers in 1996 when compared to similar type lakes.  Both species have usually been caught in high numbers in testnettings conducted periodically since 1960.  Pike averaged 19.8 inches and 1.6 lbs. in size.  The 1993 year class was the strongest of those sampled.  Pike had good growth rates.Walleye numbers continued to be low in '96 when compared to similar type lakes.  The catch rate in five of the six nettings done on the lake, including '96, was less than one fish per gillnet lift.  This low catch has persisted in spite of consistent stocking efforts from 1982-1993.Largemouth bass continued to be abundant in '96.  A majority of bass netted were from the strong 1993 year class.  Bass continued to show slow growth.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996.  Most previous catch rates were well into the \"high\" category, when compared to similar type lakes.  As in the past, bluegill growth was slow.  Strongest year classes sampled were 1992 and 1989.  Only about 3% of trapnetted bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length in '96.Yellow perch are an important food source for predator fish like walleyes, northern pike and largemouth bass.  Perch were caught in low numbers in '96, and were not sampled in 1991.  Past catches of perch have ranged from 0-34 perch/gillnet.  Present low perch catches may be partially due to large numbers of predator fish in the lake and excessive competition with other panfish species.</p>",
