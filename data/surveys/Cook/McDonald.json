                "narrative": "<p>The 2004 walleye catch in McDonald Lake was low, both for a lake of this class and for this lake historically.  Although there had been some walleye reproduction, it did not appear that it had been enough to produce any strong year classes recently.  Equally low walleye catches were observed when the lake was regularly stocked with walleye.  The northern pike catch in 2004 was high for a lake of this type, and it was one of the higher catches observed in this lake in recent assessments.  Most of the northern pike collected were young fish (two or three years of age), and most were under 20 inches in length.  The smallmouth bass catch was about average for this lake, and for the lake class.  Half of the smallmouth bass collected were 12 inches in length or larger (up to 17.9 inches), and growth rates had been relatively fast.Yellow perch were fairly abundant, and many were large enough to provide some angling opportunity.  The relatively high yellow perch catch contributed to fast growth rates observed for walleye and northern pike in this lake in 2004.  White sucker were also present, although the 2004 catch was relatively low.  Most of the white sucker were too large to have been preyed on by even the largest northern pike in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McDonald Lake is about 15 miles northwest of the City of Grand Marais. There is a signed parking area and carry-in trail off the south side Forest Road 153 which provides lake access. McDonald Lake is an Ecological Class 15 Lake; lakes of that class typically have a shallow maximum depth (less than 15 feet), very irregular shorelines, and very soft bog-stained water.  <br> \n <br> \nMcDonald Lake has been managed for Northern Pike and Smallmouth Bass since 2009. The 2017 standard survey of McDonald Lake was the first of two scheduled in the 2009 lake management plan (LMP) to monitor the status of these populations, and to determine if the Walleye population could recover naturally from historic lows observed prior to 2009. The current long-range goals for Northern Pike are to maintain population with a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/net, with a minimum mean weight of 1.4 lb/fish. Goals for the Smallmouth Bass population are to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 1.5 fish/net, with a minimum mean weight of 1.5 lb/fish.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, McDonald Lake has produced average numbers of small-medium sized Northern Pike. The 2017 Northern Pike gill net catch failed to meet the abundance goal for the species, although the size goal was met. Northern Pike sampled in 2017 ranged from 17 to 22.5 inches in length, and included three to six-year-old Northern Pike. Growth rates of Northern Pike had been about average; fish reached a mean length of 16.5 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an average of 16.2 inches for similar lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass remained fairly abundant in McDonald Lake in 2017, and should have provided quality angling opportunities for medium-large sized fish. Both the abundance and size goals for the population were met in this survey. A total of six year classes of Smallmouth Bass were present in the gill net sample, with the 2012 year class appearing most abundant. Those fish reached an average length of 13.9 inches at the end of their fifth year, which was comparable to growth observed in similar lakes in the area. <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye gill net catch improved slightly over more recent survey results, but remained much lower than gill net catches observed prior to 1998. The gill net catch included a wide variety of sizes (range 7.7-23.2 inches) and ages, with fish from one to nine years old collected. All Walleye sampled in this survey were the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Yellow Perch are the primary forage species present in McDonald Lake. Gill net catches for both species in 2017 fell into normal ranges for lakes of this type. Results from this survey also suggested the Yellow Perch population may have provided a bonus fishery for anglers. Over half the Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets in 2017 surpassed eight inches in length, and the catch included fish up to 11 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish community of McDonald Lake was also sampled during this survey using nine small-mesh beach seine hauls at various locations. Prior to 2017, McDonald Lake was known to support Blacknose Shiner, Central Mudminnow, Longnose Dace, and Pearl Dace in addition to the Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker populations. The 2017 survey added Golden Shiner and Bluegill to that list. Bluegill found McDonald Lake likely originated from the Two Island Lake population, which has been established for many years and is located one lake upstream in the watershed. Established Bluegill populations are rare in the Grand Marais area, so it remains to be seen if a Bluegill fishery will develop in McDonald Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in McDonald Lake. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota AIS laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",

It appeared that walleye were able to reproduce naturally in this lake, and that fry stocking was failing to improve, or even maintain, walleye abundance.  Walleye growth was relatively fast.Northern pike were present in good numbers, but most of the fish collected in 1998 were two years of age, and few fish older than three years were found.  Northern pike growth had also been fast.Smallmouth bass were present in good numbers, and their average size was excellent.  Smallmouth bass growth rates also appeared to have been fast, and several naturally produced year classes were present.Yellow perch were present in numbers sufficient to provide a good forage base for walleye and northern pike, and in sizes large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Yeloow perch growth had also been fairly fast for this area.</p>",

There appeared to have been virtually no survival of stocked walleye fry, and little or no reproduction.Smallmouth bass abundance appeared to have been good, and the quality of the population seemed to have been excellent.  Smallmouth bass growth rates had been good.  Although sample sizes were small, mean lengths for age-3, 4, 5, and 6 fish all exceeded area means.The northern pike catch in 2001 was close to the median for the lake class, and was similar to past catches in this lake.  Average size of the fish taken was low, due to a lack of older fish in the catch.  No fish older than age 4 were collected, but it appeared that the 1999 and 1998 year classes had been strong.  Northern pike growth rates had been about average for the area.The yellow perch catch was about average for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically, but the size of the fish collected was excellent.  Most of the catch was over nine inches in length.</p>",
