                "narrative": "<p>Middle Spunk Lake is a 236-acre general development lake located partly within the City of Avon in north central Stearns County.  The lake is deep (81 feet) and clear (secchi depth nine feet).   Aquatic vegetation was found growing to a maximum depth of 19 feet.  Muskgrass was the only species of 38 aquatic plants that was common in abundance.  Curly leaf pondweed was found growing at or near the surface on 1.3 acres, or less than 1% of the lake, in June.   <br> \n\t <br> \nThis was the first survey since 1998.  Gill net catches of northern pike and walleye declined significantly; and no yellow perch were taken. <br> \n <br> \nThe net catch of northern pike declined but the average weight increased.  Anglers can expect to catch fish more that average three pounds. Northern pike ranged in length from 16 to 32 inches.  Forty-three percent of northern pike were greater than 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for walleye was 0.50/lift, a significant decline from 1998.  At this level of abundance only a rare walleye will show up in the creel.  Yet walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly since 1946 and every other year since 1987.  All of the Spunk Lakes showed low catches of walleye (<2/lift) in 2008.   <br> \n  <br> \nNo yellow perch were taken during the survey.  This is critical considering the importance of perch in the diet of northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBass were sampled by electrofishing at night on June 4, 2008.  A total of 50 largemouth and three smallmouth bass were captured.  The catch rates were similar to the average catch rate of Stearns County lakes.  Anglers can expect to catch largemouth bass of all sizes up to 18 inches.   Largemouth grew to 12 inches in six years. <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Spunk Lake is the last lake in the Montrose Area to support a significant tullibee population.  Tullibee from ages 5-7 were absent.  Otherwise, year classes 2-4 and 8-11 were represented.  A late-summer temperature-oxygen profile done on August 10, 2006, measured five mg/l of dissolved oxygen down to only 18 feet (69.6?F).  There seems to be little in the way of cool water habitat at Middle Spunk Lake.       <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant in trap nets but black crappie were not.  The average bluegill was five inches long and weighed 0.1 pounds.  Bluegill grew to six inches in six years.  Only five black crappie were collected in 2008: two in gill nets and three in trap nets.  Black crappie catches have been historically low except for 1987 when the catch was above average. <br> \n <br> \nNongame fish collected were black and yellow bullhead, white sucker, hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin, rock bass, and carp.  Sensitive minnow species captured were banded killifish, and blacknose and blackchin shiners.</p>",

The lake is 81 feet deep and a public access is located on the north east side of the lake.\n\nThe number of Northern Pike caught was similar to the catch in 1981 and above the local average. The one through five year old fish sampled had good growth but the average weight dropped from 3.5 lbs in 1981 to 1.5 lbs.  In the 1975 survey, Northern Pike were 2.3/gill net. Bluegill abundance has increased six times since 1981. Four to six inch long fish make up 87% of the sample and have slow growth. Hybrid sunfish remained abundant and Pumpkinseed remained average since 1981. Green Sunfish declined from abundant numbers to an average 0.8/trap net. Rock Bass were present at 1.5/trap net. Black Crappie numbers increased from scarce in the two previous surveys to near average for this are.  Three and four year old fish were represented, and the 1984 year class was dominant. Growth was good. Walleye abundance remained average and was similar to 1981. The average weight of the fish sampled was 2.1 lbs. Some natural reproduction was indicated with the presence of 1986 and 1985 year classes in the catch. No 1981 or 1982 fish were caught and 1980 was the oldest year class represented. The growth for these fish was good. The electrofishing catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 9.2/hour. Our observations and expectations are that bass are more abundant than the survey data shows. Cisco are present at 3.7/gill net but appear to have declined from 1975 abundance. White Sucker and Yellow Perch populations increased from scarce in previous nettings to the average range for this area. Black and Yellow Bullhead catches were similar to the previous survey. Common Carp abundance appeared scarce and down from 1.9/ trap net in 1981 while Bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in average numbers. Seven snapping turtles were caught in 1987 compared to one in 1981.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Spunk Lake is a 236-acre lake located partly within the City of Avon in north central Stearns County.  The lake is 81 feet deep and a public access is located on the north east side of the lake.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance increased to rate of 8.2/gill net which is at the upper limit of the normal range for similar lakes.  Five age classes were sampled and growth rates appeared to be average.  Walleye abundance also increased from the previous survey but remained below average. Five age classes were sampled with age 2 and 3 Walleye being most abundant and growth rates were average. The Cisco (tullibee) decreased dramatically since the 1975 survey. The Yellow Perch catch rate declined in gill nets since the 1975 survey, but shoreline seining showed that reproduction and abundance were similar.  Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at rate of 53.3/net which exceeded the range expected for similar lakes.  Black Crappie were sampled at a rate of 0.6/trap net, which is below the expected range for lakes like Middle Spunk. \n\nThe rough fish population is at or below average abundance with the exception of Common Carp.  Length frequency data showed several years classes present.  Common Carp were sampled in trap nets at a rate exceeding the range typical of similar lakes. One adult Common Carp sampled, while the rest appeared to be mostly yearlings.  \n\nOther species sampled in low numbers included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish) hybrid and Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Spunk Lake is a 236 acre lake located within the city limits of Avon in central Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 81 feet and a large watershed dominated by row crops, forest, and pasture. A city owned public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake. Middle Spunk Lake is managed for Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2008. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and large Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation covered more than half of the shoreline in August, primarily cattail, waterlily, and bulrush. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but chara and coontail were the dominant species in 2008. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 10.5 feet in late June and MPCA data show an average summer Secchi depth of 13 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 35 feet in late June. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were higher than 2008 and above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 13.9 to 35.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds. Northern Pike were smaller compared to the last survey; only  <br> \n16% were 24 inches or longer in 2016, compared to 43% in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches have historically been low in Middle Spunk Lake despite regular fingerling stocking for many years. Only four Walleye were captured during the 2016 survey; this is below the expected range of values for lakes like Middle Spunk and similar to results in 2008. Walleye ranged in length from 18.5 to 25 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 4.2 pounds. Due to continued poor returns from our Walleye stocking, Middle Spunk Lake will no longer be stocked with Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at night on May 26. The catch rate of 56/hour was below the Sauk Rapids nighttime average of 74/hour and the 2008 result of 68/hour. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 4.4 to 17.8 inches with an average length of 10.4 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 10% were longer than 15 inches. The Smallmouth Bass catch was lower (16/hr), but most were longer than 16 inches and three exceeded 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Spunk Lake is one of the few lakes in the Sauk Rapids Area to support a Tullibee population. However, the Tullibee catch was lower than in 2008 and the lowest recorded from all surveys. Tullibee lengths ranged from 7.5 to 14.6 inches with a mean length of 10.1 inches. Tullibee need cold, well oxygenated water; a warmer climate may be hindering Tullibee survival. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher than 2008, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 2.5 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 4.9 inches. Black Crappie numbers were below the expected range and similar to 2008. Black crappie lengths ranged from 7.6 to 8.3 inches, with an average length of 8.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly four Yellow Perch were caught in the survey; perch abundance is likely hindered by high numbers of Northern Pike. Other species captured included: Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted on Middle Spunk Lake in August; results from this survey will be summarized in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Spunk Lake is a 236-acre lake located partly within the City of Avon in north central Stearns County.  The lake is 81 feet deep and a public access is located on the north east side of the lake.\n\nPrincipal species sampled in gill nets included Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass.  Other species sampled included Cisco, White Sucker, and Rock Bass.  Northern Pike catch (3.0/gill net) was significantly lower than during the 1987 assessment, but was still within expected ranges for lake class 24.  Growth was average for a Minnesota lake, and fish 14 to 37 inches long, from age classes 1 through 8, were sampled.  Mean weight (3.8 lb.) was above the expected range and had increased from 1987 (1.5 lb.).  The catch rate of Walleyes (3.33/gill net) was significantly higher than in 1987, but was still within expected values.  Walleye from 9.5 to 24 inches, age 2 through 5, were sampled. Growth rates were average, and average weight (1.5 lb.) was within expected values.  The Yellow Perch catch showed a significant increase, from 2.0/gill net in 1987, to 22.0/gill net in 1992, but was still within expected values.  Average weight (0.1 lb.) was below the expected range, and modal length was 5.5 to 5.9 inches.  Three shoreline seine hauls on 9/1/92 captured 94 young of the year Yellow Perch.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in numbers within the expected values for lake class 24.  Average weight (0.5 lb.) was within expected values and growth rate was average.  Fish from 5.5 to 13.9 inches were captured.  Sixty-six young of the year Largemouth Bass were sampled with shoreline seines.  White Sucker and Rock Bass were sampled in numbers within the expected range, while Cisco were sampled in numbers ten times the third quartile value.  Cisco, White Sucker, and Rock Bass were all of average size for lake class 24.  Principal species taken in trap nets included Bluegill and Black Crappie. Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and Bowfin (dogfish) were also taken in trap nets.  Bluegill catch (65.9/trap net) was within expected levels and appeared unchanged from previous surveys.  Average weight (0.1 lb.) was within expected values, and 88% of the fish sampled in trap nets were between 4.0 and 6.4 inches.  Ninety-six young of the year and age 1 Bluegill were sampled with shoreline seines.  Black Crappie were sampled in numbers below the expected range for lake class 24, but numbers have been low historically. Average weight was within expected values, and fish from 6.0 to 10.4 inches were sampled.  Pumpkinseed and Green Sunfish were taken in numbers, and at weights, that were within expected values.  Both populations appear to have remained stable.  All fish sampled were from 3.5 to 5.4 inches long.  Low numbers of Hybrid Sunfish, from 3.0 to 7.4 inches long, were also sampled.  Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead were all sampled in low numbers and all appeared to have remained at a stable level since previous samplings.  Forage species sampled included Emerald and Spottail Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Banded Killifish, Brook Silverside, and Iowa, and Johnny Darters.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Relative abundance estimates of fish from 1998 gill net sets consisted of five major species:tullibee (cisco) (15.50/lift), rock bass (4.00/lift), northern pike (2.17/lift), walleye (1.83/lift), andyellow perch (1.17/lift).  Tullibee abundance was above expected  values, rock bassabundance was higher than the expected values, walleye abundance was slightly lower thanexpected values, while northern pike and yellow perch abundance were well below the expectedvalues for lakes similar to Middle Spunk Lake.The gill net catch rate for tullibee has appeared to decrease from 22.83/lift in 1992 to 15.50/lift in1998.  Length range of fish sampled in 1998 was from 7.5 to 14.0 inches, with a mean length of12.6 inches and mean weight of 0.82 lbs.    The gill net catch rate for rock bass has significantly increased from 0.33/lift in 1992 to 4.00/lift in1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.5 to 10.0 inches, with a mean length of 4.9inches and a mean weight per fish of 0.82 lbs.  The gill net catch rate for northern pike has appeared to decrease from 3.00/lift in 1992, to2.17/lift in 1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained similar at 3.77 and 3.61 lbs.,respectively.  Northern pike sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 19 to 30 inches, with a meanlength of 24.9 inches. The gill net catch rate for walleye has appeared to decrease from 3.33/lift in 1992 to 1.83/lift in1998, and mean weight per fish decreased from 1.51 lbs. to 1.18 lbs., respectively.  Walleyesampled ranged in length from 6.5 to 22.0 inches, with a mean length of 14.2 inches. Growth wasslightly above average as fish reached 6.85, 10.43, 14.72, and 16.25 inches by Age I through IV,respectively.  Gill net catch rate for yellow perch has significantly decreased from 22.00/lift in 1992 to 1.17/liftin 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.5 to 8.0 inches, with a mean length of 6.5inches.  Growth of yellow perch was above average as fish reached 5.75, 6.48, and 7.95 inches byAge II, III, and IV, respectively. Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of three major species:bluegill (25.38/set), hybrid sunfish (4.63/set), and green sunfish (3.00/set).  Green sunfishabundance was above the third quartile range, while bluegill abundance was above the secondquartile range for lake class 23.The trap net catch rate for bluegill has decreased from 65.88/set in 1992 to 25.38/set in1998, and mean weight per fish decreased from 0.10 lbs. to 0.06 lbs. Growth was above averagewhen compared to other Minnesota lakes as  Age I through V fish reached 3.16, 3.99, 5.31, 6.81,and 7.40 inches, respectively. The trap net catch rate for green sunfish has appeared to increase from 1.0/set in 1992 to 3.00/setin 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a mean length of 4.3inches.  The trap net catch rate for hybrid sunfish remained similar from 3.75/set in 1992 to4.63/set in 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a meanlength of 5.0 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Spunk Lake is a 236-acre lake located within the city limits of Avon in central Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 81 feet and a large watershed dominated by row crops, forest, and pasture. A city owned public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2023 to monitor changes in the fishery since the last survey in 2016. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped in August 2016 and found to cover more than half of the shoreline. Dominant species mapped were cattail, waterlily, and bulrush. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed in 2023, but chara and coontail were the dominant species found in 2016. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 18  feet in late June and MPCA data shows the average summer water clarity to be 13 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 35 feet in late June. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were lower than 2016 but remained above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 13 to 34 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 2 pounds. The Northern Pike size structure is relatively poor as only 9% of the pike sampled were 26 inches or longer in 2023, similar to 2016 (8%). With the high catch rate of pike, anglers could expect a fair bit of action from the abundant small pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches have historically been low in Middle Spunk Lake despite regular fingerling stocking. Only six Walleye were captured during the 2023 survey; this is below the expected range of values for lakes like Middle Spunk and similar to results in 2016. Walleye ranged in length from 12 to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 3.7 pounds. While numbers are low, anglers still have a chance to catch a few walleye in Middle Spunk Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on June 1st. The catch rate of 46/hour was lower than the Sauk Rapids average daytime catch of 52/hour and lower than the 2016 survey when sampling was conducted at night. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from six to 19 inches with an average length of 10 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 20% were longer than 15 inches. No Smallmouth Bass were sampled in the 2023 but smallmouth were sampled in 2016 (16.2/hour). <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Spunk Lake is one of the few lakes in the Sauk Rapids Area to support a Tullibee population. The Tullibee catch was much higher than 2016 and the second highest on record. Tullibee lengths ranged from seven to 16 inches with a mean length of 11 inches. Tullibee need cold, well oxygenated water to survive; a temperature oxygen profile conducted on June 20 indicated that dissolved oxygen was 3.2 ppm at 36 feet, where the temperature was 44?F. It is likely that conditions are less favorable later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were lower than 2016 but remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from three to eight inches with an average length of five inches. Black Crappie numbers remained low, but similar to 2016. Black Crappie lengths ranged from five to 13 inches, with an average length of nine inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Yellow Perch were caught in the survey; perch abundance is likely hindered by high numbers of Northern Pike. Other species sampled in low numbers included: Bowfin, Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
