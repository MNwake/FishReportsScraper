                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a shallow 73-acre basin located in north-west Pine County that has been assigned to lake class 37.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and black crappie and secondarily for largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish.  There is no established public water access.  The lakeshore is lightly developed with only four dwellings.  The lake is high in fertility resulting in poor water clarity.  Shoreline substrate is predominately sand.  Fishing pressure is light.  The lake's shallow and fertile nature makes it susceptible to low winter oxygen levels.  Fluctuating species composition and panfish abundance in past assessments point to irregular winter kills.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike abundance, based on gill net catch rate, has been low in all assessments.  The catch rate was low again in 2008 at just 0.5 pike per net lift.  Both measured northerns were over 30 inches in length.  Yellow perch abundance, though above the 25th percentile for the lake class, was markedly lower than the previous assessments.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers and size were above normal levels based on the trap net catch.  Crappie ranged from 4.4 to 12.5 inches with an average of 9.3 inches and half a pound.  Bluegill sunfish also exceeded the norm in size but their abundance was typical of the lake class.  Most bluegill (55%) were 7 inches or better in length while 20% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured during the survey include yellow bullhead, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and largemouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    In early September 1988 a lake survey was conducted on Indian Lake.  Two gillnets and four trapnets were set to obtain data of the present fish population.  Shoreline seining efforts were conducted in mid-August to evaluate natural reproduction in conjunction with the lake survey.  \n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  Two northern pike (1.00/set) were sampled in the gillnet catch which was below the local median catch (3.88/set).  The trapnet catch (0.50/set) also yielded two northern pike.  The length frequency distribution, from the combined catches, ranged from 21.0 to 26.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0 - 23.9 inches.  Mean weight was 3.18 pounds.  Age groups II, III and IV were represented by the northern pike sampled.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded one young-of-year northern pike in the 0.40 acre area seined.  The gillnet catch in the previous survey (1967) did not sample northern pike.\n  The yellow perch (43.25/set) net catch was up from the previous survey net catch (21.00/set) and above the local median catch (24.27/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.0 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 6.0 - 6.4 inches. Age groups II, III and IV were represented by the yellow perch sampled.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded only one young-of-year yellow perch. \n  The largemouth bass (0.50/set) net catch was above the local median catch (0.43/set).  These two fish measured 17.5 and 19.8 inches and were of ages VIII and IX, respectively.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded twenty-three young-of-year largemouth bass.  In the previous survey, largemouth bass were not taken in the sampling gear used. \n  The bluegill sunfish (12.75/set) net catch was below the local median catch (25.67/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches with a median length group of 5.0 - 5.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.22 pounds.  Age groups I- VIII were represented by the bluegill sunfish sampled.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded thirty-four young-of-year.\n  The black crappie (43.25/set) net catch was well above the previous survey net catch (10.80/set) and the local median catch (18.45/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 11.9 inches with a median length group of 7.0 - 7.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.22 pounds.  Age groups I-IX were represented by the black crappie sampled.  Young-of-year black crappie were not taken in the shoreline seining efforts.  \n  Five other species were sampled in the test nets (golden shiner, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish).  All were above their respective local median net catches except the hybrid sunfish.  The pumpkinseed sunfish (14.75/set) net catch was higher than the bluegill sunfish net catch (12.75/set).  Black bullheads were numerous in both trapnets and gillnets with a length frequency distribution of 6.5 to 11.4 inches.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake, located in Pine County, is a shallow 73 acre lake that is managed primarily for northern pike and secondly for largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish.  In order to evaluate the present fish population status, a standard lake survey was conducted on Indian Lake during the week of August 31, 1998.  Sampling gear consisted of spring electrofishing, three gill nets, six trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.The northern pike abundance was at a normal level while the average weight was calculated to be at an above average size of 4.2 pounds.  When compared to previous surveys, the 1998 catch was the highest ever recorded.  Measured northern pike ranged in length from 21.3 to 29.1 inches with an average length of 25.4 inches.  When compared to statewide averages, Indian Lake northern pike growth was typical of normal at ages 1-3 and above average at age 4.Spring night electrofishing was the selected method to sample for largemouth bass.  On June 6, 1998, the entire shoreline of Indian Lake was electrofished for the first time.  A catch rate of 1.0 fish/hour was determined.  Although catch rate averages are currently not available for comparison, this rate appears to be low.  The one bass captured measured 8.3 inches and its growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.Black crappie numbers along with an average weight of 0.3 pounds were determined to be at normal levels.  Crappie lengths ranged from 3.8 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 7.7 inches.  Growth rates were found to be at a normal level.The abundance and average weight of pumkinseed sunfish were found to be normal when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.9 to 6.6 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.When compared to other lakes of this type yellow perch were above normal in numbers and normal in size.  Perch lengths extended from 5.7 to 10.1 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.Three shoreline seine hauls were conducted to assess natural reproductive success on September 2, 1998.  Only three young of the year bluegill sunfish were sampled.The selected gear types also sampled black bullhead, golden shiner, yellow bullhead and emerald shiner.  The abundance of  black bullhead, golden shiner, and yellow bullhead were at normal levels.</p>",
