Other area lakes in this class include:  Fladmark, German, Tenter, and Twenty-One. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance, indexed by a gill net catch rate of 12.5 per lift, exceeded the normal range for this lake class.  The average weight of individual pike was 1.5 pounds and the mean length at capture of age-III pike was 19.4 inches.  Northern pike reproduction appears to be consistent as four consecutive year classes were well represented in the sample.   <br> \n     The trap net catch rate of brown bullheads was 20.6 per lift, which is 7.4 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Ninety percent of the bullheads measured were between 9.5 and 11.5 inches in length.   <br> \n     The trap net catch rate of bluegills was 65.4 per lift, which is 1.7 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  None of the bluegills measured were seven inches or greater in length and growth rates are slower than statewide averages.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is also with the normal range and equal to the lake class median with a trap net catch rate of 1.8 per lift.  Age data indicated that crappie reproduction is consistent as four consecutive year classes were represented.  Black crappie growth rates are slower than statewide averages with a mean length at age-IV of 6.5 inches.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance is below the normal range with a gill net catch rate of 0.8 per lift.   <br> \n     No walleyes were sampled during the survey. <br> \n</p>",
