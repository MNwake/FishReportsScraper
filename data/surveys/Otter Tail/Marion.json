                "narrative": "<p>     Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The lake is composed of two basins which are separated by a peninsula.  Boats can navigate between the basins using a narrow channel along the north shore.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 11.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Marion Lake is included in lake class 27; other area lakes in the same classification include North Lida, West Battle, South Ten Mile, Pickerel, and Big Pine.  \n     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  Two resorts and 203 homes/cottages were counted during the 2000 lake survey.  A DNR owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand with areas interspersed with gravel and rubble.  Stands of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\n     Marion Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.\n     Walleye is a primary management species in Marion Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that natural reproduction is limited and that the strongest year classes consistently correspond to years of walleye fingerling stocking.\n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was equivalent to the upper limit of the expectedl range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike recruitment is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 13.6 to 35.0 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.7 pounds.\n     Catch data from recent surveys indicate that an abundant largemouth bass population exists.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 15.2 inches.  \n     The test-net catch rate for bluegill exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Nine percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.\n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion Lake is a 1,664 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles southwest of the city of Perham, MN.  The lake is composed of two basins, separated by a peninsula.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  Boats can pass between basins using a narrow channel area along the north shore.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  There are three small inlets and one larger outlet.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 11.5 feet.  Previous readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.  A DNR public water access is located along the southeast shoreline.     Heavy development exists around Marion Lake.  Two resorts and 203 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Marion Lake contains good populations of northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Northern pike and walleye catches were at historical highs in the 2000 survey.  Northern pike numbers are high with some quality fish (> 30 inches) present.  Pike ranged in length from 9.5 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The 1997 year class of walleye is extremely strong in Marion Lake and is responsible for the high catch rate.  These fish are approximately 13 to 15 inches in length and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1997 and likely contributed to this strong year class.  Walleye fingerling stocking is supplementing natural reproduction in the lake.  Current management calls for biennial walleye fingerling stocking to continue in Marion Lake.  Largemouth bass are abundant and some larger fish are likely present.  Bluegill numbers are high with not many fish over seven inches in length.  Yellow perch numbers are at a historical low.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The lake is composed of two basins which are separated by a peninsula.  Boats can navigate between the basins using a narrow channel along the north shore.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 9.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand  interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  Stands of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Marion Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Marion Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.0 to 25.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye reach an average length of 13.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 11.8 to32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 22.9 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Northern pike reach an average length of 24.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Catch data from recent surveys indicate that an abundant largemouth bass population exists.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.4 to 17.3 inches.   <br> \n     Catch data indicate that bluegills are also very abundant.  Bluegill size structure is very good with 44% of the bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.      <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The lake is composed of two basins which are separated by a peninsula.  Boats can navigate between the basins using a narrow channel along the north shore.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 13.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand  interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  Stands of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Marion Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.0 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has historically fluctuated.  Pike ranged in length from 15.2 to 32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Catch data from recent surveys indicate that an abundant largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.1 to 16.1 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Catch data indicate that bluegills are also very abundant.  Bluegill size structure is good with 34% of the bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at seven years of age.      <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Northern pike abundance is similar to the 1987 survey at 3.7 per gill net lift with an average weight of 3.6 pounds.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has declined substantially from 223.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 119.6 per net, but remains more than three times the area median.  The bluegill population is dominated by small fish as only 3% of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass and black crappie abundances, as indexed by fish per trap net lift, continue to increase.  Age data for both of these species indicates excellent reproduction with multiple year classes present in the sample.  <br> \n     Yep abundance remains high and has increased from 56.4 per gill net lift in 1987 to 70.1 per net.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 6.1 per gill net lift in 1987 to 3.6 per net and the average weight increased from 1.4 pounds to 2.0 pounds.  While a spring electrofishing assessment conducted in 1987 indicated substantial walleye natural reproduction can occur, recent fingerling stockings make it difficult to reach any conclusions concerning walleye reproduction from this test-netting data. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The lake is composed of two basins which are separated by a peninsula.  Boats can navigate between the basins using a narrow channel along the north shore.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 12.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  Stands of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Marion Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-Bass-Panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is at the second highest level recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.2 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 22.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Catch data from recent surveys indicate that an abundant Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.9 to 15.4 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 13.2 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Bluegills are very abundant.  Twelve percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at six years of age.      <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles southwest of Perham, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The lake is composed of two basins which are separated by a peninsula.  Boats can navigate between the basins using a narrow channel along the north shore.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet.  Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 13.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  Stands of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Marion Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-Bass-Panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.1 to 24.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.1 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has also remained stable.  Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Pike ranged in length from 17.4 to 32.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 26.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     An abundant Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.9 to 16.2 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.4 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Bluegills are very abundant.  Twenty-nine percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length, while only 2% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.      <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Marion Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion Lake is a 1,664-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles southwest of the city of Perham, MN.  The lake is composed of two basins, which are separated by a peninsula.  The west basin has a maximum depth of 30 feet while the east basin has a maximum depth of 62 feet. Forty-one percent of the lake area is 15 feet or less in depth.  Boats can pass between the basins using a narrow channel area along the north shore.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 12.0 feet during the 2003 survey.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 feet.  Marion Lake is included in lake class 27 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.     The shoreline of Marion Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  Two resorts and 203 homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southeast shoreline of the lake. Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand with areas interspersed with gravel and rubble.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.    Marion Lake is a popular angling lake.  It can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community. Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.    Walleye is a primary management specie in Marion Lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 24.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The 1997 and 2001 year classes appear to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is limited and that the strongest year classes consistently correspond to years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Walleye attain an average length of 12.7 inches at three years of age.     The test-net catch rate for northern pike was also equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.2 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 21.3 inches at four years of age.    Catch data from recent surveys indicate that an abundant largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.8 to 15.7 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 12.2 inches at four years of age.    The test-net catch rate for bluegill exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 27% of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at seven years of age.      Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",
