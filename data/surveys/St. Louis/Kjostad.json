The lake is relatively deep (50 ft max depth) and has a fair amount of development (seasonal cabins) as compared to some of the other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate was 1.22/set which is slightly lower than similar lakes but in line with catch rates from previous surveys.  Walleye lengths ranged from 6.6 to 25.7 with a mean of 13.3 inches and a mean weight of 1.46 lbs.  Growth rates appear to be a bit slower than other lakes in the International Falls Management Area (IFMA).  Five year classes were represented and all year classes matched stocked years, indicating no evidence of natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 2.67/set which is slightly lower than similar lakes.    Pike lengths ranged from 18.2 to 33.1 with a mean of 24.1 inches and a mean weight of 3.39 lbs which is above 75% of other similar lakes.  Although growth was fairly average compared to other lakes in the IFMA, many of the pike seemed quite robust for their lengths.   <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 6.17/hr of on time and the fish had a mean weight of 1.22 lbs.  This was slightly better than the previous three catch rates, but still quite low. Lengths ranged from 3.6 to 17.0 with a mean of 10.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch rate was 103.92/hr of on time and the fish had a mean weight of 0.25 lbs.  This catch rate was higher than the three previous surveys but the fish sampled were mostly smaller than what anglers would find interest in.  Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 15.0 with a mean of 6.7 inches. Of the 101 fish sampled, 61% were less than 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance was 1.44/set which is somewhat low when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 11.9 with a mean of 6.1 inches.  Growth was close to average when compared with other lakes in the IFMA and mean weight was 0.22 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 5.11/set, which is the second highest catch rate on record (highest being 20.92/set in 2002).  Coincidently, the 2002 catch does reference seeing many spawners and spawning was not witnessed at the time of the survey in 2012.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.7 with a mean of 7.2 inches.  Seventy six percent of the catch was larger than 7 inches.  Mean weight was 0.30 lbs which is above the 75% of other similar lakes; however growth rates appear to be below average when compared with other lakes in the area.   <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 0.67/set, slightly better than 25% of other similar lakes.  Mean weight was 0.19 pounds and lengths ranged from 6.1 to 8.2 with a mean of 7.6 inches.  Growth rates were slightly below the area average.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee gill-net abundance was 4.78/set.  Lengths ranged from 8.0 to 14.4 with a mean of 11.7 inches and a mean weight of 0.58 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nThe only additional species sampled were a few rock bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kjostad is a 437 acre lake, located approximately 12 miles east of Orr, Minnesota. The lake is relatively deep (50 ft max depth) and has a fair amount of development (mostly seasonal cabins) compared to some of the other area lakes. The lake supports a diverse fishery and only receives a light amount of angling pressure. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Kjostad for Walleye follow the statewide regulation, which is a 6-combination total possession limit with not more than 1 walleye over 20.\" The Northern Pike regulations follow the Northeast Zone. Black Crappie fishing regulations follow the statewide regulation. Sunfish fishing regulations follow the statewide. Smallmouth Bass fishing regulations follow the Northeast Zone regulation. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap-net abundance was 3 fish per net, which is within the expected range for this lake class. This is greater than the historic mean of 2 fish per net and ranks 6th out of the 14 surveys conducted between 1965 - 2022. Six year-classes were present and ages ranged from 2-8 years. Total length in trap nets ranged from 7 to 13  inches and the mean was 9 inches. With the healthy population density, the ability to catch a quality Black Crappie is very likely. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 4 fish per net, which is below the expected range for this lake class. This is less than the historic mean and ranks 3rd out of the eight surveys conducted between 1965 - 2022. Seven year-classes were present and ages ranged from 4-10 years. Total length in trap nets ranged from 5 to 9 inches and the mean was 8 inches. With the healthy population density, and angler would have the ability to catch a quality Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was not conducted during the 2022 standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was 2 fish per net, which is within the expected range for this lake class. This is greater than the historic mean of 1 fish per net and ranks 4th out of the 16 surveys conducted between 1951 - 2022. Five year-classes were present and ages ranged from 2-7 years. Total length ranged from 18 to 36 inches and the mean was 25 inches. The mean weight was 4 pounds which is above the expected range for this lake class. With the healthy population density and size structure, the ability to catch a quality Northern Pike is possible. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) gill-net abundance was 7 fish per net. Total length ranged from 7 to 15 inches and the mean was 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was 1 fish per net, which was below the median for this lake class and less than the historic mean of 2 fish per net. Two year-classes were present and fish were 3 and 5 years of age, both year-classes corresponded to stocked years. Total length ranged from 14 to 20 inches and the mean was 16 inches. Mean weight was 1 pound, which was greater than the median for this lake class. Walleye abundance is down but there are harvest-sized fish present. <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net abundance was less than 1 fish per net, which is within the expected range for the lake class. Total length ranged from 5 to 10 inches and the mean was 8 inches. Yellow Perch offer great forage opportunities for Walleye and Northern Pike, and offer limited angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were sampled in low numbers, and most were of small size, a result of fingerling stocking in 1992.  One walleye sampled was 28.6 inches, and 8.8 pounds.  Low numbers of small northern pike were sampled.  The largest one was 22.1 inches long.  No northern pike over 3 years old were sampled.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers, and the largest one was 15.7 inches.  Black crappie were also sampled in low numbers, but were of good size.  Average size was 11.4 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The largest crappie sampled was 13.8 inches.  Bluegill, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, yellow perch, and white sucker were also sampled in low numbers.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.0 inches, and the largest yellow perch sampled was 9.3 inches.  Cisco were sampled at twice the average number for this lake type.</p>",

Walleye average length was 16.7\", while northern pike averaged 22.2\".  Although the growth rate of smallmouth bass was lower than average, fish over 12\" were not uncommon.  Panfish were represented by bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  None of these species were very common, but the average sizes of bluegill (7.5\") and black crappie (11.4\") were large.  Tullibee, white sucker and rock bass were also sampled in this survey. </p>",

Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  The 1998 year-class made up 45% of the sample.  Length in trap nets ranged from 5.6-13.3 inches and the mean was 8.7.  Growth was was above the area average.    Bluegill trap-net abundance was 20.92 fish/set, which was greater than most lakes of this type and a dramatic increase from previous invetigations in which bluegill abundance never exceeded more than 1.00 fish/set.  In 2002, six year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  The 1997 and 1998 year-classes composed 96% of the sample.  Length ranged from 3.4-7.8 inches and the mean was 6.1.  Growth was above average.  Cisco abundance declined from the two previous investigations.  However, abundance continued to remain well above what is found in similar lakes.  Length ranged from 7.3-12.9 inches.  Northern pike abundance was low compared to similar lakes; but growth, weight and size were above average.  Average size was 24.3 inches with a range from 14.0 to 40.9.     Few largemouth were captured, as has been the case in previous investigations in Kjostad Lake.  However, smallmouth bass were abundant.  For smallmouth bass, length ranged from 2.7-18.4 inches and the average was 7.8.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-12 years.  The 1999 and 1998 year-classes made up 64% of the sample.      Walleye abundance was normal for this lake type.  Age ranged from 1-8 years and all year-classes present corresponded to stocked years.  Length of walleyes sampled ranged from 9.8-27.0 inches and the mean was 18.2.  Mean weight was 2.56 pounds, which was above average for this lake type.  Growth was fast.  For example, length at age 4 was 16.1 inches, which was nearly 2 inches larger than the average age-4 walleye in the International Falls management area.Yellow perch abundance was slightly above average.  Length ranged from 5.2-8.5 inches and the average was 6.2.  Growth rate of yellow perch in Kjostad Lake was one of slowest in the International Falls management area and much slower than the previous investigation conducted in 1997.  </p>",

Total length (TL) in trap nets ranged from 3.4-12.9 inches and the mean was 7.1.  Growth was above the area average.  The mean weight of black crappies captured was 0.33 pounds, which was similar to the average for class 10 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 0.78 fish/set, which was much less than the median of 10.3 fish/set for class 10 lakes and a dramatic decrease from the previous investigation in which bluegill abundance was 20.92 fish/set.  In 2007, two year-classes were present and age ranged from 4-5 years.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 4.7-7.3 inches and the mean was 6.0.  Growth was less than the area average.  Mean weight was similar to the median for class 10 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco gill-net abundance was 5.22 fish/set, which was the lowest level observed in two decades.  However, abundance continued to remain above what is found in most class 10 lakes.  Total length ranged from 7.7-14.5 inches and the mean was 12.0.  The mean weight of cisco captured in gill nets was 0.61, which was slightly above the median of 0.54 for class 10 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 1.78 fish/set, which was below the median of 2.75 fish/set for class 10 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-8 years.  Mean TL in gill nets was 25.8 inches with a range from 15.8 to 37.4.  Growth was greater than the statewide and area averages.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets exceeded the third quartile for class 10 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was 2.44 fish/set, which was above the median of 2.00.  Otoliths and scales were used to determine that five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-9 years.  All year-classes present corresponded to stocked years.  The 1998 year-class was one of the strongest and composed 36% of the sample.  It is noteworthy that the 1998 fish were stocked as yearlings.  Total length of walleyes captured in gill nets ranged from 9.4-23.8 inches and the mean was 16.6.  Mean weight was 1.83 pounds, which exceeded the median (1.54) for class 10 lakes.  Growth was similar to the average for the International Falls Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 3.44 fish/set, which was greater than median of 2.60 for class 10 lakes.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 3-9 years.  Total length ranged from 5.8-8.9 inches and the mean was 6.8.  Growth rate of yellow perch in Kjostad Lake was one of slowest in the International Falls Management Area.  Mean weight was similar to the median value for class 10 lakes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kjostad is a 438 acre lake, located approximately 12 miles east of Orr, Minnesota. The lake is relatively deep (50 ft max depth) and has a fair amount of development (mostly seasonal cabins) compared to some of the other area lakes.  The lake supports a diverse fishery and only receives a light amount of angling pressure.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill abundance was below the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were impressive.  Black Crappie over 11 inches and Bluegill over 9 inches were sampled.     <br> \n <br> \nA few Largemouth Bass were captured, as has been the case in previous investigations in Kjostad Lake.  Smallmouth Bass were more abundant than Largemouth Bass, but not nearly as abundant as the record catch observed in 2012.  Future sampling will be necesssary to determine if the decrease was a single abnormal observation or a consistent trend.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was low compared to similar lakes; but growth, weight and size were above average.  Anglers have a chance to catch a very large Northern Pike.  The sample in 2017 included fish up to 39.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was on the low end of the normal range for this lake type.  Average length of Walleye sampled was 15.6 inches and the largest was an impressive 29.9 inches.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
