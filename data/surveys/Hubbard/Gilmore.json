                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (1.25 fish/gillnet and 1.05 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 28 of the Schupp Classification System.  Numbers and sizes were above the third quartile in 1962.  Of the walleye sampled, only one was >17 inches and the mean weight was 0.84 lbs.  Walleye exhibit slow growth, especially during the first three years, attaining an average length at age 4 of 12.94 inches.  Gilmore is not stocked, therefore all walleye in the lake result from natural reproduction.Catches of northern pike (3.25 fish/gillnet and 8.11 lbs/gillnet) also were within the normal ranges, recovering from a low year in 1985.  Mean weight of northern pike sampled was 2.50 lbs.  Growth rates are variable, but on the average, growth is slow the first year and then increases proportionally with age.  Average length at age 4 is 18.61 inches.  The present PSD of 50 indicates good size structure, however, sample size is small and there are few preferred length fish.  From the age analysis, it appears that recruitment is consistent from year to year.Bluegill and largemouth bass catches were within the normal ranges, while pumpkinseed and black crappie catches were above the third quartile for lakes of this classification.  The largemouth bass populations in 1991 and 1985 were almost identical, with numbers showing a decrease from the 1962 survey.  Black crappie abundance was below the first quartile in 1962 and has gradually increased.  The size structure (PSD=56, RSD-P=21, RSD-M=3) and growth rates of black crappie are good.  Average length at age 4 is 8.67 inches.  Bluegill abundance has shown increases since 1962.  Growth rates are slow (5.23 inches average length at age 4), but the size structure is fair.  The PSD is 43, however, there are few fish of preferred length.  Pumpkinseed abundance was below the first quartile its only time in 1985.  Since then, densities have increased to 9.44 fish/trapnet, but sizes have remained small (PSD=29).  Slow growth the first 3 years results in an average length of 4.64 inches for age 4 pumpkinseed.Yellow perch catch rates have increased since 1962, but remained within the normal ranges for 1991. (20.50 fish/gillnet and 2.58 lbs/gillnet).  The present size distribution  is small (PSD=0).Catches of white sucker and yellow bullhead were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification, decreasing in abundance since 1985 and 1962, respectively, when numbers were above the third quartile.  Rock bass densities were above the third quartile in 1991 and have been since the initial survey in 1962.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilmore Lake is located three miles northeast of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Gilmore has a surface area of 91 acres and a maximum depth of 54.0 feet.  There is no public access on the lake and the entire shoreline is in private ownership.  Gilmore provides angling opportunities for northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other      characteristics.  Gilmore is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams.Northern pike abundance was up with the gillnet catch rate of 7.8 pike/net at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike numbers in past surveys have been lower, ranging from low to moderate numbers.  Northern pike sample was dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike in the 18.0 to 20.0 inchsize range.  Northern pike up to 27.6 inches were sampled. Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes. Gilmore supports a small walleye population.  Walleye abundance was at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class. Walleye numbers in past surveys have fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 13.0 to 21.7 inches.  Walleye growth rates were slightly slower than other class 28 lakes.  There is no record of walleye stocking in Gilmore.Panfish were sampled in low numbers during the 2001 survey.  Black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed catch rates were at the low end or below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Panfish abundance in past surveys has been higher, generally fluctuating within the \"normal\" range.Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers with standard survey gear.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass have been sampled in past surveys.  Special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted to adequately assess largemouth bass abundance and size distribution.Other species sampled include high numbers of white sucker, moderate numbers of rock bass, and low numbers of yellow perch and yellow bullhead.</p>",

There is no public access on the lake and the entire shoreline is in private ownership.  Gilmore provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Gilmore is in lake class 28.  Class 28 lakes have the characteristics of being small, having hard water, high water clarity, and having a regular shaped shoreline.  Other class 28 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was low when compared to other class 28 lakes.  Northern Pike numbers in past surveys have fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Northern Pike up to 29.1 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were sampled in low to moderate numbers when compared to other class 28 lakes.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed were small in size, with most fish in the 4-5 inch size range.  Bluegill up to 8.3 inches were sampled.  Bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other class 28 lakes.  Good numbers of Black Crappie were sampled, however, size was small with fish in the 4-6 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers with standard survey gear, similar to past surveys.  Largemouth Bass up to 17.1 inches were sampled.   One Smallmouth Bass was sampled.  Smallmouth Bass have not been sampled in past surveys.  No spring electrofishing has been conducted on Gilmore to adequately assess Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass abundance and size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Walleye, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
