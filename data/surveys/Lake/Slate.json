                "narrative": "<p>Slate Lake is a moderately soft-water lake which is part of the Stony River System of the Kawishiwi Watershed. There are two inlets and an outlet. The outlet and one inlet are the Stony River. The area of Slate Lake is approximately 294 acres and the maximum depth is 10 feet. There is a makeshift dam at the outlet, about 1/4 mile mile from the lake, and a designated public access road to the outlet near the lake. Shoal soils of the lake are mostly muck, mucky sand, boulder, gravel and rubble. Most of the surrounding land is moderately hilly forest land with limited areas of sedge and bushy lowlands.     At the time of the survey, aquatic vegetation was sparse throughout most of the lake. Fifteen trapnets were set in the lake. Most of the Walleye taken were greater than 13\" and all of the Northern Pike were 16\" or longer. Young-of-the-year Walleyes, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Rock Bass were taken in shoreline seining, together with several species of minnows. Spawning facilities were rated \"fair to good\" for Walleye, \"fair\" for Northern Pike and Smallmouth Bass, and \"poor\" for centrarchid panfish and Largemouth Bass. Fishinig success was reproted poor to fair in recent years, but Walleye and Northern Pike fishing has occasionally been good in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>DNR test nets sampled fewer Walleyes in Slate Lake in 1993 than in previous surveys however current Walleye abundance is still average compared to similar types of lakes. Inconsistant natural reproduction has historically caused fluctuations in Walleye abundance in this lake. Walleyes up to 26\" were observed with approximately 1 in every 4 Walleye sampled being in the 17\" to 18\" range. Slate Lake is a shallow, dark water river/lake system which warms up more rapidly in the spring than most of the local lakes. For this reason early spring Walleye fishing is often better here than in other area lakes.     Slate Lake usually supports an average number of Northern Pike compared to similar types of lakes but the 1993 results were below normal. Average size is quite small (16.2\") with fish in the 16\" to 18\" range most common. The lake does produce some large fish such as the 36\" Northern Pike observed in the test nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Slate Lake is a 293 acre lake with a maximum depth of seven feet located along State Highway 1 northwest of Isabella. The Stony River flows through the lake and access is gained via the river channel below the lake outlet. Anglers then paddle or motor upstream from the access into the lake. There are many rocks that are difficult to see in the dark water and a shallow rocky riffle between the access and the lake that can be hazardous to motor boats. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting was completed on Slate Lake during early June of 2022 to gather information on the Bluegill population that was first detected in the lake in 1999. A total of 89 Bluegill were sampled, almost twice as many as sampled in the 2019 survey, and a good number for this area. Size structure remained good with 56 percent of the sample longer than eight inches and the longest fish measuring over 11 inches. Bluegill ranged from two to eight years old with each year class represented indicating consistent reproduction in recent years. The population will continue to be monitored because the lake is one of only a few in the Finland Area that supports a fishable Bluegill population with opportunities for anglers to potentially catch a memorable fish. <br> \n <br> \nSlate Lake has a diverse fish community with a variety of sportfish populations available to anglers. Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were also sampled during this survey. <br> \n</p>",

The purpose of this survey was to assess the current state of the Bluegill population in the lake and to establish baseline data to work from into the future.  During the survey, a total of 49 Bluegill were sampled.  These fish had an average length of 8 inches and a maximum length of approximately 10.5 inches; 53 percent of the sampled Bluegill were 8 inches or longer.  Ages ranged from four to 10 years old with growth rates near average when compared to other area Bluegill populations.  Slate Lake supports a fishable Bluegill population with good growth, consistent enough recruitment that the population is expected to persist into the future, and opportunities for anglers to catch large fish.   <br> \n <br> \nSlate Lake is primarily managed for Walleye with a secondary fishery for Northern Pike.  A total of 15 Walleye were sampled in the survey with an average length of just under 14 inches.  Northern Pike were sampled in large numbers (72 total sampled) with an average length of 17.5 inches.  Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were also sampled during this survey.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In 2005 walleye, northern pike , yellow perch, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and bluegill were sampled in Slate Lake.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and the population is maintained through natural reproduction.Walleye were sampled in average numbers as they have been in most of the past assessments on this lake.  The largest walleye collected in 2005 was 22.6 inches (4.0 lb) and a number of fish between 18-22 inches were taken; however, approximately two-thirds of the walleye were smaller than 14 inches.  The average size was 0.9 lb/fish.The northern pike catch was average for the lake class but lower than the above-average catch in the last assessment (1999).  Some fish between 3-4 pounds were collected and a 12.2 pound northern pike was sampled; however, most of the northern pike were smaller than 2.0 pounds.Bluegill were sampled in average numbers in this assessment.  Most of the bluegill were larger than 8.0 inches with fish up to 9.7 inches taken.  Bluegill were sampled for the first time in this lake in 1999 and it appears the species has become fairly well established.  It remains to be seen if this species can sustain a quality fishery.Largemouth bass were collected in this assessment but the population cannot effectively be evaluated with the type of sampling gear used in this assessment.  This species is best evaluated using electrofishing equipment; however, due to access limitations this equipment cannot be used on Slate Lake.  Only two largemouth bass were collected in this assessment and they weighed 2.2 and 2.3 lb.Two smallmouth bass were sampled in this assessment.  They measure 9.2 and 15.8 inches.  Prior to this assessment there was no record of this species being in Slate Lake.  At this time there does not appear to be a sizeable population of smallmouth bass in Slate Lake.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers and the catch included a few fish between 10.0 and 11.0 inches.Slate Lake is a shallow lake with very dark water.  There are many boulders scattered throughout the lake and boaters should use caution when traveling on the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Slate Lake is located 12 miles west and 5 miles north of Isabella in the Superior National Forest.  Historically the lake has been known as a pretty good lake for angling for Walleye and Northern Pike lake.  Although, most of the fish caught are usually on the small side there is an occasional large fish caught.  There is no designated public access.  However, the lake can be accessed from highway right-of-way at the outlet, then motor up the Stony River to the lake.  The lake is 293 acres with a maximum depth of seven feet.  Boulder, rubble, muck, and detritus are common around most of the lake with gravel and sand in a couple of locations.  Vegetation grows to an approximate depth of five and half feet with 29 species present.  Two inlets enter the lake.  Camp E Creek enters on the east end with a long finger bay ending at a beaver dam.  The main flow comes from the Stony River which enters on the south end.  One outlet, (Stony River) exits on the southwest end of the lake at the bridge on State Highway 1.  There are a few homes present along the north shore of the outlet channel.  Slate Lake is a shallow lake with very dark water.  There are many boulders scattered throughout the lake and boaters should use caution when traveling on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction in Slate Lake.  In 2014, Walleye were sampled in average numbers as they have been in most of the past assessments on this lake.  The gill net catch of 4.5/lift was slightly less than average for this type of lake class in Northeastern Minnesota but was similar to the previous four investigations.  Average weight of 2.2 pounds was above average and was strongly influenced by two fish greater than 5.7 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 25.2 inches and weighed 6.2 pounds.  Growth was average for the Finland Area.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 4.2/lift was average for lake class this type of lake class in Northeastern Minnesota with an average weight of 1.4 pounds which was the largest in the past four investigations.  The largest fish sampled in all gear types was 35.6 inches and weighed 10.9 pounds.  Reproduction appears to be consistent over the years and growth is about average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 8.7/lift was slightly above average and near the catch the past four investigations.  Average weight of 0.2 pounds was also slightly above average but matched the previous low the past four investigations.  The largest fish sampled was 11.1 inches and weighed 0.6 pounds; 21% of the catch was larger than nine inches.  Reproduction was consistent with only one year class missing between age-2 and age-10.  Growth was about average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThere are some Largemouth Bass present, but none were caught in this survey.  Largemouth Bass population cannot effectively be evaluated with the type of sampling gear used in this assessment.  This species is best evaluated using electrofishing equipment; however, due to access limitations this equipment cannot be used on Slate Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gill net catch of 1.3/lift was slightly below average.  The average weight of 2.1 pounds was much higher than average.  The largest fish sampled was 18.4 inches and weighed 3.2 pounds.  Little can be said about reproduction with only eight fish sampled, however; growth appeared much faster than the Finland Area average.  Smallmouth Bass are recent introduction and were first sampled in Slate Lake in 2005.  Seven of the eight fish sampled came from the two nets set in the bay referred to as Spider Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are another recent introduction in Slate Lake and were first sampled in 1999.  In 2014, the Bluegill trap net catch of 0.8/lift was slightly below average but the average weight of 0.9 pounds was more than three times the lake class average. The largest fish sampled was 10.6 inches and weighed 1.1 pounds.  Reproduction appears very sporadic with only three year classes sampled. Growth was faster than the Finland Area average.  The fish community in Slate Lake seems to be changing with the arrival of Bluegill and Smallmouth Bass as evidenced by the last two investigations.  At this point not a lot is known about the Bluegill and Bass populations in the lake other than there are some very nice sized fish present.  Fishermen should show restraint harvesting the big Bluegills as it takes about 10 years to grow to 1 pound. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 7 feet (25 feet in the Stony River), has very dark water and is quite rocky.  Caution should be exercised when traveling on the lake.     Fish collected in DNR test nets in 1999 were northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, white sucker, rock bass and a very small number of bluegill and burbot.     Walleye were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class with fish from 6.8 inches to 26.6 inches (4.3 pounds) sampled.  Some larger fish in the 14 inch to 16 inch range were recorded, but most were smaller than 14 inches.     Test nets during earlier surveys had typically found average numbers of northern pike in Slate Lake, however during the 1999 survey above average numbers of northern pike were collected.  The average size was about 1.4 pounds with a 25.3 inch (4.3 pounds) individual the largest sampled during the survey.     Yellow perch numbers are average compared to similar lakes with an average size of just over 8 inches.  Yellow perch up to 12 inches were sampled and about 33% were between 9 inches and 11.5 inches.  Slate Lake is not stocked, all fish populations are maintained through natural reproduction.</p>",

The number per gillnet lift then was 2.0/lift, and 2.4/lift in the current survey. The lake has a high population of mature suckers.     No management of this lake is planned for the near future. Due to the river like nature of the lake, management would be very difficult. According to stories of old time residents the natural ledgerock dam at the outlet was blasted out in the early 1900's and replaced with a log dam to control water for floating logs down the river. When the log dam finally washed out the overall level of the lake was dropped between 4 and 5 feet. Following this the former excellent fishing came to an end.</p>",
