                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Willie in 2016 to monitor the lake's fish population.  A total of 14 species were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and by spring night-time electrofishing (SEF), which targeted Largemouth Bass.  The lake was well mixed, on 7/11/16, with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 4.3 mg/l just off the bottom in 17.0 feet of water, allowing fish to use all depths of water.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 2.5 feet, due to an algae bloom.  The last investigated winterkill was in 2001.  A small fishing pier is available for anglers at Willie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (49) for a catch rate of 8.2/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie and was the second highest on record at Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was much lower at 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=9) were variable, ranging from 0.8 to 9.0/net with an average of 3.6.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as low (<5/net) at Willie.  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 7.7 to 25.2 inches long with an average of 19.0.  Approximately 16% of the gill net catch was 21 inches or longer.  However, trap nets did sample three fish that were over 30 inches in length, with maximum length being 33.0 inches, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  Northern Pike were not aged.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (92) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 10.2/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was 1.1/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 0.3 to 24.4/net with an average of 8.2.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.8 to 12.1 inches long with an average of 8.3.  Approximately 37% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer, a modest amount of fish at a size range anglers prefer.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (49) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 8.2/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 gill net catch rate was 5.3/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=9) were variable, ranging from 0.5 to 19.0/net with an average of 8.9.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 3.6 to 9.8 inches long with an average of 5.9.  Black Crappie were not aged, but the length frequency data indicated that multiple year classes were present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (9.7) of White Crappie for a catch rate of 9.7/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Historic catch rates (n=9) ranged from 0.2 to 14.0/net with an average of 5.4.  Gill netted White Crappie were 3.6 to 11.1 inches long with an average of 5.6. Approximately 91% of the gill net sample was under 7 inches in length, indicating a young and/or small population.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (7) of White Crappie for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  Historic catch rates (n=11), from 1975 to 2016, ranged from 0.0 to 28.5/net with an average of 4.6.  Trap netted White Crappie were 4.6 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 6.8.  White Crappie were not aged, but the length frequency distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present. Anglers who wish to tell black and white crappie apart should count spines on the dorsal (topmost) fin; white crappies have five or six spines while black crappies sport seven or eight spines. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Walleye (13) for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was four times lower (0.5/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=9), under various stocking regimes, were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 7.4/net with an average of 1.7.  In 2016, gill netted Walleye were 12.3 to 21.7 inches long with an average of 18.3.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 28.0 inches in length, indicating that those rare trophy sized fish were present in Willie.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-3 to age-7 with three year classes present.  The 2013 year class accounted for 69% of the gill net catch.  The current stocking regime (242 pounds of fall fingerlings every other year) was initiated in 2005.  Yearlings were stocked in 2015, due to a fingerling shortage that fall.  Non-stocked years (2010 and 2012) made up 0% of the gill netted fish, in 2016.  The contribution from natural reproduction during stocked years (fingerling and yearling) was unknown.  Growth was fast.  Gill net catch rates (n=3) during this stocking regime ranged from 0.2 to 2.2/net with an average of 1.0.  Higher numbers (8.2/net) of predatory Northern Pike could be negatively affecting Walleye abundance at Willie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (41) for a catch rate of 4.6/net which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 3.3.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 72.7/net, with an average of 11.4.  Approximately 73% of the historic trap net catches were below the normal range, indicating that Willie was typically not a great Bluegill Lake.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 3.0 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 4.9.  Approximately, 22% of the catch exceeded 6 inches leaving few fish at a large size anglers prefer.  Bluegill were not aged.     <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled moderate numbers (27) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 18.0/hr.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 19.3/hr.  Catch rates (n=7) from 1992 to 2016 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 19.3/hr. with an average of 12.3.  Largemouth Bass were 8.9 to 19.5 inches long with an average of 13.0.  Approximately 30% of the catch was 15 inches or longer, giving anglers a fair chance at larger sized fish.  Trap nets sampled few (3) Largemouth Bass, but fish up to 19.1 inches in length were sampled.  Largemouth Bass (all gears) were age-2 to age-9 with six year classes present.  Growth was fast.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (7) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was also 1.2/net.  The last four catch rates have all been below the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  Historical catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=9) were variable ranging from 0.7 to 52.8/net with an average of 12.1.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 6.1 to 8.0 inches long with an average of 7.2. Yellow Perch were age-2 to age-3 with two year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (13) for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was 0.1/net.  Historic catch rates (n=11) from 1975 to 2016 were variable, ranging from 0.1 to 6.0/net with an average of 1.8.  Trap netted Common Carp were 12.4 to 25.4 inches long with an average of 16.3.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (13) for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was also within the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=9) were variable, ranging from 0.3 to 17.3/net with an average of 5.0.  Gill netted Common Carp were 10.8 to 31.1 with an average of 18.7.  Length frequency data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Common Carp would be difficult to control due to the highly connected watershed to the south (Harden Lake, Hoff Lake, and South fork of the Crow River) and to the east (Greenleaf Lake). <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (13) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Willie.  The 2013 catch rate was 0.2/net. Relative abundance of Black Bullhead, over the last ten years, appears to have been quite low at Willie.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2016 (n=9) were highly variable, ranging from 0.2 to 203.4/net with an average of 70.9.  Trap nets sampled 2 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was also below the normal range for lakes similar to Willie and the lowest ever measured at Willie.  Historic catch rates (n=11) were variable ranging from 0.2 to 133.2 with an average of 21.5.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 7.0 and 9.8 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Their relative abundance appears to have increased since a 1975 lake survey.  Both species exhibit average growth rates and the sample is composed of age 1 to age 3 fish.  Fishing reports during winter 1980-81 report crappies up to 3 pounds taken by anglers.  Yellow perch are abundant at 18.3/gillnet and provide forage for northern pike.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked (3112 weighed 102 pounds) during fall 1979, but it looks like the return on these fish will be slight.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 0.3/gillnet and no further management for walleye is recommended.  Black bullhead are numerous (133/trapnet) and range in length from 3 to 10 inches.  Average weight is about 0.2 pounds.</p>",

One pumpkinseed, one bluegill, three white crappie and four black crappie were taken during the survey, indicating a rather small panfish population.  This fact could be due to a light winterkill in 1975.  Spawning areas for panfish are good.  There is a large bullhead population in Willie, most of which were from six to seven inches long.</p>",

Abundance of walleye approximately twice local values at 7.4 walleyes per gill net set.  Northern pike are below local levels with 2.0 per gillnet set.  Northern pike are well above average in growth rates, with 60% of northern pike sampled being age 3.  Other age groups represented were 2-5.  Bluegill were 1.6 times local values.  Growth rates in younger fish were also faster than normal.  Bluegill sampled were ages 0-5, with ages 1 and 3 predominant.  Black crappie abundance and growth are average for this area.  Black crappie were ages 0-5, with ages 1 and 3 predominant.  Black bullheads present at 3.6 per trap net set.  Average length of black bullheads was around 6.7 inches.  White crappies were also present in average numbers for this area.  Other species present were pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, carp and bowfin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Willie Lake in 2013 to monitor the fish community. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Black and White Crappie and to a lesser degree for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, bluegill, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.5/net, indicating low numbers were present for the fourth consecutive sample from 1996 to 2013. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0/net to 7.4/net with an average of 1.6/net. Lengths ranged from 12.5 to 17.5 inches with an average of 15.0 inches. An additional 19.0 inch Walleye was sampled with the trap nets. Walleyes from both gears ranged from 2 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present. Growth to age 3 was fast. The latest stocking regime calls for 2 pounds fingerlings/littoral acre during odd numbered years and began in 2005. In 3 samples since then, gill net catch rates have remained low with an average of just 0.5/net. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating low numbers were present for the second consecutive sample since 2009. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.8/net to 9.0/net with an average of 3.1/net. Lengths in 2013 ranged from 19.5 to 25.0 inches with an average of 21.4 inches. An additional 6 Northern Pike were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present. Growth to age 3 was fast. <br> \n <br> \nJust 7 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.2/net, indicating low numbers were present. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.7/net 52.8/net with an average of 13.4/net. Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 6.1 inches with an average of 5.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 32 Black Crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.3/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2009 was 12.3. Historically, gill net catch rates have ranged from 0.5/net to 19.0/net with an average of 9.0/net. Lengths ranged from 4.8 to 9.9 inches with an average of 5.8 inches. A total of 10 Black Crappies ranging from 3.0 to 11.6 inches long were also sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.1/net. Fish from both gears were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present. Growth to age 3 was slow. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 White Crappies from 5.0 to 5.3 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.2/net to 14.0/net with an average of 4.9/net. One 12.5 inch White Crappie was also sampled with the trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net. Fish from both gears were 1 to 7 years old with just 2 year-classes present. The White Crappie population in Willie Lake displays erratic recruitment but has a history of producing large fish over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 Largemouth Bass were sampled spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 19.3/hour on-time, which was the largest catch rate recorded in Willie Lake. Since 1992, catch rates have ranged from 0/hour on-time to 19.3/hour on-time with an average of 11.4/hour on-time. Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 18.0 inches with an average of 12.5 inches. An additional 3 Largemouth Bass ranging from 1.7 to 9.6 inches long were sampled with trap and gill nets. Fish from all gears were 1 to 9 years old with 8 year-classes present. Growth to age 3 was fast. Following the reported winterkill in 2000-2001, Largemouth Bass numbers have rebounded to an all-time high in Willie Lake and should persist in the absence of winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 3.3/net, indicating low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2006 was 11.7/net. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0/net to 72.7/net with an average of 12.1/net. Lengths ranged from 2.3 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 4.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2013 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Willie, Meeker County, is a 182 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The lake is located approximately eight miles south of Litchfield.  Lake Willie can be a good producer of panfish, walleye, largemouth bass and northern pike.  The lake sometimes experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter.  This may be a limiting factor in sustaining a fishery and makes it difficult to characterize fish populations.  The 1996 survey had low net catch rates for most gamefish species.  The black crappie gillnet catch rate was within the normal range for this lake class.  Average length of black crappie sampled was less than 5 inches, but most were age 1 fish.  Only one white crappie was sampled.  No bluegill were sampled in 1996.  Low catch rates of panfish species is unusual for Lake Willie.  Sampling may have been affected by unseasonably cool weather or other factors.  The northern pike catch rate was below the normal range and has been in the past several surveys.  Average length of the northern pike sampled was 20 inches.  The walleye net catch rate was also below the normal range.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 10 to 20 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked periodically and can develop strong year classes and provide good angling.  Lake Willie has some stands of cattail and bulrush and undeveloped, wooded shoreline that provide good bass habitat.  Electrofishing sampled 20 largemouth bass that ranged in length from 7 to 17 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches.  Most of the bass were age 2 and should provide future angling opportunities.  The gillnet catch rate of yellow perch was above the lake class median, but within the normal range.  This is similar to past surveys.  Yellow perch up to 9 inches long were sampled.  Most perch sampled were age 2 and should provide good angling in the future.  Black bullhead catches were below normal, but fish up to 11 inches were present.  These fish are often overlooked by anglers, but can provide good angling, and eating.  Common carp were abundant.  Fish up to 26 inches long were present and could provide good sport for the interested angler.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Willie in 2006 to monitor the lake's physical chemical and biological charecteristics.  Willie Lake has a history of winterkill and a partial kill occurred during the 2000-2001 winter.  Willie's watershed was dominated by row crop agriculture, but the immediate shoreline was mostly undeveloped.  Submergent vegetation was rare in early August, growing to a maximum depth of 3.5 feet.  Algal blooms can be intense on Willie Lake.  Water clarity was only 2.5 feet in early July, 2006.  A small fishing pier is available at the access site.\n\nLow numbers of walleye were gill netted, ranging in length from 11.8-21.9 inches and averaging 18.5 inches.  A new walleye stocking regime (2 lbs of fingerlings every other year) was initiated in 2005.  Future gill netting assessments will determine the success of this strategy.  Fair numbers of northern pike were gill netted, ranging in length from 15.5-28.3 inches and averaging 22.6 inches.  Trap nets sampled northern pike up to 35.5 inches.  Gill nets and trap nets sampled moderate numbers of black crappie, but size was small.  Only 3 black crappie were 8 inches or longer.  Moderate numbers of white crappie were netted and fish up to 11.9 inches were sampled.  Approximately 13% of the white crappie trap net catch was above 8 inches.  Fair numbers of bluegill were trap netted, but size was small.  Bluegill averaged 4.9 inches.  Only 1 bluegill was 7 inches or longer.  Bluegill catch rates have slowly been increasing since the 2001 stocking effort.  Low numbers of largemouth bass were sampled during spring night time electrofishing.  Largemouth bass were 7.3-16.6 inches long averaging 12.3 inches.  Carp were abundant with gill netted fish ranging from 14.8-23.7 inches. in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:Net catch data was compared to similar lakes across the state.  Gamefish species captured in the gillnets were northern pike, yellow perch and walleye.  The northern pike catch (2.0/lift) is similar to previous nettings.  This was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch (8 total) consisted of 4 fish each of ages 2 and 4 and growth was good.  The yellow perch catch (10.5/lift) was within the normal range for this lake type and appears to have increased from the previous survey (1987).  Only age 2 and 3 fish were represented in the sample and these fish were not large enough to be of interest to the angler.  The walleye catch (2.8/lift) declined slightly from the previous survey, but was still within the normal range for this type of lake.  Fish of age 3 through 8 were represented in the sample and growth was good.  Gamefish sampled in the trapnets were bluegill, white crappie and black crappie.  The bluegill catch (72.7/lift) was above the normal range for the lake class.  This is higher than the catch from the previous survey (24.6/lift).  Bluegill abundance has been steadily increasing since the 1975 survey.  The catch was dominated by age 2 fish (over 80%) and the remaining fish were age 3.  Bluegill growth was good, but almost 90% were less than 6.5 inches and probably not yet acceptable to anglers.  Previous surveys show good representation of several age classes indicating stable recruitment.  The white crappie catch (28.5/lift) was above the normal range for this lake type.  Almost the entire catch were age 2 fish and ranged in length from 6.5 to 8 inches.  Black crappie numbers in the trap nets (8.5/net) and the gillnets (19.0/lift), indicated moderate to high abundance for this lake type.  Approximately 80% were age 2 fish, which ranged in size from 5.5 to 9 inches in length.  Given the number of age 2 panfish sampled during the survey, Lake Willie should provide good fishing for these species over the next several years.  Nighttime electrofishing was conducted in the spring on Lake Willie.  This electrofishing targeted largemouth bass.  Twenty-seven bass were sampled for a catch per hour of 16.9 fish.  This catch per effort might be termed moderate among other lakes sampled in 1992 (catch per hour on 12 lakes ranged from 7.5 to 39.3 bass).  Over 75% of these were age 2 and 3 fish, ranging in size from 6.4 to 11.4 inches long.  Several large fish (19 and 21 inch) were also captured.  Carp abundance appears to be increasing.  Both the gill and trapnet numbers were above the normal range for this lake type.  Most of these were 12 to 16 inch fish.  Numbers of black bullhead were within the normal range for this lake type.  As typical of most area lakes, bullhead numbers have tended to fluctuate over time.  Most of the bullhead sampled this year were 7 to 9 inches long.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Willie is a small lake (191 acres) located south of the City of Litchfield in Meeker County. A state-owned access with gravel parking and a double cement plank boat ramp is present on the west shore. A separate fishing dock is also present at the public access. Willie has approximately three miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of seventeen feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Willie is a class 34 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Greenleaf Lake and Long Lake near Dassel, both in Meeker County. Willie's 2017 lake management plan listed Walleye as the primary management species, while Northern Pike, Black Crappie, White Crappie, Yellow Perch, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were secondary species. The Willie Lake fish population occasionally suffers partial winterkills with the most recent event occurring in 2023. Fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on the severity of the latest winterkill event.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Common Carp were not sampled in the 2023 gill nets. However, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are typically not sampled well in gill nets. Low numbers of dead Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Common Carp, Black Crappie and White Crappie were observed at the public access and outlet area of Willie Lake following ice-out in 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 22.8 inches in length. Approximately 25% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. The longest pike sampled was 26.8 inches. Northern Pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats, population abundances and size structures. Three management zones were established for Northern Pike, with their own bag limit and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone, where Willie Lake is found, anglers can keep up to ten Northern Pike, but no more than two fish can be longer than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released. Darkhouse spear fishermen are allowed to have one pike within the protected slot limit in their possession. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium and large sized pike.  <br> \n <br> \nLow to moderate numbers of Black Crappie were netted in 2023, but average size was small (5.6 inches in length). The longest Black Crappie sampled was only 7.1 inches in length. Moderate numbers of White Crappie were netted in 2023, but average size was small (6.8 inches in length). Only two fish were over 9.0 inches in length. The longest White Crappie sampled was 11.6 inches. Anglers may also encounter Hybrid Crappie at Willie Lake. A Hybrid Crappie is a cross between a Black Crappie and a White Crappie. Low numbers of Yellow Perch were netted and all were small. The longest fish sampled was 6.4 inches. However, Yellow Perch play an important role as forage at Willie Lake. Additional fishes sampled in the 2023 gill nets included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead and Brown Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",
