Little change is evident in the fishery since 1993.  Northern pike provide good angling opportunity with an abundance typical of similar lakes.  Pike averaged 21.6 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northerns over 30 inches were not sampled.  Bluegill are very abundant but small.  Of the 419 sampled in the trapnets, only 11 exceeded 7 inches.  Black crappie and yellow perch populations appear low.  Only 2 individuals of each species were caught.  Largemouth bass are present in the lake but their abundance was not measured. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>On June 28, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Pennington Lake (lake class 37).  Standard netting methods were used to evaluate the present fish population.  Pennington Lake is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Stocking has not taken place on this lake.  Being a shallow lake on average and prone to winterkills, the lake does quite well in sustaining a natural population of fish.  The outlet connection to the Groundhouse River can also provide a source of fish (via migration) during highwater periods.       Northern pike abundance was normal for this lake type.  Fish up to 31.7 inches were sampled.  The average length was 21.5 inches and the average weight was 2.3 pounds.  Ages 2-7 were sampled and their growth was typical of normal.     Largemouth bass abundance was hard to assess with the given netting results.  Typically a difficult fish to catch by netting, bass are better sampled by night electrofishing.  Due to time constraints during the survey, electrofishing was not conducted.  Of the bass that were sampled, one measured 19.5 inches weighing 4.2 pounds.  Several were observed in the shallows by the survey crew.  Shoreline seining captured 3 young-of-year bass which      indicated some spawning success.     Bluegill abundance was high with fish up to 8.1 inches taken.  The average size was almost 5.0 inches.  Many were sampled in the 6.0-7.0 inch range.  In general, Pennington Lake has many bluegills but most of them tend to run small.  Ages 2-8 were sampled and their growth was slower than normal.     Black crappie abundance was low, but local residents report of good catches during the spring.  Crappies up to 10.7 inches were sampled with an average size of 6.5 inches.  Ages 2-7 were captured with growth being normal.     Pennington Lake, not noted for its yellow perch, only produced 2 perch in the nets.  The northern pike population most likely keeps perch numbers down, since perch are their primary source of food.     Pumpkinseed abundance was very high.  Although not as dominant as the bluegills, the pumpkinseeds manage to make up 1/3 of the sunfish population.  They range from 3.1 to 8.1 inches averaging 5.2 inches.     The remainder of the fish population consisted of black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and brown bullhead.  The brown bullhead abundance level was fairly high with an average length of 11.0 inches.  Black bullhead and bowfin levels were very low.     Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",
