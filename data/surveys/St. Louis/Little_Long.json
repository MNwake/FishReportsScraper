                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is located approximately 4 miles NW of Ely. The surrounding landscape is rugged with abundant red and white pines along with white cedar growing near the shores of this clear water lake. Little Long is moderately developed with homes and seasonal cabins. A small resort is located at the NE end and a summer church camp on the SW end. There is a concrete planked boat ramp and nearby fishing pier off the Echo Trail (CR 116) for public access. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, bluegill, smallmouth bass and rock bass were sampled in 2015 at above average numbers. Northern pike was sampled in record low numbers for this lake. Rusty crayfish and northern clearwater crayfish were also sampled in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2015 was much higher than past surveys and well above average compared to similar area lakes. The average walleye sampled was 19.6 inches long (3.4 lbs) and about 5 years old. Fifty-five percent of the walleye sampled were 20 inches or larger and the largest walleye sampled was 27.2 inches long. Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years and in 2015 all walleye aged were from years that were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nSmelt, a non-native species, were first sampled in surveys in 1987 and abundance was at 215/small mesh net in 2010. Abundance was down significantly in 2015. Smelt are the primary forage for the abundant walleye population, however they negatively impact walleye reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was near average for the lake but high compared to other area lakes. Most bluegill were less than 8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were above average in every gear type in which they were sampled. The electrofishing catch rate was high with many smaller bass. Only 17% of the smallmouth sampled by electrofishing were 12 inches or longer although the largest was just over 20 inches. Smallmouth bass comprised ninety-five percent of the sample from electrofishing. Largemouth bass made up the other five percent. The average largemouth was 13 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were above average for Little Long and similar area lakes. The average rock bass sampled was 6 inches long. Low numbers of black crappie were also sampled in 2015. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations in 1994 were dominated by walleye and bluegill sunfish, followed by northern pike.  Other species were present in fairly low numbers.  Large numbers of smelt were also captured in a special smelt assessment.  Nine rusty crayfish were observed in a gillnet near the east end of the lake.  This is the first observation of rusty crayfish in this lake.The average size of northern pike was small (17.1\" in the gillnets), but a large (39\") pike was caught, and some nice pike are reported by anglers every year.  Walleye sizes were very large, averaging 18.2\", with 30% over 20\" and several over 30\".  Bluegill sizes were small, all but four were under 7\".  Some nice sized smallmouth bass (18\") were present.Recruitment of the major species appears to be quite good, except that almost all walleye (71 of 75) were from fingerling stocked year-classes.  Northern pike and walleye growth was above average for the area, especially after the first year.  Both of these species had been foraging on smelt.  Smallmouth bass and bluegill growth was below average for the area.In the gillnet catch the total number of fish per net (27.5) was average.  The total weight of fish per net (56.4 lbs) was high, due to the presence of many large walleye.In the trapnet catch the total number of fish per net (74.9) was high and the total weight of fish per net (14.2 lbs) was low, both due to the presence of many small bluegill.SMELT GILLNETS:This special assessment consisted of four standard smelt nets, each with a 6' by 100' by 0.5\" bar mesh panel and a 6' by 100' by 0.375\" bar mesh panel.These nets caught an average of 179 smelt/net, which is fairly high.  Seventy-seven percent of the smelt were captured in the 0.5 in mesh net panels.  Smelt sizes ranged from 4.3\" to 8.0\" and averaged 6.2\".Smelt were observed in the stomachs of walleye and northern pike during the regular assessment in 1994.  Spawning smelt have been observed at the outlet (to Bass Lake).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that drop off steeply along the shoreline and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Long Lake was thermally stratified on 08/30/2004 with a surface temperature of 64 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 32 ft, where the temperature was 55 F.  Two small inlets drain local swamps.  The outlet to Bass Lake has beaver dams and rocky rapids that limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 48% boulder, 27% rubble, 10% sand, 8% gravel, 6% muck, and 1% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and confined to shallow bays.The 2004 fish population assessment consisted of four gillnet sets, nine trapnet sets, and four small mesh smelt gillnet sets.  Nine previous investigations, dating back to 1955, used 4-5 gillnets and 3-12 trapnets.  Smelt were first observed in 1987, and smelt gillnets have been used in five investigations from 1989 through 2004.  Shoreline seining was done in 1955, and small mesh trapnetting for young-of-year fish was done in 1978 and 1994.  Night electrofishing for bass was done in the spring of 1994.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by bluegill sunfish and walleye.  Good populations of smelt, rock bass, northern pike, black crappie, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were also present.  Notable by their relative absence in this lake are perch and white sucker.  No perch were captured in 2004 and both perch and sucker were absent or present in very low numbers in previous investigations. Bluegill numbers in 2004 (130.6/trapnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class, and were higher than the median catch of 64.3/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2004 averaged 6.4\" (0.21 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  Most bluegill were age five (28 percent) or age six (52 percent).  The largest bluegill captured in 2004 was 10.0\".  Bluegill growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Walleye numbers in 2004 (12.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 20.5\" (4.3 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 18.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 26.7\".  The walleye were very fat and had been eating smelt.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially in Little Long Lake since 1985 and most (perhaps all, depending on scale reading errors on older fish) of the walleye captured in 2004 were from fingerling-stocked year classes.  Growth of walleye captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Smelt are an Atlantic Ocean fish that have been in the Great Lakes for decades.  They were introduced to adjacent Burntside Lake, probably by anglers, in the 1970's.  They were first observed in Little Long Lake in 1987.  Smelt numbers in 2004 (27.2/smelt gillnet) were lower than the average catch of 160/smelt gillnet in recent investigations on this lake.  The reason for this apparent decline is not known, although walleye and northern pike are foraging heavily on smelt.  Smelt were likely responsible for apparent recruitment failure of cisco in this lake, as smelt are known to out-compete cisco for invertebrate forage and to prey on young fish.  Cisco appear to be disappearing from this lake, and the only cisco captured in recent investigations was large (17.8\"). Black crappie numbers in 2004 (11.3/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2004 averaged 7.5\" (0.27 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was at the average size for all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie was 12.6\".  Most crappie captured in 2004 (73 percent) were age three.  Crappie growth was faster than normal by area standards.Largemouth and smallmouth bass numbers in 2004 were higher than normal for this lake class.  Bass are known to be \"net shy\" and their abundance is underestimated by their numbers in gillnet and trapnet catches.  Many large bass carcasses were observed during the 2004 survey at Shig Wak Resort on the east end of the lake.  The largest bass captured in our nets were a 16.3\" largemouth and an 18.0\" smallmouth.  Sample sizes were small, but largemouth growth appeared to be slower than normal (in the first quartile) and smallmouth growth appeared to be faster than normal for young fish.Many of the game fish examined in 2004 were infected with neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first captured in the 1994 investigation, entangled in the gillnets.  Their numbers have grown from 1.6/gillnet in 1994, to 18.2/gillnet in 1999, and to 45.2/gillnet in 2004.  This increase is similar to other lakes in the area to which rusty crayfish have been introduced.  Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River Valley and were likely introduced to the area by anglers.  They often out-compete and displace native crayfish, remove aquatic vegetation, and eat fish eggs and small fish.  They are aggressive and can nip the feet of swimmers.  They could affect Little Long Lake by removing the aquatic vegetation that sunfish and crappie depend on for hiding cover and habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have steep dropoffs along the shoreline and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Long Lake was thermally stratified on 06/14/99 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) to a depth of 30 ft, where the temperature was 51 F.  Two small inlets drain local swamps.  The outlet to Bass Lake has beaver dams and rocky rapids which limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rubble.    The total catch of fish in the gillnets (all species combined) in 1999 of 33 fish/net was normal for this lake class, and was similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake dating back to 1955.  The total catch of fish by weight of 75 lb/net was higher than normal for this lake class and higher than previous catches in this lake.  The capture of many large walleye in 1999 resulted in the unusually high fish biomass in the gillnets.    The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1999 of 153 fish/net was much higher than most previous catches in this lake, mostly due to high catches of bluegill sunfish in 1999.    Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by bluegill and walleye, followed by smelt, smallmouth bass, rock bass, northern pike, and black crappie.    Bluegill numbers in 1999 (125/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 62/trapnet in previous trapnet catches in this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 1999 averaged 6\"; the largest was 8.5\".  Most bluegill were ages 4, 7, and 8.  Bluegill growth (5\" at age four) was normal for the area.    Walleye numbers in 1999 (12/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Walleye were present in very low numbers until the late 1970's; walleye fingerling stocking has led to the current high population.  Most of the walleye captured in 1999 (88 percent) were from stocked year classes.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 20\" (4.2 lb), which is higher than normal for this lake class; the largest walleye was 27.6\" (10.8 lb).  Walleye were very fat and had primarily been eating smelt.  Walleye growth (19\" at age four) was faster than normal for the area.    Smelt were first observed in Little Long Lake in 1987.  Smelt numbers in 1999 (149/special smelt gillnet) were quite high.  Smelt sizes in 1999 averaged 5\"; the largest smelt was 7.7\".    Smallmouth bass were reportedly introduced into Little Long Lake about 1950.  Smallmouth numbers in 1999 (5/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth sizes in 1999 averaged 12\"; the largest was 19.0\".  Smallmouth growth (11\" at age five) was normal for the area.    Rock bass numbers in 1999 (2/gillnet, 12/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catches of 1/gillnet and 1/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Rock bass sizes in 1999 averaged 7\"; the largest was 8.9\".    Northern pike numbers in 1999 (2/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the median catch of 5/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 23\"; the largest was 34.3\".  Pike growth (14\" at age two) was normal for the area.    Black crappie numbers in 1999 (3/gillnet, 3/trapnet) were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the median catches 0.3/gillnet and 0.8/trapnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 1999 averaged 9\"; the largest was 11.8\".  Most crappie were ages 4 and 5.  Crappie growth (9\" at age four) was faster than normal for the area.    Many of the fish examined in 1999 were infested with neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite that is found in or just under the skin.  It is native to the area, is killed by cooking, and can usually be removed by filleting the fish.    Rusty crayfish were first observed in Little Long Lake in 1994.  They are easily entangled in gillnets as they pursue captured fish.  Their numbers went from 1.6/gillnet in 1994 to 18.2/gillnet in 1999.  These crayfish have the potential to reduce native crayfish populations, reduce aquatic vegetation, and ultimately, to reduce fish populations.</p>",

The largest smallmouth was 18.5\". <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish sampled in 2010 include northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n  <br> \nRainbow smelt captured in 2010 (215.2/gill net) were higher than any previous investigations on this lake since first observed in 1987. Smelt sizes averaged 5.2\". Smelt made up a major component of the walleye diet in the 2010 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of non-native crayfish were sampled in 2010. Rusty crayfish (43.25/gill net) were more abundant than Clearwater crayfish (9.5/gill net). <br> \n   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is a 322 acre lake located two miles northwest of Ely.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp off the Echo Trail.  The lake has a maximum depth of 45 feet and had clear water at the time of this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOn August 5, 2022 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 48 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly bedrock, gravel, and rubble.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse due to a rusty crayfish infestation. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Long is currently stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings.       <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 29.7 fish/net which was average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 85.5 lbs/net which was the highest on record for the lake.  Fish species sampled were walleye, smallmouth bass, northern pike, rock bass, rainbow smelt, white sucker, and green sunfish.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 54.3 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys on Little Long.  Yield was 9.4 lbs/net which was very close to the lake's historic average.  The catch was dominated by bluegill with additional species sampled that weren't also caught in gill nets including black crappie, golden shiner, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  The small mesh gill nets sampled rainbow smelt, northern pike, white sucker, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nSixty walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 20.0 fish/net, which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the highest catch rate on record for the lake.  It also ranked third out of 198 surveys of walleye lakes in the area.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to just over 28 inches with an average of 20 inches.  Mean weight was an impressive 3.5 pounds which was very good compared to other similar lakes.  Growth was excellent with the average walleye reaching 16 inches long at three years old.  Ages ranged from 1 to 19 years with the 2019 year class representing 56% of the total catch.  When stocked years were compared against non-stocked years, 52 of the 56 aged fish (93%) came from a year class where stocking occurred.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 2.0 fish/net which was lower than average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Lengths ranged from 16 to just over 32 inches with an average of 22.5 inches.  Both the average and max lengths were on par with previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve smallmouth bass were sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 4.0 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes and better than average when compared to past surveys on Little Long.  The average weight was nearly two pounds which was very good compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 19 inches with an average of nearly 15 inches.  Nine additional smallmouth were sampled in trap nets and scales were taken from those fish to account for growth information.  Growth was slightly below average compared other smallie populations in the area.  On average it took four years for a fish to reach 8 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 17 years.   <br> \n <br> \nTen black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 1.1 fish/net.  This was below average compared to other similar lakes but right at the average compared to past surveys on Little Long.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches with an average of just over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 43.6 fish/net which was well above average compared to other similar lakes, but below average for Little Long Lake.  Sizes ranged from 4 to 8 inches with an average of just over 5 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9 years with strong representation (over 70% of the total catch) coming from the 2019 year class.  It took the average bluegill four years to reach 5 inches which was slightly better than average compared to other bluegill populations in the area.   <br> \n <br> \nRainbow smelt are a non-native invasive fish that were first caught in small mesh nets in 1989.  In the 2022 survey, 999 smelt were caught for a catch rate of 249.8 fish/net.  Previous surveys of smelt catches were highly variable ranging from 1.0 fish/net in 1989 and 1.3 fish/net in 2015 to what is now the new high mark in 2022.  Sizes have remained relatively constant through time with a 2022 average length of 5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish have been in Little Long since at least 1994.  Catch rates have generally increased in the gill nets from the low of 1.5 fish/net in 1994 to 57.0 fish/net in 2022.    <br> \n</p>",
