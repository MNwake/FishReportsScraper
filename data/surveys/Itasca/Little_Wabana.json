This species was present at a gillnet CPUE of 14.5 in this study.Northern pike were captured at a gillnet CPUE of 4.0 compared to a median for this Ecological Lake Classification #23 of 4.5.  The mean weight for the northern pike captured was 7.7 pounds.  Good growth was observed for this species with a mean length at age 4 of 26.2 inches (N=6) and age 5 fish at 29.1 inches (N=5).Bluegill abundance has appeared to have increased since the 1978 survey to a trapnet CPUE of 53.3.  This is much higher than the lake class median of 17.2.  Growth of bluegill is considered very slow.  Mean length at age 3 is 2.9 (N=9) and age 4 is 4.3 (N=21).A naturally reproducing population of walleyes exists possibly from an initial stocking of fry in 1953 and frylings in 1955.  A gillnet CPUE of 2.0 was observed in 1978 and 1.5 in this survey.  The lake class median for this species is 2.1 with a 1st quartile median of 0.89 and a 3rd quartile median of 4.75.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wabana Lake is a 104 acre lake located 11 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 57 feet and clear water (18 ft Secchi transparency).  There is a privately owned boat access on the north end of the lake off County Road #49.  As in the two previous surveys, the gill-net catch rate for northern pike (3.0/net) was below the lake class average (5.0/net).  Gill-net sampled pike had a good quality size structure; they ranged in length from 18.1 to 40.2 inches, with an average length of 27.0 inches.  Two fish over 38 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were well above the statewide average.  The gill-net catch rate for walleye (4.3/net) in the 2005 assessment was above the lake class average and the highest recorded in any of the three assessments on Little Wabana.  Sampled walleye ranged from 15.6 to 25.3 inches, with an average length of 19.4 inches.  No walleye have been stocked in Little Wabana since the 1950's.  Ages 3-8 were represented in the sample, indicating fairly consistent natural reproduction.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide average.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill was near the lake class average at 16.3/net.  This is down substantially from the catch of 53.2/net in the 1990 survey.  Bluegill size structure was fairly poor in 2005.  Fish in the trap nets varied from 3.4 to 8.1 inches, with only one fish over 8 inches in the sample.  The gill-net catch rate for black crappie was above the normal range at 2.0/net.  Sampled black crappie ranged from 8.3 to 11.8 inches, with an average length of 9.8 inches.  Ages 3-5 were represented in the sample and growth rates were similar to the statewide average.Gill-net and trap-net catch rates for largemouth bass were within the normal range in 2005.  Similar catch rates were observed for both gears for in the 1990 survey, while substantially higher catches were recorded in the 1978 survey.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in both gears in the 1978 survey, but have not been captured in test nets since that time.  A spring electrofishing assessment would likely provide better information on the bass population. The yellow perch gill-net catch was slightly above the normal range at 14.7/net.  Similar catch rates were reported in the two previous surveys.  The gill-net catch rate for tullibee was within the normal range at 6.3/net.  Test-net catches of tullibee are typically quite variable due to the pelagic and schooling nature of this species.  The tullibee catch was substantially higher in 1990 at 14.5/net, while no tullibee were sampled in the 1978 survey.  Other species sampled included: green sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.</p>",
