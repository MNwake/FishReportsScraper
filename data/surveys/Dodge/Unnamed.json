Seining information and visual observations during electrofishing suggest that strong 1992 year-classes of bluegills and yellow perch are present. Green sunfish X bluegill hybrids were commonly sampled. Numerous unknown hybrids, possibly a green sunfish X orange-spotted sunfish, consisting of some 3\" sexually mature individuals were also sampled. There appears to be a more than adequate forage base as reflected in the shoreline seining data. Two adult female largemouth bass and one adult sauger were sampled. The occurrence and potential impacts of these fish, in and on the currently managed fish community, and the probability that indiscriminate stocking by the public will continue, may jeopardize management goals.                                                                            </p>",
