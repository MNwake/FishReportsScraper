                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is located in northern Clearwater County about nine miles north of Leonard, Minnesota.  The lake is small, has clear water and one seasonal cabin.  Most of the lake is shallow with emergent or submerged vegetation, but there is a small zone of deep water.  A small unnamed lake (20 acres), a short distance west of the lake can be accessed with a canoe during high water years.   The public access is small with an earthen ramp and normally not accessible to larger boats.  Access is off County Road #11 on the northwest side of the lake.  This lake has not had a survey since 1971 and has no active fisheries management plan.   The fish community is very simple, consisting of nothern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, yellow perch and minnows.   Northern pike are common though the abundance is below that of most other lakes in class 36.  The pike are small, ranging from 18 to 28 inches, with most of them around 20-22 inches.  The average weight was 2.3 pounds.   Largemouth bass are above the lake class average in trap net samples, but they are below average in mean weight.  Bass reproduction seems consistent with five consecutive year classes sampled.  They ranged from six to sixteen inches in length.   Bluegill abundance is good but only 10% of the fish measured were more than seven inches long.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are not as abundant as bluegill and slightly smaller in size.   Yellow perch are present but the numbers are low.  Sizes sampled ranged from 5-8 inches.   Long Lake has probably experienced partial winterkills though the extent has not been documented.  Walleye fry were stocked four times between 1967 and 1973 and provided a limited fishery, but they are no longer present.</p>",
