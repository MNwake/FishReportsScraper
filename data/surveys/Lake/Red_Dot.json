The lake is approximately 16 miles northeast of Finland and is approximately 600 feet east of Lake County Rd #7 in a bog. There is no maintained trail to the lake.  Test nets in 2006 collected high numbers of white suckers and low numbers of yellow perch and various minnow species. Yellow perch up to 9.4 inches were collected, but most of the fish were smaller than 7.0 inches and too small to interest anglers.   </p>",
