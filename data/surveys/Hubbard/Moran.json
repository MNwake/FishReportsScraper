                "narrative": "<p>Moran Lake is located 3.5 miles south of Park Rapids, Minnesota.  The lake has a total area of 95 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The lake has a history of a fairly constant water level.  All of the lake's immediate watershed is forest land.  Three private homes with two boats were located on the lake at the time of this survey.  About 3% of the present lake water surface area is covered by standing emergent vegetation.  Local reports indicate that this lake winterkills occasionally.Test netting during the survey indicated that the lake contained high populations of perch and pumpkinseed sunfish, good northern pike and common sucker populations, and a small bluegill population.  Following severe winterkills, fish management should be directed toward building up the quickest catchable gamefish population at the least expense.  This is usually done through walleye fry stocking.Lord's Lake, which is located approximately 1/2 mile south of Moran Lake, was originally known as Moran lake, according to the original land survey made in 1861.  The present Moran Lake is also shown on the original survey map, but is not named or meandered.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moran is a 95 acre, shallow and narrow lake located south of Park Rapids.  Due to the shallow depth, Moran is subject to periodic \"winterkill\" events.  Winterkill happens when oxygen levels in the water drop to a level which is lethal to some fish species.  Winterkill usually happens during winters with heavy snowfall which acccumulates on the ice and blocks sunlight from penetrating to the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, which causes oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow, weedy lakes are more likely to winterkill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are more susceptile to low oxygen levels than are northern pike and bullhead.  The last partial winterkill on Moran occurred during the winter of 2003-2004.  Moran was opened up to liberalized fishing from 3/6/2004 to 4/1/2004.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Moran is in lake class 42.  Deer Lake is the only other class 42 lake in the Park Rapids area.Northern pike abundance was up, with the gillnet catch rate of 15.0 pike/net the highest recorded on Moran Lake.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.0 inches and 2.9 pounds, with pike measured up to 28.9 inches.  Bluegill abundance was also up, with the trapnet catch rate of 121.4/net the highest recorded for all surveys.  Bluegill numbers in past surveys have been much lower, generally below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Moran's bluegill population is currently composed of young, small fish in the 4 to 6 year old range and under 7 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other Park Rapids area lakes.  Pumpkinseed were sampled in low to moderate numbers and size of fish was small.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow perch are present in moderate numbers, but few perch were of an acceptable size for angling.  Other species sampled included low numbers of white sucker, hybrid sunfish and golden shiner.  Moderate numbers of rock bass were sampled.  Rock bass and golden shiner had not been sampled in previous surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moran Lake is located four miles south of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Moran is a long, narrow, shallow lake with a surface area of 100 acres and a maximum depth of only 15 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the north end of the lake off of 149th Avenue.  Moran provides fishing opportunities for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Moran is in lake class 42.  Class 42 lakes have the characteristics of being shallow, hard water, and 100% littoral (water depth of 15 feet or less).  Due to the shallow depth, Moran is subject to periodic \"winterkill\" events.  Winterkill usually happens during winters with heavy snowfall and long ice cover on the lakes.  Heavy snow cover and ice on the lakes block sunlight from penetrating into the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, which causes oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow, weedy lakes are more likely to winterkill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Walleye are more susceptible to low oxygen levels than are Northern Pike or Black Bullhead.  The winterkill events on Moran have been infrequent and partial, with a gamefish population remaining.  The last notable winterkill on Moran occurred during the winter of 1988-1989, 2003 - 2004, and 2013 -2014. <br> \n <br> \nMoran supports an abundant Northern Pike population.  Anglers will find lots of smaller sized Northern Pike in the 19 to 22 inch size range.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 30.9 inches.  Panfish are a popular choice for anglers on Moran with recent surveys showing good Bluegill numbers with fish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Pumpkinseed are also present, but small in size, with most fish under 6 inches in length.  Present and past surveys have shown Moran to support a low Black Crappie population.  Largemouth Bass abundance was up in Moran with fish up to 17.3 inches sampled.  Largemouth Bass have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys on Moran.  Yellow Perch were sampled in moderate numbers, but size was small, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Moran.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moran Lake is a shallow, narrow, 95 acre lake located south of Park Rapids.  Due to the shallow depth, Moran Lake is subject to periodic \"winter kill\" events.  Winter kill happens when oxygen levels in the water drop to a level which is lethal to some fish species.  Winter kill usually happens during winters with heavy snowfall which accumulates on the ice and blocks sunlight from penetrating to the water, which in turn limits oxygen production through photosynthesis.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, which causes oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow, weedy lakes are more likely to winter kill than are deep water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and walleye are more susceptible to low oxygen levels than are northern pike and bullhead.  Black crappie were stocked in 1984, 1988 and 1989 to help establish populations following winter kill events.  Yellow perch were stocked in 1989 to help increase the forage base for the northern pike.Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.5/gillnet).  Average size was small: 20.9 inches and 0.9 lbs.  Northern pike up to 29.2 inches were measured.  Historical northern pike gillnet catches have been higher, ranging from 7.0/gillnet in 1990 to 12.5/gillnet in 1980.Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (5.7/trapnet); however, average size was large: 8.1 inches and 0.5 lbs.  Bluegill ranged in length from 6.9 to 8.7 inches.  Bluegill have been sampled two other times; 0.8/trapnet in 1987 and 1.1/trapnet in 1963.  Sporadic bluegill population levels are indicative of winter kill lakes.Black crappie were sampled at moderate levels (5.0/trapnet).  Black crappie were small in size, with an average length of 8.0 inches and with largest fish sampled at 9.1 inches.  Historical trapnet catches have been lower.Pumpkinseed were sampled in high numbers (19.9/net), similar to past surveys.  Pumpkinseed were fair in size with an average length of 5.7 inches and with fish measured up to 7.3 inches.  Pumpkinseed are better able to withstand the winter kill conditions than are bluegill.Yellow perch were abundant (65.6/trapnet) and averaged 7.2 inches in length.  Historical catches of yellow perch have also been high.  Eleven percent of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 9.0 inches, acceptable size for angling, with fish measured up to 10.2 inches.White sucker were sampled in moderate numbers (5.0/gillnet).</p>",
