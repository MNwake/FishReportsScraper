Growth rates are slow for panfish, average for walleye and crappies, and above average for northerns.  Largemouth bass population appears good based on angler contact and observation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stone is a 77% littoral, 181 acre lake located 15 miles north and 8 miles west of Two Harbors, Minnesota.  The Drummond Road, an old railroad grade, acts as a dam to impound the lake resulting in stump strewn shallows.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch comprise the bulk of the fish community.     Largemouth bass were captured by electrofishing in the spring of 1997 at one of the higher rates in the area.  A large group of age 3 bass were present although ages 2 through eleven were represented in the sample.  Average length was 10.8 inches with a range from 6.3 to 17.8 inches.     Northern pike numbers were also quite high in the 1997 summer assessment.  Growth rate was below area medians with the average pike measuring 19.0 inches with a range from 12.6 to 29.3 inches.     Only two walleye were sampled in the 1997 investigation and they correlated to the 1988 walleye fry stocking.  Walleye from the subsequent fry stocking in 1993 and 1994 were not sampled.     Bluegill numbers declined from the 1991 investigation, however, were still quite high when compared to similar type lakes.  Average length was 7.0 inches with a range from 4.5 to 8.1 inches.  Most of the sampled bluegill were old as 93% were age 6 and over.     Black crappie numbers were low and had declined from the 1991 catch.  Average length was 8.5 inches with a range from 5.2 to 11.2 inches with the growth rate faster than the local average.     Other species sampled in the 1997 investigation at average numbers included:  yellow perch, white sucker and pumpkinseed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stone (Stump) is a 181 acre lake with 140 acres (77%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The lake is located 15 miles north and 8 miles west of Two Harbors, MN.  The Drummond Road, an old railroad grade, acts as a dam to impound the lake, resulting in stump-strewn shallows.  There is a county owned, gravel back-in access on the south end of the lake off the Drummond Road.  Little Stone was surveyed during the summer of 2012 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2007 (0.8) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Despite stocking numerous year-classes since 1999, the success of the biennial fingerling stocking program appears to be limited.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 40.1 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 11.2 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2010 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type but was down from 2007 (6.7).  Average size was 20.4 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes were represented from 2004 through 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2007 (3.4) and is below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 6.3 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Recruitment was sporadic, with several missing year-classes from 2004 through 2010.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 18.7 per trapnet lift was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and down from 2007 (52.1).  Average size was 5.5 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2010 were represented with strong 2005 and 2006 year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 4.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up from 2007 (1.7).  Average length of perch was small at 6.2 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 through 2009 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included central mudminnow, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nLittle Stone was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2012.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stone (Stump) is a 181 acre lake located 15 miles north and 8 miles west of Two Harbors, MN.  The Drummond Road, an old railroad grade, acts as a dam to impound the lake, resulting in stump strewn shallows.  Maximum depth is 17 feet, with 77% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  There is a county owned, gravel, back-in access on the south end of the lake off the Drummond Road.     Walleye fry have been stocked in Little Stone since 1983; fingerling stocking began in 1999.  Walleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of walleye was large at 21.9 inches.  Growth was not evaluated because of the small sample size.  Of the three fish sampled, each was from a different year-class (1990, 1993, and 1996) and only one was from a year in which walleyes were stocked (1993).     Northern pike abundance of 8.2 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of northern pike was 18.8 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 21.5 inches.  All year-classes were represented from 1997 through 2001, with a strong 1999 year-class (45% of the fish).     Black crappie abundance of 1.1 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black crappie was 8.4 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 8.1 inches.  Four year-classes were represented from 1996 through 1999.  Black crappie were also caught in gillnets at the rate of 2.3 per lift.     Bluegill abundance of 14.6 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of bluegill was 5.8 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 5.2 inches.  Six year-classes were represented from 1994 through 2000.    Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing.  Largemouth bass abundance was 104.2 per hour of electrofishing, which was up from 1997 (91.2).  Mean length of largemouth bass was 10.9 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 10.7 inches.  All year-classes were represented from 1993 through 1999.     Yellow perch abundance of 5.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of yellow perch was small at 6.5 inches.     Little Stone should provide excellent angling for largemouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike.  Other fish sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",

The lake is located 15 miles north and 8 miles west of Two Harbors, MN.  The Drummond Road, an old railroad grade, acts as a dam to impound the lake, resulting in stump-strewn shallows.  There is a county owned, gravel back-in access on the south end of the lake off the Drummond Road.  Little Stone was surveyed during the summer of 2007 to update information about fish populations, water quality and the aquatic plant community.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2002 (0.5) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was large at 22.4 inches, however too few individuals were sampled (6) to evaluate growth rates.  Only one fish sampled was less than 22 inches in length and average weight was 4.0 pounds.  Five fish were aged and all were from stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 6.7 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type but was down from 2002 (8.2).  Average size was 21.6 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Twenty-nine percent of the sample was over 24 inches in length.  A strong 2002 year-class was present (39%) with all year-classes represented from 2000 through 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (1.1) and is average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.4 inches was below average and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only 13% of the fish sampled were over 8 inches in length.  The 1999 and 2004 year-classes were absent, but other years from 1998 through 2005 were represented with a large percentage of the catch coming from the 2005 year-class (37%).   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 52.1 per trapnet lift was well above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.0 inches was large but growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2002 were represented with strong 2000, 2001 and 2002 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was small at 6.2 inches and growth was very slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The 2000, 2002 and 2003 year-classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and golden shiners.   <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate types and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was moderate with 24 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  Northern water-milfoil was the most frequently found plant (90% of transects) followed by Robbins-leaf pondweed, Canada waterweed and white water lily (85% of transects).  Rare species include blue flag iris, reed canary grass (an invasive plant) and flat-stem pondweed, which were identified at 5% of the sampling stations.  The most common substrate types were rubble, boulder and sand which were identified along 75%, 70% and 70% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Little Stone is a slightly alkaline, slightly hard water lake with low fertility.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Stone (Stump) Lake is located about 16 miles to the northwest of Two Harbors, MN. Access is a gravel back-in on the south end of the lake off the Drummond Road. The Drummond Road is an old railroad grade and acts as a dam to impound the lake resulting in stump-strewn shallows. The lake is 181 acres with 140 acres (77%) littoral area and has a maximum depth of 17 feet. The 2022 survey was completed to update information about fish populations in Little Stone Lake. This was the first survey to be performed since Walleye stocking was discontinued in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 46 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing. The catch rate of bass was 33.7 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time. The average length of Largemouth Bass was 14.7 inches and 49% of the catch was over 15 inches. Six year-classes were represented and growth for bass was found to be slow for the Duluth Area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 40.5 per trapnet lift was above the normal range compared to similar lakes. The average length was 5.0 inches yet only two fish were over 8 inches long. All year-classes from 2013 to 2020 were represented indicating consistent recruitment and 60% of the catch was made up of strong year-classes in 2016 and 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trapnet catch was within the normal range for similar Minnesota lakes. The gillnet catch for crappie was also within the normal range. The average length of Black Crappie was 6.8 inches and 13% of the catch was over 10 inches long. Seven ages of crappie were found with age-2 fish making up 45% of the catch. Growth of Black Crappie was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch was above the normal range compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and higher than the previous two surveys. The average size of pike was 21.1 inches with the largest fish measuring 32.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.7 fish per gillnet lift was below the normal range for similar type lakes in Minnesota. The length of sampled fish was large ranging from 20.2 to 27.8 inches. Two Walleye were aged with one 11 years old and a remnant from past stocking. The other was 6 years old from a year not stocked. Recruitment and natural reproduction appear to be sporadic with low numbers sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catch of Yellow Perch was within the normal range for similar Minnesota lakes. The average length of perch was small at 6.1 inches and only one perch was longer than 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. </p>",
