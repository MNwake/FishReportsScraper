Average populations of bowfin, northern cisco, northern pike, black, yellow and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, black crappie and yellow perch. A low population of white suckers was indicated. Comparisons were made with lake group 8 medians within the Brainerd Area. Northern pike length frequencies ranged between 17 and 31 inches. Growth rates are fast for ages 1 and 2 and are average for ages 3 and older. Ages 1-7 were represented by the fish sampled. A high population of bluegills 84.66/lift, compared to 10.6/lift for similar lakes in the area, was present in North Long Lake. Ages represented were 4, 5, 6 and 8 and all ages showed slow growth rates. Individual lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.5 inches with 73% between 5 and 7 inches. Largemouth bass sampled were aged from 1 to 4 years old. One and 2 years old fish comprised 75% of the sample. Lengths ranged from 5-14 inches. Growth rates are average for all ages when compared to statewide averages. Black crappies sampled indicated a young population present. Seventy five percent of the sample was one and two year old fish. Individual lengths ranged from 4-12 inches with most 4 and 5 inches. Growth rates were average for all age classes. An average population of yellow perch was present with ages 2-6 represented. Growth rates were average and lengths present ranged from 5 to 9 1/2 inches. Six inch fish made up two-thirds of the sample. An excellent population of walleyes was present with individual lengths ranging from 8 to 27 inches.  Average growth rates were exhibited by all age classes. The 2 and 3 year old fish were most abundant making up 55% of the sample. Northern cisco indicated an average population with length frequencies ranging from 7 to 15 inches, seven inch fish made up 50% of the sample. An average population of bullheads was present. All three species, yellow, brown and black were found in the lake with yellow the most abundant. Length frequencies ranged from 6.5 to 16 inches. Eight to twelve inch fish represented 95% of the sample.</p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on September 24, 2018 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  The total sample time was 59 minutes, which resulted in a YOY catch rate of 11.2/hr run-time.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 53.3/hr run-time.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 6.9\" to 8.3\", with an average length of 7.7\".  Walleyes that were age 1 and older were captured at a rate of 18.3/hr run-time.  They ranged in length from 10.6\" to 22.1\" and had an average length of 15.0\".</p>",

Development is fairly heavy, with ofer 450 homes/cabins present, along with nearly a dozen resort/campgrounds of various types.  The lake's three basins provide a variety of habitat for the diverse fish population.In 1993, black crappies, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, largemouth bass and bowfin (dogfish) were found in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Black and brown bullheads, white suckers and northern pike were found in \"low\" numbers.  Northern pike were, however, fast growing and several age classes were present.  Walleyes were found in \"average\" numbers, had good growth and many year classes were sampled.  Rock bass, yellow bullheads, tullibees and yellow perch were also found in \"average\" numbers.In spite of heavy development, North Long supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  Bass, sunfish and crappies currently have excellent spawning habitat.  Protection of bulrush beds will help maintain this quality in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Long lake is 6,000 acres in size and is one of the larger and more popular recreational lakes in the Brainerd Area Fisheries management area.  According to the latest cabin count (1993), development is fairly dense with over 450 cabins and homes and about a dozen resorts and campgrounds located along the shores.  Larger dwellings such as multi-family homes, townhomes and possibly condominiums are also becoming more numerous.  The lake is comprised of three distinct basins, each having its own characteristics.  In many ways, the three basins can be considered to be seperate lakes.  This variety of habitat accounts for a widely diverse fish population.In 1999, northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass were netted in high numbers compared to similar lake types.  Carp, brown bullheads and white suckers were found in low numbers.  Other species such as rock bass, yellow bullheads, tullibees, black crappies, walleyes and yellow perch were found in average numbers.Northern pike growth was good and several age classes were present.  Walleyes were found in average numbers, had good growth and five year classes were sampled.  Walleye stocking has taken place annualy since 1986.  Largemouth bass continue to be present in high numbers and are a popular angling attraction.  Also, the lake sustains substantial winter and summer fishing aimed at black crappies, bluegills and walleyes.  An open water angler (creel)census is planned to be completed in 2000.In spite of heavy shoreline development and recreational use, North Long supports a healthy and diverse aquatic plant community.  Extensive bulrush stands offer excellent spawning, forage and cover habitat for many fish species and should be actively protected through the Aquatic Plant Management Program in the Department of Natural Resources.  Protection and perpetuation of plant species is tantamount to maintaining healthy fish populations and good water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in North Long Lake was conducted on August 13-15, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 24 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 22 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 24 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates North Long Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

North Long is known for its shallow sand flats, with 65% being 15' deep or less.  However, it reaches depths of 97'.  Walleyes are one of the more popular species on North Long.  Walleyes are stocked annually as fry (3,900,000/year) and were sampled in average numbers in 2021 when compared to similar lakes at 4.9/gill net.  Average length was 17.3\" and all but one fish was 12\" or longer.  Walleyes ranged from 11.3\" to 25.0\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 5.7/gill net.  Average length was 21.1\", with 63% of the fish below the 22-26\" protected slot and only 8% over 26\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was not conducted for Largemouth Bass in 2021.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets at 1.3/gill net.  Average length was 11.9\" and 45% of the fish were 12\" or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in average numbers in high numbers for this type of lake (1.3/gill net).  Average length was 7.1\", with 26% measuring 8\" or larger.  Fish up to 12.9\" were sampled, however.  In 2021, a new regulation was adopted that reduces the crappie and sunfish daily limit to 5 each in order to protect and improve panfish sizes.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Long Lake, at 5,998 acres, is one of the largest and most popular lakes in the Brainerd area.  The lake is heavily developed with 21.7 homes/cabins per shoreline mile as of 1993 in addition to several resorts and campgrounds of various types and sizes.  There are 4 public accesses providing many recreational opportunities.  The maximum depth is 97' and about 65% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, although areas of silt, gravel, and rubble are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 43 species present and is critical to maintaining good water quality and healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 walleye catch of 10.1/gill net is above average for this and similar lakes.  Average length and weight were similar to the previous netting in 2000 at 16.2\" and 1.7lbs.  Age 3-5 fish (2001-2003 year classes) accounting for 62% of the gill net catch.   These fish measured approximately 12\" to 20\" at the time of the survey.  In recent years walleye have been stocked annually as fry.  These fry-stocked year classes accounted for 59% of the catch, suggesting that fry stocking has been successful.  In general, there are several abundant year classes from 2001-2005 that should provide quality fishing now and in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance remained above average at 9.5/gill net in 2006.  Average length and weight were similar to 2000 at 22.5\" and 2.6 lbs with 31% measuring at least 24\".   <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass catch was typical of past catches on North Long and a bit higher than on similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 88.3/hr with an average length of 11.6\" and 43% measuring at least 12\".  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was the lowest to date, but at 43.5/trap net, it is above average compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in average numbers (0.7/gill net and 0.4/trap net) when compared to past catches on North Long and similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The tullibee catch was above average at 6.7/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance has varied considerably in the past, ranging from 5.6 to 24.9/gill net.  The 2006 catch of 16.7/gill net was typical for this and similar lakes.   <br> \n</p>",

The total sample time was 1.5 hours, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 27.3 fish/hour, the second highest catch rate to date.  The 2010 YOY comprised 61% of the total sample, ranged in size from 5.6-7.4 inches, and averaged 6.5 inches long.  The catch rate for age-I and older walleyes  was  17.3 fish/hour.  These fish ranged in size from 9.3-22.6 inches long and ranged up to age-VIII.  The 2008 year class was the most abundant of these older fish, comprising 16% of the total sample.  Although the 2010 sample was similar to that of 2008, the large amount of shallow sandy substrate has traditionally made electrofishing success inconsistent compared to other lakes in the Brainerd management area.  Hence, conclusions should be reached with caution.</p>",

Although walleye numbers appear to have dropped (4.5/net) since our last survey in 2009, they were still average for this type of lake.  Average length was 15.6\" and 68% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAnother popular fish on North Long is largemouth bass.  Numbers looked healthy, with an electrofishing catch rate of 99.0/hr run-time.  Size was decent as well, with 66% measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high for this type of lake (13.3/net).  Average size was 20.6\" and 17% of the fish were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish number looked good, but size was lacking.  Black crappie numbers were high for this type of lake, but average length was only between 6.8\" and 7.3\".  Only 15% were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were average for this type of lake (23.4/net), but still the lowest to date on North Long.  While a few bluegills up to 9.4\" were caught, the average length was only 5.5\" and 16% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Long is a popular 5,998 acre lake located just north of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  North Long is known for its shallow sand flats, with 65% being 15' deep or less.  It reaches depths of 97'.  Walleyes are one of the more popular species on North Long.  Walleyes are stocked annually as fry (3,900,000/year), and were sampled in low numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 3.9/gill net.  Average length was 15.7\", with 88% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Walleyes ranged from 10.4\" to 23.7\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 4.5/ gill net.  Most were on the smaller side, with an average length of 20.1\".  Northern pike ranged from 9.8\" to 28.7\", with 18% measuring at least 24\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in high numbers at 1.9/gill net.  Average length was 11.6\".  Electrofishing was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill nets (1.0/net) and trap nets (1.3/net).  Average length was 9.2\" for gill nets and 5.3\" for trap nets.  For both gear types combined 37% measured at least 8\".  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 21.6/ trap net.  Most were on the small side with an average length of 4.6\".  Only 3% measured at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for walleye and northern pike.  Perch were sampled in low numbers at 3.2/gill net.  Most are too small to be of interest to anglers with an average length of 6.6\". <br> \n <br> \nNorth Long Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Long, at 5,998 acres is one of the largest and most popular lakes in the Brainerd Area.  The lake is heavily developed with 21.7 homes/cabins per shoreline mile as of 1993, in addition to several resorts and campgrounds of various types and sizes.  There are four public accesses providing many recreational opportunities.  The maximum depth is 97 feet and about 65% of the lake is fifteen feet deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, although areas of silt, gravel and rubble are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 43 species present and is critical to maintaining good water quality and healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and providing essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye catch of 9.27/GN was similar to the 2006 catch of 10.1/GN and near the upper quartile value of 9.63/GN for the lake class.  Size averaged 15.3 inches and 1.46 pounds, similar to the 2006 values of 16.2 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Nine year classes were sampled, with fish aged 2-5 all being fairly abundant.  Growth was in the \"average\" category.  About 92% of sampled walleyes were from years since annual fry stocking began in 2002.  Fall electrofishing produced a catch rate of 3.33 young walleyes per hour, a typical result in this lake.  Overall, the walleye population seems to be in good shape, with several fairly strong year classes present and a good growth rate. <br> \n <br> \nThe pike catch showed a decline to 5.0/GN from the 2006 value of 9.5/GN, and now is equal to the median value for the lake class.  Size remained similar to 2006 values, at 22.3 inches and 2.75 pounds.  Pike that were at least 24 inches long equaled 33% of the catch and 8% were at least 30 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of largemouth bass was the highest to date, at 2.0/net.  Bass averaged 12.3 inches long.  Of those at least 8.0 inches long, 90% were at least 12 inches long and 25% were at least 15 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie was only 3 fish (0.20/GN).  Size ranged from 7.0 to 9.4 inches and 67% were at least 8.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch has ranged from 5.6/GN to 24.9/GN in the eleven nettings to date.  The 2009 catch was 13.4/GN, similar to the 2006 catch of 16.67/GN and \"average\" for the lake class.  Seven age classes were sampled and age three and four perch were most abundant.  Growth was \"average.  The tullibee catch (0.60/GN) showed a decline from the 2006 value of 6.67/GN.  Fish from three year classes were present in the sample of nine fish.  The 2009 catch remained in the \"average\" category for the lake class. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye are stocked as fry every year into North Long and the population looked good in 2015.  The gill net catch was typical for this type of lake (7.6/net), with an average length of 16.0\" and 94% measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers were high (9.8/net), but the population was dominated by smaller fish.  Average length was 21.5\" and only 21% of the fish were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for walleye.  The net catch in 2015 was low (5.6/net) for the second straight survey (3.4/net in 2012).  The abundant small northern pike may have something to do with this.  Anglers are reminded to keep some of these smaller pike and release those over 24\". <br> \n</p>",
