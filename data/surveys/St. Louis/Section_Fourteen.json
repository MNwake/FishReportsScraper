Although walleye fingerlings have been stocked since 1990, the lake produces mainly northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.     Average numbers of northern pike were sampled in the 1995 population assessment with a mean length of 19.3 inches with a few pike over 25 inches.  Bluegill numbers were high with an average length of 6.5 inches and a few fish over 8 inches.  Black crappie numbers were average with a mean length of 7.2 inches and a maximum length of 9.5 inches.  Pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker and yellow perch were also present in low to average numbers in Section Fourteen Lake.  Largemouth bass will be assessed in the spring of 1996.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 14 is a 140 acre lake with 110 (79%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 27 feet.  The lake is located 2 miles southeast of Makinen, MN off County Road #108 and has a DNR administered, concrete, back-in access.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even years from 1990 through 2002, except 1996.  Primary management species from the 1997 lake management plan were walleye and largemouth bass and secondary species were bluegill and black crappie.     Walleye abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance has increased slightly from 0.5 and 0.7 per gillnet lift in 1989 and 1995.  Of the seven walleye aged from the 2003 investigation, six (86%) were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Mean length was 19.3 inches.  Growth was average with length at age IV of 15.6 inches.  Results of the last two investigations (1995 and 2003) have shown a low catch rate for walleye despite stocking of fingerlings every other year since 1990.  It is uncertian what may be limiting the recruitment of stocked walleye to assessment gear.  The stocking program will be more thoroughly examined in the lake management plan to be written in conjunction with the 2003 population assessment.     The scheduled largemouth bass electrofishing assessment was not completed.  No largemouth bass were sampled during the summer population assessment.  An electrofishing assessment will be conducted in conjunction with the next scheduled investigation.     Bluegill abundance of 11.3 per trapnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 7.1 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 4.1 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1997 year-class and all year-classes from 1993 through 2001 represented.     Black crappie abundance of 2.1 per trapnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 7.5 inches.  Growth was average with length at age IV of 7.4 inches.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes from 1998 through 2002 represented.     Northern pike abundance of 5.8 per gillnet was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 18.9 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age IV of 19.8 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 1999 and 2000 year-classes and only four year-classes represented.     Other fish species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",
