Adult rainbow and brown trout were stocked 10-23-87 to provide an interim fishery prior to the warmwater species restocking. Although an occasional trout is still reported, none were taken during this assessment. Bluegill, yellow perch, channel catfish and yellow bullhead provide the present fishery with largemouth bass and walleye expected to enter the catch in 1991. Black crappie, black bullhead and northern pike were also sampled and these species were probably stocked by the public. An extremely abundant year class (1989) of juvenile black crappie was sampled during this assessment and may have an adverse impact on future management of the lake. Available forage species are primarily yellow perch and golden shiner.</p>",

The strong 1989 year class of black crappies is still well represented in the current fish population. Length frequency distribution suggests that many of these fish will be of an acceptable size during the winter 1992-1993. Additional species of fish present include: good numbers of quality size yellow bullheads, good numbers of yellow perch, and an occasional channel catfish and northern pike. Shoreline seining efforts suggest poor panfish recruitment in 1992 and few available forage fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tKohlmeier Lake in Steele County is a 32 acre lake located within the city of Owatonna. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake off 18th street southwest. A fishing pier is located on the north end of the lake off Swimming Pool Road. A local ordinance covering the lake allows for electric trolling motor use only. <br> \n\tA fisheries population assessment was conducted the week of July 7th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Gill netting was difficult due to heavy curlyleaf pondweed growth. Gill net catches were comprised mostly of black bullhead (28.5 fish per net), bluegill (8.5 fish per net), yellow bullhead (4.5 fish per net), and black crappie (4.5 fish per net). Two northern pike, one hybrid sunfish, and a largemouth bass were also caught in the gill nets.  <br> \n\tTrap netting was difficult from slow sloping shorelines and seasonal low water. Trap net catches were overwhelmed with bluegill. Bluegills were trap netted at a rate of 190.6 fish per net. Size range was poor, between 3.4 and 6.0 inches. Average size was 4.7 inches. Hybrid and green sunfish were netted at a rate of 5.0 and 2.8 fish per trap net respectively. Other fish captured in the trap nets at trace levels were white sucker, largemouth bass, black crappie, and walleye. Bluegill size structure in Kohlmeier lake exhibits characteristics of a stunted population. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Kohlmier is managed primarily for largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill.  Walleye are stocked every other year to provide an additional sport angling opportunity.  Northern pike are present in the lake and may have been deposited during past flooding of the Straight River.  The DNR has never stocked northern pike into Lake Kohlmeier.  A winterkill in 1996 appears to have negatively impacted at least one component of the fish community.  Many large individual gamefish such as channel catfish, largemouth bass, and bluegill were unfortunately lost.  Additionally, the average size of bluegill remains similar to the past - small.  There may be several reasons for this, none of which is an easy fix.  Lake City Area Fisheries will consider potential strategies to improve this.  Largemouth bass numbers and average size appears to be down from past years.  Sampling conditions during this assessment however were poor.  Spring sampling for largemouth bass in 1999 will shed more light on the condition of the bass population.Northern pike and walleye abundance remains similar to past years.  Neither species has ever been very abundant, however, a few lucky anglers seem to catch some every year.Presently, black crappie are doing well, and probably offer the best chance for some decent action.  Over 80% of the crappie collected during this assessment were nine inches or better.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Largemouth bass continue to have the best chance at providing quality fishing in Lake Kohlmeier.  Bass ranging in age from 3 to 6 years old were collected at a rate of 34 fish per hour in May, 2000.  The percentage of the population 15 inches or greater has averaged about 23 percent over the past 4 years.  A partial winterkill in 1996-97 was thought to have claimed many of the larger bass in the lake.  Electrofishing surveys completed since then have shown this to be not the case, as fish up to 19 inches have been collected.   Bluegill abundance (13.3/set) is what we'd expect to see in a lake like Kohlmeier.  The average size unfortunately is small, about 10/pound.  Black crappie abundance (.8/set) is low, as is average size (5.3 inches).   Walleye are stocked biennally to provide anglers with an alternative to bass/panfish.  Because only one gillnet is used, it's tough to estimate population characteristics.  Few walleye are collected, however the ones that are, are usually over 20 inches long.    Northern pike are not stocked by DNR.  Nevertheless, they are present in the lake, either due to escapement from the Straight River, or by intentional stocking by local citzenry.  Abundance estimates since 1990 range from 1-14/set.  Average size is about 20 inches.  Northern pike are voracious feeders, and can quickly decimate a forage supply that would otherwise be utilized by walleye and largemouth bass.  Transporting gamefish from one body of water to another is illegal without a DNR permit, and can have negative consequences to existing fisheries. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Kohlmeier is a 32 acre pond located within the city limits of Owatonna.  It has very good water clarity and good growth of rooted, aquatic vegetation.  Different species present include northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  It is primarily managed as a bass/panfish lake, with recent emphasis focused on black crappie.The lake suffered a couple partial winterkills in the late 1990's, causing an overall decline in numbers of gamefish, particularly large predator species such as largemouth bass, walleye, and channel catfish.   The present abundance of bluegill and black crappie is about what we'd expect to see in a lake like Kohlmeier.  Average size is poor though (about 5 inches).  Largemouth bass abundance is low, and needs time to recover from previous winterkills.  Stocking of adults may be necessary to jump-start the population.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year, and channel catfish may be added to this.  Over 2300 adult black crappie were stocked in 2001.  These fish have survived, and will likely provide good fishing in 2003 and beyond.The City of Owatonna has purchased a state of the art aeration system that should prevent the lake from winterkilling again.  This will go a long way toward maintaining and improving the recreational fishery of Lake Kohlmeier.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Kohlmeir is a small, clear water lake that often provides excellent fishing within the city limits of Owatonna, MN.  Largemouth bass, many over 16 inches, are sampled annually by DNR fisheries crews with electrofishing equipment during the spring.  Rooted vegetation, submerged logs and tree branches provide good habitat near the shoreline.  Bluegill and black crappie are also present in good numbers.  While bluegill average size is small, black crappie have been getting bigger and presently average just over 8 inches.Walleye and northern pike are also regularly sampled by survey crews.  Average size of walleye and northern pike sampled in survey nets during this survey was 15.2 and 18.9 inches, respectively.  While neither species can be described as \"abundant\", it is not uncommon to here reports of some nice fish being caught.Lake Kohlmeir was drawn down and chemically reclaimed in 1987. Since then, a variety of fish including walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch and yellow bullhead have been stocked to develop a sport fishery.  Channel catfish have also been stocked but have not been captured in sampling nets to date.  The presence of northern pike is likely the result of unapproved stocking by local citizens. A voluntary catch and release regulation for largemouth bass has been in place since 1991.  Additionally, operation of outboard motors other than electric trolling motors is prohibited.</p>",
