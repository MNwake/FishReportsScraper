                "narrative": "<p>Mud or Vails Lake is a 324 acre lake located three miles north of the City of Eden Valley.  The maximum depth of the lake is 20 feet and during mid-August adequate oxygen is present down to 17 feet.  A public access is located on Mud Lake in the southeast corner of the lake, near the wastewater treatment plant.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, and northern pike are the most common gamefish species taken in the lake.  In the summer of 1995, a population assessment was conducted on Mud Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.        The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (1.8/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey when no fish were sampled but remained below expected levels for lakes that are similar to Mud.  The average size northern caught in gill nets was 2.3 pounds and 21.6 inches.  The largest northern pike caught was over 29 inches in length.  Two to seven year old fish were sampled in gill nets and the growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The catch rate of walleye in gill nets (3.8/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey (0.5/gill net) and rose within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size walleye caught during our assessment was 1.2 pounds and this average weight was within expected levels for the lake type.  Overall, walleye sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 13.2-20.4 inches and averaged 15.0 inches in length.  The overall growth rate of walleye was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in Mud Lake (53.5/gill net) significantly increased from the last survey (11.8/gill net) and remained above expected levels for this lake type.  The average size yellow perch caught in gill nets was 6.2 inches in length and 0.1 pounds in weight.  While this average size may seem small, yellow perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like the northern pike and walleye.       The overall catch in trap nets was down during the 1995 population assessment.  Trap net catch can be highly variable and changes in weather can impact netting success.  During the 1995 assessment, weather was cool and this can cause a reduction in trap net catches as less fish are present in the shallows where these nets are placed.         The black crappie catch rate in trap nets (0.8/trap net) apparently declined from the 1990 survey (39.2/net) and fell below expected levels for this lake type.  Black crappies sampled ranged in length from 7.5-10.6 inches and averaged 8.8 inches in length.  The mean weight of black crappie caught in trap nets was good (0.4 pounds) and appeared to increase from the 1990 survey.            The trap net catch of bluegills in Mud Lake (2.6/trap net) appeared to decline from the previous netting in 1990 (36.8/lift).  The mean weight of bluegill sampled (0.3 pounds) appeared to increase from the lake survey (0.1 pounds) and rose above expected levels for this lake class.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 5.4-8.5 inches and averaged 6.8 inches in length.       The catch rate of black bullhead in trap nets (1.2/net) declined sharply from the 1990 survey (528.2/trap net) and fell to within expected levels for this lake class.  The mean weight of black bullhead (0.9 pounds) appeared to increase and rose above expected levels for lakes similar to Mud.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake, also known as Vails Lake, is located north of Eden Valley, in south-central Stearns County.  The lake is 151 acres and relatively shallow.  It is the first of a series of lakes that outlet northward to join the Sauk River chain of lakes.  Nearly 23,000 acres of mostly agricultural land form the watershed of Mud Lake, and this is reflected in the lake's impaired water quality.  The lake is prone to partial winterkill, and this occurred most recently in 2001.  Fieldwork in 2003 included night electrofishing, gill- and trapnetting, shoreline seining, and an aquatic plant survey.Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in May.  Forty-three bass were captured in 1.1 hours (40.7/hr, on-time), somewhat lower than average for lakes in the area.  Lakes with low water clarity typically have fewer aquatic plants and fewer largemouth bass than clear lakes.  Several bass sampled were greater than 16 inches, and the largest was nearly 19 inches.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was within the range expected for a lake like Mud, but significantly higher than in 1995, and higher than it has been in past surveys.  Average size (3.1 pounds) was high, which may be due in part to the ample yellow perch available for forage.  Mud Lake is not stocked with walleye, but a few were sampled during the 2003 survey.  It is likely that fish can migrate in from Eden Lake (less than 1/2 mile away), which is regularly stocked with walleye fry.  The catch rate of black crappie in 2003 was relatively high.  Historically, catch rates of black crappie have been high, with the exception of the 1995 survey.  Most of the crappie sampled in 2003 were age 2 (6.5 inches) or age 4 (8 inches), with only a few older fish.  The catch rate and average size (0.24 pounds) of bluegill were both within the normal range.  The average length of bluegills sampled was 6.5 inches, and the largest was 8.3 inches.  It appears that any winterkill that occured in 2001 had only a temporary impact on panfish populations.Other species sampled in 2003 included black, yellow and brown bullheads, common carp, bowfin, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Vails Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 17, 2019. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Vails Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake, also known as Vails Lake, is located north of Eden Valley, in south-central Stearns County.  The lake is 151 acres and relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 20 feet.  It is the first of a series of lakes that outlet northward to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  Nearly 23,000 acres of mostly agricultural land form the watershed of Mud Lake, and this is reflected in the lake's impaired water quality.  The lake has had a history of partial winterkill, but significant fish loss has not occurred since 2001.  Submersed plant growth is inhibited by low water clarity.  Coontail and sago pondweed were the most common species sampled, but curly-leaf pondweed was also very abundant in early June. The 2013 survey consisted of day-time electrofishing, gill and trap netting, and an aquatic plant survey. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing in late May.  Forty-five Largemouth Bass were captured in just under 1 hour of effort, somewhat above average for lakes in the area.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 18.8 inches with an average length and weight of 11.5 inches and 0.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike in 2013 was within the range expected for lakes like Mud and similar to the rate observed in 2003.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 30.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Seventeen percent of the Northern Pike catch was longer than 24 inches.  Average size has decreased, which may be due to a decrease in the number of Yellow Perch available for forage.   <br> \n <br> \nMud Lake is not stocked with Walleye, but several were sampled during the 2013 survey.  It is likely that fish can migrate in from Eden Lake (less than 1/2 mile), which is regularly stocked with Walleye fry.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.5 to 23.0 inches, and averaged 18.2 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Channel Catfish, which were not found in previous surveys, were also sampled in low numbers compared to the rest of the Sauk River of Chain of Lakes but the average length and weight (21.4 inches and 3.5 pounds) was larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Crappie was relatively high, which has been historically the case in Mud Lake.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.8 to 11.8 inches with a mean length of 8.2 inches and 0.34 pounds.  The catch rate of Bluegill was also high in Mud Lake and fish ranged in length from 4.6 to 8.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 6.3 inches and 0.21 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nGrowth rates of all the species mentioned above were similar to statewide averages.  Other species sampled in 2013 included Black and Yellow bullheads, Common Carp, Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Golden Shiner, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Vails Lake was conducted on August 7-8, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter) and four tolerant species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Vails Lake based on this survey is just above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Vails Lake (aka Mud Lake) is a 151 acre lake located just north of Eden Valley in southern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 20 feet. It is the first in a series of lakes which outlet northward to the Sauk River chain of lakes. The watershed is large and dominated by agriculture, pasture, and development. A public access and fishing pier are located on the south end of the lake. Vails Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish and anglers can expect good fishing for these species. The last survey was done in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation were sparse, primarily cattail and a few waterlilies. Submergent vegetation was not surveyed in 2018, but in 2013 coontail and sago pondweed were abundant. Curly leaf pondweed was abundant in spring and early summer in 2013. Water clarity (Secchi depth) was moderate in mid June (4.5') and dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 16 feet. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have been increasing, but their size remains good. Current results were higher than 2013, but within the expected range of values for likes like Vails. Pike lengths ranged from 13.4 to 30.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 3.0 pounds. 27% of pike were over 26 inches and two percent were over 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in mid May by daytime electrofishing. The catch per hour (46) was similar to the Sauk Rapids Area average of 43 per hour and 2013 results of 47 per hour. Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 18.7 inches with an average length of 13.8 inches. 56% of Largemouth Bass were over 15 inches, an improvement from 2013 when only 5% exceeded 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nVails Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings annually since 2011 by the Eden Valley Sportsmen's Club. However, the Walleye catch in 2018 was below the expected range of values for similar lakes and down from the 2013 catch. Walleye were large; lengths ranged from 19.0 to 25.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 3.7 ponds. Northern Pike numbers are likely affecting walleye fingerling survival, but the stocking rate is also low. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers have decreased since 2003 but are still in the expected range of values for the lake class. Perch lengths ranged from 5.8 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. The decline in Yellow Perch numbers is likely due to increasing numbers of Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish have recently become established in Vails Lake as well as other lakes connected to the Sauk River Chain of Lakes. The catch in 2018 was similar to 2013, but none were captured in surveys prior to 2013. Catfish were large; lengths ranged from 21.6 to 31.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 27.3 inches and 11.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have increased from 2013 and 2003 and were above the expected range of values for the lake class. Crappie lengths ranged from 4.9 to 12.6 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches. Only five percent were 10 inches or longer. The Bluegill catch was within the expected range and similar to 2013. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.2 inches with a mean length of 5.8 inches. Less than 1% of the Bluegill catch were eight inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nOther species samples included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
