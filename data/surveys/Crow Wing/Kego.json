                "narrative": "<p>Kego is a 272 acre lake located 3 miles northwest of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the southeast end of the lake.  Development is not quite as heavy as other area lakes, with 25 homes/cabins scattered mainly along the north and east sides of the lake.  Most of these are tucked back into the woods.  The maximum depth is 20 feet and 62% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The aquatic plant community consists of 29 species of which flat-stem pondweed is the most abundant.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other aquatic species.  Kego has been known to winterkill in the past.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers when compared to similar lakes (17.2/gill net).  The 2000 and 2001 year classes represented 57% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 16.7\" to 23.2\".  Average length and weight were 21.9\" and 2.6 lbs, with 30% of the fish being 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets at above average rates (2.3/gill net).  The average length and weight of bass sampled in gill nets was 14.8\" and 2.0 lbs, with 93% measuring 12\" or larger.The bluegill catch in 2003 was the lowest ever recorded at 13.44/trap net.  This number was as high as 86.2/trap net in 1985.  Average length of these fish was 6.4\", with 38% being 7\" or larger.  Growth of these fish was fast.The black crappie catch rate also declined from recent nettings, however, the number of fish caught per net (1.4/trap net and 4.3/gill net) is still average when compared to similar lakes.  The 1999 and 2001 year classes represented 59% of the catch.  The average length from trap nets and gill nets was 8.5\" and 8.2\",respectively, with 67% being 8\" or larger.The yellow perch catch was high at 48.5/gill net.  The average length was 6.8\", with 11% measuring 8\" or larger.   The 1999 and 2000 year classes represented 69% of the catch.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. </p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 21st, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 7 stations.  Nineteen species were sampled, including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter. This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net and trap net survey collected the same week to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.   <br> \n</p>",

Numbers were high at 13.0/net and average size was great at 24.9\" with 32% measuring 26 inches or larger.  Anglers are encouraged to use restraint when harvesting northern pike on Kego in order to preserve this unique opportunity.  Please release the largest fish and preferably only keep those under 22\".  The perch population more than likely helps support this healthy population of northern pike.  They are an important forage fish and were captured at 5.2/gill net.  This number has been much higher in the recent past.  Average size was small at 6.6\", suggesting the pike are keeping them cropped down.  This is a unique balance that doesn't exist in a lot of area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish looked like they could offer some fishing as well.  Black crappie were caught at the rate of 3.3/gill net, which is average for this type of lake.  Average length was 8.9\", with 90% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Similar results were found for bluegill, with a catch rate of 15.2/trap net.  Average length was 6.8\" and 64% measured 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught in high numbers for this type of lake (4.7/gill net).  Largemouth bass tend to do a good job of avoiding nets, so to find this many in our nets is encouraging to anglers looking to fish Kego for bass.  Average length was 13.0\" and fish up to 18.5\" were captured.  Electrofishing is usually a better indicator of the population, but as bass are not one of the management species for this lake, electrofishing was not completed in 2023.  <br> \n</p>",

Numbers were good (10.8/net) and average size was great at 26\" and 68% measuring 24 inches or larger.  Anglers are encouraged to use restraint when harvesting northern pike on Kego in order to preserve this unique opportunity.  Release of all northern pike over 24\" should preserve this healthy balanced fish community.  The perch population more than likely helps support this healthy population of northern pike.  They are an important forage fish and were present in healthy numbers at 21.5/net.  Average size was small at 6.4\", suggesting the pike are keeping them cropped down.  This is a unique balance that doesn't exist in a lot of area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were also quite abundant, but size was not remarkable.  Black crappie average length was 7.4\", with 31% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill were caught at a rate of 28.3/trap net, and averaged 6.1\".  Twenty-two percent measured 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWhile only five largemouth bass were caught in our survey nets, the lake is said to have a healthy bass population.  Largemouth bass tend to avoid survey nets and thus electrofishing is usually a better indicator of the population.  As bass are not one of the management species for this lake, electrofishing was not completed in 2014.  <br> \n</p>",
