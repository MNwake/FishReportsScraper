                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake (26 surface acres) is a designated trout lake located in Maplewood State Park.  It has a maximum depth of 39 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading for this survey was 14.2 feet.  A carry-in access is located on the northeast shoreline.  The lake was reclaimed with rotenone in 1987.  A special trap net assessment was conducted in 2001 to document changes in the fish populations of various species.  Bass Lake is a put and take type of trout lake.  Approximately 2,500 rainbow trout are stocked on an annual basis.     Black bullhead abundance has increased dramatically from the last survey in 1997.  Black bullhead trap net catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 122.0 fish per net.  Black bullheads were not sampled in the 1991 or 1997 surveys.  Several year classes of black bullheads appear to be present.     The presence of sunfish (bluegill and pumpkinseed) was documented in 2001.  Trap net catch rates for these two species are high.  These species were not sampled in the 1991 or 1997 lake surveys.  Age data shows that multiple year classes of both species are present.     A total of 14 rainbow trout were sampled.  The catch rate was higher than in the 1991 or 1997 lake surveys.  Rainbow trout a mean length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.43 pound.  Age data indicate that three year classes are present with 71% of the trout corresponding to the 2000 year class.  Rainbow trout attain an average length of 12.1 inches at three years of age.     Non-trout species were likely introduced by anglers, either intentionally or unintentionally.  The result is a sub-standard trout lake.  To improve the trout angling, Bass Lake will likely need to be rehabilitated with an expensive rotenone reclamation project.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Bass lake was treated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 to remove the existing fish populations.  It has been stocked with 2,500 rainbow trout each spring since 1988.  The gill net catch rate of trout was 3.0 per gill net lift and the average weight of individual trout was 1.4 pounds.  The gill net employed was a 100-foot, 2-inch mesh tullibee net.  Eighty-three percent of the sample corresponded to the 1990 stocking, while 17% corresponded to the 1989 stocking.  Trout from the 1990 stocking were between 13.0 and 16.0 inches in length.  The reclamation of bass lake appears to have been successful as no other fish species were sampled.  Minnows were observed in the shoal water areas.  The lake provides a popular fishery and ice angling reports have suggested good trout fishing during the winter of 1991-1992.</p>",

The very high numbers of green sunfish and black bullheads compete with the trout for all available food.  Stomach samples of rainbow trout were taken and indicated that their diet was exclusively small snails and organic material.  The present management plan for Bass Lake is for a reclamation in the fall 1987.  Bass Lake will be open to promiscuous fishing several months prior to reclamation to utilize the trout which are still present.  No stocking will take place until reclamation is complete (spring 1988).  Stocking of gammorus and/or hyallela in late winter or early spring (1988) might be considered as this would provide an excellent forage species for the newly stocked trout.</p>",
