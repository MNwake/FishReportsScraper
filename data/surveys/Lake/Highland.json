The access is a short carry-down trail on state land off Highland Lake Road with limited space for parking a couple vehicles.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was above the normal range compared to similar lakes. Size ranged from 10.4 to 28.9 inches and averaged 20.3 inches with 18% longer than 24 inches. Good natural reproduction was documented with seven year classes identified and growth near average for the Finland area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of Yellow Perch was well above the normal range for similar lakes. Trap nets also captured a higher than the normal number of perch. The average length of perch was 6.8 inches with only 11% longer than 9 inches, but fish up to 12 inches long were caught. Perch from six year classes were identified in the catch and growth appear to be average for the area. Perch are an important forage species in the lake, yet anglers may find a decent keeper at times.</p>",
