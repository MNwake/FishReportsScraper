Other area lakes in this classification are:  Fladmark, German and Twenty-One. <br> \n     The northern pike catch rate was 11.5 per gill net lift, which exceeds the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Mean weight of individual pike was 1.7 pounds and mean length at age-II was 17.3 inches, indicating good growth rates.  All pike sampled were greater than 15.0 inches in length with 43% of the sample greater than 20.0 inches.  Pike recruitment appears to be consistent; however, 61% of the pike sampled corresponded to the 1989 year class (age-II).   <br> \n     The bluegill catch rate of 35.5 per trap net lift is within the normal range.  Recruitment is good with seven age-classes represented in the age-class distribution.  Thirty-five percent of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length and growth rates are slow compared to statewide means.   <br> \n     The black crappie catch rate was 3.5 per trap net lift, which equals the third quartile for class 28 lakes.  All crappie in the sample were between 6.5 and 9.5 inches and mean individual weight was 0.5 pounds.  Black crappie recruitment appears to be inconsistent as all fish sampled were from the 1988 year class (age-III).  Black crappie growth rates are average when compared to statewide means. <br> \n     The yellow perch catch rate of 9.5 per gill net lift is within the normal range. <br> \n     Only two walleyes were sampled; however, the catch rate of 0.5 per gill net lift is within the normal range.  There is no indication of recent recruitment.  Spawning areas are limited and there is no record of walleye stocking. <br> \n</p>",
