This 19acre lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and is surrounded by federal land.  Access is from a walk-in trail off a USFS road and showed minimal usage. Northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, golden shiner and blacknose shiner have been found at various times since the initial investigation in 1977.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have not varied significantly over the sampling history in this lake.  The average weight of northern pike has shown an increase in each assessment since 1977 reaching 5.1 pounds in 2007.  The sample in 2007 included 5 northern pike that weighed over 8 pounds the largest 17.3 pounds; the remainder of the northern pike represented a more typical size group.  Northern pike of the quality size sampled in 2007 were not sampled in past assessments.  The average length of northern pike at age-4 was 25.3 inches.  Spawning conditions for northern pike were good.. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch has ranged widely in each assessment.  The catch in 2007 was the highest recorded with the bulk of the sample less than 8 inches in length.  Growth was average for the area.  Spawning habitat for yellow perch was good.  White sucker (average weight of 1 pound) were sampled in higher numbers in 2007 than in past assessments. <br> \n</p>",
