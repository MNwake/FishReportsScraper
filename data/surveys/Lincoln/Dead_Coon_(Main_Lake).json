                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake near the town of Arco is a 569-acre lake located in Lincoln County.  This class 43 lake has a maximum depth of 9 feet and is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch.  Dead Coon Lake has an inlet that is connected to Lake Benton via Coon Creek and is connected to the Redwood River via Coon Creek at the outlet.  The current management plan calls for stocking walleye fry two out of three years.  Dead Coon Lake has had partial winterkills nine times over a period of 44 years which is considered infrequent for the Windom Area.  Dead Coon Lake has had very little shoreline development over the years.  Much of the surrounding landscape within the watershed is dominated by agricultural row cropping.  Spawning habitat is considered good for yellow perch and fair for walleye and northern pike.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of September 4, 2001 utilized 3 gillnets, 9 trapnets, and 4 seine standard seine hauls.The walleye catch rate in gillnets was 21.00/set which was higher than normal.  Total lengths of walleye captured in gillnets averaged 14.96 inches.  This healthy walleye population could provide some excellent fishing for those anglers that get to know the lake.  Additionally, the catch rate of walleyes in trapnets was 3.22/set which was also higher than expected.   This system has the capability of being self-sustaining because of the documented natural reproduction.  Forty-four and four Age 0 walleye were captured with a standard bag seine in 1992 and 2001, respectively.  However, fall electrofishing in 1998 failed to document any natural reproduction.  Five different year classes of walleye were captured, based on aging, which indicated a fairly stable population of walleyes.  Good numbers of respectable sized walleyes are available to anglers.The yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 22.33/set which was at the expected catch rate for this lake class.  Total lengths of yellow perch captured averaged 9.06 inches.  Four standard seine hauls conducted on September 4 of 2001 failed to capture any Age 0 yellow perch.  Based on aging information, five different year classes of yellow perch were captured with the 1999 year class dominating.  The yellow perch population was very respectable from an anglers point of view.  Many anglers would love to catch a mess of 9 inch perch for table fare.The northern pike catch rate in gill nets was 1.67/set which was within the expected range for this lake class.  Total lengths of northern pike captured in gill nets averaged 23.24 inches.  All of the northern pike captured were aged to the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  Excluding the 1983 survey, it appears that historically northern pike numbers have been low.  While fishing for walleye or yellow perch, don't be caught off guard by an occasional \"toothy\" tugging on your line.The black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 8.67/set which was below what we expect.  The last three surveys conducted on Dead Coon has documented catch rates lower than expected.  Don't be alarmed as there are numerous lakes in the Windom area that have good numbers of black bullhead.  Lake Shoakotan, approximately 13 miles away,  would be a good alternative lake for the angler targeting bullheads.  The last three surveys conducted on Dead Coon has documented either lower or expected catch rates of common carp compared to other Windom Area lakes.  Additionally, the catch rate of white sucker was the lowest (2.67/set) ever recorded compared to historical surveys.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Dead Coon Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Other species captured in the survey were black crappie and fathead minnows.Prepared by : Ryan Doorenbos      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota DNR Fisheries classifies lakes with similar characteristics, such as size, depth, water chemistry and other metrics on a statewide basis for comparison of fish communities.  Dead Coon Lake is located southeast of Arco in Lincoln County, has a surface area of 547 acres, a maximum depth of 8 feet, and is in DNR lake class 43.  It is managed primarily for walleye, and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike.  The lake is part of a large watershed and is connected to Lake Benton upstream and the Redwood River downstream via Coon Creek.  This connection allows for fish passage in either direction, at times, especially during periods of high flow.  The lake does have an aeration system, but with Coon Creek flowing through it, most years it has not been necessary to operate.  A DNR owned access with dock and concrete ramp is located on the southwest corner of the lake.  Additional winter access is available from the township road on the north end of the lake.  To assess fish populations and evaluate the lake management plan, test netting was conducted by Windom area fisheries personnel during the week of June 17, 2013 with the following results. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in gill nets at 2.7 fish per net is a historical low for this lake since gill net surveys began in 1983.  The long term average number of walleye for seven prior surveys from 1983-2009 was just over 21.0 fish per net.  Water transparency of 4 feet during this survey was the highest ever recorded for Dead Coon so it is possible some net avoidance by fish did occur.  Trap net catch rates for walleye were also very near an all time low at less than 1.0 fish per net.  Lengths of walleye from both gears ranged from 6.7 to 23 inches, with a mean length of 16.5 inches, and a mean weight of 1.9 pounds.  Growth rates for walleye were about average compared to other area lakes.   Walleye captured in gill nets were aged by counting growth rings on an internal bony structure called otoliths (\"ear stones\"). Although only eight walleye were aged during the netting, seven of them correspond to fry stockings in 2008 and 2009.  The one three year old fish from 2010 may have come from natural reproduction or moved downstream from Lake Benton.  The majority of the walleye sampled during this survey were longer than 14 inches, so even with a lower than average population, currently some \"keepers\" are available to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for yellow perch were also the second lowest level on record at 4.3 fish per net.  The majority of the perch captured ranged from 7 to 10 inches with one 13 incher present.  The average weight of these fish was nearly half a pound, and growth appears to be above average.  Although numbers are currently low, size structure of perch is good, and they should provide an angling opportunity for a couple of years. <br> \n <br> \nWith a gill net catch rate of 2.0 per net northern pike were approaching the long term average of about 3 per gill net.  Lengths of all pike caught in both gill and trap nets ranged from near 21 to 27 inches with an average length of about 24 inches.  The average weight of these fish was just over two and a half pounds, but growth rates were relatively slow considering the presence of a large white sucker population.  The pike numbers have increased since the last survey in 2009, which is probably due to the stocking of fingerlings in 2011.  The lake is scheduled to receive another fingerling stocking in 2014 which should help sustain a harvestable level of pike.  Improved water clarity may also be helping the northern pike be more efficient at finding food since they are considered to be \"sight\" feeders. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not often targeted by anglers the white suckers are doing very well with a catch rate of 18 per  gill net which is slightly above the long term average for this lake.  Sizes ranged from 13 to 21 inches which should provide excellent northern pike forage. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads dropped to very low levels following the 1988 survey, and have remained low since then at only 1.0 per gill net and 3.0 per trap net during this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low densities included black crappies, common carp, painted turtles, and one snapping turtle.  Game fish numbers are currently low according to this survey, but anglers should note that fish populations tend to rebound rapidly in fertile Southwest Minnesota prairie lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon is a 555 acre lake with a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and is located near the town of Arco in Lincoln County.  Dead Coon has similar water chemistry and other biological characteristics to other nearby lakes like East Goose and East Stay.  The lake is presently managed for walleye primarily while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  The lake is presently stocked with walleye fry two of every three years at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre and is due to be stocked again in 2006.  Littoral acreage is determined by how many acres are 15 feet deep or less.Dead Coon has an excellent walleye fishery.  The gill net catch rate was 37.0 fish per net.  We would expect to catch from 2.3 to 18.1 fish per net in lakes like Dead Coon.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 6.3 to 22.7 inches and averaged 12.9 inches.  The smaller average length is due to a high number of walleye fingerlings caught which were more than likely the result of the fry stocking in 2005.  Six different ages of walleye were caught during the assessment and all but the 1998 fish were more than likely from fry stocking.The yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like Dead Coon.  It may be possible that when walleye numbers are above 30.0 fish per net that yellow perch numbers are lower.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in our gill nets ranged from 4.3 to 12.8 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  Five different ages were observed during the assessment which indicates good yellow perch natural reproduction.Presently northern pike are not managed for in Dead Coon but it still has a good northern pike fishery, probably because of good spawning habitat which allows for natural reproduction.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill net ranged from 13.1 to 31.1 inches and averaged 22.4 inches.The black bullhead population is low when compared to lakes similar to Dead Coon.  The catch rate was only 4.4 fish per trap net.  We would expect catch rates anywhere from 11.5 to 132.6 in lakes like Dead Coon.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in trap nets ranged from 5.6 to 13.2 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.Other fish species caught in our nets in 2005 included carp and white suckers.Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Dead Coon Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

FOUR OF THE SIX YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR WAE FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  A 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT REPORTED THAT 54.1% OF THE STOCK WAS FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION (AGE 1 AND AGE 2 WAE).  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR YEP WERE IN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  THE YEP POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY AGE 2 AND AGE 3 FISH (87% OF THE STOCK).  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB DECREASED FROM 112.3 FISH PER NET IN 1988 TO 2.1 FISH PER NET IN 1992.  THE TRAPNET INDICES ARE BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE INDICATING A LOW POPULATION FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP DECREASED FROM 52.0 IN 1988 TO 10.6 FISH PER NET IN 1992.  THE TRAPNET INDICES ARE ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE THIRD QUARTILE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP DECREASED FROM 14.2 FISH PER NET IN 1988 TO 10.6 FISH PER NET IN 1992 WHICH IS ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE THIRD QUARTILE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION FOR THIS LAKE CLASS. BLC WERE NOT OBSERVED DURING THE SURVEY.  DEAD COON WAS STOCKED WITH YEARLING BLC IN 1989 AND ADULTS IN 1984.  IT APPEARS THERE IS POOR RECRUITMENT TO THE ADULT POPULATION.  BASED ON THIS, MANAGEMENT FOR BLC AS A SECONDARY SPECIES SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED.  ACCORDING TO SHORELINE SEINING RESULTS, WAE, YEP AND CARP SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN DEAD COON LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake covers 569 acres and has a maximum depth of 9 feet.  The east and west shores are bordered by undeveloped woodland areas, whereas the north and south shores are nearly void of trees.  The majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  Shoalwater substrates are dominated by sand.  Although numerous types of aquatic vegetation are located near the inlet (1992 survey), aquatic vegetation is considered sparse in the remaining portion of the lake.  The Lake is primarily managed for walleye while providing a secondary population of yellow perch.Walleye numbers have increased since our 1992 survey and are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 8 ? to 23 ? inches with an average length of approximately 15 inches.  A fair number of walleye are in the 15-16 inch range and the 18-19 inch range.  Walleye are supported in Dead Coon Lake through a combination of natural reproduction, immigration, and stocking.  Walleye fry were last stocked in 1994.Yellow perch numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 5 ? to almost 11 inches with an average length of 7 ? inches.  The perch population appears healthy and self-supporting.Historically, black crappie do not seem to flourish in Dead Coon Lake.  Black crappie were stocked in the past with limited success in establishing a quality black crappie fishery.  Currently, black crappie numbers are considered low to normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from around 3 to almost 10 inches with an average length of 5 ? inches.  Black bullhead numbers are comparably low compared to past surveys.  Bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 5 ? to almost 11 ? inches with an average length of 8 inches.Dead Coon Lake also supports high numbers of large carp.  Carp sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 13 ? inches to almost 30 inches with an average length of approximately 23 ? inches.  The population is comprised mainly of large fish with a fair number reaching memorable lengths (greater than 26 inches).Other species observed during the 1996 survey include largemouth bass, bluegill, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, brook stickleback, and fathead minnow.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Dead Coon Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

AGE 3, 5, AND 8+ WALLEYE ARE ALSO WELL REPRESENTED. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX FOR WALLEYE WAS 3.6 TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN BUT ONLY 59.5% OF THAT FOUND IN THE 1983 SURVEY. THE PSD FOR WALLEYE GREATER THAN 20 INCHES WAS 2 IN 1983 AND 20 IN 1988. GROWTH RATES FOR FISH CAP- TURED IN 1988 WERE FAST FOR WALLEYE LESS THAN ABOUT 11 INCHES, BUT THEN DROPPED TO ABOUT STATE AVERAGE THEREAFTER. THE NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS TWO TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN BUT ONLY 20% OF THAT FOUND IN 1983. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT IN 1983 WAS 1.33 LBS. AND IN 1988, 2.92 LBS. GROWTH RATES FOR NORTHERN PIKE WERE ALSO FAST UP TO 11 INCHES, BUT THEN SLOWED TO ABOUT STATE AVERAGE THEREAFTER. ASSUMING AN ISOLATED STOCK, NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN 1984, 1985, 1986. SPAWNING MAY BE LIMITED TO DURING WHICH NORTHERN PIKE HAVE ACCESS TO SUITABLE SPAWNING HABITAT. THE DEAD COON YELLOW PERCH STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE 1 FISH. AGE 2 AND 3 FISH ARE ALSO PRESENT, BUT NO OTHER AGES WERE FOUND. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS 25.7% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND ONLY 16% OF THE CPUE FOR YELLOW PERCH FOUND IN 1983. YELLOW PERCH WERE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT IN THE 1983, 1985 AND 1988 NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS HOWEVER, BASED ON THE LOW ABUNDANCE FOUND IN THE SURVEY, IT APPEARS THAT ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE YOY PERCH ARE RECRUITING TO THE ADULT POPULATION. BLACK CRPAPIE WERE ALSO FOUND IN THE 1983, 1985, AND 1986 NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS, BUT ONLY ONE ADULT WAS FOUND DURING THIS SURVEY. NO BLUEGILL NATURAL REPRODUCTION  WAS FOUND IN ANY OF THE REPRODUCTION CHECKS AND NO ADULTS WERE FOUND DURING THIS SURVEY. THE BLACK BULLHEAD TRAPNET INDEX WAS 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND ABOUT EQUAL TO 1983 LEVELS. THE CARP TRAPNET INDEX WAS 5.9 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 8.4 TIMES THE LEVELS. THE WHITE SUCKER GILLNET INDEX WAS 2.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN BUT ONLY 32.5% OF THE LEVEL FOUND IN 1983.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon is a 555-acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet and is located near the town of Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake is a class 43 lake and is managed for walleye primarily while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  As part of the Lake Survey on Dead Coon, vegetation transects were conducted to determine the presence or absence of aquatic emergent and submergent vegetation.  The only vegetation found during the survey was hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) and that was only on 3% of the 29 transects. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is doing very well in Dead Coon when compared to other lakes with similar morphology and water quality characteristics.  The gill net catch rate of 16.7 walleye/net was above our long range goal of 15.0 fish/net.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 11.1 to 26.9 inches with an average length of 15.2 inches.  Almost 50% of the walleye aged were from a 2007 year class when the lake wasn't stocked.  This could indicate excellent natural reproduction but it could also be the result of fry drift from Benton where 2.8 million fry were stocked in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are what we would expect for lakes similar to Dead Coon.  There were some very nice yellow perch caught in our nets during the 2009 survey.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 9.0 to 12.1 inches and had an average length of 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population appears to be increasing according to data collected during the 2009 survey.  The northern pike trap net catch rate increased from 0.1 fish/net in 2005 to 0.8 fish/net in 2009.  Lengths of northern caught in our trap nets ranged from 14.1 to 24.9 inches with an average length of 20.1 inches.  Only one northern pike was sampled in gill nets; however, it had a total length of 40.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were quite low during the survey in 2009.  High walleye numbers in Dead Coon throughout the last 15 years may have suppressed the black bullhead population and is keeping black bullhead numbers in check.  Black bullhead sampled in trap and gill nets in 2009 were large.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 12.5 to 13.4 inches and had an average length of just under 13 inches.  The only black bullhead caught in gill nets was 13.1 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2009 lake survey included orange spotted sunfish, carp, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Dead Coon Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake is a 547-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is located southeast of Arco, in Lincoln County.  The surrounding watershed is large and is mostly agricultural, which has resulted in siltation and high nutrient levels, accounting for poor water quality much of the year.  Dead Coon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of July 17, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates at Dead Coon Lake have historically been high with a long term average of 21.7 per gill net since 1983.  The 2017 catch rate was 23.0 per gill net, slightly higher than the long term average and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled, with age-2 Walleye accounting for 64 percent of the fish.  Dead Coon Lake has historically had evidence of natural reproduction, and that was evident in the 2017 sample.  The 2013 and 2016 year classes were present, but do not correspond with stocking events, indicating that natural reproduction occurred or Walleye moved downstream from Lake Benton fry stockings that occurred in those years.  Fall electrofishing in 2017 captured young-of-the-year Walleye at a rate of 75.9 per hour, with the majority of the year class being naturally reproduced.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9.5 to 27.0 inches and averaged 14.0 inches.  Growth of Walleye was normal, as age-1, age-2, and age-3 walleyes averaged 10.0, 13.3, and 16.0 inches, respectively. Given the high abundance and decent size structure, Dead Coon should continue to be a good Walleye angling destination.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2017 was 23.0 per gill net, which is greater than the long term average of 13.1 per gill net, and is within expected catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.8 to 12.7 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  Adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2016, and appear to have restored the population.  Yellow Perch are not highly abundant but good numbers of fish over 10 inches are available.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net and 2.2 per trap net, suggesting there are a fair number of Northern Pike in this lake.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 14.5 to 34.7 inches, with the majority being between 14.0 and 19.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Common Carp catch rate increased from 1.4 per trap net in 2013 to 4.6 per trap net in 2017, but was below the long term average of 6.6 per trap net since 1983.  Black Bullhead abundance was very low at 1.7 per gill net and 1.4 per trap net. Other species sampled included White Sucker.  Species diversity is low and this system tends to be very simplistic in nature but a successful fishery.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake is a 547-acre lake that is located southeast of the Town of Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 ft. and is situated in highly agricultural watershed, resulting in excess siltation and high nutrient levels.  This has resulted in Dead Coon Lake having poor water quality for much of the year.  Dead Coon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 12, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates at Dead Coon Lake have varied from 2.7 per gill net in 2013 to 37.0 per gill net in 2005 and have averaged 21.3 per gill net since 1983.  In 2021, the Walleye catch rate was 17.7 per gill net, which is near the upper end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (18.1 per gill net).  Six year-classes of Walleye were sampled including age-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.  The 2013 (age-8) and 2016 (age-5) year-classes do not correspond to stocking events in Dead Coon Lake; however, they do correspond to stocking events in Lake Benton, which is upstream of Dead Coon Lake. The 2013 and 2016 year-classes could be the result of natural reproduction or downstream drift from Lake Benton.  The 2019 year-class is the result of natural reproduction because neither lake was stocked in 2019.  Growth of Walleye was normal in Dead Coon Lake when compared to other populations, as mean length at age-3 was 16.2 inches. Walleye lengths ranged from 10.6 to 29.0 inches and averaged 17.5 inches.  Eighty-eight percent of gill netted Walleye were 15.0 inches or longer, which should provide a good opportunity to harvest some Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Yellow Perch have varied from 3.0 per gill net in 2005 to 33.0 per gill net in 1983 and have averaged 12.6 per gill net since 1983.  In 2021, the catch rate of Yellow Perch was 7.7 per gill net, a decrease from 23.0 per gill net in 2017, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.5 to 11.5 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2021 was 3.2 per trap net, which is the highest recorded catch rate at Dead Coon Lake.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 8.1 to 11.9 inches and averaged 10.1 inches.  Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net and 1.6 per trap net.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 18.3 to 35.8 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  Other species sampled included Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake is a 547-acre, class 43 lake that is located southeast of the Town of Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 ft. and is situated in highly agricultural watershed, resulting in excess siltation and high nutrient levels.  Additionally, Dead Coon Lake is positioned towards the bottom of the watershed of Lake Benton and has a watershed to lake ratio of at least 30:1.  This has resulted in Dead Coon Lake having poor water quality for much of the year.  Dead Coon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  A daytime electrofishing event was conducted on October 9th, 2023 to collect fin clips from 50 age-0 Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nThree minutes of electrofishing during the middle of the day was utilized to collect 53 age-0 Walleye. Fin clips from the caudal fin were collected from all Age-0 Walleye and retained in a common jar of 95% ethanol for genetic analysis. Genetic analysis revealed that the fish were a mixture of Lower Mississippi Strain and Spicer Strain Walleye, matching what is found in Lake Benton and indicating a potential common population. Additionally, this naturally produced (non-stocked) year class was very abundant. If the catch rate of 53 fish in 3 minutes was extrapolated to 1 hour, then over 1,000 fish would have been sampled. The fish appeared healthy and ranged in length from 5.9 to 7.0 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches. A standard lake survey in 2025 will help to quantify the true strength of the year class, whether they contribute to the fishery as harvestable size (over 13 inches) adults in the gill net sample.   <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured eight species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=270), Black Bullhead (N=3), Black Crappie (N=1), Common Carp (N=2), Fathead Minnow (N=215), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=1), Walleye (N=6), and Yellow Perch (N=43).  Electrofishing captured four species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=30), Fathead Minnow (N=224), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=13), and Black Bullhead (N=2).  Reproduction exists for some of the species in Dead Coon Lake as, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, and Walleye were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Dead Coon Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of lakeshore habitat on Dead Coon Lake was conducted on 8/10/2017.  The assessment consisted of 34 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. The average lake wide habitat score was 69.2(+/- 2.6), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 64 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 60.7(+/- 2.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 84.7(+/- 2.5).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Dead Coon Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Coon Lake is a 547-acre, class 43 lake that has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is located southeast of Arco, in Lincoln County.  The surrounding watershed is large and is mostly agricultural, which has resulted in siltation and high nutrient levels, accounting for poor water quality much of the year.  Dead Coon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Dead Coon Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 75.9 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that a year class was produced.  Dead Coon Lake has historically had evidence of natural reproduction, so genetic analysis of the fingerlings was done to determine their origin.  The analysis indicated that 86 percent of the year class was naturally produced.  This indicates that the fry stocking in 2017 likely did not account for much of the year class that was produced (only 14%).  Lengths of Walleye fingerlings ranged from 4.8 to 8.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a strong year class in the Dead Coon Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",
