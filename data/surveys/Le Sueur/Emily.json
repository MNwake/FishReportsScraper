THESE RESULTS AND THOSE OF THE 1990 LAKE SURVEY WILL BE VALUABLE PRE-STOCKING REPORTS OR PANFISH GROWTH AND SIZE STRUCTURE.  BLC NUMBERS REMAIN CONSTANT AT 138.25/ TRAP NET, COMPARED TO 148.50/TRAP NET IN 1990. CRAPPIES AGED 3-5 WERE SAMPLED, AND THE 1986 AND 1987 YEAR CLASSES CONTINUED TO DOMINATE, AS THEY HAD IN 1990.  CRAPPIE LENGTH AT AGE (4.8 INCHES) IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 1990 (6.9 INCHES) AND 1988 (6.2 INCHES) SURVEYS, AND LOWER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE OF 8.3 INCHES.  THOUGH THE BLG CATCH INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 9.25 IN 1990 TO 145.50/TRAP NET, THE SAME YEAR CLASSES (1984-1986) THAT HAVE DOMINATED THE CATCH SINCE 1988, CONTINUE TO DOMINATE.  THE 1988 NET CATCH WAS 46.50/TRAP NET, AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE 1990 CATCH WAS SO LOW AND THE 1991 CATCH SO HIGH.  AGE 5 AND 6 BLG EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH, AT 6.4 AND 6.7 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY.  STATE AVERAGE IS 7.1 INCHES AT AGE 5 AND 7.8 INCHES AT AGE 6.  YEP NUMBERS INCREASED FROM 11.50/GILL NET IN 1990 TO 21.00/GILL NET. PERCH WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 3-6, WHICH EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH AFTER AGE 3.  NOP NUMBERS REMAIN LOW AND UNCHANGED, WITH ONLY ONE FISH SAMPLED IN 1988, 1990, AND 1991.  THE WAE CATCH DECLINED, WITH ONE FISH SAMPLED IN GILL NETS COMPARED TO 4 FISH SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS IN 1990.  ONLY ONE FCF WAS SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS.  CARP INCREASED FROM 0.75/ TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 8.75/TRAP NET.  BLB WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS, AVERAGING 3.25/TRAP NET.</p>",

A fishery survey was conducted on Lake Emily in early July 2002 to assess the fish community and lake characteristics.  Lake Emily has a central main basin and three bays.  The water clarity tends to be low and aquatic plants are generally rare.  Northern pike catch per gill net (4.8) was at its highest level since the 1981 survey.  Over the nine assessments from 1988 to 1999 northern pike catch per gill net was always < 1.  Northern pike ranged from 13.8 to 31.4 inches.  Both bluegill and black crappie were abundant in the 2002 survey.  Most bluegill were around 5 inches long, although there were fish up to 8.2 inches.  Black crappies were up to 11.5 inches, but 6 to 9 inch fish were the most abundant.  Largemouth bass are also present and provide some angling opportunity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lake Emily was conducted on 20 July 2023 by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 8 sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 9 stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including 1 species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and 3 that are tolerant of disturbance (Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Bigmouth Buffalo).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Minnesota River - Mankato Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Emily is a 235-acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the town of St Peter. It has a maximum depth of 37 feet with approximately 70% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Lake Emily is located near the top of the watershed and has a moderately developed shoreline that includes a golf course adjacent to the northeast basin. Much of the shoreline, including the island, remains as natural riparian cover and woody habitat is abundant. The local lake association remains committed to improving lake water quality and fishing and has been involved in shoreland restoration, invasive species management, and Northern Pike rearing. A DNR owned ramp is located on the south side of the lake off of Lake Emily Road. The sport fish community consists mainly of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. A small self-sustaining Channel Catfish population also persists in the lake. Northern Pike fry have been stocked 3 out of 4 years into a small wetland connected on the west side of the lake since 2008. Most recently, Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Northern Pike were scheduled to be stocked in 2020 as well, but during the COVID19 pandemic no stocking took place. Other sport fish maintain their populations through natural reproduction. At times, Waterville Fisheries has used the abundant Black Crappie and Bluegill populations as a source for stocking needs throughout the area. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of 26 June 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was completed to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 60 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies numbers declined in Lake Emily with a total of 134 sampled in trap nets for a catch rate 14.9/net, down from the 2017 rate of 60.3/net. Catch rates have varied from 14.9/net in 2023 to 129.4/net in 2012 with an average of 57.2/net since 1993. Size structure was poor in 2023, with lengths ranging from 3.2 to 7.8 inches and an average of just 5.0 inches. Black Crappie ranging from 4.1 to 7.6 inches were also the most sampled fish in gill nets with a catch rate of 20.7/net. Fish from both gears were aged using otoliths and scales. Fish were young ranging from age-1 to age-5 with age-2 fish accounted for 56% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in trap nets during the 2023 survey, with a total of 296 sampled for a catch rate of 32.9/net. This represents a significant decline since the 2012 survey which sampled an all-time high of 154.0/net. Catch rates have typically been high with an average of 50.7/net since 1993. Bluegill size structure was poor in 2023, with lengths ranging from 3.0 to 8.8 inches and an average of just 4.6 inches. Fish were aged using otoliths and scales. Bluegills ranged from age-2 to age-10 with age-2 and age-3 fish accounting for approximately 50% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 11 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 11.0/hour which was a decrease from the 2017 sample of 81.0/hour. Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 17.3 inches with an average of 13.4 inches. This represented good size structure for anglers targeting Largemouth Bass. <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 9 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.5/net which was below the long-term average for Lake Emily (3.1/ net). The Northern Pike fry stocking location was changed from in-lake to a connected wetland on the southwest side of the lake in 2008. Before that change, Northern Pike catch rates ranged from 0.0/net to 4.8/net with an average of just 0.9/net. Lengths in 2023 ranged from 21.3 to 33.0 inches with an average of 27.7 inches. Nearly 80% of Northern Pike sampled were longer than the 24-inch minimum size limit. Although the population of Northern Pike is low in Lake Emily there is opportunity at some nice sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were well represented in the gill nets in 2017. However, 0 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets or trap nets in the 2023 survey. Catch rates have been variable ranging from 1.1/net in 1994 to 45.8/net in 2012 with an average of 16.9/net since 1993. Fish were mostly small with the majority ranging from 6 to 7 inches. It is unknown why the Yellow Perch population has crashed in Lake Emily. <br> \n <br> \nJust 5 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net. Catch rates have been consistently low for the past 15 years with an average catch rate of 1.6/net. Catch rates regularly exceeded the lake class third quartile and averaged 4.2/net prior to 2007. An additional 2 fish were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 15.2 to 17.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the Common Carp numbers have dropped in recent years, it appears that Bigmouth Buffalo numbers have skyrocketed in recent years. Bigmouth Buffalo were sampled at a rate of 16.2 per gill net in 2023 the same as in 2017. Bigmouth Buffalo were sampled at an average rate of less than 0.1/gill net prior to 2017. Bigmouth Buffalo ranged in size from 10.4 inches to 17.4 inches and averaged 14.5 inches in length. The lake association has been in cooperation with commercial fishermen to try and reduce the numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo in Lake Emily. Unfortunately, the small size of these fish are not easily marketed, therefore commercial fishermen are not as willing to continue harvesting from Lake Emily. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye are not a managed species in Lake Emily, there were 3 individuals sampled using both gill nets and trap nets. These fish were between 20.7 and 21.7 inches in length. Walleyes have historically been sampled in low numbers averaging 0.3/gill net since 1993. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, absolute secchi depth was 2.0 feet, indicating moderate water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 74.8 degrees Fahrenheit and 5.5 ppm at the surface to 70.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.2 ppm at 15 feet. A thermocline was detected between 14 and 17 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 13 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Black crappies and bluegills were both very abundant in the survey nets.  All of the bluegills and 95% of the black crappies observed were less than 8 inches long.  A few walleyes and northern pike were also observed.  The walleyes were 17 to 26 inches in length; pike lengths ranged from 24 to 29 inches. </p>",

BLUEGILLS HAVE DECLINED FROM 108.50 TRAPNET IN '81 TO 31.50/TRAPNET IN '85.

BLUEGILLS ARE REPRESE- NETED BY II- V AGE CLASSES WITH THE III AGE CLASS DOMINATING. BLACK CRAPPIES AVG 5.00/TRAPNET COM- PARED TO 15.00/TRAPNET IN '81. BLACK CRAPPIE WERE BETTER REPRESENTED IN GILLNETS AVGING 44.00/GILL NET COMPARED TO 12.50/GILLNET IN '81. CRAPPIES ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SLOW GROWTH IN III, IV AND V AGE CLASSES. I-V AGE CLASS FISH WERE CAPTURED WITH THE III AGE CLASS DOMINATING. CRAPPIES IN THE '81 NETTING DID NOT EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH, BUT NO FISH WERE CAPTURED GREATER THAN III YEARS OLD. PUMPKIN- SEED WERE ONLY SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING. PUMPKINSEED HAVE SHOWN NOTABLE DECLINE FROM 9.50/ TRAPNET IN '81 TO NONE PRESENT IN NETS IN '85. A SMALL REMNANT POPULATION OF LARGE WALLEYES WERE SAMPLED; WALLEYE STOCKING WAS DISCONTINUED IN 1980 PERCH HAVE DECLINED FROM 41.50/GILLNET IN '81 TO 3.17/GILLNET IN '85. PERCH ARE DOMINATED BY II AGE CLASS FISH. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE ONLY SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING, AND ANGLING REPORTS INDICATE THAT A GOOD POPULATION IS PRESENT.

                "narrative": "<p>Emily Lake is a 235 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the town of St Peter. It has a maximum depth of 37 feet with approximately 70% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Located near the top of the watershed, the lake is impacted by a moderately developed shoreline that includes a golf course adjacent to the northeast basin. Much of the shoreline, including the island, remains as natural cover and woody habitat is abundant. The local lake association remains committed to improving lake water quality and fishing and has been involved in shoreland restoration, invasive species management, and Northern Pike rearing. A DNR owned ramp is located on the south side of the lake off of Lake Emily Road. The sport fish community consists mainly of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. A small self-sustaining Channel Catfish population also persists in the lake. Northern Pike fry have been stocked 3 out of 4 years into a small wetland connected on the west side of the lake since 2008. Most recently, Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017. At times, Waterville Fisheries has used the abundant Black Crappie and Bluegill populations as a source for stocking needs throughout the area.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).This survey was completed to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 80 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies remain abundant in Emily Lake with a total of 543 sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 60.3/net, which indicated high numbers were present. Since 1993, catch rates have varied from 25.7.net in 1994 to 129.4/net in 2012 with an average of 61.9/net. Size structure was poor in 2017, with lengths ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 inches and an average of just 6.7 inches. Black Crappie ranging from 3.9 to 7.8 inches were also the most commonly sampled fish in the gill nets with a catch rate of 25.8/net. Fish were young ranging from 1 to 4 years old with 2 and 3 year old fish accounting for 98% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the second most abundant fish sampled in the 2017 survey, with a total of 418 sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 46.4/net, which indicated high numbers were present. This represents a significant decline since the last survey which sampled an all-time high of 154.0/net. Since 1993, catch rates have typically been high with an average of 52.6/net. Lengths ranged from 2.6 to 9.4 inches with an average of just 5.7 inches. Only 1% of the population exceeded 8 inches in length. Fish were mostly young, ranging from 2 to 5 years old. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 108 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 81.0/hour which was a slight increase from the 2012 sample of 74.0/hour. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 21.1 inches with an average of 10.7 inches. Approximately 21% of the population exceeded 15 inches in length. This represented good size structure for anglers targeting Largemouth Bass. In 2017, the population appeared healthy and represented a quality option for bass angling in the Waterville Area. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 36 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. This was the second highest catch rate on record behind the 2012 catch rate of 17.8/net. In 2008, the Northern Pike fry stocking location was relocated to a connected wetland on the southwest side of the lake. Before that change, Northern Pike catch rates ranged from 0/net to 4.8/net with an average of just 0.9/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 21.9 to 36.4 inches with an average of 28.2 inches. Approximately 53% of the population exceeded 28 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were well represented in the gill nets with a total of 102 fish sampled for a catch rate of 17.0/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1993, catch rates have been variable ranging from 1.1/net in 1994 to 45.8/net in 2012 with an average of 16.9/net. Fish were mostly small with the majority ranging from 6 to 7 inches. Only 1 fish exceeded 8 inches. In 2017, Yellow Perch remained an important member of the game fish community, providing food for healthy Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass populations. <br> \n <br> \nJust 13 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. During the past ten years, catch rates have been consistently low with a mean catch rate of 1.9/net. Before that time, catch rates regularly exceeded the 3.0/net and averaged 4.2/net. An additional 17 fish were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 8.4 to 23.9 inches and appear to represent several year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nA single Yellow Bullhead was sampled with trap nets in 2017. Since 1993, bullhead species have been extremely rare in surveys with a total of just 4 fish sampled with gill nets during that time. Black Bullheads have not been sampled in over 20 years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, White Crappie, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, absolute secchi depth was 3.0 feet, indicating moderate water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 73.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 6.8 ppm at the surface to 50.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 35 feet. A thermocline was detected between 14 and 17 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 13 feet. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Emily Lake (class 34) is a 273.0 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the Town of St. Peter. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Emily Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Some natural shoreline does exist, primarily on the east side of the lake. A DNR owned boat ramp is located on the south shore of the lake. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike. The northern pike population is maintained through stocking. Northern pike fry have been stocked 3 out of 4 years at a rate of 30,000/year since 2004. A population assessment was conducted on 7-2-2012 to monitor the sport fish populations in Emily Lake using 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Largemouth bass were electrofished on 5-14-2012 because other standard gears do not effectively sample them.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were collected on 7-2-2012. Emily Lake was experiencing an algae bloom as the water appeared green and had a secchi depth of 3.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 10.9 ppm at the surface to 0.1 ppm at 23.0 feet. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 12.0 and 14.0 feet of depth as evidenced by a drop in water temperature. <br> \n <br> \nPrimary management species include bluegill and black crappie. Bluegill have historically been abundant in Emily Lake as catch rates have varied from 9.3/trap net in 1990 to 154.0/trap net in 2012. The 2012 catch rate of 154.0/trap net is very high when compared to similar lakes, and was the highest bluegill catch rate observed on Emily Lake. Six year classes of bluegill were sampled including age-1 (2011) to age-6 (2006) bluegill. Age-3 bluegills were the most abundant, accounting for 35% of bluegills sampled.  Size structure of bluegill was small, with bluegills ranging in length from 2.8 to 8.2 inches and averaging 5.6 inches, and was similar to size structure of bluegills in 2007. Displaying average growth, bluegill averaged 3.3 inches at age-1, 4.6 inches at age-2, 5.6 inches at age-3, 6.5 inches at age-4, 7.4 inches at age-5, and 7.6 inches at age-6.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 black crappie catch rate (129.4/trap net) nearly doubled from the 2007 catch rate (70.3/trap net), and was consistent with historical catch rates. The catch rate of 129.4/trap net is high when compared to similar lakes. Five year classes (2007-2011) of black crappie were sampled, with age-1 and age-3 crappies representing 32% and 36% of the sample. Black crappie ranged in length from 3.5 to 10.5 inches and averaged 6.9 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure and was similar to size structure in 2007. Black crappie growth was slow in Emily Lake.  Black crappie lengths averaged 3.3 inches at age-1, 4.6 inches at age-2, 5.6 inches at age-3, 6.4 inches at age-4, 7.4 inches at age-5, and 7.6 inches at age-6.   <br> \n <br> \nArea anglers should be satisfied with the current status of Emily Lake's largemouth bass and northern pike populations. Largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 74.0/hour, which exceeds the management goal of 30.0/hour. Largemouth bass caught electrofishing ranged in length from 2.8 to 20.8 inches and averaged 12.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPast northern pike catch rates have varied from 0.1/gill net in 1994 to 17.8/gill net in 2012. The 2012 catch rate of 17.8/gill net was the highest northern pike catch rate observed in Emily Lake, and is high when compared to similar lakes. Four year classes of northern pike were sampled (2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010), with age-2 and age-3 fish representing over 90% of the sample. All four of the year classes sampled corresponded to stocking events. Northern pike lengths ranged from 17.0 to 33.9 inches and averaged 25.0 inches. Northern pike growth was fast, as age-2 and age-3 northern pike averaged 21.7 inches and 27.3 inches, respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance increased from 12.0/gill net in 2007 to 45.8/gill net in 2012, which is the highest observed catch rate of yellow perch in Emily Lake. Although abundant, yellow perch were small, not exceeding 7.3 inches in length. Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.5 to 7.3 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. Age-3 yellow perch accounted for 82% of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nOne age-8 walleye was captured in the survey, measuring 27.9 inches. Bigmouth buffalo, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed were also present, but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN RECENT YEARS THE QUALITY OF FISHING ON EMILY L. HAS DECLINED. HOW THE FISHERY HAS CHANGED DEPENDS ON THE SPECIES OF CONCERN. NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE HAS DECLINED FROM 6.9/FISH GILL NET TO 2.7/GILL NET IN 1985 AND FINALLY THIS SURVEY MEASURED 0.2/GILL NET. THE RECORD HIGH WATER YEAR OF 1986 DID NOT PRODUCE A STRONG YEAR- CLASS OF FISH IN EMILY LAKE AS IT DID IN MOST OTHER LAKES IN THE WATERVILLE AREA. THEREFORE, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SPAWNING HABITAT IS LIMITED ALTHOUGH IN-LAKE HABITAT FOR JUVENLES AND ADULTS IS QUITE GOOD. TWO BASIC APPROACHES ARE AVAILABLE TO IMPROVE NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE. EITHER FIND A SUITABLE SITE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTROLLED NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNING MARSH OR SOTCK FINGERLING OR YEARLING PIKE ON A PERIODIC BASIS TO BOLSTER POPULATION LEVELS. AT THIS TIME IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PIKE FINGERLINGS BE STOCKED AT 1.5 POUNDS/ LITTORAL ACRE TWO OF THREE YEARS. WALLEYE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED IN THE PAST BUT HAS RESULTED IN MARGINAL SUCCESS. IN 1971, THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE WAS 0.8 FISH/GILL NET; IT INCREASED TO 2.5 IN 1981 AND THEN DECLINED TO 0 IN 1986 AND 0.8 IN 1988. EMILY LAKE HAS EXCELLENT HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS FOR BASS-PANFISH MANAGE- MENT ANDWALLEYE PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE STOCKED. BLUEGILL AND BLACK CRAPPIE FISHING HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE SIZES OF FISH TAKEN IN SURVEY NETS. ALTHOUGH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF BOTH SPECIES IS HIGH, FEW FISH ARE GROWING TO AN ACCEPTABLE SIZE FOR ANGLERS. AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATES CRAPPIES AND BLUE- GILL ARE GROWING AT A SLOWER THAN AVERAGE RATE FOR SOUTHERN MINNESOTA LAKES. RECORDS FROM 1971 1981 SHOWED GOOD SIZES OF BLUEGILL AND CRAPPIE. WHY THE FISH HAVE BECOME STUNTED IS UNKNOWN. POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS INCLUDE HIGH SURVIVAL  OF YOUNG FISH INCREASING COMPETITION FOR FOOD THUS REDUCING GROWTH RATE OR INTENSIVE ANGLING CROPPING OFF THE LARGER FISH. THE FORMER IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON. TWO STRATEGIES APPEAR POSS- IBLE TO INCREASE THE SIZES OF BLUEGILL AND CRAPPIE. WITH CURRENT LAKE LEVELS THAT ARE VERY LOW, RETURN TO NORMAL LAKE LEVELS WOULD TEMPOR- ARILY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD IN THE EXPANDED LAKE AND THUS INCREASE GROWTH RATES. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY WAY IN WHICH SIZES WILL IMPROVE. ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD BE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE LAKE WITH ANTIMYCIN A. THE METHOD ELIMINATES SMALL FISH, LEAVING MORE FOOD FOR REMAINING POPULATION. THIS TECHNIQUE MAY HAVE POTENTIAL IF OTHER METHODS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL. CARP APPEAR TO BE AT AVERAGE TO LOW LEVELS IN EMILY LAKE. THEY MAY HAVE SOME IMPACT ON SPORTFISH BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE LAKE SINCE 1956. DURING THE INTERIM, GOOD FISHING HAS OCCURRED DESPITE THE PRESENCE CARP. THE ONLY WAY TO RID THE LAKE OF CARP WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN AT LOW ABUN- DANCE AND ARE NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE A PROBLEM. OTHER SPECIES WERE SAMPLED AT LOW LEVELS AND REMAIN UNCHANGED IN COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS SURVEYS. LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE 'NET SHY' AND WERE POORLY SAMPLED IN THIS SURVEY. ANGLER REPORTS USUALLY INDICATE A HEALTHY POPULATION.</p>",
