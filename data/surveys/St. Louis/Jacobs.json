                "narrative": "<p>Jacobs is an 88-acre lake with 88 acres (100%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  The lake is heavily vegetated and located 9 miles north of Duluth, Minnesota.  There is no public access to Jacobs Lake.  Jacobs was initially surveyed in 1964 and again in 1997 by DNR fisheries.  A population assessment was completed during the summer of 2008 to evaluate species composition and to gather information about fish populations.  The only record of fish stocking was walleye fry in the early 1960\u0019s. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 4 largemouth bass were sampled during the survey.  Average length of sampled bass was 11.1 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2006 were represented.  This species was not captured in any of the previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 13.0 per gillnet lift was up from 1997 (8.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 20.9 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 through 2006 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.6 per trapnet lift was down from 1997 (8.3) and below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 8.8 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only the 2006 year-class was represented in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 2.3 per trapnet lift was down from 1997 (2.6) but remained average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 6.8 inches but growth was slow.  Forty-four percent of the bluegills sampled were over seven inches in length.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2002 were represented with a strong 2001 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance of 51.4 per trapnet lift was up from 1997 (1.1) and well above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black bullhead mean length was 8.7  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and smallmouth bass that were sampled in the 1997 survey were not captured during this assessment.  Jacobs Lake fish community is typical of a lake that is frequently subjected to winterkill conditions.  Species composition and abundance can vary widely from year to year, with black bullhead and young game fish dominating the fishery.   <br> \n</p>",

About 95% of the lake is 5 feet deep or less resulting in periodic winter kills.  Black crappie, bluegill, northern pike and bullhead are the dominate species.     The 1997 survey found high numbers of black crappie that showed fast growth, however, only two age groups were present.  Average length was 8.4 inches with a range from 7.0 to 9.6 inches.  Bluegill numbers were normal and they also showed fast growth.  Average bluegill length was 6.6 inches with a range from 4.8 to 9.4 inches.  Fifteen northern pike were sampled with an average length of 20.3 inches and a length range from 14.8 to 28.7 inches.  Black bullhead numbers were normal with an average length of 6.0 inches.     Additional species seen at low numbers in the 1997 lake survey included:  smallmouth bass, walleye, yellow perch and white sucker.</p>",
