                "narrative": "<p>Gillnet catches of Walleye have increased over the last two assessments with the 1992 catch near the all time high. Natural reproduction is occurring, however the stronger year classes of Age II and IV walleye correspond with stocked years. Walleye growth is good for all ages represented.       The Northern Pike gillnet catch declined from the all time high of the previous assessment, however the catch per gillnet was still near the historical average catch. Northern Pike average about 1.6 pounds each.      The gillnet catches of Yellow Perch have historically shown considerable fluctuation. The substantial decline in the 1992 catch per gillnet is typical of past trends. Yellow Perch are fairly abundant with gillnet catches of 9.3/lift.      The trapnet catches of Bluegill has remained below 1.0/lift over the last four assessments. Numbers are not high but quality size fish are present.      Smallmouth Bass sampled during the assessment averaged about 2.2 pounds, with some individuals weighing 3.0 pounds. The gillnet catch of 1.7/lift is considered good when comparing similar lakes in this lake classification (11). Largemouth Bass young-of-the-year and small 1+ are generally well represented in 1/4 inch mesh trapnets but are seldom taken in the standard lake survey sampling gear.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2002 survey sampled walleye in above average numbers with an average weight of just under two pounds, and fish up to 5.8 pounds sampled.  The survey collected some quality size walleye with approximately 41% of the fish in the sample ranging between 18 inches and 21 inches.  The last walleye stocking in Mitawan Lake occurred in 1994.  The walleye population is being maintained through natural reproduction at this time.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers and averaged 2.9 pounds with fish up to 32.3 inches (7.3 pounds) sampled.  Although the survey indicated that the northern pike are not abundant there were a number of quality size fish over 4.7 pounds collected.Smallmouth bass were sampled in average numbers with fish up to 17.2 inches (3.0 pounds) captured.  The quality of the smallmouth bass collected in this survey was above average with several 2 to 3 pound fish sampled.Bluegill were sampled in below average numbers, however there were some quality size individuals collected.  Bluegill up to 9.8 inches were sampled, with a number of fish over 8 inches captured.Yellow perch were collected in below average numbers in this survey, which was typical for this lake.  The largest yellow perch collected was 9 inches.  Approximately 33% of the fish were between 8 inches and 9 inches, but most were too small to interest anglers.Largemouth bass are present in Mitawan Lake but are difficult to sample with this type of netting gear.  The very low numbers sampled in 2002 may not be an accurate assessment of the largemouth bass population in the lake.  The status of this species is best evaluated with electrofishing equipment, which was not used in this survey because of the difficult access.Mitawan Lake does not have a developed designated public access.  </p>",
