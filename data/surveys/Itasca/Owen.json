                "narrative": "<p>Owen Lake is a 257-acre lake in northern Itasca County located 12 miles east of Bigfork, MN.  The lake has an earthen public access on the south shore and a shoreline consisting of several points, bays and channels.  A DNR campground is present on the east shore.  Owen is in lake class 32 and other area lakes in this lake class include Eagle, Burrows and Burnt Shanty lakes.  Primary fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 10.2/net, which exceeded the expected range for similar lakes and was similar to the catch rate of 11.0/net in 2000.  Size structure was good with a good proportion of the population exceeding 24 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 28 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted for the first time in 2008 and sampled largemouth bass at a rate of 52/hour, indicating a moderately abundant population.  Small fish less than 15 inches dominated size structure.  Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in the 2000 assessment and four fish were sampled by electrofishing in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 23.7/trap net, which indicates a moderately abundant population and was similar to the catch rate in 2000 of 23.0/trap net.  Size structure was moderate to poor with many fish exceeding 6 inches, but no fish exceeding 8 inches. Growth was slightly faster than the lake class average with fish reaching 7 inches by age eight.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill net catch rate was 0.8/net, which was similar to the lower end of the expected range.  The trap net catch rate was 1.9/net and was similar to the middle of the expected range.  Size structure in trap nets was good with fish up to 10.5 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 9.7/net, which was similar to the upper end of the expected range.  The population consisted of mostly small fish between 5 to 6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFive walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 0.8/gill net, which was the same as the lake class average.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked every third year with the most recent stockings occurring in 2002 and 2005.  One of the five walleye sampled corresponded to a stocked year class.  Based on the results of this assessment, it appears that natural reproduction is maintaining a small walleye population similar to what this lake type is capable of producing.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 25 June, 2018.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at eight sites; using the 50-ft seine at four and the 15-ft seine at four.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of nine different species; seven species by seining and five species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 2 July, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Owen Lake is a 257-acre lake located 12 miles southeast of Bigfork, MN.  A state owned cement public access is located off Owen Lake Path (off Hwy. 52) on the south shore with parking for two boats with trailers.  Owen Lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and 71% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has soft water and low to moderate fertility.  Water transparency is good with visibility that has ranged between 8 and 17 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence has varied between 16 and 21 feet in mid-summer.  The lake has no inlets or outlets and an irregular shoreline with many points and bays.  Other lakes with similar habitat in the Grand Rapids area include Burnt Shanty, Burrows, and Eagle. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey was the tenth survey of the fish community since 1969.  This survey was conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.  The gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike and Black Crappie.  No special regulations are present.  The 2009 management plan indicated Northern Pike and Black Crappie were primary management species due to good size distribution and angler interest.  Walleye were a secondary management species due to them being actively managed through stocking and angler interest.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has higher density, good size distribution, and growth similar to the statewide average.  The gill net catch was higher than average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Catch rates the past four surveys were higher than those observed in the six prior surveys.  Lengths ranged from 14 to 39 inches, with an average of 25 inches.  Size structure was favorable, as 78% of pike sampled exceeded 21 inches and 31% exceeded 28 inches.  While the catch rate goal from the 2009 management plan was not met, all size structure goals were.  Pike were aged from 2 to 11 years old.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, resulting in pike taking five years to average 21 inches.  Due to the lake's small size anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike exceeding 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population has slightly above average density and size distribution, while growth is slightly below average.  Crappie have been sampled in all 10 surveys, indicating a consistent presence.  Trap net and gill net catches were higher than average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  The catch rate goal from the 2009 management plan was met.   Lengths ranged from 3 to 11 inches, with an average of 8 inches.  Size structure was favorable, as 55% of crappie sampled exceeded 8 inches and 12% exceeded 10 inches.  Crappie were aged from 1 to 7 years old.  Low to moderate levels of recruitment appear to occur regularly with fish aged from all age classes from 1 through 7.  Growth was slightly below the statewide average, resulting in crappie taking five years to average 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population has low density, above average size distribution, and below average growth.  The gill net catch was similar to average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  The catch rate goal from the 2009 management plan was not met; however the goal of 2.0/net was only observed once in the past seven surveys and likely not attainable.  Lakes with similar habitats are not well suited for supporting Walleye, as catch rates are typically 1.3/net.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 21 inches, with an average of 18 inches.  Size structure was favorable, as 90% of Walleye sampled exceeded 15 inches and 30% exceeded 20 inches.  Walleye were aged from 2 to 10 years old.  Growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Walleye taking 5 years to average 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population has higher density and below average size distribution and growth.  Gill-net catch rates have had an increasing trend over time.  The electrofishing catch rate was the highest observed and exceed the expected range for Grand Rapids Area lakes.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 15 inches, with an average of of 9 inches.  Size structure was below average, as only 29% of bass sampled exceeded 12 inches and only 5% exceeded 15 inches.  Only 4 fish over 15 inches have ever been sampled, with the largest being 18 inches.  Bass were aged from 2 to 8 years old.  Growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Largemouth Bass taking six years to average 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population has low to moderate density and poor size distribution.  Perch numbers remained really low throughout the first six surveys; however, catch rates have somewhat increased the last four.  Lower perch densities typically limit the number of adult Walleye and other gamefish, as well as the survival rates of stocked Walleye.  Lengths of fish sampled ranged from 5 to 8 inches, with an average of 7 inches.  Size structure was poor, as only 15% of perch sampled exceeded 8 inches.  Only two 10 inch perch have ever been sampled.  Age and growth information has never been determined.  Perch may be too small to interest anglers; however, are an important prey source for gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has moderate density and below average size distribution and growth.  Although trap-net catches remained low prior to 1988, they have increased and now are comparable to lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths of fish sampled ranged from 3 to 7 inches, with an average of 6 inches.  Size structure was below average, as 58% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 6 inches, and 0% exceeded 8 inches.  Eight inch fish have only been sampled in three surveys, while fish 9+ inches have never been sampled.  Bluegill were aged from 3 to 9 years old.  Growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Bluegill taking six years to average 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass population has low density and below average size distribution and growth.  The first Smallmouth Bass was sampled in 2000, while four were sampled in both 2008 and 2018.  Those 9 fish ranged in size from 4 to 17 inches.  In 2018, Smallmouth Bass were aged from 4 to 6 years old, and growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Smallmouth Bass taking five years to average 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Owen Lake is a small bass-panfish lake located in northeastern Itasca County.  The lake is known for its northern pike, black crappie and walleye fishing.  Stocked for many years with walleye, Owen in recent years has been stocked with walleye fingerlings.     In this assessment, walleye were sampled at 1.5/gill net, similar to what has been observed in the past.  All but one of the walleyes was from the fingerling stocked years of 1990, 1993 and 1996.  Growth of the walleye was excellent, exceeding the statewide averages by up to 15%.     Northern pike abundance reached an all time high in this assessment.  Although they varied in length from 9.7-35.3 inches, the average weight was only 1.8 pounds.  Of the 66 northerns aged, 74% were 2-5 years old.     Yellow perch were sampled at higher numbers than has been observed in most of the past assessments.  At 9.0/gill net in this assessment, they were sampled in the upper range for lakes of this type.     Black crappie and bluegill were also observed in good numbers.  Eighty-three percent of the black crappie sampled were from 1996 and 1997 year classes (3 and 4 years old).  The average size was 7.3 inches.  Bluegill, also abundant in this assessment, confirmed a trend of increasing numbers in the recent years. They averaged 5.1 inches in the gill net and 5.8 inches in the trap net.     Largemouth bass were sampled in the same numbers in both gill net and trap net, 1.2/set.     Other species sampled were brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish and white suckers.     </p>",

Walleye CPUE from gill nets in 1994 was the highest recorded for the lake at 2.0 per set.  Mean weight of walleye sampled was 1.8 pounds.  No walleye less than 14 inches were sampled in this assessment.     Northern pike CPUE from gill nets in 1994 was also the highest recorded at 7.8 per set.  Mean weight was 2.4 pounds and fish up to 31 inches were sampled.     Largemouth bass were sampled at 1.7 per gill net set.  Mean length was 13.2 inches and fish up to 17.7 inches were sampled.  Trap net CPUE was 0.3 per set.     Yellow perch CPUE from gill nets was the highest recorded from the lake in 1994, 18.0 per set.  This is up from 3.6 per set in 1988.     Black crappie CPUE in trap nets was 2.0 per set in 1994, the same as in 1988.  However, the gill net CPUE was 5.2 per set, up from 1.8 per set in 1988.     Bluegill CPUE in trap nets in 1994 was nearly identical to that found in 1988.  At 39 per lift, the population is made up generally small bluegill with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Over 10% of the bluegill measured were greater than 7 inches in length.     The fish community in Owen Lake appears to be quite diverse and healthy.  Gamefish species are present in moderate to high abundance for this lake class.  Yellow perch abundance is likely the key to the size and number of walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.</p>",
