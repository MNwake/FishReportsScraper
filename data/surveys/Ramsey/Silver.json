                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake covers an area of 72.1 acres.  Approximately 98 percent (70.7 acres) of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  The maximum depth is 18 feet and the median depth is 7 feet.  Water of the lake is moderately hard, fertile, and supports a very heavy or rank growth of muskgrass (Chara sp.).  Other aquatic vegetation such as bulrush, cattail, spikerush, sago pondweed, water milfoil, white waterlily, claspingleaf pondweed, and Berchtold's pondweed show only scattered to sparse growth around lake.  During the September lake survey the water was quite clear and a Secchi disc could be seen to a depth of 9 feet.  On August 16, 1961, the lake waters had a brownish-green color and a Secchi disc could not be seen in water deeper than 3.75 feet.  Soils in the more shallow lake waters were judged to be 60 percent mixture of sand, gravel, and rubble covered by silt; 15 percent pure sand; and 10 percent mixture of sand and muck.  However, in the area that supports Chara it would seem that the soil indicated is marl or a mixture of marl and other soils.  There is no outlet from the lake.  Two intermittent inlets, one in the northwest corner and one in the northeast corner, were checked but had no water.  One additional inlet (ditch) is reported to exist near inlet containing benchmark.  This third waterway had standing water on May 3, 1961.Test netting of the waters revealed that numbers of golden shiner, northern pike, black bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and hybrid sunfish were above respective statewide medians.  All the above populations except those of northern pike and largemouth bass appeared to be especially dense.  Perch, brown bullhead, and black crappies were taken in numbers that indicated populations of these species were below statewide medians.  Shoreline seining operations showed that a very large number of fathead minnows were present.There is no designated, state-owned, public access.  However, the public gains entrance to the lake from Highway 100, a Ramsey County picnic area, and a city-owned park and bathing beach.  Indications are that fishing pressure may range from moderate to heavy.  A considerable amount of the fishing pressure is judged to take place from shore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catches were above average for the area.  Walleye sampled were from 1985-1989 fgls stocking.  Walleye had exhibited average growth for the area.  NOP and LMB were sampled in low numbers, but NOP had good growth while growth of LMB was avg.  Bluegill were sampled at more than twice the number of the 1985 netting and were of small avg. size.  Growth of BLG was slow, as could be expected from such high abundance in a small size group.  BLC were sampled in low numbers, with a small average size.  The complete lack of larger BLC may be a result of high fishing pressure and harvest.  The catch of BLC was significantly lower than in 1985.  The shift in sunfish and crappie abundance may be related to elimination of winterkill with subsequent increases in the density and distribution of submerged vegetation.  An additional factor that may have affected BLG and BLC abundance could be the reduction of internal nutrient loading as a result of lowered bullhead numbers.  The number of HSF increased since the last netting, but PMK numbers declined.  The increase in HSF may be a result of an increased ability to compete with a population of very small size BLG.  Four TME were captured, all from the 1990 yrls. stocking.  GOS were abundant.  WTS were only sampled in the trapnets, but were taken at a higher than median rate for that gear.  Bullhead spp. sampled were low in abundance.  YEP were only caught in the trapnets in low numbers.</p>",

A city park on the south shore provides shore and pier fishing access and a county park on the north shore provides shore, boat, and winter access.  A winter aeration system is located east of the boat access.Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were the most abundant fish captured during this survey.  Most fish were small, with less than 10% over 6 inches long.  Black crappie were present in low numbers with only a few over 8 inches long.  Yellow perch numbers were below the median for lakes of this type.  Nearly half of the yellow perch caught were over 9 inches long.Walleye were captured in numbers of 3.50/gillnet, within the historic range of 2.00-5.50/gillnet.  Fish averaged over 20 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were moderately abundant with most fish measuring 12-16 inches long.  Northern pike were sampled in numbers higher than in any previous survey of this lake.  All fish were age IV or less and most were under 25 inches long.  Two tiger muskie were sampled, both from the last stocking (1998).  Both were approximately 24 inches long.Yellow bullhead numbers reached historic highs in this survey, but were average for this type of lake.  One-third of all fish were over 12 inches long.  Black bullhead numbers were low (2 fish).  White sucker were present in moderate numbers, ranging in size from 15-18 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is 72 acres in size and is in lake class 40. Maximum depth is 18 feet and littoral area covers 71 acres. The lake is a heavily vegetated shallow water basin that has a predominant Northern Pike - Largemouth Bass - Bluegill species composition. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 1992.  Since 1995, chemical treatments to control dense mats of milfoil have been done in the southern part of the lake. In 2007-2009 a series of lakewide herbicide treatments aimed at controlling Eurasian watermilfoil were conducted. These large chemical herbicide treatments perturbed the lake, resulting in a decline in native aquatic plant species and a corresponding decline in water clarity and quality. To this day, Silver Lake is still dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil. A city park on the south shore provides shore and pier fishing access and a city park along the north shore provides shore, boat, and winter access. A winter aeration system is located east of the boat access.  <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing was conducted on May 5th 2017. Twenty one Largemouth Bass were sampled during this survey.  Largemouth bass were moderately abundant with 20.05/hour observed and most fish measuring 6.5-20 inches Long.  The average size of Largemouth bass sampled was 13.8 inches long.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Less than 1% of the Bluegill measured 6.0\" or more, with the largest fish captured measuring only 6.3\" in length. The size structure for Pumpkinseed Sunfish is similar to that for Bluegill. A good Largemouth Bass population appears to be present. Approximately 80.0% of the stock size Largemouth Bass captured were 12.0\" or larger, and 20.0% measured 16.0\" or longer. Northern Pike were sampled in below median numbers. The average NOP captured was 20.2\" long and 1.96 pounds. Approximately 17% of the Northern Pike sampled measured 25.0\" or larger, with the largest fish captured being 30.6\" long. Walleye averaging 15.1\" long and 1.1 pounds were captured but in below median abundance. Yellow Perch were also sampled in low abundance. Black Crappie continue to be present in low abundance and average size of sampled fish was 6.3\" in length. Despite annual stocking of Channel Catfish from 1996-2002, none were captured during this assessment. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is 72 acres in size and is in lake class 40. Maximum depth is 18 feet and littoral area covers 71 acres. The lake is a heavily vegetated shallow water basin that has a predominant Northern Pike - Largemouth Bass - Bluegill species composition. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 1992.  Since 1995, chemical treatments to control dense mats of milfoil have been done in the southern part of the lake. In 2007-2009 a series of lakewide herbicide treatments aimed at controlling Eurasian watermilfoil were conducted. These large chemical herbicide treatments perturbed the lake, resulting in a decline in native aquatic plant species and a corresponding decline in water clarity and quality. To this day, Silver Lake is still dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil. A city park on the south shore provides shore and pier fishing access and a city park along the north shore provides shore, boat, and winter access. A winter aeration system is located east of the boat access.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were the most abundant fish captured during this survey.  Most bluegill were small, with less than 2% over 6 inches long.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also very small with average sizes of 4.13 and 4.54 inches respectively.  Black crappie are present in high numbers but small in size, with only one fish larger than 8 inches. Black crappies had and an average size of 6.35 inches. Yellow perch numbers were below the median for lakes of this type.  Yellow perch size ranged from 5.67 to 6.57 inches with an average size of 6.1 inches. Walleye were not sampled during this survey, but have been observed in previous surveys in low to modest numbers. Largemouth bass were moderately abundant with most fish measuring 8-16 inches Long.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers but less than the previous survey of this lake (2005) in which northern pike were sampled at all-time highs for abundance.  All fish were age VI+ or less and had an average size of 25 inches long.  One tiger muskie was sampled this fish corresponds to a stocking event in 2008.   This lone tiger muskie was 32 inches long and weighed slightly more than 6 lbs. Yellow bullheads were observed in moderate but average numbers for this type of lake.  Yellow bullhead sizes ranged from 7.5 to almost 11 inches. Black bullhead were found in low number during this survey. White sucker were also present in low numbers, ranging in size from 15-18 inches. Despite annual stockings from 1996 to 2003 and a 2008 stocking, channel catfish continue to be found in low abundance in Silver Lake as measured by catch rate, with one channel catfish observed during this survey. This single fish measured over 25.5 inches and weighed 6.4 lbs and was from the 2008 stocking.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake (72 acres and lake class 40) has maximum depth of 18 feet and littoral area of 71 acres. The lake is a heavily vegetated, shallow water basin that has a predominant Northern Pike - Largemouth Bass - Bluegill species composition. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 1992.  Since 1995, chemical treatments to control dense mats of milfoil have been done in the southern part of the lake. In 2007-2009 a series of lakewide herbicide treatments aimed at controlling Eurasian watermilfoil were conducted. These large chemical herbicide treatments perturbed the lake, resulting in a decline in native aquatic plant species and a corresponding decline in water clarity and quality. To this day, Silver Lake is still dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil. A city park on the south shore provides a fishing pier another city park along the north shore provides a fishing pier, shore, boat and winter access. A winter aeration system is located east of the boat access.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid sunfish were the most abundant fish captured during this survey.  Most Bluegill were small, with less than 8% over 6 inches long.  Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish were also very small with average sizes of 5.3 and 5.6 inches respectively.  Black Crappie are present in above average numbers but small in size, with no fish larger than 8 inches. Black Crappies had an average size of 6.3 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were above the median for lakes of this type.  Yellow Perch size ranged from 5.6 to 7.4 inches with an average size of 6.5 inches. Consistent with what has been observed in previous surveys, Walleye have been found in low to modest numbers. One large Walleye was sampled during this survey, it measured over 27 inches. Largemouth Bass were moderately abundant with most fish measuring 9.5-14.5 inches Long.  Northern Pike were sampled in above average numbers and are essentially unchanged in catch rate from the 2012 survey.  This quantity is less than the previous survey of this lake (2005) in which Northern Pike were sampled at all-time highs for abundance.  Northern Pike had an average size of 22 inches long.  Yellow Bullheads were observed in below average numbers for this type of lake.  Yellow Bullhead sizes ranged from 6.5 to almost 14 inches. Black Bullhead were found in much lower numbers during this survey than what was found in 2012. These fish however are of good size and had an average size of 12.0 inches. White Sucker were also present in low numbers, ranging in size from 16-21 inches. Other fish found in low abundance were Golden Shiner and Brown Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
