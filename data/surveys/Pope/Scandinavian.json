The size distribution of Largemouth Bass of desirable.  PSD was calculated at 50% and PSD-P was 13%.  Age classes 1 through 11 were represented in the catch.  Largemouth Bass growth rates are slightly greater than the mean for area lakes within Lake Classification 24.  Age 5 fish averaged 13.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Catch per unit effort, structural indices, and age class distribution of Largemouth Bass are very similar to the 1987 survey.  This suggests that Lake Scandinavian provides suitable aquatic habitat and forage to sustain a quality Largemouth Bass population.  Bluegill are over-abundant in Lake Scandinavian, however, catch rates averaged only 17.1 fish/trap net.  Dense beds of aquatic vegetation probably limit the effectiveness of trap nets in July.  Lake Scandinavian is used as a source of adult Bluegills in the spring.  The size structure and growth rate of Bluegill are indicative of a stunted population.  The mean weight of the fish captured was only 0.06 lbs and PSD was calculated at 11%.  Bluegill growth rate is slow, well below the mean growth rate for area lakes within lakes within lake classification 24.  Age 6 fish averaged only 5.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Northern Pike abundance may have declined since the last survey in 1987.  Catch rates fell from 9.8 fish/gill net in 1982 and 1987 to 3.0 fish/gill net in 1991.  Only ages 1 through 4 were represented in the catch.  PSD was measured at 60%.  No fish exceeded 26.0% inches in length.  Age 3 fish averaged 20.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  This growth rate is slightly greater than the mean growth rate for area lakes within Lake Classification 24.  Walleye catch rate averaged 1.6 fish/gill net in 1991.  Catch averaged 5.7 and 5.2 fish/gill net in 1982 and 1987, respectively.  Analysis of the age class distribution suggests poor success of recent fry and fingerling stockings.  Results of the population assessment in 1987 indicate relatively successful stockings of fingerlings in 1984 and fry in 1986.  Catch rates for Yellow Perch averaged 15.0 fish/gill net.  The mean weight of fish captured was 00.9 lbs and PSD was 0%.  The Yellow Perch will offer little in terms of recreational fishing, but should provide ample forage for Northern Pike and Walleye. Fisheries management should focus on maintaining the Centrarchid-Northern Pike community.  Walleye fingerlings could be stocked one out of three years to provide an additional angling opportunity.  Bluegill density will probably remain high and the size structure will remain poor due to the extensive submerged vegetation which provides escape cover.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scandinavian Lake is a 424-acre basin located approximately 14 miles south of Glenwood in southern Pope County.  The Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations has collected water quality on fifteen county lakes since 1994.  Results indicate that Scandinavian Lake ranks in the top five and fully supports swimming and other recreational use throughout the summer.  Secchi disk measurements usually exceed 10 feet.    The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community, which provides ample habitat for bass, sunfish, and northern pike.  This vegetation also competes with algae for the available nutrients in the lake, thus helping to maintain water clarity.   Emergent aquatic vegetation, such as bulrush and cattail, has diminished in abundance over the years.  These plants also provide critical fish habitat and protect water quality.  A permit from the DNR is required to remove or destroy any emergent vegetation from shoreline areas.  The fish community in Scandinavian Lake is typical of a moderately sized, densely vegetated lake.  Largemouth bass are abundant and the size structure of the population is desirable.  Over three-fourths of the fish sampled were 12 inches in length or greater and sixteen percent exceeded 15 inches.  Northern pike are also abundant, however the average size of the fish is relatively small.  Fish averaged about 20 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Bluegill are likely over-abundant.  The average size of the fish is small and growth rates are very slow.  Only twenty percent of the fish sampled were 6 inches or greater.  Walleye are managed as a bonus fishery. Gill net catches averaged 5.1 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was about two pounds.  Age-1 and age-3 fish were the strongest year classes present.  These year classes correspond to fingerling stockings in 1998 and 2000.  Scandinavian Lake is included in a current research project titled \"Evaluation of walleye stocking in 80 - 400 hectare Minnesota Lakes\".    </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Scandinavian Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTen species were collected during this survey.  One species (Banded Killifish) was considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Scandinavian Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scandinavian Lake is a 424-acre basin located approximately 14 miles south of Glenwood in southern Pope County.  Maximum depth is 49 feet.  Water clarity typically exceeds 9.0 ft during summer months.  The basin carries a MPCA aquatic recreational use classification of \"Fully Supporting\".  Aquatic plants are abundant and diverse.   Habitat attributes are characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" waters. <br> \n <br> \nSunfishes such as largemouth bass and bluegill are abundant.  Bass fishing opportunities are very good.  Growth is near average and 10-year-old bass were represented in 2006 survey.  Forty percent of bass in the 2006 population sample exceeded 15.0inches in length.  Mean weight was 1.4 pounds.  Bluegill may be overabundant.  This observation is not obvious in 2006 trapnet catches.  Most bluegill were captured in gillnets and deeper water.   Size distribution of the population is poor in response to slow growth.  Older individuals averaged only 3.3 inches in total length at age-4.   Very few sampled fish exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie are much less abundant than other sunfishes.  Average trapnet catches among surveys have consistently remained below the expected catch rate.  Crappie are not abundant, but they tend to be large.  The largest measured in 2006 was 12.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTypical of clear bass-panfish lakes in west-central Minnesota, northern pike are abundant.  Average gillnet catches in all but the 1991 survey have exceeded the range of normal for similar lakes.  Consequently, pike growth is below average.  Older pike captured during the 2006 survey averaged 20.1 inches in total length at age-4.  Average size captured was 1.9 pounds and 20.6 inches in length.  The largest northern pike measured 30.3 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry or fingerling stockings have occurred for many years in efforts to sustain a good fishery.  Age distribution of the 2006 population sample was well correlated with stocking chronology, yet survival of young walleye to a harvestable size is low.  Survey capture rates are within the range of expected catches, but below the median catch rate for similar lakes.  Consumptive walleye fishing quality is marginal.  Recreational fishing potential, expressed as average size available to catch, is very good.  Walleye grow very fast and individuals exceeding age-10 are not uncommon.  Five-year-old fish caught during the 2006 survey were nearly 20.0 inches in length.  Mean weight of walleye was 3.0 lbs.  Walleye fishing attributes could best be described as low catches of large walleye. <br> \n <br> \nScandinavian Lake's fish community is overloaded with predators and medium-size sunfishes too large for all but the largest predators to consume.  Anglers can serve a beneficial role in restructuring the fish community, improving gamefish growth rates, and enhancing walleye stocking success by focusing harvest on small northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  Under-exploitation or size-selective harvest of the larger individuals in the populations leads to community instability and degraded fishing quality. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scandinavian Lake is a 424-acre basin located approximately 14 miles south of Glenwood in southern Pope County.  Maximum depth is 49 feet.  Water transparency is declining but still exceeds 8.0 ft. during summer months.   The basin carries a MPCA aquatic recreational use classification of \"Fully Supporting\".  Aquatic plants are abundant and diverse.   Habitat attributes are characteristic of \"bass-panfish\" waters.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant.  Spring electrofishing resulted in capture of 74.4 bass/hour of effort.  Natural reproduction appears to be good with ten age classes represented in the population sample.  Mean weight was 1.1 pounds.  Slow growth reduces potential fishing quality in terms of average size caught, but longevity helps mitigate much of that loss of fishing quality.  Nineteen percent of 8.0-inch and larger bass captured exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nSunfishes such as bluegills, pumpkinseeds, hybrids, and green sunfish, are abundant.  Bluegills have comprised the greatest proportion of sunfishes captured during surveys.  Size structure and growth rate of bluegills are less than desirable due to high abundance.  Age-7 bluegill averaged 6.3 inches in total length at time of capture.  Average size of bluegill captures was 5.0 inches. Only two percent of bluegills larger than 3.0 inches exceeded 8.0 inches.  Harvest of surplus densities of medium-size sunfishes would improve growth and average size of the bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are also abundant.  Average size caught in gillnets was 2.2 pounds and 21.4 inches in length.  In contrast to largemouth bass and other sunfishes, pike growth is fairly good and in time, pike can grow large.  One 40.0 inch fish was captured during the 2012 survey.            <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling stockings are programmed during odd-numbered years to sustain a modest fishery.  Age distribution of the 2012 population sample was well correlated with stocking chronology.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.4 fish/net, which is acceptable given intense competition with other predators and predation of fingerlings by largemouth bass and northern pike.  Walleye grow surprisingly fast in Scandinavian Lake.  Age-3 walleyes averaged 15.5 inches in length at time of the July survey.   Fast growth and modest contributions of stockings are evident in size distribution of the population sample.  Forty-three percent of the gillnet catch of 10.0-inch and larger walleye exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of black crappie were low during the 2012 survey.  Those crappies captured were young fish.  Average size caught in gillnets was 5.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe preferred prey of walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass is yellow perch.  Perch abundance is low in response to high predator numbers.  Few are large enough to harvest.  Due to predation pressures, perch are maturing at a small size. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species netted during the survey included black, yellow and brown bullheads, white suckers, bowfin, and common carp.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scandinavian Lake is a 417-acre basin located 14 miles south of Glenwood.  The lake has a maximum depth of 50.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 11.0 feet.  The lake was thermally stratified at time of the July 2018 netting survey.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 20.0 feet in depth were too low to support fish life.  Water quality is good and in response, aquatic vegetation is abundant.  Aquatic vegetation provides important habitat to vegetation-oriented fish species (Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, panfish).  Walleye are stocked to sustain a modest fishery.  A public access site is located on the south shore off of South Scandi Drive. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2018 to gain updated information describing fish community structure and gamefish abundance.  Survey methodology included a May electrofishing survey to sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the survey was completed July 16-19.  A combination of nine gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish community. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth Bass continued to be abundant.  Average size of bass captures was 11.7 inches.  The largest bass caught measured 17.7 inches in total length.   Thirty-two percent of captures measuring 8.0 inches and larger exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  Large numbers of small, likely young bass, were collected and will likely provide a good fishery in upcoming years.  <br> \n <br> \nNetting catch rates documented that Northern Pike remain abundant.  Average size of pike captures in gill nets was 20.5 inches.  Few pike captures exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  The lake supports elevated densities of Bluegills in probable response to plenty of escape cover from predators.  Average length of Bluegill catches was low at 4.8 inches, but some individuals did exceed 8.0 inches.  Growth rates were moderately slow, thus few live long enough to grow to 8.0 inches.  Black Crappies are present, but relatively few are captured near shore in July surveys.  Those crappies captured in gill nets averaged 8.6 inches.  The largest measured 11.1 inches.  Yellow Perch exist at a low population density in probable response to elevated predator densities.  Average size of perch captures was 6.4 inches.  While important to the diet of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleyes, few perch grow large enough to attain a harvestable- size. <br> \n   <br> \nScandinavian Lake's Walleye population is supplemented with fingerling or yearling stocking scheduled at an alternate year frequency.  Walleyes proved to be moderately abundant.  The Walleye gill net catch rate of 6.6 fish/net was the second-highest catch rate recorded among surveys.  Over 70% of the gill net catch of Walleyes exceeded 15.0 inches.  Average size of captures was 17.1 inches.  A strong year class of two-year-old Walleyes was detected.  This year class will likely sustain good fishing opportunities in the coming years. <br> \n   <br> \nElevated numbers of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass have likely limited Yellow Perch abundance and potential contributions of the Walleye stocking program.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of expanded Northern Pike harvest opportunities in the North-central Harvest Zone to increase harvest of 21.9-inch and smaller pike to reduce pike numbers and enhance predator/prey balance and success of Walleye stockings.  Anglers are also encouraged to harvest from surpluses of medium-size Bluegills and 12.0-inch and smaller Largemouth Bass to reduce densities and improve growth potential. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil is present in Scandinavian Lake, but no other invasive species have been documented.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Scandinavian Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides ample habitatfor centarchids and northern pike.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 16.0 feet and is densein shallow areas.  Emergent vegetation is limited to a fringe of cattail around the shoreline of thebay on the western shore.  Only one small patch of hardstem bulrush was observed during the vegetationsurvey.  Past vegetation surveys and anecdotal reports suggest a loss of widely scattered bulrushstands around the lake.Northern pike catches increased from 3.0 fish/gillnet in 1991 to 9.7 fish/gillnet in 1996.  Gillnetcatches averaged 9.8, 9.4, and 12.5 fish/net in 1987, 1982, and 1977, respectively.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 1.5 - 7.3fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.0 pounds.  Over 80% of the fish were 21 inches inlength or greater, however few fish exceeded 28.0 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant and shouldprovide quality angling opportunities.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 77.0 stock-size fish per hour. Most of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greater and 31% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegillcatches averaged 23.4 fish/trapnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes.(7.5 - 62.5 fish/trapnet).  Trapnet catches have ranged from 17.1 to 96.4 fish/net in previoussurveys.  Size structure of the bluegill population is poor.  Most of the fish were between 3 and 6inches in length.  Walleye are considered a bonus angling opportunity.  Gillnet catches increased from1.6 fish/net in 1991 to 7.9 fish/net in 1996.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.3 to 6.6 fish/net inprevious surveys, nearly identical to the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes.  Meanweight of fish captured in 1996 was 0.9 pounds.  Age-2 fish comprised 62% of the fish captured ingillnets.  This age class corresponds to a year of fingerling stocking in 1994, however the stockingof age-1 fish in recent years precludes any meaningful evaluation of natural reproduction or stockingefficiency.  Yellow perch catches averaged 10.3 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 3.5 to61.4 fish/net in previous surveys.  All of the fish captured in 1996 were between 5.0 and 8.0 inchesin total length.         </p>",
