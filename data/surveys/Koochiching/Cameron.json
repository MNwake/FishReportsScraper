The lake has a carry-in access via a state trail crossing near the outlet. Northern Pike are abundant in comparison to similar lakes, with an average length of 19.7 inches and fish up to 25.7 inches sampled. Yellow Perch should provide some good angling opportunities as they are also in high abundance. Over 30% of the fish sampled by gill net were greater than 8 inches in total length, and fish up to 12 inches were sampled. Several strong year classes are present so there may be more fish recruiting to the larger size classes in the coming years. Dissolved oxygen readings from past years show that this lake may be prone to winter kill, and angling may follow boom and bust cycles that are typical for these small and shallow lakes.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cameron Lake is a 94 acre lake, located about one mile southwest of Northome. The lake is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 26 feet, making it prone to occasional winterkill events. Current access to Cameron Lake is via the Blue Ox/Voyageur trail that crosses the outlet about 0.3 miles from the lake. A standard survey was completed in Cameron Lake in late June of 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nCameron Lake has no special regulations. Fishing regulations follow statewide regulations for inland waters. Previous management plans identify several long-range goals, including providing angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass through natural reproduction. No Largemouth Bass or Northern Pike were sampled during the 2023 survey, indicating that a winter kill event had likely occurred since the last survey in 2013. Yellow Perch were the only gamefish species present, and Black Bullhead and golden shiner were the only other species present. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate was 111.5 fish per net, which was above average for similar lakes. Length ranged from 4.9 to 12.0 inches, with an average of 6.2 inches. Average weight was 0.11 pounds, which was below average for similar lakes. A total of three year-classes were present, and ranged from 3-6 years, with the 2020 year-class represented 85% of the total sample. Yellow Perch should provide some good angling opportunities as they are in high abundance. Given the strong year-class in 2020 and above average growth rates, there may be more fish recruiting to the larger size classes in the coming years.  <br> \n</p>",
