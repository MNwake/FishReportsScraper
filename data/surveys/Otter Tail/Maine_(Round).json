                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is located in central Otter Tail County, about one mile from the town of Maine.  The lake is 83 acres in size, and reaches a maximum depth of 34 feet.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake off of county road 115.  The secchi depth in July of 1999 was 11.5 feet, indicating good water quality.  Much of the lakeshore is undeveloped, and good stands of hardstem bulrush are present throughout the shallow areas of the lake.  Bulrush and other emergent vegetation are important as fish spawning and nursery areas, as well as protection from shoreline erosion.  As such, they are protected by law from removal.  Landowners should check with DNR Fisheries before performing removal of aquatic vegetation to learn about pertaining regulations.     Round Lake supports good populations of several species of fish.  Popular targets are walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Other potential catches include bluegill and yellow perch.     Walleye catches increased to 7.3 per gill net in 1999 from an average of 2.3 in 1994.  This is the highest catch rate since 1974, and is above expected levels for this type of lake.  The average size was 14.3 inches and 1.1 lbs.  Fifty-seven percent of walleye came from the 1996 year class, a year in which the lake was not stocked.  The remainder came from stocked years, which typically produce a majority of walleye in this lake.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 1 lb. per littoral acre (35 lbs.).  Walleye is the only fish specie that is stocked in Round Lake.     Northern pike averaged 8.0 per gill net, which is above the previous survey (1.7) and the statewide median for this type of lake (5.0).  Fifty-two percent of the pike were from the 1996 year class.  The average size was 22.4 inches and 2.6 lbs, and the largest was 28 inches.  Pike reached an average of 21.5 inches by age 4, which is typical for this lake type.     Bluegill catches averaged 58.9 per trap net, which is above what is expected for this lake type, but similar to the previous survey (57.0 per trap net).  The 1995 year class accounted for 98% of the bluegills sampled, or 398 of 407 fish.  The average size was 6.3 inches, and 18% were above 7.0 inches.  As this year class continues to mature, the average size should improve.     Yellow perch averaged 16.7 per gill net, which is within the normal range for this lake.

                "narrative": "<p>     Round Lake is an 83-acre lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately one mile west of Maine, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 34 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline length is 1.6 miles.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 survey was 9.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 15.5 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public access is located off of County Road 115 along the east shoreline of the lake.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most prevalent emergent vegetation is hardstem bulrush, which is located in scattered beds mainly along the north and west shorelines of the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Round Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Size structure is poor; no pike 24.0 inches or greater in length were sampled.  Pike ranged in length from 11.7 to 20.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are slow, which may correspond with a low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage specie. <br> \n    Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Round Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bass attain  an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n    A moderate-density bluegill population exists.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Size structure is also good with 32% of the bluegills in the trap net sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.7 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike are present in fairly high numbers for the available prey and further stocking should be eliminated unless there is a need.  <br> \n     Test-netting data indicates that bluegills are present but of only moderate size.  <br> \n     Yellow perch numbers are very low for the high numbers of predators in this lake.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass were found in high abundance in both summer netting and during the fall electrofishing period.  Due to the high numbers of predators, the low level of perch, and the evidence of walleye natural reproduction, it is recommended that stocking of northern pike and walleye be discontinued. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Round Lake is an 83-acre lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately one mile west of Maine, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 34 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline length is 1.6 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 16.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 15.5 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public access is located off of County Road 115 along the east shoreline of the lake.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most prevalent emergent vegetation is hardstem bulrush, which is located in scattered beds mainly along the north and west shorelines of the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Round Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated due to inconsistent reproduction.    Eleven percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Pike ranged in length from 14.2 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Round Lake has a high density Largemouth Bass population.  Bass ranged in length from 3.2 to 17.5 inches with an average length and weight of 8.9 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at three years of age. <br> \n    A moderate density Bluegill population exists.  Bluegill reproduction appears to be consistently good.   Eleven percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is located in central Otter Tail County, approximately one mile west of the town of Maine, MN.  The lake is 83 acres in size, and reaches a maximum depth of 34 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the east side of the lake off of County Road 115.  The secchi disk reading was 10.0 feet, indicating good water clarity.  Much of the lakeshore is undeveloped and large stands of hardstem bulrush are present throughout the shoal water areas.  Bulrush and other emergent vegetation are important as fish spawning and nursery areas, as well as protection from shoreline erosion.  As such, they are protected by law from removal.       Round Lake supports good populations of several species of fish.  Popular targets are walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass.  Other potential catches include bluegill and yellow perch.     The walleye test-net catch rate decreased, however; it was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  The average length and weight was 18.9 inches and 2.3 lbs.  Walleye fingerlings arecurrently stocked every other year at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (70 lbs.).  Walleye is the only fish specie that is stocked in Round Lake.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range.  The average size was 17.9 inches and 1.1 lbs.  Pike reach an average length of 20.0 inches by age 4, which is typical for this lake type.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was similar to the previous two surveys and above the normal range.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with fifty-six percent of the bluegill greater than 7.0 inches in length.  The average size was 6.9 inches.   </p>",
