The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, and several year classes were strongly represented in the 1999 catch.  It appeared that good walleye year classes had been produced in every year since 1995.  Walleye growth rates were slower than average for this area, probably due to a lack of forage fish, and to competition from the dense white sucker population.</p>",

Walleye average size was low, but that has usually been the case in West Twin Lake, and the average size of the 2005 catch was similar to what has been seen in the past in this lake.  The walleye population was supported entirely through natural reproduction, and it appeared that the 2003 and 2002 year classes had been strong.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for a lake of this type in Cook County.  Walleye attained, on average, a length of 12.3 inches at the end of their fourth year.White sucker were also abundant; however, the 2005 catch, while high, was not unusually high for this lake.  Walleye and white sucker were probably competing for invertebrate forage, since there was little else available for walleye to consume.  No yellow perch were present, although modest numbers of fathead minnow and creek chub were taken in 1/4-in-mesh trap nets used to sample small fish.</p>",
