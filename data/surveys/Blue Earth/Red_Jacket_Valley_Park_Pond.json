                "narrative": "<p>Red Jacket Valley Park Pond is a 40-acre water body located within the Red Jacket Valley Park 2 miles southwest of the town of Mankato in Blue Earth County. The pond was created as a privately-owned sand and gravel pit and was transferred along with the surrounding land to county ownership in 2016. A new park called Red Jacket Valley Park was established at the site and encompasses three separate water bodies. The south basin is the largest with a max depth of approximately 20 feet although water levels vary considerably due to the connection with the Le Sueur River.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted by the Minnesota DNR using boat electrofishing on June 7, 2018 and July 2, 2018 to assess the baseline fish community prior to the development and implementation of a management plan. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Walleyes were targeted, netted, and measured during the June 7, 2018 sample and all gamefish were targeted, netted, and measured during the July 2, 2018 sample. Gamefish small enough to escape through ? inch mesh and non-game species were not measured but identified and judged to be either abundant, common, or rare. Water quality parameters were also measured.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 8 species of gamefish were sampled on July 2, 2018 including Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch. Bluegill were the most abundant game fish and were sampled at a rate of 117.8/hour. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 75.0/hour on-time. Largemouth Bass were also sampled at a rate of 71.5/hour on-time on June 7, 2018. Largemouth Bass lengths from both samples ranged from 4.5 to 18.0 inches with an average of approximately 10.2 inches. Bluegills were mostly small with a range of 2.9 to 7.5 inches and an average of 5.2 inches. Black Crappie and Yellow Perch were sampled in moderate numbers with catch rates of 17.5/hour on-time for both. Black Crappies ranged from 4.3 to 10.4 inches with an average of 7.8 inches and Yellow Perch ranged from 3.9 to 6.9 inches and averaged 5.6 inches. A total of 6 Walleyes ranging from 13.4 to 16.0 inches were measured from both samples. A single Smallmouth Bass measuring 12.6 inches, one 8.0-inch White Crappie, and a few hybrid sunfish rounded out the gamefish sample. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the June 7, 2018 sample include Bigmouth Buffalo (common), Black Bullhead (common), Bluntnose Minnow (rare), Common Carp (common), Emerald Shiner (rare), Gizzard Shad (rare), Golden Shiner (rare), Green Sunfish (abundant), hybrid sunfish (common), age-0 Largemouth Bass (common), Northern Pike (rare), Orangespotted Sunfish (rare), Shorthead Redhorse (common), Shortnose Gar (rare), Smallmouth Buffalo (rare), Spotfin Shiner (rare), White Crappie (rare), White Sucker (rare), and Yellow Perch (common).  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the July 2, 2018 include Black Bullhead (common), Bigmouth Buffalo (common), Common Carp (abundant), Emerald Shiner (rare), Fathead Minnow (rare), Freshwater Drum (rare), Green Sunfish (common), Golden Shiner (common), age-0 Largemouth Bass (abundant), Orangespotted Sunfish (rare), Quillback Carpsucker (rare), River Carpsucker (rare), Shorthead Redhorse (rare), Shortnose Gar (rare), Smallmouth Buffalo (rare), White Sucker (rare), and age-0 Yellow Perch (abundant). Overall, high diversity was seen during the 2018 survey and the fish community was a mix of lake and river species. The river species most likely came from the nearby Le Sueur River during high water events. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were taken on July 7, 2018 including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was moderate with a secchi depth of 3.4 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 74.1 degrees Fahrenheit and 11.7 ppm at the surface to 47.5 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at a depth of 24 feet. A shallow thermocline was detected around 6 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth Bass were also sampled at a rate of 71.5/hour on-time on June 7, 2018. Largemouth Bass lengths from both samples ranged from 4.5 to 18.0 inches with an average of approximately 10.2 inches. Bluegills were mostly small with a range of 2.9 to 7.5 inches and an average of 5.2 inches. Black Crappie and Yellow Perch were sampled in moderate numbers with catch rates of 17.5/hour on-time for both. Black Crappies ranged from 4.3 to 10.4 inches with an average of 7.8 inches and Yellow Perch ranged from 3.9 to 6.9 inches and averaged 5.6 inches. A total of 6 Walleyes ranging from 13.4 to 16.0 inches were measured from both samples. A single Smallmouth Bass measuring 12.6 inches, one 8.0-inch White Crappie, and a few hybrid sunfish rounded out the gamefish sample. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the June 7, 2018 sample include Bigmouth Buffalo (common), Black Bullhead (common), Bluntnose Minnow (rare), Common Carp (common), Emerald Shiner (rare), Gizzard Shad (rare), Golden Shiner (rare), Green Sunfish (abundant), hybrid sunfish (common), age-0 Largemouth Bass (common), Northern Pike (rare), Orangespotted Sunfish (rare), Shorthead Redhorse (common), Shortnose Gar (rare), Smallmouth Buffalo (rare), Spotfin Shiner (rare), White Crappie (rare), White Sucker (rare), and Yellow Perch (common).  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the July 2, 2018 include Black Bullhead (common), Bigmouth Buffalo (common), Common Carp (abundant), Emerald Shiner (rare), Fathead Minnow (rare), Freshwater Drum (rare), Green Sunfish (common), Golden Shiner (common), age-0 Largemouth Bass (abundant), Orangespotted Sunfish (rare), Quillback Carpsucker (rare), River Carpsucker (rare), Shorthead Redhorse (rare), Shortnose Gar (rare), Smallmouth Buffalo (rare), White Sucker (rare), and age-0 Yellow Perch (abundant). Overall, high diversity was seen during the 2018 survey and the fish community was a mix of lake and river species. The river species most likely came from the nearby Le Sueur River during high water events. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were taken on July 7, 2018 including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was moderate with a secchi depth of 3.4 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 74.1 degrees Fahrenheit and 11.7 ppm at the surface to 47.5 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at a depth of 24 feet. A shallow thermocline was detected around 6 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",
