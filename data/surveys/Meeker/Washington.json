This is slightly lower than the last assessment netting of 10/gillnet in 1979.  The netting information between 1979 and 1983 indicates a drop in the perch forage base, going from 7.8/gillnet in 1979 to 2/gillnet in 1983.  Shoreline seining showed similar results.  The northern pike population has increased from 2/gillnet in 1979 to 7/gillnet in 1983.  Other fish populations have remained fairly stable, except that the number of white crappies reduced considerably.  Though the numbers of walleye per lift reduced slightly from 1979, the length increased slightly to an average of 18 inches.  The catch per lift is still well above the local and state averages.  Northern pike lengths went from 12\" to 34 \", with most fish being in the 18\" category.  The largemouth bass have done very well in Washington, with fish ranging from 6 to 19 inches being sampled in this survey.  Growth has been good on gamefish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Washington Lake in 2012 to monitor the fish population.  In 2012, a total of 17 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Dense beds of the exotic plant, Eurasian watermilfoil, were found across much of the basin in 2012.  Washington Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are listed as secondary management species in the Fisheries Lake Management Plan.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (143) of walleye for a catch rate of 9.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 17.8/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 2.2 to 41.2/net with an average of 14.7.  The gill netted walleye were 8.9 to 23.1 inches long with an average of 12.3.  Approximately 21% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer.  The latest stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every other year) was initiated in 1991.  Gill net catch rates during this regime (1999, 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2012) ranged from 5.8 to 19.0/net with an average of 13.2.  All five of those catch rates were within or above the normal range for this lake type.  Walleye were age-1 through age-7 with seven year-classes being represented.  In the gill nets, age-1 fish made up approximately 78% of the catch.  The 2011 cohort was the only year-class that would be considered strong.  Approximately 6% of the gill netted walleye that were aged came from non-stocked years.  It was unknown what portion of the 94%, from stocked years, resulted from natural reproduction, stocking, or some combination of both.  Analysis of gill net age data from 1989 to 2011 indicated that only 1 strong year-class (2006) was produced during a non-stocked year (n=10).  Growth was fast in 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (57) of northern pike for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 1.6/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were mostly low, ranging from 0.7 to 8.5/net with an average of 3.2 and a median (middle most data point) of 2.1.  This indicated that recruitment was poor most years at Washington Lake.  Northern pike were 16.4 to 26.7 inches long with an average of 19.9.  Approximately 82% of the gill net catch was less than 21 inches in length.  Trap nets sampled seven northern pike, with a maximum length of 28.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (6) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 and 2004 catch rates were also low, 1.8 and 0.2/net, respectively.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were generally low, ranging from 0.2 to 64.0/net with an average of 13.1 and median of 1.8.  Yellow perch were 5.9 to 9.3 inches long with an average of 6.8.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (9) of black crappie for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the second lowest catch rate ever recorded at Washington Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was similar at 0.7/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.3 to 22.6/net with an average of 4.3.  Trap netted black crappie were 5.2 to 11.7 inches long with an average of 8.9.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (30) of black crappie for a catch rate of 2.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2012 (n=12) were generally low, ranging from 2.0 to 11.4/net with an average of 5.3.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.6 to 14.7 inches long with an average of 7.6.  Approximately 27% of the gill net sample was 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (255) of bluegill for a catch rate of 17.0/net which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was lower at 8.2/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=12) ranged from 0.2 to 23.9/net, with an average of 12.2.  In 2012, trap netted bluegill were 3.2 to 8.0 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Approximately 32% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, while 5% were 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, targeting largemouth bass, sampled low to moderate numbers (46) of fish for a catch rate of 17.3/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The 2008 catch rate was similar at 12.4/hr.  Historic catch rates (n=7) from 1993 to 2012 were variable, ranging from 8.7 to 40.1/hr with an average of 18.2.  Largemouth bass were 3.2 to 18.6 inches long with an average of 11.9.  Electrofished largemouth bass were age-1 through age-7, with six year-classes present.  Age-2 fish were most abundant, representing 36% of the aged fish.  Growth was similar to past assessments.  Gill nets sampled 15 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Electrofishing on Washington may not be as effective as it is on other lakes, due to an abundance of offshore submergent vegetation.  Anecdotal reports from anglers indicate that a quality largemouth bass fishery exists at Washington Lake.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (20) of smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was similar at 1.9/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) ranged from 0.0 to 2.1/net with an average of 0.5 and a median of 0.  Relative abundance in the 2000's increased, when compared to the 1970's through the 1990's.  Gill netted smallmouth bass were 5.9 to 17.1 inches long with an average of 12.2.  Spring night time electrofishing sampled low numbers (25) of smallmouth bass, for a catch rate of 9.4/hr of electrofisher on-time, and this was the highest ever measured at Washington Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 5.6/hr.  The last three catch rates showed an increasing trend for smallmouth bass, although this may not be statistically significant.  Historic catch rates (n=7) from 1993 to 2012 were low, ranging from 0.4 to 9.4/hr with an average of 4.1.  In 2012, only 3 electrofished smallmouth bass were greater than 12 inches in length.  Electrofished smallmouth bass were age-1 to age-5, with five year-classes present.  Age-2 fish made up 72% of the catch.  Growth was similar to the 2008 assessment.  Washington is one of the few lakes in Meeker County that has a fishable population of smallmouth bass.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.1/net.  This was the first time that channel catfish were sampled in Washington Lake.  The fish was 26.2 inches long.  It was unknown how this fish ended up in Washington Lake, but it likely immigrated up Washington Creek and swam over the outlet dam during a high water event.  Water levels were exceptionally high during the spring of 2011.  <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (4) of carp for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.1 to 15.7/net with an average of 1.0 and a median of 0.4.  Trap net catch rates have been below the normal range since the 1979 survey.  Gill nets did not sample any carp in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (12) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the second lowest ever measured at Washington.  Historic catch rates from 1951 through 2012 (n=13) were generally low to moderate, ranging from 0.0 to 51.2/net with an average of 7.8 and a median of 3.6.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (3) of black bullhead in 2012, for a catch rate of 0.2/net. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Lake Washington beginning on 7/23/18 to monitor the lake's fish population and evaluate the Walleye stocking regime. In 2018, a total of 24 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN), or with traditional (0.25\") shoreline seining.  The lake was well mixed on 7/23/18 with oxygen near the bottom being 5.5 mg/l.  Water clarity was only fair (4.0 feet), due to an algae bloom.  Formal plant sampling was not conducted in 2018, but no patches of Eurasian Watermilfoil were observed during netting week by the fish survey crew.  Washington Lake was listed as having two aquatic invasive species, Eurasian Watermilfoil (listed in 1999) and Zebra Mussel (listed in 2015). <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Walleye (82) for a catch rate of 5.5/net, which was within the lake's normal range but was the second lowest catch on record for Washington Lake.  Only the 1957 GN catch rate was lower (2.2/GN) than the 2018 catch.  The 2017 lake management plan (LMP) long range goal of Walleye (>7.7/GN) was not met in 2018.  The 2016 catch rate was 9.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=16), under various stocking regimes, were variable, ranging from 2.2 to 41.2/net with an average of 13.4.  The latest stocking regime (2,266,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 1991.  Gill net catch rates during this regime (1999, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018) ranged from 5.5 to 19.0/net with an average of 11.2.  In 2018, gill netted Walleye were 8.5 to 24.5 inches long with an average of 13.7.  Approximately 44% of the GN catch was less than 10 inches in length and only 7% were 20 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure for walleye.  In 2018, Walleye were age-1 through age-9 with seven year classes being represented.  In the gill nets, age-1's, 2's, 3's and 4's accounted for 48%, 20%, 16% and 10% of the catch, respectively.  The 2015, 2016, and 2017, year classes would all be ranked as moderate in size, although the 2017 year class was not fully recruited to the gillnets (large enough to be captured effectively).  No year classes were considered strong in 2018.  In 2018, all other year classes (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014) were ranked as weak.  The contribution from non-stocked years was 29% of the GN aged fish, mainly due to the moderate 2016 year class.  It was unknown what portion of the stocked year fish came from stocking, natural reproduction, or some combination of both.  Since we began using otoliths to age Walleye in 2012 (2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 surveys), the percentage of gill netted walleye from non-stocked years has averaged 19.5%.  Analysis of GN age data, from 1991 to 2018 (n=9 assessments), indicated that only one strong year class (2006) was produced during a non-stocked year (n=13).  Fry stocked years (n=14) produced six strong year classes during that time period.  In 2018, growth for age-1 fish was slow, but may be attributable to a shortened growing season with a late ice out.  Growth for age-2, age-3 and age-4 fish was fast.  In 2017, fall electrofishing, targeting young of the year Walleye, produced a catch rate of 51.0/hour, indicating a moderate sized year class.  The 2017 year class was the largest age class in the 2018 gill nets, a remarkable feat considered that some of the 2017 year class may have still been too small to be effectively sampled with gill nets in 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (38) for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2017 LMP's long range goal of Northern Pike (1.6 to 4.5/GN) was met.  The 2016 GN catch rate was similar at 4.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=16) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.5/net with an average of 3.3.  This indicated that recruitment was low (<5/net) most years at Washington Lake.  In 2018, Northern Pike were 9.5 to 32.5 inches long with an average of 24.8.  A single young of the year Northern Pike (5.5 inches in early August) was sampled during shoreline seining.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Lake Washington is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 pike bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  Historically speaking, Washington is often too turbid for spearing.  The new Northern Pike zone regulations are designed to improve the size structure of Northern Pike in lakes in the southern and north central zone and preserve existing size structure in lakes in the northeastern zone.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (36) for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2016 catch rate was much higher at 12.6/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=16) were highly variable, ranging from 0.2 to 64.0/net with an average of 11.8.  In 2018, Yellow Perch were 5.6 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 6.6.  Yellow Perch were aged using scales and otoliths in 2018.  Yellow Perch were estimated to be age-2 to age-5 with four year classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish accounted for 32% and 51% of the gill net sample, respectively.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment.  Recent Yellow Perch growth could be classified as above average for this lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net which was below the lake's normal range and the second lowest catch rate on record.  Black Crappie were not sampled in TN's in either 2014 or 2016.  The 2018 TN Black Crappie was 11.7 inches long.  Trap nets had not sampled moderate numbers of Black Crappie since 1983 (5.5/net).  Trap net catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 22.6/net with an average of 3.4.  This suggests that trap nets in August don't do a good job of sampling Black Crappie at Washington Lake; future plans call for additional panfish netting in the spring which may better assess given size structure and age and growth derivatives of Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (56) for a catch rate of 3.7/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2017 LMP's long range goal (>2.6/GN) was met.  The record high catch rate in 2016 (14.5/GN) seems to have quickly dwindled from natural or angling mortality.  Gill net catch rates from 1957 to 2018 (n=15) were generally low, ranging from 1.2 to 14.5/net with an average of 5.5.  In 2018, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.8 to 14.9 inches long with an average of 8.9.  Approximately 45% of the GN catch was 10 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Only one Black Crappie was aged (otolith) in 2018.  The 14.9 inch long fish was found to be age-8.  The GN size distribution indicated that at least four age classes were present.  Catch rates indicated inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (534) for a catch rate of 35.6/net which was above the lake's normal range and the highest ever measured at Washington.  The 2017 LMP's Bluegill long range goal (maintain presence) was met in 2018.  The 2016 catch rate was 22.1/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=15) ranged from 0.2 to 35.6/net, with an average of 14.2.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 3.2 to 8.9 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Only 7% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  Data indicated a relatively poor size structure, dominated (93%) by fish less than 7 inches in length.  The TN size distribution indicated fairly consistent recruitment in recent years. Future spring panfish assessments will better assess size structure, as well as age and growth, of Bluegill in Lake Washington.   <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, the standard gear for sampling Largemouth Bass, was not conducted in 2018.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (5) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 6.9 to 18.9 inches long with an average of 15.7.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (17) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 1.1/net which was within the lake's normal range.  Gill netted Largemouth Bass were 6.0 to 18.1 inches long with an average of 13.1.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.  The 2017 LMP's Largemouth Bass long range goal (maintain presence) was met. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Smallmouth Bass (34) for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was within the lake's normal range and the second highest catch ever recorded at Washington.  The 2016 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=16) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 2.7/net with an average of 0.8.  Relative abundance increased dramatically in the 2000's and 2010's (average of 1.7/GN), when compared to the 1950 through 1990's time period (average of 0.1/GN).  In 2018, gill netted Smallmouth Bass were 5.9 to 19.9 inches long with an average of 14.9.  In 2018, Smallmouth Bass were aged using scales and otoliths, to gain better age and growth data on this species.  Smallmouth Bass were age-1 to age-8 with eight year classes present.  Age-4 Smallmouth Bass were most abundant, accounting for 42% of the aged fish.  Age-2 fish, second most abundant, accounted for 18% of the aged fish.  In 2018, growth for age-4 fish was moderate.  Recruitment did not appear to be consistent.  The 2017 LMP's Smallmouth Bass long range goal (maintain presence) was met. Angling interest in the Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass fisheries at Lake Washington and Stella in the form of permitted fishing tournaments and club bass leagues has increased within the same time period as abundance has increased.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and trap nets failed to sample Channel Catfish in 2018.  The 2012, 2014, and 2016 GN catch rates were all 0.1/net (1 fish each year).  This species' abundance was likely very low in Washington Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (9) for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2016 TN catch rate was 0.1/net.  Historic catch rates (n=15) were variable, ranging from 0.1 to 15.7/net with an average of 2.1.  Trap net catch rates have been below the lake's normal range since the 1979 survey.  In 2018, TN Common Carp were 9.3 to 32.6 inches long with an average of 18.2.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (7) for a catch rate of 0.5/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates (n=14), dating back to 1957 were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 1.4/net with an average of 0.5.  In 2018, GN Common Carp were 8.7 to 32.4 inches long with an average of 19.3. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (14) for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was below the lake's normal range as was the 2016 catch rate (2.6/net).  The last time that Black Bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers was in the 2004 assessment (51.2/GN).  Historic GN catch rates from 1951 through 2018 (n=16) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 51.2/net with an average of 6.7.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.2 to 15.3 inches long with an average of 11.4.  Black Bullhead were not sampled in trap nets in 2014, 2016 or 2018, which tied the record low catch from 1951 (0.0/TN).  Historic Black Bullhead TN catch rates have been below the lake's normal range 12 out of 14 surveys (86%).  At Washington Lake, gill nets continued to do a better job of sampling Black Bullhead.   <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard GN and TN's included; Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nSeining (0.25\" mesh) sampled 15 species (plus Hybrid Sunfish); Iowa Darter (1), Johnny Darter (5), Banded Killifish (191), Blacknose Shiner (4), Bluegill (293), Bluntnose Minnow (405), Brook Silverside (8), Green Sunfish (2), Hybrid Sunfish (17), Log Perch (1), Mimic Shiner (59), Spottail Shiner (130),and Yellow Perch (49).  Young of the year species sampled were; Bluegill (67), Hybrid Sunfish (1), Largemouth Bass (25), Northern Pike (1), Smallmouth Bass (2), and Yellow Perch (381).  This could indicate that a substantial year class of Yellow Perch was produced in 2018.   <br> \n</p>",

During the summer, the oxygen concentrations are nearly the same at the surface and the bottom. <br> \nThe lake, as evidenced by the 1957 test netting, contains a high population level of walleyes, moderate black crappies, bluegills, bullheads, carp and perch and a low level of northern pike.  The growth rate is about normal for all species checked. <br> \nShoreline seining indicates good natural reproduction for bluegills and average for bass, crappies, and perch.  It is not yet possible to fully determine the value of walleye stocking, except that year-classes are present in years of no stocking. <br> \nIn the surveys from 1947, 1951, and 1957 are indications of some changes in species composition.  The most significant is the increase in bluegill.  There has been a decrease in the carp population, which is substantiated by rough fish removal records.  The past history of carp population is one of great fluctuations with no definite trends.  If reductions can be made, and kept in the carp population, bluegills and crappies should increase.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Washington is the largest fishing lake in Meeker County with a surface area of 2,639 acres.  The lake basin is shallow with numerous small bars and mid-lake humps.  By mid-summer, most of the lake basin is covered with submerged vegetation.  These characteristics make Lake Washington a good producer of bluegill and black crappie, as well as being a consistently good walleye lake.     During the summer of 1993, DNR fisheries crews used trapnets, gillnets and an electrofishing boat to survey the fish population in Lake Washington.  Survey results indicated that anglers can expect this lake to provide excellent fishing for 1994 and beyond.     Walleye are very abundant and a wide size range of fish are present.  Catch rates in gillnets averaged 41 walleye per net, which is approximately 8 times the average for lakes similar in physical characteristics to Lake Washington.  Walleye catch rates have risen steadily over the last ten years (7 per gillnet in 1983 and 20 per net in 1988).     The abundant walleye population is probably the result of fry stocking that has been done every year from 1983 to 1991, but naturally reproduced walleye may also contribute to the population.  In 1992 walleye fry were not stocked.  This \"skip\" year will allow fisheries crews to assess possible contributions of naturally reproduced walleye.  The current management plan calls for walleye fry to be stocked in 1995, 1997 and 1999.     The average length of walleye sampled in gillnets this year was 13.2 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled were 2 to 3 years old and had excellent growth rates.  The large 1991 year class should provide excellent fishing in upcoming years.     Bluegill and black crappie are about average in number for lakes similar to Washington, but the average size of these species was greater than in most area lakes.  Bluegill averaged 6.1 inches, but good numbers of 8 inch and longer fish were also present in testnet samples.  Seven age classes of bluegill were present, indicating consistent reproduction that should provide stable fishing success for bluegill.     Black crappie were slightly below average in number, but have shown an increase since the last survey in 1988.  Most of the black crappie were over 9 inches, with an average length of 9.7 inches.  As in most area lakes, black crappie numbers tend to fluctuate according to the size of individual year classes.  Natural reproduction of black crappie is highly dependant on lake conditions at the time of spawning and the survival rate of young fish.     Northern pike have shown a downward trend since 1983.  Low water levels and poor spawning conditions in the late 1980's have contributed to poor northern pike populations.  This has been evident in most area lakes, but the return of normal water levels will likely help northern pike populations recover.  Young northern pike (1 and 2 year olds) were present in testnets and are a good indication that these populations are on the increase.</p>",

Growth is average among this sample with the majority being age III, IV, and V individuals, 14-19 inches in length.  Northern pike were somewhat less abundant at 2/gillnet and all of the fish captured were greater than or equal to 16 inches in length.  Bluegill were taken at a rate of 20/trapnet and many were six inches or more in length, with average growth rates.  White crappies (18/trapnet) were more plentiful in the sample than black crappies (4/trapnet).  Several thousand crappies died from apparent summer-kill in Lake Washington during summer 1979.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present.  Roughfish populations appear to be at low levels.  Catch rates for carp, black bullhead, and yellow bullheads are below local average catch rates.  Shoreline seining revealed young of the year presence for largemouth bass sunfish.  Various minnows, shiners and yellow perch are available as forage.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington Lake, Meeker county, is a 2,639-acre lake that was surveyed during the week of July 26, 1999.  A population assessment was conducted using standard gill nets, trap nets, and spring night-time electrofishing techniques.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike.  Gill nets sampled 210 walleye, for a catch rate of 14.0 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 7.4 to 27.7 inches and had an average length of 10.8 inches.  Approximately 2/3 of the fish sampled were between 8.5 and 10 inches.Gill nets sampled 128 northern pike, for a catch rate of 8.5 per net.  Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 31.7 inches and had an average length of 19.6 inches.Trap nets sampled 266 bluegill, for a catch rate of 17.7 per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.1 to 8.1 inches and had an average length of 5.6 inches.Trap nets sampled 16 black crappie, for a catch rate of 1.1 fish per net.  Catch rates have ranged from almost 0 up to 5 fish per lift in past assessments.  Fish ranged in size from 8.7 to 11.7 inches and had an average length of 9.7 inches.  Although nice sized, black crappie have never been overly abundant in this lake.Spring electrofishing, on May 10, 1999, captured 27 largemouth bass and 1 smallmouth bass.  Largemouth ranged in length from 3.2 to 18.3 and had an average length of 12.3 inches.  The smallmouth was 4.8 inches long.  Good oppertunities exist for largemouth bass anglers, including a few bonus smallies.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington Lake was designated infested with Eurasian watermilfoil in 1999. The plant spread prolifically and formed dense mats around the lake, was subject to some herbicidal treatments in subsequent years, and as recently as 2014 and 2016 has been at nearly undetectable levels around the lake. Monitoring efforts for the specie continue. In 2015, zebra mussels were discovered in the lake. Lakeshore owners retrieving their docks in the fall of 2016 report that the mussels are increasing as their dock structures were covered in adjoined mussel shells. What impact the filter-feeding organisms will have on the lake's fish populations and food web relationships is unknown. One concern with zebra mussels and increasing water transparency is the idea of thermal-optical habitat area loss. Too much transparency could change the ecology of the lake and resulting habitat conditions could favor species other than walleye, the present primary fisheries management specie. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted at Washington in 2016 to monitor the lake's fish population.  In 2016, a total of 22 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill and trap nets, by spring night-time electrofishing, or with traditional (0.25\") shoreline seining.  The lake was well mixed on 7/25/16, with oxygen near the surface being 9.1 mg/l, and 7.7 mg/l just off the bottom.  Water clarity was poor (2.9 feet) due to an algae bloom.  Neascus parasites (black spot), which are common throughout Minnesota, were observed on Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (143) for a catch rate of 9.5/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The 2012 and 2014 catch rates were similar at 9.5 and 8.3/net, respectively.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=15), under various stocking regimes, were variable, ranging from 2.2 to 41.2/net with an average of 13.9.  The latest stocking regime (2,266,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 1991.  Gill net catch rates during this regime (1999, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016) ranged from 5.8 to 19.0/net with an average of 12.0.  In 2016, gill netted Walleye were 9.2 to 25.9 inches long with an average of 16.8.  Approximately 78% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  In 2016, Walleye were age-1 through age-15 with twelve year classes being represented.  In the gill nets, age-1's, 2's, 3's and 5's accounted for 20%, 29%, 26% and 15% of the catch, respectively.  The 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2011 year classes would all be ranked as moderate in size.  The contribution from non-stocked years (natural reproduction) was 37% of the gill net aged fish, mainly due to the substantial 2014 year class.  The contribution from fry stocked years was 63%.  It was unknown if that 63% came from the fry stocking, natural reproduction, or some combination of both.  Analysis of gill net age data, from 1991 to 2016 (n=8 assessments), indicated that only one strong year class (2006) was produced during a non-stocked year (n=12).  Fry stocked years (n=13) produced six strong year classes during that time period.  Overall, growth could be categorized at moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (67) for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 3.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=15) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.5/net with an average of 3.3.  This indicated that recruitment was low (<5/net) most years at Washington Lake.  Northern Pike were 17.4 to 32.2 inches long with an average of 24.4.  Approximately 31% of the gill net catch was 26 inches or longer, indicating a size structure with some opportunities for larger fish.  Fish were age-1 to age-6 with six age classes being present.  Growth was fast in recent years.   <br> \n   <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Yellow Perch (189) for a catch rate of 12.6/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=15) were highly variable, ranging from 0.2 to 54.7/net with an average of 12.5.  Yellow Perch were 5.1 to 9.6 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Only four fish were 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure, as far as perch anglers would be concerned.  Yellow Perch ages were estimated to be age-2 to age-6 with four year classes present.  Age-2 fish accounted for 78% of the gill net sample, indicating inconsistent recruitment and/or predation.  Recent growth could be categorized as moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets failed to sample any Black Crappie in 2016, as was the case in 2014.  These two years produced the lowest catch rates ever recorded since trap netting began in 1951.  Trap nets had not sampled good numbers of Black Crappie since 1983 (5.5/net).  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 22.6/net with an average of 3.7.  This likely indicated that trap nets, in early August, often don't do a good job of sampling Black Crappie at Washington Lake.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Black Crappie (218) for a catch rate of 14.5/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Washington and the highest ever recorded at Washington.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was the lowest on record (1.2/net).  Catch rates from 1957 to 2016 (n=14) were generally low, ranging from 1.2 to 14.5/net with an average of 5.7.  After examining many decades of data, gill nets usually did a better job of sampling Black Crappie than trap nets did.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 4.8 to 14.4 inches long with an average of 8.5.  Approximately 75 of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer, while 6% were 11 inches or longer, indicating a decent size structure.  Black Crappie were age-1 to age-8 with six year classes present.  Age-2 (2014) fish made up 91% of the sample, indicating a strong year class that averaged 8.2 inches in late July, 2016.  That year class should be at least 9 inches long by the spring of 2017.  Growth was moderate.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (331) for a catch rate of 22.1/net which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The 2014 catch rate was 9.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 0.2 to 23.9/net, with an average of 12.7.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 3.4 to 8.2 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Approximately 21% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, but only 6% were 7 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled Bluegill up to 9.1 inches in length.  Bluegill were age-2 to age-8 with seven year classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were well represented accounting for 38% and 53% of the trap netted fish, respectively.  Growth was considered moderate.      <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass, sampled low numbers (16) of fish for a catch rate of 10.7/hr.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 11.6/hr.  Historic catch rates (n=9), from 1993 to 2016, were variable, ranging from 8.7 to 40.1/hr. with an average of 16.7.  Largemouth Bass were 4.9 to 17.3 inches long with an average of 12.3.  Largemouth Bass were age-1 to age-8 with eight year classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Electrofishing on Washington may not be as effective as it is on other lakes, due to an abundance of offshore emergent and submergent vegetation.  Anecdotal reports from anglers (especially bass fishing clubs) mention Washington Lake as having a quality Largemouth Bass fishery.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Smallmouth Bass (27) for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The 2014 catch rate was at 2.7/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2016 (n=15) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 2.7/net with an average of 0.7.  Relative abundance increased in the 2000's, when compared to the 1950 through 1990's time period.  In 2016, gill netted Smallmouth Bass were 8.9 to 19.7 inches long with an average of 15.6. Approximately 67% of the catch was 16 inches or longer, indicating a high quality size structure.  Spring night time electrofishing sampled low numbers (2) of Smallmouth Bass, as is usually the case, for a catch rate of 1.3/hr.  The 2014 catch rate was also low (1.7/hr.).  Historic spring electrofishing catch rates (n=9) were mostly low, ranging from 0.4 to 9.4/hr. with an average of 3.6.  Electrofished Smallmouth Bass were 4.2 and 17.0 inches long.  Smallmouth Bass were age-1 to age-9 with seven year classes present.  Recruitment was somewhat inconsistent. <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net.  This was also the catch rate in 2012 and 2014.  The 2016 fish was 17.1 inches long.  It was unknown how this fish ended up in Washington Lake, but it likely immigrated up Washington Creek and swam over the outlet dam during a high water event.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (2) for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The 2016 and 2014 catch rates tied the record low from 2008.  Historic catch rates (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.1 to 15.7/net with an average of 2.2.  Trap net catch rates have been below the normal range since the 1979 survey.  Trap netted Common Carp were 20.1 and 27.4 inches long.  Gill nets sampled 0 Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.0/net which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.   Historic gill net catch rates, dating back to 1957, ranged from 0.0 to 1.4/net with an average of 0.5. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (39) for a catch rate of 2.6/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Washington.  The catch was also low in 2014 (1.8/net).  The last time that Black Bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers was in the 2004 assessment (51.2/gill net).  Historic catch rates from 1951 through 2016 (n=15) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 51.2/net with an average of 7.1.  Black Bullhead were 5.0 to 14.9 inches long with an average of 10.4.  Black Bullhead were not sampled in trap nets in 2016 or 2014, which tied the record low from 1951.  Historic Black Bullhead trap net catch rates have been below the normal range 11 out of 13 times (85%) at Washington Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gill and trap nets included; Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nSeining (0.25\" mesh) sampled 12 species; Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Silverside, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Log Perch, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Young of the year species sampled were; Bluegill (11), Bluntnose Minnow (2), Largemouth Bass (7), Smallmouth Bass (1), White Sucker (1), and Yellow Perch (433). <br> \n</p>",

It has been surveyed in 1938, 1940, and 1947.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake and drainage basin characteristics are as follows: Its area is 2,407 acres; maximum depth of 20 feet; and over half of the area is less than 10 feet deep.  One inlet from Stella and Manuella Lakes flows at a rate of 3 cubic feet per second.  The outlet, with a flow of 10 cubic feet per second drains into the North Fork of the Crow River. <br> \n <br> \nThe physical and chemical conditions are as follows: The turbid brown water was well mixed top to bottom at the time of the survey.  Water temperature varied only slightly throughout its depth.  Sufficient oxygen for fish life was found at all depths.  The water alkalinity is 162 parts per million. <br> \n <br> \n17 species of aquatic plants have been identified in past surveys including sago pondweed, bushy pondweed and arrowhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo determine the condition of the fish population 7 gillnet and 9 trapnet sets were made.  24 species of fish have been taken from this lake.  The catch was as follows: carp, perch, walleye, and black crappie were above normal in abundance; suckers and northern pike were about average; and dogfish, bullhead, bluegill, white crappie and largemouth bass were low in abundance.  There appeared to be a decrease in the white crappie population since the last survey whereas the carp, perch, walleye and black crappie increased. <br> \n <br> \nSpawning conditions were found to be fair for panfish, poor to fair for northern pike and good for walleye.  Natural reproduction of perch, bluegill and black crappie were found in shallow seining. <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake is considered to be a walleye type of lake from the fish management standpoint and will be managed toward the maintenance of good walleye population. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Washington Lake beginning on July 22, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1991 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Washington is a class 41 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2017 lake management plan (LMP) listed Walleye as primary management species at Washington Lake.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 17 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The lake was well mixed, with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 9.5 mg/l just off the bottom, in late July.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 3.3 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Smallmouth Bass, were aged for this survey.  Public shore fishing opportunities were limited to the public accesses on the south and east sides of the lake.  Washington Lake was listed at being infested with Eurasian Watermilfoil in 1999 and Zebra Mussel in 2015.  Anglers should drain water from their boats and remove plant fragments from their trailers, to make sure they were not transporting any aquatic invasive species.  Washington was part of a three-year study (2019 to 2021), on the Washington, Stella, Manuella chain of lakes, designed to estimate angler exploitation of Walleye.  Walleye were marked with a jaw tags during an ice-out trap netting and ice-out electrofishing survey and summer gill netted fish were examined for tags for a population estimate.  Spring trap netting, targeting Black Crappie and Bluegill occurred at Washington in 2019.  Fall electrofishing, targeting young of the year and yearling Walleye, was conducted at Washington in 2019.  Fall gill netting, targeting Walleye, was also conducted at Washington this year.  A fall research survey, using nighttime electrofishing and experimental fine mesh gill nets targeting Yellow Perch, was also conducted in 2019.  Standard survey frequency was increased to every other year in 2012, to more closely monitor the Washington Lake fish population.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Largemouth Bass (27) for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  In 2019, the 2017 LMP Largemouth Bass long-range goal (maintain presence) was met.  Gill netted Largemouth Bass were 5.6 to 17.9 inches long, averaging 11.7 inches.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (9) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 5.6 to 7.5 inches long.  Bass anglers know Washington to be a quality bass fishery. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (<5/GN) of Northern Pike (10) for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and was the second lowest catch ever recorded at Washington.  The 2017 LMP's long-range goal (1.6 to 4.5/GN/net) was not met.  The 2018 catch rate was also low at 2.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=17) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.5/net, averaging 3.1/net.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low at Washington Lake.  In 2019, gill netted Northern Pike were 21.9 to 33.1 inches long with an impressive average length of 26.9 inches, indicating that quality sized fish were present. Washington was included in the 2018 Northern Pike North Central Management Zone regulation area, which had a 22 to 26 inch protected slot limit (PSL), with a ten fish bag limit (8 below and 2 above).  The PSL regulation was designed to allow more harvest of abundant small pike and to shift the population size structure to more medium sized fish.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Smallmouth Bass (31) for a catch rate of 2.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and was tied for the third highest ever measured at Washington Lake.  The 2018 GN catch rate was similar at 2.3/net.  The 2017 LMP's goal for Smallmouth Bass (maintain presence) was met.  Historic GN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=17) were all low ranging from 0.0 to 2.7/net averaging 0.9/GN.  In 2019, GN Smallmouth Bass were 7.5 to 18.3 inches long averaging 13.8 inches.  Smallmouth Bass (31 aged) were age-1 to age-9 with seven year classes being present.  Age-1 (16%), age-3 (29%), and age-5 (19%) fish, were most abundant, accounting for 64% of the aged fish.  Washington was known as one of the better Smallmouth Bass lakes in Meeker County.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets failed to sample any Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2018 TN catch rate was also low (0.1/TN).  Trap net catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=16) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 22.6/net averaging 3.2/TN.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (62) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 4.1/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  The 2017 LMP's long-range goal (>2.6/GN) was met. Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 1.2 to 14.5/net averaging 5.5/GN.  In 2019, the gill netted Black Crappie were 4.5 to 13.5 inches long, averaging 8.2 inches.  Approximately 35% of the GN catch was 10 inches or longer, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  The summer GN and TN length table distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment, with the possibility of only four year classes being present.  In 2019, spring trap netting sampled moderate numbers (222) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 4.9/TN, but water temperatures fell below the recommended 50 F some days, possibly reducing the catch.  In 2019, spring TN's (222 fish) provided the best Black Crappie sample, summer GN's provided a decent sample (62 fish), while summer TN's (0 fish) did a poor job of sampling the population.  Quality sized crappie were present for anglers seeking this species. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (728) for a catch rate of 48.5/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type and was the highest ever recorded at Washington.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 summer TN's.  The 2018 TN catch rate was similar at 35.6/net.  The 2017 LMP's Bluegill long-range goal (maintain presence) was met.  Historic TN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 0.2 to 48.5/net, averaging 16.4/TN.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 2.4 to 11.6 inches long averaging 4.3 inches.  Approximately 8% of the TN catch was 6 inches or longer, indicating a size structure dominated by small fish.  The TN size distribution table indicated that multiple year classes were present and recruitment, in recent years, was consistent.  Gill nets sampled 5 Bluegill that were 7 inches or longer, of which 2 were 8 inches or longer, indicating that a few quality sized fish were present at Washington.  Spring TN's however, sampled 1,757 Bluegill ranging in length from 2.2 to 9.7 inches, with approximately 37% of the catch being 6 inches or longer.  Spring trap netting likely provided the best description of the true Bluegill population size structure, in 2019.  Bluegill anglers may need to sort through a few little ones to get some keepers.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Walleye (37) for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and was the second lowest catch rate ever recorded at Washington.  The 2017 LMP's long-range goal for Walleye (>7.7/net) was not met.  The 2018 GN catch rate was 5.5/net, which also failed to meet the 2017 Walleye long-range goal.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=17), under various stocking regimes, were mostly moderate to high, ranging from 2.2 to 41.2/net averaging 12.7/GN.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 9.2 to 26.9 inches long averaging 17.2 inches.  Approximately 68% of the GN catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-18+, with 9 year classes present.  Only 22% of the aged fish were age-5 or older.  None of the year classes were considered strong.  The 2016 year class was considered to be moderate in size.  The other seven year classes were considered weak.  Growth was above average for age-3 fish.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 43% of the GN aged (n=37) Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring, somewhere within the Washington, Stella, Manuella chain of lakes.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate the two groups.  Gill net catch rates from 1999 to 2019 (n=9), during the 1991 stocking regime (2,266,000 fry 1 of 2 years), ranged from 2.5 to 19.0/net averaging 10.2, possibly indicating a successful stocking strategy.  The stocking regime changed in 2019 to 1,133,000 \"North Fork Crow River\" strain Walleye fry 1 in 2 years, based on recent research and New London Hatchery production capabilities.  Walleye anglers may have to do some searching, but nice sized fish were present.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Yellow Perch (100) for a catch rate of 6.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2018 GN catch rate was 2.4/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=16) were variable ranging from 0.2 to 64.0/net averaging 11.5.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were 4.9 to 8.9 inches long, averaging 6.4 inches.  Yellow Perch were age-1 to age-5 with five year classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish accounted for the majority (39% and 47%, respectively) of the sample.  Washington seldom had a perch population with fish being big enough to interest anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (45) of Yellow Bullhead for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type and was the highest catch rate ever measured at Washington.  The 2018 GN catch rate was similar at 1.9/GN.  Historic GN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=12) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 3.0/net averaging 0.8/GN.  In 2019, Yellow Bullhead were 7.2 to 14.6 inches long averaging 6.4 inches.  Approximately 22% of the GN sample was 12 inches or longer, indicating that a quality size distribution was present for bullhead fishermen. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (14) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2018 GN catch rate was also 0.9/GN.  Historic GN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=17) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 51.2/net averaging 6.4.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.4 to 13.9 inches long.  In 2019, trap nets also sampled low numbers (3) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/TN, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Black Bullhead abundance has likely been low at Washington, ever since the 2004 survey (51.2/GN).  Black Bullhead anglers may want to fish a different lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.   The trap netted Common Carp was 28.1 inches long.  Historic TN catch rates from 1951 to 2019 (n=16) were almost all low, ranging from 0.1 to 15.7/TN averaging 2.0.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (8) of Common Carp this year, for a catch rate of 0.5/net. Historic GN catch rates were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 1.4/net.  In 2019, gill netted Common Carp were 18.0 to 26.1 inches long.  Data indicated that the relative abundance of Common Carp was typically low at Washington Lake, but bow anglers should be able to find a few out there.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (2) for a catch rate of 0.1/net, tying the all-time highs set in 2012, 2014, and 2016.  The Channel Catfish were 15.1 and 22.5 inches long, possibly indicating two different year classes.  Relative abundance of Channel Catfish in Washington appears to be remaining low.  This species likely immigrated into Washington Lake, by swimming over the outlet dam during high water. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included: Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington is a large lake (2,438 acres) located south of the City of Darwin in Meeker County. A large state-owned access with paved parking and a double cement boat ramp is present on the south shore. A small state-owned access is also present at the east end of the lake. Smaller boats may also enter Washington (from Stella Lake) via a cement box culvert at the west end of the lake. Washington has approximately ten miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of seventeen feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Washington is a class 41 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Long Lake near Grove City in Meeker County and Cedar Lake in McLeod County. Washington's 2021 lake management plan listed Walleye, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass as primary management species, while Black Crappie and Bluegill were secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Walleye were netted in 2023, and fish averaged 18 inches in length. The maximum length of Walleye sampled was just over 26 inches. An impressive 84% of the catch was 17 inches or longer. Ageing data from the 2023 survey indicated that natural reproduction of Walleye was substantial at Washington Lake. The oldest Walleye was age-16.  <br> \n <br> \nLower numbers of Smallmouth Bass were netted, with fish averaging 17 inches in length. The longest Smallmouth Bass captured was 18.6 inches.  Low numbers of Largemouth Bass were netted, but that species typically does not sample well in gill nets. Largemouth Bass averaged 13 inches in length, with the longest fish being 19 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nRecord low numbers of Black Crappie were gill netted in 2023, and average size was 8.6 inches in length. However, Black Crappie up to 13.9 inches were found to be present at Washington Lake. Record high numbers of Bluegill, for Washington Lake, were gill netted in 2023. However, sunfish populations typically do not sample well in this gear. Most of the Bluegill were small, averaging 4.2 inches in length. The longest Bluegill sampled was just under 8 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 23 inches in length. The longest pike sampled was 34.7 inches. Approximately 33% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. Northern Pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats, population abundances and size structures. Three management zones were established for Northern Pike, with their own bag limit and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone, where Washington Lake is found, anglers can keep ten Northern Pike. Only two can be longer than 26 inches and all pike from 22 to 26 inches long must be immediately released. This zone regulation is meant to decrease numbers of small Northern Pike and increase the abundance of medium and large sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fish varieties sampled in the 2023 gill nets included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Washington Lake has two AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussel. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill nets, trap nets and shoreline seining were used to sample the Washington Lake fish population in 2004.  Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  Eurasian Watermilfoil was first discovered in Washington Lake in 1999.  It has since become abundant, with dense beds being found all around the lake.  Over 30 native aquatic plant species were also sampled in 2004.  The lake's shoreline is highly developed and the surrounding watershed is dominated by agricultural row crops.  Moderate numbers (5.8/net) of walleye were gill netted in 2004 compared to the high numbers (19.0/net) sampled in 2001.  Walleye were 13.3-21.7 inches long averaging 16.5 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Washington Lake.  Naturally reproduced walleye accounted for at least 36% of the gill net sample.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted.  Pike were 13.9-27.8 inches long averaging 22.8 inches.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were trap netted, but most of the fish were small.  Bluegill averaged 5.3 inches in length.  Approximately 22% of the bluegill trap netted were 6 inches or longer.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were gill netted.  Black crappie were 4.2-12.0 inches long averaging 6.1 inches.  Approximately 10% of the black crappie gill netted were 8 inches or longer.  Only 1 smallmouth bass was gill netted in 2004 compared to the 32 sampled in 2001.  That fish was 15.9 inches long and 3 years old.  Spring night-time electrofishing is the standard gear for sampling largemouth bass, but was not conducted in 2004.  However, trap nets sampled moderate numbers of largemouth bass ranging in size from 9.2-14.5 inches.  Only 3 yellow perch were gill netted in 2004 and they averaged 5.5 inches.  The 2004 black bullhead catch rate was the highest ever measured at Washington Lake indicating moderate numbers to be present.  Moderate numbers of carp were also sampled averaging 20.9 inches.  Anglers can help slow the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes by removing all plant fragements from their boat, motor and trailer when leaving the lake.   </p>",

A total of 16 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 267 walleye for a catch rate of 17.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 5.8/net.  Walleye were 7.3 to 23.3 inches long averaging 13.2 inches.  Approximately 12% of the gill netted walleye were less than 10 inches in length.  Walleye were 1 to 9 years old with 9 year-classes present.  The 2007 year-class (age 1) accounted for 57% of the gill net sample and would be considered strong.  The latest stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1991.  Approximately 29% of the walleye gill netted came from non-stocked years, documenting natural reproduction.  Gill net catch rates during the latest regime (2008, 2004, 2001, 1999) ranged from 5.8 to 19.0/net, averaging 14.1/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 24 northern pike for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2004 catch rate was 2.1/net.  Catch rates (n=4) have been declining since the 1999 assessment.  Northern pike were 16.3 to 34.1 inches long averaging 22.2 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 27 yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.2/net.  Yellow perch were 4.9 to 8.4 inches long averaging 6.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 29 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.1/net.  Smallmouth bass were 7.2 to 18.7 inches long averaging 13.9 inches.  Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 15 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 5.6/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2006 was 1.1/hr.  Electrofished smallmouth bass were 5.0 to 18.0 inches long averaging 7.6 inches.  Smallmouth bass were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 33 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 12.4/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2006 was 29.6/hr.  Historic catch rates (n=6) ranged from 8.7 to 40.1/hr, averaging 18.3/hr.  Catch rates (n=3) have been decreasing since the 2002 assessment.  Largemouth bass were 3.1 to 18.6 inches long averaging 12.6 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 9 years old with 9 year-classes present.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 8 carp for a catch rate of 0.53/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was virtually indenticle at 0.6/net.  High numbers of carp have not been trap netted since 1974.  Carp were 23.3 to 31.5 inches long averaging 28.1 inches.  The trap net catch rate was also low at 0.1/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 62 black bullhead for a catch rate of 4.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 51.2/net.  Black bullhead were 9.8 to 13.4 inches long averaging 11.5 inches.  The trap net catch rate was also low at 1.0/net.  Trap nets sampled 16 yellow bullhead.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 11 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.5/net.  Black crappie were 4.8 to 7.8 inches long averaging 6.4 inches.  Gill nets sampled 57 black crappie for a catch rate of 3.8/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.4 to 14.7 inches long averaging 6.5 inches.  The 2004 catch rate was 3.3/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 123 bluegill for a catch rate of 8.2/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of Washington's type.  The 2004 catch rate was 12.8/net.  Bluegill were 0.4 to 7.8 inches long averaging 5.2 inches.  Approximately 7% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled 3 fish that were 8 inches or longer.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington is a large lake (2,266 acres) located near Darwin, in Meeker County.  A large state owned access, with a double cement boat ramp, is present on the south shore.  A small state owned access, with a cement boat ramp, is located at the east end of the lake.  Washington has 10 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Washington is a class 41 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Cedar and Jennie.      <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake appears to be changing (increases in water clarity and submerged plant abundance) and so may some of the fish populations.  Historically, good numbers of Walleye were typically sampled at Washington Lake, but this was not the case in 2020.  The 2020 gill net catch rate indicated that low numbers were present, but keeper sized fish were available (averaging 15 inches in length).  The maximum length for Walleye was 24 inches.  Don't expect to catch tons of Northern Pike at Washington either, but if you do it will probably be a decent one.  In 2020, Northern Pike averaged 24 inches in length.  Fair numbers of Black Crappie were sampled in 2020, but anglers may need to do some searching for this elusive species.  However, big crappie are present (maximum length was 14 inches this year) at Washington Lake. Anglers can expect decent Bluegill action, but they can also be hard to find in this large and shallow lake, with abundant vegetation. Bass anglers know that Washington has both decent numbers and nice sizes of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass.  The maximum lengths for Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass sampled in 2020 were 20 and 19 inches, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussel are now present in Washington Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing! <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington is a larger sized lake (2,438 acres) located south of the City of Darwin in Meeker County. Washington has ten miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. A state owned public access, with two cement boat ramps, and a large amount of parking is present on the south shore. A small state owned public access, with a cement ramp, is present on the east end of the lake. Parking is limited at the eastern access. Access can also be gained via the inlet culvert from Stella Lake, under County Highway 14 on the western shore, when water levels are adequate. Water clarity is fair and submergent vegetation is plentiful at Washington.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring daytime electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass, was completed at Stella Lake on May 21, 2021. Bass species were measured, and age and growth information was collected from Largemouth Bass, which is lacking from lakes in the southern part of Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Largemouth Bass were collected during the electrofishing survey, with fish averaging 10 inches in length. Many smaller sized Largemouth Bass were captured in this assessment, but fish up to 19 were also found to be present. Largemouth Bass were age-1 to age-19 with 9 year classes present. Largemouth Bass recruitment appeared to be somewhat inconsistent at Washington. Low numbers of Smallmouth Bass were captured, but this species has rarely been sampled well with the electrofishing gear at Washington. Smallmouth Bass were 4 to 15 inches long. Washington is one of the more popular bass fishing lakes in Meeker County, for both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass. Bass fishing clubs often visit Washington Lake because of its history of producing good numbers of nice sized bass. Twitching crankbaits, slow-rolling spinner baits, buzz baits and a jig-and-a-pig will all take Washington bass. Fishing the lake's bulrush beds can be productive, as can flipping jigs under the deeper docks. A leech under a bobber is another tried-and-true method of catching Washington Lake bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Washington Lake has the AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussel. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

A total of 127 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 95.3/hour, which was the fifth highest catch rate ever recorded at Washington and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (> 79.8). The 2022 year class appears strong in abundance. In 2022, the mean length for YOY was 7.6 inches, which was within Washington's historical third quartile (6.9 to 7.6), indicating moderate growth (within the inter-quartile range) for this lake. In 2022, no yearlings were sampled.</p>",

Electrofishing sampled 119 YWAE for a catch rate of 51.0/hour.  The 2017 YWAE year class would likely be considered moderate in size.  Young of the year Walleye had an average length of 6.0 inches indicating that growth was slow this year for Washington Lake.  The latest stocking regime (2,266,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 1991.  Catch rates, for YWAE, from 1993 to 2017 (n=22) ranged from 0.0 to 126.2/hour with an average of 43.1.  Catch rates from stocked years (n=12) ranged from 1.1 to 108.8/hour with an average of 61.5.  Catch rates from non-stocked years (n=10) ranged from 0.0 to 126.2/hour with an average of 21.1.  With a mean that was almost three times higher, fry stocking is having a positive influence on YWAE abundance at Washington Lake.  However, a definitive answer cannot be reached because of the inability to differentiate stocked fish from naturally reproduced fish during years when Walleye fry are stocked.  Of interest, the highest fall electrofishing catch rate ever recorded at Washington (126.2/hour) occurred during a non-stocked year (1998).  Natural reproduction during non-stocked years was documented 8 out of 10 times (80%), but only one of those YWAE year classes (1998) was considered to be exceptionally strong (126.2/hour).  It is likely that stocking would be required to maintain a quality Walleye fishery at Washington Lake.  Electrofishing sampled low numbers (9) of YRLWAE for a catch rate 3.9/hour, likely indicating that the 2016 year class was still weak.  In 2017, the YRLWAE mean length was 12.5 inches, indicating fast growth.  Washington was designated as being infested with Zebra Mussel in 2015.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Washington in 2014 to monitor the lake's physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.  In 2014, a total of 14 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nSubmergent vegetation was unusually plentiful in 2014.  Plant transect sampling documented 16 varieties of submergent vegetation, of which 5 (Bushy Pondweed, Clasping-leaf Pondweed, Illinois Pondweed, Variable-leaf Pondweed, and Water Celery) were rated as common.  During the last resurvey in 2004, Eurasian Watermilfoil (aquatic invasive plant species) was the only submergent vegetation variety ranked as common, with dense beds being found across much of the lake.  Only one small fragment of Eurasian Watermilfoil was found floating, between two transects, during the 2014 survey.  The reason for this drastic change in abundance was unknown.  Chara, a type of advanced algae that has a musky odor, was also rated as being common and occurred at 98% of the vegetation transects.  The maximum depth at which rooted vegetation was found was 9.6 feet.  Sand and silt were the most plentiful shoalwater substrates, and both were rated as being common.  The lake was well mixed on 7/28/14, with oxygen near the surface being 8.2 mg/l and 7.8 mg/l just off the bottom.  Water clarity was poor to fair (3.0') due to an algae bloom.  Washington's lakeshed was large (22,578 acres) and dominated by row crop agriculture (corn and soybeans).  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 9:1.  Washington's shoreline was heavily developed with homes, cabins, and trailers accounting for roughly 85% of the entire shoreline.   <br> \n   <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Walleye (125) for a catch rate of 8.3/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2012 catch rate was similar at 9.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 2.2 to 41.2/net with an average of 14.2.  The latest stocking regime of 1,000 fry/littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet deep) every other year was initiated in 1991.  Gill net catch rates during this regime (1999, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2014) ranged from 5.8 to 19.0/net with an average of 12.4.   In 2014, gill netted Walleye were 9.5 to 24.5 inches long with an average of 16.3.  Approximately 62% of the gill net sample was 17 inches or longer, indicating a quality size distribution.  In 2014, Walleye were age-1 through age-13 with eleven year-classes being represented.  In the gill nets, age-1 and age-3 fish made up approximately 32% and 47% of the catch, respectively.  The 2011 year-class was the only year-class that would be considered strong, but the 2013 year-class was also substantial in size.  The contribution from non-stocked years, to the total catch in 2014, was only 6% of the gill net aged fish.  It was unknown what portion of the stocked year fish came from natural reproduction or stocking.  Contribution from non-stocked years, from the latest six assessments (1999-2014) ranged from 6% to 36% of the gill net catch, averaging 19.5%, indicating that over 80% of the fish sampled matched up with years when fry were stocked.  Analysis of gill net age data from the 1991 to 2014 assessments (n=8) indicated that only 1 strong year-class (2006) was produced during a non-stocked year (n=11).  This likely meant that the Washington Lake Walleye fishery was dependent upon stocking.  In 2014, Walleye reached 16.1 inches in length after three years of growth.  This data indicated that growth was fast.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (52) for a catch rate of 3.5/net, which was slightly below the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2012 catch rate was similar, at 3.8/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 8.5/net with an average of 3.2.  This indicated that recruitment was poor most years at Washington Lake.  Northern Pike were 7.9 to 33.9 inches long with an average of 23.0.  Fish that were aged were age-0 to age-4 with four age-classes being present.  Growth was typical for Washington Lake Northern Pike.  Approximately 92% of the gill net catch was between 21.0 and 26.9 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (63) for a catch rate of 4.2/net, which was just inside the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was over 10 times lower at 0.4/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=14) were generally low, ranging from 0.2 to 54.7/net with an average of 12.5.  Yellow perch were 4.4 to 6.5 inches long with an average of 5.8.  Yellow Perch ages were estimated to be age-1, age-2, and age-3.  Age-2 fish accounted for 97% of the gill net sample, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was slightly below the Washington Lake 20 year average. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets failed to sample any Black Crappie in 2014.  This was the lowest catch rate ever recorded since trap netting began in 1951.  The 2012 catch rate was also very low (0.6/net).  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=13) were mostly low, ranging from 0 to 22.6/net with an average of 4.0.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (18) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was the lowest on record.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2014 (n=13) were generally low, ranging from 1.2 to 11.4/net with an average of 5.0.  Gill netted black crappie were 5.0 to 13.5 inches long with an average of 9.5.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (142) for a catch rate of 9.5/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 17.0/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=13) ranged from 0.2 to 23.9/net, with an average of 12.0.  In 2014, trap netted bluegill were 1.9 to 7.3 inches long with an average of 4.6.  Only 3% (4 fish) of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Approximately 15% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass, sampled low to moderate numbers (27) of fish for a catch rate of 11.6/hr.  The 2012 catch rate was 17.3/hr.  Historic catch rates (n=8) were variable, ranging from 8.7 to 40.1/hr with an average of 17.4.  Largemouth bass were 12.8 to 19.1 inches long with an average of 15.3.  Approximately 93% of the electrofishing catch was between 13.0 and 17.9 inches long, which should appeal to Largemouth Bass anglers.  Electrofishing on Washington may not be as effective as it is on other lakes, due to an abundance of offshore submergent vegetation.  Anecdotal reports from bass fishing clubs mention Washington Lake as having a quality Largemouth Bass fishery.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Smallmouth Bass (41) for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 catch rate was the highest ever recorded at Washington Lake.  The 2012 catch rate was at 1.3/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2014 (n=14) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 2.7/net with an average of 0.6.  Relative abundance increased dramatically in the 2000's, when compared to the 1950's through the 1990's.  Gill netted smallmouth bass were 14.5 to 19.5 inches long with an average of 16.4.  Approximately 93% of the gill net sample was 15 inches or longer, indicating a high quality size structure.  Spring night time electrofishing sampled low numbers (4) of Smallmouth Bass, as is usually the case at Washington, for a catch rate of 1.7/hr.  The 2012 catch rate was 9.4/hr.  Historic spring electrofishing catch rates (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.4 to 9.4/hr with an average of 3.8.  Electrofished Smallmouth Bass were 10.0 to 16.6 inches long with an average of 13.9.  Gill netting, electrofishing, and trap netting (1 @ 6.5 inches in length) sampled a wide range of lengths of Smallmouth Bass, indicating that a somewhat healthy population was present.  Recruitment did not appear to be consistent every year, based on the size range data.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net.  This was the second time that Channel Catfish were sampled in Washington Lake.  One additional Channel Catfish was sampled at Washington, in 2012.  The 2014 fish was 22.9 inches long.  It was unknown how this fish ended up in Washington Lake, but it likely immigrated up Washington Creek and swam over the outlet dam during a high water event.  Water levels were exceptionally high during the spring of 2011 and in June of 2014.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 catch rate tied the record low from 2008.  Historic catch rates (n=13) were generally low, ranging from 0.1 to 15.7/net with an average of 2.4.  Trap net catch rates have been below the normal range since the 1979 survey.  Gill nets sampled 3 Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Historic gill net catch rates, dating back to 1957, ranged from 0.0 to 1.4/net with an average of 0.6.  Gill netted Common Carp were 22.2 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 25.8.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (27) for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, as was the 2012 catch rate (0.8/net).  The last time that Black Bullhead were sampled in higher numbers was in the 2004 assessment (51.2/gill net).  Historic catch rates from 1951 through 2014 (n=14) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 51.2/net with an average of 7.4.  Black Bullhead were 10.5 to 15.0 inches long with an average of 13.1.  Black Bullhead were not sampled in trap nets in 2014, which tied the record low from 1951.  Historic Black Bullhead trap net catch rates have been below the normal range 10 out-of 12 times (83%) at Washington Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Bowfin (5), Hybrid Sunfish (6), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (2), White Sucker (5), and Yellow Bullhead (18). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington is a large lake (2,266 acres) located near Darwin in Meeker County.  A large state-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the south shore. A small state-owned access with a cement boat ramp is located at the east end of the lake. Washington has 10 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Washington is a class 41 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Cedar and Jennie.      <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake is experiencing system change (increases in water clarity and submerged plant abundance) and as the habitat has changed, the fish community is in a period of change as well. Historically, good numbers of Walleye were typically sampled at Washington Lake. This was again the case in 2021, after several years of low catches. The 2021 gill net catch rate indicated that moderate numbers were present, with fish averaging almost 15 inches in length. The maximum length for Walleye was 25 inches. Do not expect to catch high numbers of Northern Pike at Washington, but if you do catch one, it could be nice sized. In 2021, Northern Pike averaged 24 inches in length with a maximum length of 34 inches. Fair numbers of Black Crappie were sampled in 2021, but anglers may need to do some searching for this elusive species. However, big crappie are present (maximum length was 14 inches) at Washington Lake. Anglers can expect decent Bluegill action, but the bigger ones can be hard to find in this large and shallow lake with abundant offshore vegetation.  <br> \n <br> \nBass anglers know that Washington has both decent numbers and nice sizes of both largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass. The maximum lengths for Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass, sampled in 2021 summer nets, were both at 18+ inches.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil and Zebra mussel are now present in Washington Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",
