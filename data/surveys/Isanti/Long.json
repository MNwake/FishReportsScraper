                "narrative": "<p>BENCHMARK #1 IS THE NORTHWEST CORNER DIAMOND BRICK OF THE RED BRICK FIREPLACE ON MATTHEW'S PROPERTY ON THE SOUTHEAST SHORE. (THIS FIREPLACE HAS BEEN REPAIRED RECENTLY AND IS NO LONGER RELIABLE AS A BENCHMARK.) NEW - BENCHMARK #2 IS THE SPIKE IN THE SOUTH SIDE OF A POWER LINE POLE 20 FEET FROM THE WATER'S EDGE, LOCATED 30 FEET NORTH OF THE OUTLET CHANNEL DAM. CURLYLEAF PONDWEED IS PRESENT IN ABUNDANCE AROUND MUCH OF THE LAKE. TWO COMMON LOONS, ONE ADULT BALD EAGLE AND SEVEN GREAT BLUE HERONS SIGHTED DURING THE FIELD WORK. THERE WERE 200 HOMES/CABINS, 40 SEASONAL TRAILERS, 265 BOATS AND 4 JET SKIS COUNTED ON THE LAKE. A POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED IN JULY OF 1989 ON LONG LAKE. SIX GILLNETS AND SIX TRAPNETS WERE SET IN ORDER TO GATHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION. IN ADDITION, SHORE- LINE SEINING WAS CONDUCTED IN MID-AUGUST TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF THE SPECIES FOUND IN THE LAKE. BASED ON RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS AND OTHER DATA THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS FOLLOWS: THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH INDICATES A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1984. THOUGH THE CATCH REMAINS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 3.50/SET/ THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGED FROM 22.0 TO 33.9 INCHES WITH THE 25.0-25.9 INCH LENGTH GROUP BEING THE MEDIAN AS COMPARED TO A 20.0-20.9 INCH MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP IN 1984. AN INCREASE IN FISH SIZE IS ALSO MADE EVIDENT BY THE 4.29 PD MEAN WEIGHT FOUND IN 1989 AS COMPARED TO 1.76 PDS FOUND IN 1984 AGE GROUPS V-IX WERE REPRESENTED BY THE TWENTY-FOUR NORTHERN PIKE AGED. THESE FISH EXHIBITED GROWTH RATES IN THE NORMAL RANGE WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH HAS ALSO SHOWN A REAL DE- CREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, AND IS ALSO BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 2.73/SET. PAST INVESTI- GATIONS INDICATE THE WALLEYE NET CATCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN EXCEPT IN 1974 WHEN THE CATCH WAS 15.00/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FROM THE RECENT SURVEY RANGED FROM 22.0-22.9 INCHES. THE RANGE HAD BEEN MUCH WIDER IN 1984 WHICH INDICATES THE PRESENT POPULATION IS OLDER. THE SIX WALLEYES AGED DURING THE RECENT SURVEY DEMONSTRATE THE OLD AGE OF THE POPULATION WITH ONLY AGE GROUPS VIII, X, AND XIII BEING REPRESENTED. FOUR OF THE FISH AGED WERE IN AGE GROUP XIII. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF WALLEYES HAS ALSO INCREASED FROM 3.79 PDS IN 1984 TO 4.95 PDS IN 1989 WHICH ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE AGING OF THE POPULATION. GROWTH RATES FOR THE AGE XIII FISH WERE SLOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE, WHILE THE YOUNGER FISH HAD NORMAL GROWTH RATES. IN GENERAL, THE POPULATION REFLECTS THE STOCKING RECORD WITH THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES CORRESPONDING TO YEARS OF FRY STOCKING, HOWEVER, SOME ADDITIONAL YEAR CLASSES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PAST  AND PRESENT SURVEYS INDICATING SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY OCCUR. THE ABSENCE OF THE YEAR-CLASS FROM THE 1985 FRY STOCKING IN 1989 TEST NETTING INDICATES POOR FRY SURVIVAL. YELLOW PERCH NET CATCHES SHOWED A REAL INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 8.58/SET. THIS CATCH IS NEARLY FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN CATCHES RECORDED FROM ANY PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBU- TION HAD A NARROW RANGE OF 5.0 - 6.9 INCHES WHEN COMPARED TO 1984 WHCIH HAD A RANGE OF 4.5-9.9 INCHES. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS 6.0-6.4 INCHES IN 1989 COMPARED TO 6.5-6.9 INCHES IN 1984. TWELVE FISH WERE AGED AND AGE GROUPS II-IV WERE REPRESENTED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH INDICATED A SIGNIFI- CANT INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, AND RE- MAINS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 5.75/SET. GILLNET CATCHES WERE ALSO QUITE HIGH, WHICH IS WELL ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE 1980 WHEN THE CATCH WAS ONLY 0.17/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBU- TION RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 8.4 INCHES WITH 7.5-7.9 INCHES AS THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP. A MAJORITY OF FISH CAUGHT BY BOTH TRAPNETS AND GILLNETS WERE 7.0-7.9 INCHES LONG. TWENTY-ONE BLACK CRAPPIES WERE AGED AND FISH DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH RATES WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGES. BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCHES WERE DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND ALSO BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 20.00/SET. THE HIGH POPULATION HAS BEEN ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BLUEGILL SUNFISH RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.9 INCHES IN LENGTH AND 6.0-6.4 INCHES WAS THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP. NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE EXHIBITED BY THE TWENTY-EIGHT FISH THAT WERE AGED AGE GROUPS I-V WERE REPRESENTED. THE PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, BUT BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 3.00/SET. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS 4.0-4.4 INCHES AND THE FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 3.5 TO 5.9 INCHES. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT TAKEN IN EITHER GILLNETS OR TRAPNETS, HOWEVER, THIRTY YOUNG-OF-YEAR AND SIX OLDER FISH WERE CAUGHT BY SHORELINE SEINING. GREEN SUNFISH AND EMERALD SHINERS ARE TWO ADDITIONAL SPECIES CAUGHT ONLY IN SHORELINE SEINES. NINE SPECIES, IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY WERE TAKEN BY TRAPNETTING AND GILL- NETTING. FOUR SPECIES WERE PRESENT IN NUMBERS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE BLACK BULLHEAD GILLNET CATCH WAS MUCH ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 6.50/SET. HISTORICALLY, THE BLACK BULLHEAD GILLNET CATCH HAS BEEN QUITE HIGH. IN ALL NETTING THE FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 7.0 TO 10.9 INCHES WITH THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP BEING 8.0 - 8.4 INCHES. GOLDEN SHINER AND WHITE SUCKER HAD NET CATCHES CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN LOCAL MEDIANS, WHILE THE BROWN BULLHEAD CATCH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. HYBRID SUNFISH, COMMON SHINER, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BOWFIN, AND COMMON CARP ALL SHOWED NET CATCHES BELOW LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS. THE TRAPNET CATCH OF COMMON CARP FELL FROM 3.67/SET IN 1984 TO 0.67/SET IN 1989. INCONSISTENCIES CONCERNING EXTREME HIGHS OR LOWS IN OVERALL SURVEY NET CATCHES MAY LIKELY BE DUE TO HISTORICAL POTENTIAL FOR PARTIAL WINTERKILL.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a very fertile, 390 acre lake located in southern Isanti County. Water clarity is generally poor due to high algae densities. Aquatic vegetation is sparse most of the open water season although curly leaf pondweed can be dense in May and early June. With a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of only 5, winterkill occurs \tperiodically on the lake. Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking, as part of the lake management plan. The lakeshore is highly developed with 211 lake homes and 1 resort. Public access is available on  <br> \nthe northeast shore.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found a slight increase in abundance of Largemouth Bass. Size also increased since 2013 with an average of 15.3 inches and 2 pounds. With most of the 2021 Northern Pike catch coming from the trap nets, comparison to past assessments is not reliable. Sampled Pike did range to 31 inches and averaged 2.5 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are presently strong. Although most were assigned to stocking some appeared to be from reproduction in Long Lake. Walleye caught during the survey ranged from 6.6 to 21.4 inches and 1 to 5 years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers, based on the trap net catch, mirrored the 2013 assessment but, like Northern Pike, were less abundant in the gill nets. Crappie ranged from 5 to 9.3 inches with most of the catch between 8 and 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill decreased in both number and average size since the 2013 assessment, both slightly lower than typical for the lake. Yellow Perch abundance remains low while Black Bullheads are extremely common. <br> \n <br> \nIn summary anglers can expect good numbers of good sized Walleye, catchable numbers of quality sized Largemouth Bass, and moderate numbers of acceptable sized Northern Pike and Black Crappie. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a very fertile 390-acre lake located in southern Isanti County just west of the town of Isanti.  A county owned public boat access is located along the mid-west shoreline east of State Hwy. 47 on 277th Ave. NW.  The boat ramp area has shallow water depths with a sandy bottom type.  Because Long Lake is one of a few larger lakes within close proximity of the city of Cambridge, the lake is a popular destination for water sports enthusiasts other than anglers.  Boat navigation during May and June is very difficult due to dense mats of curled pondweed; however, densities decrease after mid-summer which makes boating easier.  Curled pondweed is an exotic plant not native to Minnesota that has been accidently introduced into many lakes in the state.  Water recreation users should remove all plants from their boats and trailers before leaving the lake to prevent further spread of this species. The shoreline surrounding the lake is made up of residential homes except for the extreme north and south ends.  Land use in the surrounding watershed, in order of abundance, includes agricultural crop-land, undeveloped forest or woodland, livestock pastures, and marshland.  The lake has an abundance of shallow water acreage that has promoted past fish winterkills of varying intensities during favorable winter conditions.  Long Lake has a history of fish community fluctuations as a result of these fish winterkills of some degree.  The fishery in Isanti Long Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass with black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and walleye as the secondary management species. Currently, the management plan calls for walleye fry stocking after confirmed severe winterkills and reestablishing other game fish species by stocking adult pairs if needed.During the open water season of 1999, a fish population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish community in Long Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing, six gill nets, nine trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  Northern pike numbers were above normal while the average weight, at 1.9 pounds, was within a normal range for this type of lake.  Measured northern ranged from 14.7 to 32.6 inches with an average length of 21.6 inches.  The 1999 northern pike catch rate was the highest ever recorded.  Electrofishing found good numbers of largemouth bass, but the average size was small, 0.8 pounds.  Lengths extended from 5.6 to 17.1 inches, with an average length of only 10.2 inches.  Both largemouth bass and northern pike growth was average.  A single 4.0 pound walleye was captured during the assessment which indicates either poor survival of the most recent fry stocking in 1994 or minimal natural reproductive success.  The abundance of black crappie was found at above normal levels with their lengths extending from 3.9 to 10.6 inches.  The majority of crappie sampled were in the 4.0 to 5.0 inch category.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were within a normal range for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 inches with the greater part of their abundance within the 4.0 to 5.5 inch group.  Yellow perch were found at normal abundance levels.  Long Lakes fish community was also made up of black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, spottail shiner, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead were found in substantially high numbers.  Good natural reproductive success was found for bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike while yellow perch showed some success.  An angler fishing Long Lake may encounter an abundance of nice sized northern pike or an occasional nice sized largemouth bass or bluegill sunfish during their fishing experience.  Currently, the crappie size is small, but numbers are abundant.  Future crappie fishing should be excellent once this strong year class reaches an acceptable harvest size in a couple years.  Long Lake lies within a watershed that contributes high concentrations of nutrients to the lake resulting in a decrease of the lakes water quality.  Ultimately, the overall health of a lake is affected.  A reduction in nutrient input would improve current water quality.  Nutrient input can be reduced by protecting or reestablishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline, updating failing or outdated lake-home septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer on surrounding shoreline lawns and agricultural fields, utilizing crop-farming practices that reduce run-off, developing buffer strips along inlet streams, limiting removal of desired aquatic plants, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Long Lake was conducted on June 14-16, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing  was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at threes stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) and six species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Black bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and the majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Black Bullhead sampled per net was well above the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 42 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates that the fish community in Long Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by a FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Rum River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a substantial black bullhead population, and is subject to periodic winterkills.  Walleye fry are stocked on a three year rotation, and following severe winterkills.  Recent walleye stockings do not appear to have contributed to the present low walleye population.Long lake is grouped in lake class 42, a group of small to meduium sized shallow lakes of moderate to high fertility.  The northern pike population was high for lakes of this type, and was composed of good average size fish (2.9 lbs.).     Black crappie and bluegill populations were typical for the lake class in number.  The bluegill population was composed of two main length groups, one averaging 3 to 3.5 inches, and the second averaging 6 to 6.5 inches.     All species aged showed growth comparable to statewide averages for the species.  Bluegills were not aged, and samples of walleye (1), and largemouth bass (2), were very small.                    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a very fertile, 390 acre lake located in southern Isanti County.  Water clarity is generally poor due to high algae densities.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse most of the open water season although curled pondweed can be dense in May and early June.  With a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of only 5, winterkill occurs periodically on the lake.  Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan.  The lakeshore is highly developed with 211 lake homes and 1 resort.  Public access is available on both the northeast and west central shores.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found a marked drop in largemouth bass abundance after showing promise in the 2004 sample.  The four bass captured ranged from 9.5 to 20.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers were higher than normal for Long Lake and other similar lakes.  Crappie size has also improved since the previous assessment with two thirds of the catch exceeding 8 inches.  The bluegill catch rate was less than half the 2004 catch but very comparable to similar lakes.  Like black crappie, bluegill size has improved with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Although they're still more plentiful than in most similar lakes, northern pike abundance decreased since the 2004 assessment.  Captured northerns ranged from 14.3 to 32.6 inches with an average of 21.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Walleye are present in fishable numbers, likely the result of stockings in prior years.  The eleven measured walleyes ranged in length from 14.3 to 28.5 inches and averaged nearly two pounds.  The bullhead population has moderated to a more normal level, likely due to the absence of winter kill since 2001. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a very fertile, 390 acre lake located in southern Isanti County. Water clarity is generally poor due to high algae densities. Aquatic vegetation is sparse most of the open water season although curly-leaf pondweed can be dense in May and early June. With a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of only 5, winterkill occurs periodically on the lake. Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan. The lakeshore is highly developed with 211 lake homes and 1 resort. Public access is available on both the northeast and west central shores.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing found an increase in abundance of Largemouth Bass. The largest bass captured was 15.1 inches, and 5 of the 13 bass were larger than 12 inches.  An increase in the number of smaller bass in this survey bodes well for bass fishing in the future.  Northern Pike catch rates and sizes were average when compared to similar lakes. Captured Northern Pike ranged from 15.9 to 39.2 inches with an average length of 24.5 inches. Walleye are present in Long Lake, but catch rates fell to levels well below average when compared to similar lakes.  Although, Walleye caught during the survey were above average size, all being between 19 and 22 inches.  With no natural reproduction, future Walleye abundance is dependent on the success of Walleye stockings. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers in Long Lake are much higher than in similar lakes.  The largest Black Crappie collected was 9.6 inches and the average length was 7.5 inches.  While Black Crappie growth rates were slower than average in Long Lake, the large number of 7 to 8 inch fish observed in this survey should provide ample fishing opportunities in the near future. Bluegill catch rates decreased to below average when compared to similar lakes and were less than a third of that observed in 2004. Bluegill size was similar to the 2009 survey, with an average length of 6.6 inches.  The largest Bluegill collected in the survey was 7.7 inches and just over one fourth of the Bluegill were greater than 7 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance has remained low and bullhead and White Sucker abundance has increased since the last survey.  Provided no severe winterkills occur, Long Lake should provide great fishing opportunities in the years to come.  <br> \n</p>",

The walleye pike was extremely high in the gillnet medians, at 15.00 per set and 41.20 pounds per set.  All three of the bullhead species had high population figures with the black bullhead being extremely high at 233.33 per set.  Average bullhead is of a small size.  The white sucker was absent from the gillnet catch but was high in the trapnet at 4.33 per set.  The yellow perch was low in the gillnet catch but high in the trapnet medians.  The carp had high median figures at 2.33 per set and 11.53 pounds per set.  The pumpkinseed and black crappie had low population medians while the bluegill was average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a very fertile, 390 acre lake located in southern Isanti County.  Water clarity is generally poor due to high algae densities.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse most of the open water season although curled pondweed can be dense in May and early June.  With a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of only 5, winterkill occurs periodically on the lake.  Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan.  The lakeshore is highly developed with 211 lake homes and 1 resort.  Public access is available on both the northeast and west central shores.  Spring electrofishing found largemouth bass abundance to be good and higher than in past assessments on Long Lake.  Bass averaged 11.6 inches and 1 pound with lengths ranging from 6.6 to 18.6 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill numbers were typical of lakes similar to Long.  Like bass, the bluegill catch rate was the higher than in past sampling.  As of 2004, the size structure for both species may be an issue for some anglers.  The majority of crappie were between 5 and 7 inches.  Most bluegill were under 5 inches but fish between 6.5 and 7.5 inches are available to the patient angler.  Northern pike were plentiful.  Abundance and size were similar in 1999.  Captured northerns ranged from 16.6 to 28.7 inches with and average of 21.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  The black bullhead population remains high compared to similar lakes.  This is likely an impact of the partial winterkill that occured during February of 2001.   </p>",
