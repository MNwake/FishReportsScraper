                "narrative": "<p>Black Oak Lake is a small (119 acres), shallow (19 feet deep), natural environment lake.  Prior to 2004 the lake had a low priority for management because of its small size and history of frequent winterkill.  An initial survey was done in 1962 with a resurvey in 1985.  Black Oak Lake last sustained a partial winterkill in 2001-02.  A cooperative aeration agreement between the DNR and the Green Grove Rod and Gun Club first prevented winter kill during the winter of 2005-06, and led to the stocking of sunfish (in 2004 and 2006), black crappies and largemouth bass (2005), and walleye fingerlings (2008).  Since 2006, aeration equipment has been used successfully to prevent winter kill. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, the northern pike catch rate (8.25/gill net) was greater than expected compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  Average length and weight of northern pike was 23 inches and three pounds. Northern pike grew at a rate faster than statewide averages.  Thirty percent of northern pike were larger than 24 inches.  We have had some fantastic reports about northern pike spearing with fish over 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one walleye (20 inches, age 3) was sampled by gill nets.  In 2008, the Green Grove Rod and Gun Club received a permit to stock 2,200 walleye fingerlings.  Those fish would be too small to be captured with gill nets in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch (4.3/gill net) were captured for the first time at a rate within the range of expected values.  Yellow perch are an important food item for northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for largemouth was accomplished on June 3, 2008 during daylight hours.  Eleven largemouth were captured during one hour of energized-time.  Largemouth bass ranged from 11 to 17 inches with an average length of 14 inches.  The largemouth fishery is still improving since stocking occurred as recently as 2005. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (39.5/trap net) were abundant and the catch was above the normal range.  The average length of bluegill was six inches.   Bluegill grew at a rate similar to lake class averages.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie (33.0/trap net) was twice the normal range for the lake class.  Black crappie were less than a harvestable size, however, with an average length of six inches.  Growth of black crappie was below the lake class average across all age groups. <br> \n <br> \nConsidering the winter kill history of Black Oak Lake, black bullheads were not abundant.  The five black bullheads ranged from 9-10 inches. Carp, golden shiner and hybrid sunfish were all present.  These species are typical of lakes that experience winterkill. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Oak Lake is a 119 acre lake located 3 miles south of Melrose in northwestern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 19 feet and is classified as Lake Class 42. The watershed (960 acres) is small and mostly row crops (39%) with some forest (28%) and pasture (14%). The DNR owns a public access on the southeast side of the lake near county road 30. Water clarity was 10.0 feet in early June and MPCA data shows an average summer water clarity of 5.1 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 12 feet during the survey. Black Oak Lake is managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and was last surveyed in 2009. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2004, the lake was a low priority for management because of its small size and history of winterkill. An aeration agreement with the Green Grove Rod and Gun Club led to the re stocking of Bluegill, Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass by the DNR from 2004 2006. Aeration equipment has been successful at preventing winterkill in 13 of the last 16 winters. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were above the expected range of values for similar lakes and nearly double, what was sampled in 2009. Lengths ranged from 11 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.5 pounds. Twenty percent of the pike were longer than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleye yearlings (6 and 8 inches) were sampled by gill nets. Since 2008, the Freeport Family Fishing group has been annually stocking fingerling and/or yearling Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOnly three Yellow Perch were sampled in 2019. Yellow Perch are an important food item for Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing in late May failed to sample any Largemouth Bass. Even though no dead fish were reported, the complete absence of bass in the survey indicates that a partial winterkill occurred most likely in the winter of 2014 when one of the aerators was flooded and stopped running. Largemouth Bass will be re stocked in the spring of 2020 in order to restore the bass fishery. The Bluegill population also appears to have been affected by the previous partial winterkill, as only three small Bluegill around four inches were sampled in the survey. Bluegill will also be stocked in the spring of 2020 in order to supplement the existing population. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Crappie decreased from the recorded high in 2009 but remained within the normal range for the lake class. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4 to 10 inches, with an average length of 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nConsidering the winter kill history of Black Oak Lake, Black Bullheads were not abundant. Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker were all present in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

The catch was almost exclusively from the large 1982 and '83 year classes showing average growth. Black Crappie numbers were also high (61.3 /gill net). Most were from the large fast-growing 1983 year class. Pumpkinseed (15.2/trap net) and Green Sunfish (8.5/trap net) are also abundant. Northern Pike abundance (5.3/gill net) was near its local median. Age 3 fish were most abundant in the catch (ages 3-6). Growth was generally fast. Northern Pike younger than age 3 were not sampled. Yellow Bullhead numbers (1.3/trap net) were low but similar to 1975. White Sucker abundance (2.8/gill net) was high for this area while Golden Shiner catch (0.3/trap net) was low, no forage species were captured in shoreline seining this year.</p>",
