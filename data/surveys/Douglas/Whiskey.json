                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a highly eutrophic lake.  Symptoms of excessive nutrient enrichment include; denseblue-green algae blooms, poor water clarity, limited distribution of aquatic emergent plants, andhighly fluctuating dissolved oxygen concentrations during summer months.   This type of environmentlimits the abundance of sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike; yet walleye and yellow perch seemto adapt well to these conditions.   The degraded state of Whiskey Lake is likely the result ofreceiving treated and partially treated effluent from the Brandon sewage treatment plant.  A new sewagetreatment system began operation in 1988.  Wastewater effluent is now applied to a cover crop usingspray irrigation during normal operations instead of being discharged into surface waters.  Eutrophicconditions may persist due to the internal load of nutrients that is now present in Whiskey Lake.Walleye catch rate decreased from 38.7 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 6.7 fish/gillnet in 1993.  The normalrange of mean catch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 1.0 - 6.0fish/gillnet. Sixty-eight percent of the walleye captured in gillnets were less than 10.0 inches intotal length.  Larger fish were captured in trapnets.  Fry stocking appeared to produce relativelystrong year classes in 1986 and 1992.  The elevated catch rate in 1988 was due mostly to the 1986 yearclass.  Yellow perch catches averaged 22.0 fish/gillnet in 1993.  Catches averaged 20.7 fish/gillnetin 1988 and 25.0 fish/gillnet in 1984.  The size structure of the population is exceptional and shouldbe attractive to anglers.  Nine of every ten fish captured was greater than 10 inches in length.  Theaverage weight of fish captured was 0.7 pounds.  The abundance of other gamefish species is limited.Electrofishing yielded only 4.0 largemouth bass per hour.  Bluegill catch averaged 0.6 fish/trapnet. Bluegill were not captured in three previous surveys between 1988 and 1979.  Black crappie catchesaveraged 1.0 fish/trapnet.  Northern pike have not been captured in survey nets since 1979.  Blackbullhead catch rate decreased from 196.0 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 0.8 fish/gillnet in 1993.  Trapnetcatches fell from 32.7 fish/net in 1988 to 7.6 fish/net in 1993.  There was no commercial fishingactivity on Whiskey Lake during this time period.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a eutrophic lake located northeast of Brandon.  This 158 acre lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet with about one-half of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a concrete access located on the north end of the lake on County Road 58.Water clarity is poor during summer months due to dense  algal blooms.  The primary reason for the degraded water quality is the historical discharge of partially treated wastewater from the city of Brandon.   Although the city no longer directly discharges into Whiskey Lake, the lake has accumulated excess nutrients over time which continue to cycle in the lake.  The shoreline has little residential development.  Extensive development or shoreline alterations have the potential to further degrade water quality due to the steepness of the shoreline.Whiskey Lake has an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Emergent vegetation (cattail and bulrush) forms dense stands along the west shoreline.  This vegetation protects water quality by assimilating nutrients and protecting the shoreline from erosion.  It also provides good spawning and nursery habitat for bass and panfish.  This vegetation is very important to water quality and fisheries habitat and should be protected.Whiskey Lake is fished primarily during open water with little ice fishing done.  The primary species targeted by anglers include walleye and yellow perch.  Some evidence of natural reproduction exists, however, the walleye population is sustained with fry stocking on even years.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 10.7 fish per net which is above the normal range for this lake type.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye of all sizes with the most abundant fish in the 18-20 inch  range.  Walleye up to 26 inches were sampled.  Most anglers fish this lake early in the season to avoid the dense algal blooms.This lake has the ability to grow large yellow perch and has offered excellent perch fishing.  Although the fish sampled in 1998 averaged only 7.0 inches, netting in 1993 revealed that 90% of fish were greater than 10 inches and averaged 0.7 pounds.  With the fast growth and good numbers present, watch for this fishery in the next few years.The largemouth bass fishery appears to have turned around.  The 1993 electrofishing survey showed only 4.0 bass per hour of effort.  The 1998 survey showed 55.2 bass per hour with the majority of fish sampled being between 13 and 15 inches in length.  The largest fish sampled was 16 inches.  The Viking Sportsmen, Inc. stocked 430 bass fingerlings in 1996.  This stocking, good natural reproduction in 1995 and fast growth have turned this lake into a quality fishery that should continue to get better.Bluegill and black crappie should also offer quality angling opportunities.  Bluegill abundance is relatively high with the mean length of fish being almost 7.0 inches and the largest fish was 9.4\".  Black crappie are also relatively abundant with mean lengths of 8.6 inches and a maximum length of 13 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a relatively small (158 acres), lightly developed basin located two miles northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet.  Nearly half of the lake area is less than 15 feet deep.  Water quality in Whiskey Lake has improved over the past two decades.  The lake received discharges from the Brandon wastewater treatment plant until 1988.  Excessive nutrient loading resulted in degradation of water quality and fish habitat.  Dense algal blooms were frequent throughout summer months.  Algal blooms still occur, but with less frequency and severity.  Whiskey Lake now supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community, which provides key spawning and nursery habitat for many gamefish species. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Whiskey Lake has changed dramatically over the past several decades.  Increased water quality and improved habitat conditions have led to a shift in fish species composition.  Current fish community attributes more closely reflect that of small, heavily vegetated, bass-panfish lakes of west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Northern Pike are all abundant.  These species were practically non-existent throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.  Anglers can expect good numbers of quality Largemouth Bass.  Average length of Largemouth Bass captures was 11.7 inches and fish up to 20 inches were observed.  Bluegill numbers decreased some, but size improved.  Almost one third of the Bluegills sampled were over 8 inches and the largest Bluegill observed was 9.5 inches. Most Northern Pike are small, averaging 21.9 inches in length.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an annual basis and abundance is close to expected levels for this type of lake.  Walleye average length was 15.4 inches and should provide the opportunity for harvest.  Black Crappie numbers have been inconsistent, but fish greater than 12 inches in length have been sampled.  Yellow Perch numbers remain low. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Whiskey Lake.  However, because of its small size, the fishery is vulnerable to over-harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Whiskey Lake's fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Whiskey Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nEleven species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively simple nearshore fish community.  Only one species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Whiskey Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a small, lightly developed basin located about two miles northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  Surface area covers 158 acres.  Maximum depth is 46 feet.  Nearly half of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake received discharges from the Brandon wastewater treatment plant until 1988.  Excessive nutrient loading resulted in degradation of water quality and fish habitat.  Dense algal blooms were frequent throughout summer months.  Plant upgrades and discontinued effluent discharges to Whiskey Lake have resulted in improving water quality and clarity.  Algal blooms still occur, but with less frequency and severity.  Whiskey Lake now supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community, which is a primary habitat component for many gamefish species. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community has evolved with habitat suitability.   Members of the sunfish family such as largemouth bass and bluegill were rare catches in surveys completed into the early 90s.  Whiskey Lake now supports a robust fishery and diverse angling opportunities.  Largemouth bass are only moderately abundant but fishing quality, in terms of average size of bass, is good.   Mean length of largemouth bass captured during the 2009 electrofishing survey was 14.3 inches. Fifty-seven percent of catches exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  The largest bass measured was 19.8 inches.  Bluegills have become very abundant.  Most captured were young fish produced in 2006, but larger bluegills are common.  The largest bluegill recorded was 9.5 inches in length.  Crappies appear to experience high natural mortality or excessive fishing pressure.  Fewer black crappie were captured than in previous surveys.  Those captured in 2009 were only one-year-old fish. <br> \n <br> \nDespite the small size of Whiskey Lake, it also supports healthy walleye and northern pike populations.  Fishing quality should be good.  Average size of walleye captured in 2009 was 17.9 inches and 2.2 pounds.  The largest measured was 29.2 inches.  Northern pike catches ranged from 17.0 \u0013 32.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDue to Whiskey Lake\u0019s small size, the fishery is vulnerable to over-harvest.  To maintain a high value fishery, anglers are highly encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish and harvest of the more abundant smaller fish.  Benefits include a better balanced and more productive fish community and increased catches of medium and large-size gamefish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 1, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 stations, with two stations sampled from boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations and a 15-foot seine was used at four stations. Two sampling stations had conditions that prevented the use of seines. The nearshore sampling captured 16 native fish species including two species (Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) intolerant of habitat disturbance and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a 158-acre fertile lake located about 2 miles northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet and about one-half of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Whiskey Lake has a history of poor water clarity during summer months due to dense algal blooms.  The lake received treated and partially treated effluent from the Brandon sewage treatment plant until 1988.  Water quality and clarity have improved in recent years.  Seechi disk transparency was 7.5 feet in early July of 2003.  Whiskey Lake supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 9 feet and is dense in shallow areas.  Bulrush and common cattail are abundant along the west and southwest shoreline.  This aquatic vegetation helps to maintain water quality by competing with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake and by protecting the shoreline from erosion.  These plants also provide critical spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially largemouth bass and sunfish.  Lakeshore homeowners should minimize disturbances and alterations to these important components of the lake ecosystem.  The fish community in Whiskey Lake has changed dramatically in the past decade.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie have all become abundant and now provide quality angling opportunities.  These species were practically non-existent in the 1980's to early 1990's.  The species are all experiencing rapid growth rates, thus average sizes are relatively large.  For example, one-third of the northern pike captured were 28 inches in length or greater.  Quality size largemouth bass are also present.  Yellow perch are also abundant, but size structure is poor.  Ten to twelve inch perch were common in the early 1990's.Walleye numbers have decreased in recent years.  Gill net catches averaged 4.3 fish/net in 2003, compared to 10.8 fish/net in 1998.  The fish captured in 2003 were mostly large individuals, averaging about three pounds.   The Lake Management Plan was amended in 2000 to include a switch to alternate year walleye fingerling stockings rather than fry stockings.  Additional fingerlings, yearlings, and adults were stocked in 2001.           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community is dominated by three species: Walleye, Black Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. Walleye catch rates were 38.67 fish/gill net and 19.50 fish/trap net. Mean weight was slightly over 0.75 pounds. Variation in Walleye year class strength is attributable to fry stockings. Eighty-seven percent of 233 walleye captured were from the 1986 year-class when 165,000 fry were stocked. Growth rate of Walleye is fast and the 1986 year-class should recruit into the Yellow Perch abundance (20.67/gill net) and mean weight (0.55 lb.) is excellent. Forty-four percent of Yellow Perch sampled were over 10.0 inches and should contribute to the fishery. Yellow Perch probably comprise the primary forage base for the Walleye population. Their numbers have decreased with increased Walleye densities. Black bullhead are very abundant. There are two peaks in the length frequency curve for Black Bullhead. The first was at approximately 6 inches then at 12 to 13 inches with commercial value if underutilized by anglers. Black crappie and Largemouth Bass populations were probably not well represented in test net catches and may contribute to the recreational fishery. Walleye fry stocking appears to be an effective management strategy on Whiskey Lake. Fry will continue to be stocked on alternate years at a rate of 500 fry/littoral acre (36,750).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a relatively small (158 acres), lightly developed basin located about two miles northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet.  Nearly half of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake received discharges from the Brandon wastewater treatment plant until 1988.  Excessive nutrient loading resulted in degradation of water quality and fish habitat.  Dense algal blooms were frequent throughout summer months.  Plant upgrades and discontinuance of effluent discharges to Whiskey Lake have resulted in improved water quality and clarity.  Algal blooms still occur, but with less frequency and severity.  Whiskey Lake now supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community, which provides key spawning and nursery habitat for many gamefish species. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Whiskey Lake has changed dramatically over the past decade.  Increased water quality and much improved habitat conditions have led to a major shift in fish species composition.  The current fish community more closely reflects that of small, heavily vegetated, bass-panfish lakes of west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are all abundant.  These species were practically non-existent throughout the 1980's and much of the 1990's.  Anglers targeting largemouth bass and bluegill can expect good numbers of quality-sized fish.  Northern pike and black crappie populations are currently comprised of younger fish and average size of these species tends to be smaller.  Other gamefish species present include yellow perch and walleye.  Perch numbers have greatly decreased in recent years and current size structure is poor.  Walleye catches have also decreased in recent years as carrying capacity now includes greater diversity and biomass of other gamefishes.  Current abundance remains above levels expected for this type of lake.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year to maintain a fishery.  Currently, average size of walleye is large with mean length exceeding 20.0 inches and mean weight exceeding 3.5 pounds.  Large average size is due to a unique age structure dominated by old fish.  Eleven- and 13-year-old individuals comprised over two-thirds of the 2007 capture sample.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size caught, will decrease with senescence of these year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nWhiskey Lake currently offers a quality fishery and diverse angling opportunities.  However, because of its small size, the fishery is vulnerable to over-harvest.  To maintain a high value fishery, anglers are highly encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish and harvest of the more abundant smaller fish.  Benefits include a better balanced and more productive fish community and increased catches of medium and large size gamefish.     <br> \n <br> \nDiverse angling opportunities are also available on a number of lakes in close proximity to Whiskey Lake.  These lakes include Chippewa, Little Chippewa, Devils, and Stowe.  Camping opportunities are also available nearby at Chippewa Park (see http://www.co.douglas.mn.us/chippewa_park.htm for more information). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net numbers have decreased since the 1979 survey. Several factors are responsible for this decline. As the lake regained equilibrium Walleyes responding to interspecific competition and declined to expected ranges an excessive blue-green algae bloom at the time of the 1984 survey resulted in very shallow Walleye movement and were captured in trap nets. Trap net data indicate that Walleye abundance has changed very little from 1979 to 1984. Consequently, 1979 gill net catch data was biased toward high numbers because only two gill nets were used and 1984 data was biased toward low numbers because of environmental conditions. Natural reproduction of Walleye established year classes in 1983 and 1980 and should add to the fishery. Uneven and inadequate recruitment to larger sizes continues to be a problem. High Yellow Perch numbers indicates a stable forage base and should not be a limiting factor. Black Crappie numbers have declined severely with recruitment and natural reproduction almost non-existent. Largemouth Bass are present and could add to the fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whiskey Lake is a relatively small (158 acres), lightly developed basin located two miles northeast of Brandon in Douglas County. The lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet. Nearly half of the lake area is less than 15 feet deep. Water quality in Whiskey Lake has improved over the past two decades. The lake received discharges from the Brandon wastewater treatment plant until 1988. Excessive nutrient loading resulted in degradation of water quality and fish habitat. Dense algal blooms used to be frequent throughout summer months. Algal blooms can still occur, but with less frequency and severity. Whiskey Lake now supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community, which provides key spawning and nursery habitat for quality game fish populations.\n\nThe fish community in Whiskey Lake has changed dramatically over the past several decades. Increased water quality and improved habitat conditions have led to a shift in fish species composition. Current fish community attributes more closely reflect that of small, heavily vegetated, bass-panfish lakes of west-central Minnesota. Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike are now abundant. These species were practically non-existent throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. A fish survey was completed during spring and summer 2021 to provide updated information on the fish community of Whiskey Lake.  Survey components included spring electrofishing to assess Largemouth Bass, spring trap nets to assess panfish and gill nets were utilized during July.\n\nThis was the first survey on Whiskey Lake that included a spring panfish survey and results will be used as a baseline to evaluate the effects of the new sunfish regulation. Starting in the spring of 2021, a special regulation was implemented that reduced the daily limit of sunfish from 20 to 5. Whiskey Lake supports a quality sunfish population and a number of Bluegill over 9 inches were observed in the survey. Growth rates are fast and Bluegill up to age 11 were sampled in the survey.  Large bluegill can be over exploited, especially in such a small system.  The reduced bag limit will help maintain and possibly further enhance this quality fishery.\n\nSpring surveys also offer the opportunity to sample larger Black Crappie (>8\"), which can be difficult to sample in mid-summer surveys.  The size structure of Black Crappie sampled in this survey was very high. Almost 43% of the sample was made up of Black Crappie ranging from 12 to 14 inches in length.  Growth rates are only moderate, thus these larger crappies were very old compared to other populations, as most were 10 to 11 years old.\n\nLargemouth Bass are also abundant and provide a quality fishing opportunity.  A majority of the bass caught in this survey were from 13 to 17 inches in length.  The largest bass in this survey was only 17.2 inches, but fish up to almost 21 inches have been caught in recent surveys.  Northern Pike abundance has been increasing, however size structure remains poor.  Average length of pike was only 18.7 inches.  Walleye catch rates declined to 1.2 fish/net despite continued surplus fingerling stockings in recent years. The increased water clarity and submergent vegetation likely favor the bass/panfish and northern pike populations in Whiskey Lake. No Common Carp have been observed in Whiskey Lake since the lake was reclaimed and Black Bullhead abundance remains low.  \n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Whiskey Lake. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help improve and sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nWhiskey Lake was designated as infested after zebra mussels were discovered in 2017.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",
