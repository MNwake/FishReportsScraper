WALLEYES SAMPLED IN 82 WERE REPRESENTED BY II,III, IV, VI AND VII YR CLASSES, WITH A DOMI- NATE IV YR CLASS. TODAYS WALLEYE POPULATION IS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED WITH I,III,IV AND V YR CLASSES PRESENT. NORTHERNS HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT DE- CLINE IN NUMBERS AND MAY REFLECT THE DISCONTINUED STOCKING EFFORT. NORTHERNS HAVE SHOWN A DECLINE FROM 4.91/GILLNET IN 82 TO 2.66/GILLNET TODAY. NORTHERNS SAMPLED WERE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN I,II,III AND IV YR CLASSES. IN 82 NORTHERNS WERE DOMINATED BY II AND III YR CLASS FISH WITH IV AND V YR CLASSES BEING WELL REPRESENTED. LM BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 82 BUT WERE SAMPLED IN BOTH GEAR THIS YEAR, WITH THREE FISH CAPTURED. LM BASS WERE SAMPLED USING ELECTROFISHING GEAR IN MAY. BLACK CRAPPIES DECLINED IN NUMBER SINCE 82 FROM 43.62/ TRAPNET TO 29.00/TRAPNET IN 84. THE GILLNET CATCH FOR BLACK CRAPPIES DROPPED FROM 20.66/NET IN 82 TO 2.00/NET IN 84. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE WELL REPRESENTD BY FIVE YEAR CLASSES, WITH A VERY STRONG IV YR CLASS DOMINATING. WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE SHOWN A DRAMATIC INCREASE SINCE THE 82 SURVEY. WHITE CRAPPIE WERE NOT SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS IN 82 AND ONLY AVGD 1.58/NET IN GILLNETS. WHITE CRAPPIE NOW AVG 95.25/NET IN TRAPNETS AND 9.33/NET IN GILLNETS. WHITE CRAPPIES ARE DOMINATED BY A VERY STRONG III YR CLASS , THIS THREE OTHER YR CLASSES PRESENT. BLUEGILLS REMAIN THE SAME IN ABUNDANCE AS IN THE 82 SURVEY. BLUEGILLS NOW AVG 54.25/TRAPNET COMPARED TO 56.62/TRAPNET IN 82. THE SAME YEAR CLASS THAT DOMINATED THE POPUALTION IN 82 AS II YR OLDS NOW DOMINATE IN 84 AS IV YR OLDS. FIVE YR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED COMPARED TO TWO YEAR CLASSES IN 82. PUMPKINSEED HAVE DECLINED SINCE 82 WITH ONLY TWO BEING SAMPLED COMPARED TO 1.75/TRAPNET IN 85. PERCH HAVE SHOWN A LARGE DECLINE FROM 29.33 GILLNET IN 82 TO 8.33/GILLNET IN 84. PERCH ARE NOW DOMINATED BY III YR CLASS FISH AND WERE DOMINATED BY II YR CLASS FISH IN 82. PERCH NUMBERS MAY RE- FLECT THE RECENT INCREASE IN WALLEYE STOCKING. A DIVERSE NON-GAMEFISH POPULATION IS STILL PRESENT AS WAS TRUE IN 82. A MODERATE POPULATION OF CARP, FRESHWATER DRUM, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BUFFALO, SUCKER, LONGNOSE GAR, BOWFIN, AND GOLDEN SHINER WERE SAMPLED.</p>",

WALLEYES ARE FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG FIVE AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO THE FIVE AGE CLASSES PRESENT IN 1982, WHICH WERE DOMINATED BY IV AGE CLASS FISH. TWO YEAR CLASSES, 1981 AND 1984, WERE SAMPLED BUT DO NOT CORRESPOND TO PAST STOCKING RECORDS. PAST STOCKING OF 1979, 1982, AND 1983 YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED. SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY BE TAKING PLACE TO EXPLAIN 1981 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES. NORTHERN PIKE CATCH RATES HAVE SHOWN A DECLINE AND MAY REFLECT THE LOSS OF SPAWNING HABITAT AND THE DISCONTINUANCE OF STOCKING. THE CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 4.91/GILLNET IN 1982 TO 0.50/GILLNET IN 87. THE NORTHERNS SAMPLED IN 1982 WERE WELL REPRESENTED BY II-V AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO THE MUCH SMALLER I, II, III, AND VI AGE CLASSES NOW PRESENT. CATCH RATES FOR WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE SHOWN AN INCREASE FROM 1.58/GILLNET IN 1982 TO 37.92/GILLNET IN 1987. IN 1982, II AND III AGE CLASS FISH WERE SAMPLED COMPARED TO THE I-V AGE CLASSES NOW PRESENT. THE I AND IV AGE CLASSES DOMINATE THE 87 POPULATION. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 43.62/TRAPNET IN 1982 TO 25.25/TRAPNET IN 1987. YOUNGER FISH DOMINATE THE 1987 POPULATION. A DOMINATE III AGE CLASS WAS PRESENT IN 1982 COMPARED TO THE LARGE I AGE CLASS NOW PRESENT, WITH FEWER II - V AGE CLASS FISH PRESENT. BLUEGILL CATCH RATES DECREASED FROM 56.62/TRAPNET IN 1982 TO 36.87/TRAPNET IN 1987. THE SIZE OF BLUEGILLS HAS INCREASED SINCE 1982, WITH MANY FISH 7.0-7.9 NOW PRESENT. THE PRESENT BLUEGILL POPULA- TION IS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG I-VIII AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO THE II AND III AGE CLASSES SAMPLED IN 1982. PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH REMAIN UNCHANGED AVERAGING 1.87/TRAPNET COMPARED TO 1.75/ TRAPNET IN 1982. PERCH CATCH RATES DECREASED FROM 29.33/GILLNET IN 1982 TO 5.83/GILLNET IN 87. THE PRESENT PERCH POPULATION IS REPRESENTED BY I-IV AGE CLASSES, COMPARED TO THE II AND III AGE CLASSES PRESENT IN 82. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE ONLY SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING AND REPRESENTED BY SMALL FISH. INFORMATION FROM LOCAL ANGLERS INDICATES LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE PRESENT IN GOOD NUMBERS. CARP, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, AND LONGNOSE GAR NETTING INDICES ARE LOWER THAN IN THE 1982 SURVEY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BOWFIN. THESE INDICES ARE RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO SIMILAR LAKES IN THE AREA.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tGerman lake in LeSueur County is an 899 acre lake northwest of Elysian. A DNR-owned public access is located on the north side of the lake off LeSueur county road 12. German lake is connected to the Jefferson chain of lakes to the west, and is within the Cannon River major watershed. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2002. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment when leaving German lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes.  <br> \n\tGerman lake was surveyed the week of June 16th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Bluegills were the most numerous fish in the assessment in both trap and gill net catches. Bluegills averaged 48 fish per gill net lift and 76 fish per trap net lift. Average (mean) size of bluegill was around 7 inches for both gear types, a \"preferred\" length in stock density indices. Bluegill were spawning during the assessment and anglers at the public access reported good bluegill fishing. <br> \n\tBlack crappie abundance is nearing the upper quartile range at 16 fish per gill net lift. Trap netting for black crappie was not as effective as gill netting during this survey; crappies were caught in the trap nets at a rate of 1.4 fish per trap net lift. Crappie ranged in length from 6 to 11 inches, with the average (mean) fish measuring 8 inches. <br> \n\tYellow perch abundance remained stable at 21.38 fish per gill net lift. Perch ranged between 5 and 10 inches. Walleye abundance was low; 1.13 fish per gill net lifted were measured, a value that is within the lowest quartile range. Walleye were large, between 18 and 27 inch long.  <br> \n\tBlack bullhead abundance increased since the record low levels observed in the 2002 survey. Black bullheads were netted at a rate of 23.4 fish per gill net and 14.6 fish per trap net. Black bullheads were small, ranging between 8 to 10.5 inches.  <br> \n\tGerman featuers a nice northern pike population. Northern Pike averaged 4.3 fish per gill net lift, which is above average for this lake type. Pike ranged from 18 to 35 inches in length, with the average (mean) size being 25 inches. The average pike weight of 3.7 pounds is above the 75th percentile for this lake type. <br> \n\tThree largemouth bass were caught in the gill nets. Bass are not well sampled by passive gears (gill nets and trap nets) and electrofishing is not scheduled until the next full fisheries survey. White crappie and channel catfish are also present in the lake, although none were observed in this assessment. Other fish seen in the survey include white sucker, bowfin (dogfish), bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum, yellow bullhead, white bass, longnose gar, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.  <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in German Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>German Lake is an 899-acre lake located in southern Le Sueur County. A DNR-owned public access is located on the north side of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 12. A public fishing pier is located on the west side of the lake near the outlet to East Jefferson Lake. The maximum depth is 51 feet with 66% of the area less than 15 feet deep. German Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie and Bluegills and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The current management plan calls for stocking 524,000 Walleye fry in odd years. Most recently, Walleye fry were stocked in 2017, 2019, and 2021. German Lake is managed along with East Jefferson Lake, West Jefferson Lake, and Middle Jefferson Lake as part of a chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered, and management is coordinated with this in mind. German Lake is considered a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. The 2021 survey was completed the week of 14 June 2021 using 8 gill nets, 8 trap nets, and 53 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were common in the gill net sample in 2021. A total of 142 Black Crappies were caught for a rate of 17.8/net. The 2021 Black Crappie catch rate was in line with the long-term average catch rate of 13.4/net and less than half the 2018 catch rate of 38.4/net. Black Crappies ranged from 4.1 to 12.3 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. Almost half of Black Crappies sampled were over 8 inches. An additional 38 Black Crappies up to 13.1 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Black Crappies from both gears were 1 to 10 years old with 8 year classes present. Approximately 88% of Black Crappies sampled were 3 years old or younger. Black Crappie growth was moderate with fish exceeding 8 inches by year 3. Black Crappies are one of the most targeted species in the Jefferson Chain and the 2021 survey results show a population with consistent recruitment and good size potential. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills dominated the trap net sample in 2021 with a total of 318 caught for a rate of 39.8/net. The 2021 Bluegill catch rate was below the long term average of 52.7/net but still indicated high numbers were present. Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 9.1 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. Bluegill size structure was good with approximately half the sample over 6 inches and 20% over 8 inches. Bluegills were also the most abundant species in the gill nets and ranged from 3.8 to 9.4 inches. Bluegills ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 7 year classes present. Bluegill recruitment appears consistent with most year classes relatively well represented. Bluegill growth was moderately slow with an average length of 4.8 inches at 3 years old. Despite slow growth, the size structure of the 2021 sample was of high quality and should continue to attract anglers to German Lake. <br> \n <br> \nJust 7 Walleyes ranging from 14.7 to 25.3 inches were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.9/net. The long-term catch rate average was 2.0/net and recent surveys produced 0.6/net in 2013 and 1.3/net in 2018. The current management strategy of stocking fry every other year has produced very little in terms of a Walleye fishery in German Lake and the Jefferson Chain as a whole, despite moderate Northern Pike numbers and abundant Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing for a rate of 26.8/hour. This was just the third time Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing. The other two catch rates were 36.4/hour in 2004 and 18.7/hour in 2018. Overall, Largemouth Bass numbers have been sampled at low to moderate numbers in German Lake. Largemouth Bass lengths in 2021 ranged from 4.0 to 18.1 inches with an average of 11.9 inches. About half the Largemouth Bass sample exceeded 12 inches. Six more Largemouth Bass up to 16.2 inches were sampled with the gill nets. Largemouth Bass from both gears were 1 to 12 years old with 11 year classes present. The average length at 3 years old was 10.6 inches. Although sampled in low numbers, the German Lake Largemouth Bass population continues to provide a steady angling target and matches well with the abundant Bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant in the gill net sample. A total of 43 Northern Pike were sampled for a rate of 5.4/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Historically, Northern Pike catch rates have varied from 2.0/net to 9.9/net with an average of 5.3/net. Northern Pike ranged from 15.3 to 35.8 inches with an average length of 24.7 inches. Approximately 57% of Northern Pike were larger than the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Northern Pike ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. Most Northern Pike were 2 to 4 years old. Northern Pike growth was rapid with an average length of 20.2 inches at 2 years old. The last time Northern Pike were stocked in the Jefferson Chain was in 2017 which suggests that many of fish sampled in 2021 were naturally reproduced and provides evidence of a self-sustaining population. German Lake is included in the Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are limited to 2 Northern Pike daily which must be at least 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at an all-time high of 26.0/net in 2021.  The long-term average was 15.9/net and the catch rate from the previous survey (2018) was 14.0/net. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.5 to 11.4 inches with an average of 8.0 inches. Size structure was good with plenty of Yellow Perch over 8 inches. Yellow Perch ranged from 2 to 8 years old with 7 year classes present. The average length at 3 years old was 7.4 inches. The 2021 survey shows a dual-purpose Yellow Perch population. One that both provides an abundant prey base for predator species and that also provides good numbers of sizable fish for harvest. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum have historically been one of the most abundant species in gill net samples, and that trend continued in 2021. A total of 118 Freshwater Drum averaging 16.8 inches were sampled for a rate of 14.8/net, which was just above the long-term average of 12.6/net. Freshwater Drum provide an additional angling opportunity in German Lake, albeit an unpopular one. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were scarce in 2021 with just 5 sampled with the trap and gill nets and continued a steep declining trend that began in 2013. Yellow Bullheads were abundant on the other hand, with 129 sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 16.1/net. This represents a huge increase from a previous high catch rate of 2.1/net.  <br> \n <br> \nJust a single 28.5 inch Common Carp was sampled in 2021. Catch rates have remained near zero in all 8 surveys dating back to 1994. With access to the whole Jefferson Chain, Common Carp appear to prefer the habitat of other lakes over German Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2021 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Green Sunfish, Longnose Gar, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

WAE STOCKING WAS SHIFTED FROM FINGERLINGS TO FRY IN 1989 IN HOPES OF INCREASING WAE NUMBERS.  THE 1989 FRY STOCKING WAS SUCCESSFUL, WITH 3 YEARS OLDS NOW DOMINATING THE CATCH, COMPARED TO NO 2 YEARS OLDS SAMPLED FROM THE 1990 FRY STOCKING.  GROWTH APPEARS TO BE AVERAGE.  NOP HAVE REBOUNDED FROM A LOW OF 0.50/ GILL NET IN 1987 TO 8.50/GILL NET IN 1992.  THE IMPROVED NORTHERN CATCH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RETURN OF NORMAL WATER LEVELS.  THE NORTHERN POPULATION IS NOW DOMINATED BY A STRONG AGE 1 CLASS AND FEWER 2 YEAR OLDS.  BLC CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 22.25/TRAP NET IN 1987 TO 10.87/TRAP NET.  IN 1987 BLC WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-5 WITH AGE 1 DOMINATING.  BLC ARE NOW WELL REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-7 WITH AGES 2,4, AND 6 MOST ABUNDANT.  WHC HAVE SHOWN A LARGER DECLINE WITH ONLY SEVEN FISH SAMPLED IN 1992 COMPARED TO 37.92/ GILL NET SAMPLED IN 1987.  BLG HAVE EXPERIENCED A LARGE DECLINE FROM 36.87/TRAP NET IN 1987 TO 5.37/ TRAP NET.  BLG ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-6 WITH 1 AND 4 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT.  BLGS IN 1987 WERE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG AGES 1-8.  YEP SHOW LITTLE CHANGES FROM 1982, AVERAGING 7.50/GILL NET COMPARED TO 5.83/GILL NET IN 1987.  LMB AVERAGED 0.75/GILL NET, WHICH SUGGESTS A MODERATE POPULATION PRESENT.  ELECTROFISHING DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, BUT THERE ARE REPORTS OF GOOD BASS FISHING AND HABITAT IS FAVORABLE FOR THIS SPECIES. BLB HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 6.50/GILL NET IN 1987 TO 89.62/GILL NET.  BLH ARE DOMINATED BY 4.0-5.0 INCH FISH.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS OR SHOWING LITTLE CHANGE FROM 1987 INCLUDE FRD, BOF, CARP, WHB, BIB, LNG GAR, PMK, AND YEB.</p>",

Bluegill abundance remains good with most fish being between 5 - 7 inches and few fish exceeding 8 inches at this time.  Crappie abundance is below average but the average size is good at 8 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Other species sampled were largemouth bass, bowfin, yellow perch, black bullhead, drum, white bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, buffalo and yellow bullhead.  No carp were captured, a first for this lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on German Lake was conducted on August 9, 2018 by Waterville Area Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen stations, with a number of stations sampled by boat. Seining was completed at 12 of 14 stations. Ten stations were seined using a 50-foot seine and 2 stations were seined using the 15-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in May 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for German Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>German Lake is a mid-sized (900 acres) lake located in Le Sueur Co. southeast of Cleveland and northwest of Elysian.  A fishery survey was conducted on German Lake in late-June 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Northern pike catch per gill net increased from 1997 (3 per net) to 9.5 per net in 2002, the highest level observed for this lake.  Most of the northern pike were from 15 to 22 and 26 to 28 inches long.  Black bullhead catch per gill and trap net has decreased in the 2002 sample to an overall low level not previously observed in German Lake.  Yellow perch gill net catch was relatively high.  Most yellow perch were 5.5 to 8.5 inches long and from the 2000 year class (age 2).  Bluegill were by far the most abundant fish in trap net catches.  Most bluegill were from 6 to 8 inches long.  Walleye abundance has been stable in German Lake over the past few fishery surveys.  In 2002, most walleye were between 13 and 22 inches long.  Eurasian milfoil was found along the west shore and in the southeast bay in 2002.  This is the first occurrence (along with adjacent East Jefferson Lake) of this exotic plant in Le Sueur Co.  Anglers should make sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving German Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian milfoil to other lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>German Lake in LeSueur County is an 899 acre lake located northwest of Elysian.  Average depth is 13.0 feet and maximum depth is 51.0 feet.  A DNR-owned public access is located on the north side of the lake off LeSueur County Road 12.  German Lake is connected to the Jefferson chain of lakes to the west, and is within the Cannon River major watershed.  German Lake is managed to provide a bluegill and crappie fishery with secondary opportunities for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  German Lake was surveyed the week of June 17th, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap- and gill-nets to monitor the fish community. <br> \n  <br> \nPanfish including bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch were the most commen fish species observed during the 2013 survey.  Bluegills were the most numerous fish in the assessment in both trap net and gill net catches, which revealed above average abundances for this lake class.  Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 18.0 fish/gill net and 40 fish/trap net lift.  Mean total length of bluegill was near 7.0 inches for both gear types, which is indicative of \"quality\" length in terms of size structure indices.  Black crappie abundance was within the normal range for this lake type at 6.0 fish/gillnet.  Trap nets were not as effective as gill nets at capturing black crappie during this survey; black crappies were caught in the trap nets at a rate of 0.9 fish/trap net.  Black crappie ranged in length from 5.0 to 11.0 inches, with the mean length of 8.0 inches.  Yellow perch were captured at a rate of 8.0 fish per gill net, a decrease from the 2008 assessment and slightly below average for this lake type.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.0 to 8.5 inches. Overall panfish abundance during 2013 was at or above normal compared to similar lakes in Minnesota, but still lower than historic levels for German Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye abundance was low in 2013 at 0.6 fish/gillnet, a value that is in the lower quartile range for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Of the six walleye sampled, lengths ranged from 15.0 to 24.0 inches and most were above the \"preferred\" length (20 inches) in terms of size structure indices.  Walleye averaged 2.6 pounds which was in the upper quartile range for lake class 24.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at German Lake to sustain the population and minimal natural reproduction of walleye is likely occurring.  Walleye fry are stocked three out of four years. <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundances was near record low levels for this lake in 2013 with an average catch rate was 1.9 fish/gill net and 4.9 fish/trap net.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 7.0 to 14.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nGerman Lake features a good northern pike population relative to area lakes.  Northern Pike averaged 9.9 fish per gill net lift in 2013, which was above average for this lake type and the highest abundance ever observed in German Lake.  Pike ranged from 17.0 to 33.0 inches in total length, with a mean total length of about 23.0 inches.  Average weight of sampled northern pike was 2.7 lbs, which is in the normal range for this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly five largemouth bass were captured in nets during the 2013 survey.  However, largemouth bass typically are not effectively sampled by nets; thus, these numbers may not reflect true abundance.  The Jefferson chain and German Lake remain popular largemouth bass destinations and location of bass angling tournaments which indicates that the lakes supports fishable bass populations.  Spring electrofishing should be conducted to properly assess the largemouth bass population in the Jefferson Lake chain. <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie and channel catfish had been previously sampled in German lake, although none were observed in 2013.  Other fish observed in the 2013 survey included common carp, white sucker, bowfin (dogfish), bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum, yellow bullhead, white bass, longnose gar, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil was discovered in the lake in 2002.  Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment when leaving German Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in German Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural, undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork, Fisheries Specialist. <br> \n</p>",

A DNR-owned public access is located on the north side of the lake off Le Sueur County Road 12.  German Lake is connected to the Jefferson chain of lakes to the west, and is within the Cannon River major watershed.  German Lake is managed to provide a Bluegill and crappie fishery with secondary opportunities for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was performed the week of June 18th, 2018 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill-nets as well as spring electrofishing to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nGerman Lake has historically produced quality Black Crappies. Black Crappie were sampled at a rate of 6.5/trap net in 2018. Black Crappies were also sampled very effectively with gill nets, and were captured at a rate of 38.4/gill net. Black Crappie were sampled in many length groups. Black Crappie ranged from 4.1 to 11.1 inches and averaged 7.3 inches in gill nets. Trap nets sampled slightly larger Black Crappies that ranged from 3.5 to 11.9 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled at a rate of 36.3/trap net in 2018, which was slightly lower than in 2013 (40.2/trap net). Bluegills ranged from 0.7 to 8.9 inches in length and averaged 6.6 inches in 2018. Seven year classes of Bluegill were sampled in 2018 (2011-2017). All year classes were fairly even in abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates increased slightly from the 2013 survey, from 0.6/gill net in 2013 to 1.3/gill net in 2018. Walleye ages were estimated using scales and otoliths. Three year classes of Walleye were present (2012, 2014-2015). Although sample size was small, Walleye size structure was good. Walleyes ranged from 17.0 to 28.5 inches and averaged 21.0 inches. Walleye growth was fast in German Lake as fish averaged 12.6 inches at age-2 and 17.1 inches at age-3.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are secondary management species on German Lake and were assessed using day-time electrofishing. The electrofishing catch rate for Largemouth Bass was 18.7/hour. Average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2018 was 13.1 inches and ranged from 6.7 to 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been had a stable population in German Lake and the trend continued in 2018 with a catch rate of 3.9/gill net. Northern Pike sampled with gill nets ranged from 20.9 to 34.1 inches in length. Fifty-three percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than the 24-inch minimum length limit. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for German Lake. Anglers are allowed 2 fish per day. All Northern Pike under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch catch rate (14.0/gill net) increased from 2013 (8.1/gill net). Yellow Perch were small, with few fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.1 to 10.0 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum historically have had a moderate abundance in German Lake.  In 2018 the catch rate was an all-time high of 20.3/gill net.  Drum caught in gill nets ranged from 1.7 inches to 20.5 inches, and averaged 15.7 inches.  Four drum were aged using otoliths, age classes represented by these fish included 1986, 1992, 2016, and 2017. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed, Longnose Gar, Bowfin (dogfish), Yellow Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and White Bass were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellow, specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
