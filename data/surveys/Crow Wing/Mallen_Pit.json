The maximum water depth is over 80 ft and the water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  A carry-in access is located on County Road 127.   <br> \n <br> \nMallen is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.  The paved Cuyuna Lakes State Trail is located just north of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community in Mallen Mine Lake was conducted in August 2012.  The total catch in the gill nets was an average of 28.5 fish per set which was moderately high compared to other Cuyuna mine pit lakes where average gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 63 total fish per net in recent surveys (median of 10.5 fish per net).  Most of the gill net catch was bluegills.  Only one 10-inch brook trout was captured and that was an age-1 fish from the early April 2012 stocking of 406 yearling Minnesota Wild strain fish.  Other species captured in the gill nets include largemouth bass and northern pike.  The trap net catch was also mostly bluegills with most measuring from 5 to 8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles were measured on August 14, 2012 to monitor habitat for trout.  Optimal temperature and oxygen conditions for brook trout (10-16 C, greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 11 vertical ft, from a depth of about 24 ft through nearly 34 ft.  Oxygen was adequate for trout (greater than 5 ppm) down to a depth of 43 ft where the temperature was 6.9 C.   <br> \n <br> \nTrout stocking began in 1988 and usually about 400 yearling brook trout have been stocked each spring.   <br> \n</p>",
