Northern Pike numbers were below average (2.8/gill net), but average size was nice at 23.9\" and 29% of the fish were above the 22-26\" slot.  Largemouth Bass similarly were found in lower numbers while electrofishing at 23.8/hour.  However, average length was 14.8\" and 57% were 15\" or larger with fish up to 19.5\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for both Bluegill (20.2/trap net) and Black Crappie (1.8/gill net).  There are some harvestable fish present as 33% of the Bluegills were over 7\" and 43% of the Black Crappies were over 8\". <br> \n</p>",

Bottom substrate in the shoal waters (less than 4 feet) was primarily sand, with scattered areas of muck.  The aquatic plant community consisted of over 19 species. Curlyleaf pondweed, an exotic plant was found around much of the shoreline. Lakeshore owners with a DNR issued permit have been applying chemicals to attempt to control the plant.  The northern pike population was moderate at 4.5/gill net.  Three past surveys had catch rates of 8.2/gill net (1969) to 15.0/gill net (1990). The 2007 size distribution was from 18.7 to 29.1 inches and 15 % were 24.0 inches or larger. Black crappie were present in very good numbers, with gill net catch of 5.0/gill net a all-time high for this lake and the trap net catch rates were within range of past nettings.  A total of 19.0% were greater than 8.0 inches. Bluegill abundance was moderate and comparable to past surveys, with average size only 5.2 inches in the trap net. The 1969 survey had 35% of the bluegill captured at 8.0 inches or greater. The 2007 survey had none.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Sebie Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 13-14 June 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat due to the soft deep sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of Sebie Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by an FIBI score very near to the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
