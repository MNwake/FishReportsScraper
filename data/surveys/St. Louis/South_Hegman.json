There are several small islands and the shoreline is primarily rocky with a thick coniferous forest present.  <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by a 80 rod portage from the Echo Trail (CR116). There are 3 designated USFS campsites  located on the lake. South Hegman is a popular lake for visitors seeking a wilderness type experience without too much effort. It receives alot of use from visitors travelling through to view the pictographs on North Hegman. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 population assessment included catches of northern pike and smallmouth bass. One large (25.6 inch) walleye was sampled. Yellow perch, cisco and white sucker were also sampled in relatively low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (1.5/gill net) were higher than the long term average (0.5/gill net) for all assessments on this lake. Pike sizes averaged a respectable 29.4 inches and the largest pike sampled was 37.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers in 2014 (0.7/gill net) were similar to the long term average (0.6/gill net) for all assessments on this lake. The average smallmouth sampled  was 10.9 inches long and about 4 to 5 years old. The largest smallmouth sampled was 15.3 inches long and 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
