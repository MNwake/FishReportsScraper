Northern pike and largemouth bass were the primary sport fish present in 2000.       Northern pike numbers and growth rate were above average.  Numbers of largemouth bass appeared to be slightly below average.  However, many year-classes were present and should provide consistent fishing in the future.  Sunfish and yellow perch were present, but small.     Warclub Lake is attractive not only because of its fishing opportunities, but also offers solitude, scenic beauty, and access to other lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>War Club Lake is an 80 acre lake with good water clarity and a maximum depth of 40 feet. War Club Lake is located approximately 18 miles ESE of International Falls on the Kabetogama peninsula in Voyageurs National Park. War Club Lake is accessed via a shallow channel from Locator Lake which is accessed via portage trails from Kabetogama or Rainy Lakes. War Club Lake can also be accessed in the winter via the Chain of Lakes snowmobile trail. To prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species and exotic viruses, anglers are only allowed to use artificial baits. In addition, no privately-owned watercraft (boats, canoes, kayaks, etc.) or float planes are allowed on interior lakes such as War Club Lake. A standard survey was completed in War Club Lake in mid-July of 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nWar Club Lake has no special regulations. Fishing regulations follow statewide regulations for inland water. Previous management plans identify several long-range goals, including providing a self-sustaining fish community with Northern Pike as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rate was 4.0 fish per net, which was below average from recent surveys. Total length ranged from 18.1 to 34.8 inches, with an average length of 22.8 inches. Average weight was 2.5 pounds and was above average compared to similar lakes. A total of six year-classes were present and ranged from 3-10 years. Although Northern Pike numbers are down from recent surveys, there are good numbers of younger fish that should be recruiting to the larger size classes in the coming years.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gill net catch rate was 0.7 fish per net, which was below average compared to similar lakes. Largemouth bass do not sample well in passive gears such as gill nets, so active gears such as angling are typically utilized. Largemouth Bass angling catch rate was 1.5 fish per hour, which was slightly below the catch rate from the 2010 survey. Total length ranged from 7.9 to 19.3 inches, with an average of 13.5 inches. Average weight was 1.5 pounds, which was higher than the average from previous surveys. A total of seven year-classes were present and ranged from 2-10 years. Growth rates are above average compared to other area lakes and there are good numbers of quality fish providing a unique opportunity for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco were also present and provide quality forage for top predators in War Club Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

Length ranged from 9.4-15.0 inches and age ranged from 3-5 years.  The 2006 year-class was the strongest and represented 60% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the area and statewide averages.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was slightly above the normal range for this lake type.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  The 2007 year-class was strongest and represented 29% of the sample.  Trophy-sized northern pike are present and a 39.0 inch fish was sampled during the investigation.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed, rock bass, and tullibee were also captured.  Bluegill and yellow perch were not captured during this investigation, but low numbers have been captured in the past.   <br> \n</p>",
