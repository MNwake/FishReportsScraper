There is a state easement in the northwest corner of the lake but most of the land is private (Tribal Land).  The fish community is dominated by black and brown bullheads, however black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, and white suckers were sampled in 2001.  Northern pike were sampled in 1968, but were not collected in the 2001 lake survey.  There are limited sport angling opportunities on Bang Lake at the current time, and the lakes small size and abundant bullhead population probably will limit its potential to provide good angling opportunities in the future.</p>",
