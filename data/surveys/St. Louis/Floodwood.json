                "narrative": "<p>Floodwood is a 328 acre lake located east of Goodland, MN and is in ecological lake class 5.  There is no public access on the lake.  At the time of this assessment there was not a management plan developed for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill-net catch rate was 2.3/net while the trap-net catch rate was 1.5/net.  Both catch rates were near their respective lake class medians.  Fish sampled in gill nets ranged from 6.8 to 10.1 inches and had a mean length of 8.7 inches while trap-net fish had a similar size distribution.  Five year-classes from age 2 to age 6 were sampled.  Age-6 fish were the most prevalent, representing 68% of the sample.  Based on mean back-calculated lengths, growth was slower than the reported means for 11 class 5 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap-net catch was the second highest ever observed for the lake at 17.9 fish/net.  The catch approached the lake class 3rd quartile value of 21.2/net.  The fish ranged from 3.4 to 8.3 inches and had a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified ranging from 2 to 11 years old.  The 2001 year class represented 42% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the median back-calculated lengths for class 5 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing for the first time in 2008.  Electrofishing resulted in the capture of 94 largemouth bass for an on-time catch rate of 94.0 fish/hr.  The fish ranged from 4.6 to 17.4 inches and had a mean length of 9.8 inches.  The population appeared to have fairly consistent recruitment for the last nine years.  Seven year-classes were identified with the 2005 and 2006 year-classes representing 44 and 26% of the sample, respectively.  The large year classes in recent years has been observed on other local lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 fish/net since 1956 and were the lowest on record in 2008.  Although the 2008 catch was lower, all catch rates have been near the lake class median (3.2 fish/net) to 3rd quartile value (5.5 fish/net).  The sampled fish ranged from 15.5 to 30.9 inches and had a mean length of 21.4 inches.  Four age-classes were sampled from 1 to 4 years old.  Recruitment appears to be quite low in recent years.  One and two year old fish represented 38 and 46% of the sample.  Growth was above statewide averages for all ages.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included black bullhead, common shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the edge of the water, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",
