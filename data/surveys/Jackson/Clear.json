                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population density on Clear Lake near Jackson appears to be relatively high compared to other area lakes.  The average walleye gill net catch per net was 13.25 fish per net set which compared favorably to previous surveys.  The highest historical average gill net catch rate was 18 fish/net set in 1990.  Additionally, the walleye size structure appears to be healthy.  Total lengths of walleye ranged between 9.0 and 27.0 inches, with an average of 18.7.  Eight year classes of walleye were recorded while the 1995 and 1996 year classes dominated.  The fact that numerous year classes of walleyes were captured indicates good long-term survival and stability in the population.  Electrofishing conducted in the fall of 1997 indicated some natural reproduction had occurred in 1996 (99 fish/hour) and 1997 (122 fish/hour) because walleyes were not stocked in those years.  Survival of walleyes from both natural recruitment (natural reproduction) and supplemental recruitment (stocking) has provided fish for future brood stock and even angler's creels.  Efforts to document if and how much natural reproduction of walleye may allow more efficient management of a quality walleye population.  Like most yellow perch fisheries in the prairie pothole region, the Clear Lake population has been prone to high and low densities.  The average yellow perch gill net catch rate was 68.75 fish/net set which was considerably high compared to other area lakes.  With management efforts, yellow perch numbers have steadily increased for each survey since 1990.  Yellow perch have not been stocked since 1984 however one young of the year yellow perch was sampled shoreline seining in 1999.  This would indicate there is some natural reproduction of yellow perch in 1999.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 5.5 and 11.0 inches, with an average of 7.8.  Yellow perch fishing should be decent for at least the next few years as those younger fish move through the population.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake is a 415-acre lake located four miles west of the City of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  Similar to other lakes in the area, the water is turbid throughout much of the year as evidenced by a Secchi depth of 1.2 feet in early June of 2015.  Clear Lake has historically been a good Walleye fishery and therefore is managed primarily for Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  The current management plan calls for Walleye fry to be stocked 3 of 4 years (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 etc.). Northern Pike are stocked when there is a surplus available.  Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2005, 2007, and 2010, and Northern Pike adults were stocked in 2010 and 2013.  Clear Lake was surveyed the week of June 1, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nSince 1982, catch rates of Walleye in Clear Lake have varied from 1.7 per gill net in 2003 to 18.0 per gill net in 1990, and have averaged 9.3 per gill net.  The 2015 Walleye catch rate of 4.0 per gill net was the second lowest catch rate observed on Clear Lake, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  The trap net catch rate of Walleye in 2015 was 2.4 per trap net, which is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.3 to 2.0 per trap net).  Walleye captured in gill nets ranged from 12.1 to 22.6 inches and averaged 14.6 inches.  Trap netted Walleye were smaller ranging in length from 11.6 to 14.5 inches and averaging 13.0 inches.  Four year classes of Walleye were sampled (2007, 2009, 2010, and 2013), all of which corresponded to stocking events.  Age-2 walleye dominated the catch, accounting for 77 percent of the aged fish.  Lengths at age were 9.7 inches at age-1, 12.5 inches at age-2, 15.0 inches at age-3, 16.6 inches at age-4, 18.4 inches at age-5, and 19.3 inches at age-6.  When compared to growth of Walleye from other class 43 lakes, growth of Walleye in Clear Lake is slow to age-4, and average thereafter.  The current stocking of fry at a rate of 500 per littoral acre, 3 out of 4 years appears to be an effective strategy on Clear Lake, despite the relatively low catch rate observed in 2015.  High fishing pressure and subsequent high harvest rates likely account for the \"below average\" catch rate.  On opening day of the 2011 angling season, word got out of a hot walleye bite at Clear Lake, which attracted nearly 100 boats to the 415-acre lake.  Similarly, anglers reported good fishing during the 2015 angling opener, likely removing a large portion of the population.  Beginning in 2016, Clear Lake is going to be stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry (500 per littoral acre).  This is the same strain of Walleye that has persisted in Lake Sarah (Murray County) without any stocking for decades.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nSince 1982, Northern Pike catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1993 to 5.0 per gill net in 1982, and have averaged 1.4 per gill net.  In 2015, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 3.3 per gill net, which is the highest catch rate observed in the past 20 years, and is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net).  This increase in abundance is likely a result of the winter rescue adult northern pike (317; approx. a pound apiece) that were stocked in 2013.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 19.1 to 22.1 inches and averaged 20.8 inches, further suggesting that these fish were from the 2013 adult stocking.  Northern pike were very plump and are not struggling to find food in Clear Lake.  Northern Pike fingerling stocking was tried in the mid to late 2000's, with little to no success.  It appears that, when available, stocking adult winter rescue pike is an effective way to maintain the Northern Pike population in Clear Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Clear Lake has been highly variable, ranging from 0.3 per gill net in 1990 to 263.0 per gill net in 1987, and averaging 47.1 per gill net since 1982.  More recently since 2001, Yellow Perch catch rates have averaged 18.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  The 2015 catch rate of 4.3 per gill net was near the lower end of the expected range and was the lowest catch rate observed in the past 20 years.  Size structure of Yellow Perch was balanced as lengths ranged from 7.2 to 12.6 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  Adults capable of reproducing are present in the system, and will likely maintain the Yellow Perch population.  In future years, if the catch rate of Yellow Perch drops below 3.3 per gill net, adult Yellow Perch could be stocked to boost the population.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Crappie decreased from 5.1 per trap net in 2011 to 0.6 per trap net in 2015, and was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 11.7 to 12.6 inches and averaged 12.3 inches.  Catch rates of Black Crappie in Clear Lake have consistently been near the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 per trap net) since surveys began in 1982.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nBluegill occur at very low abundance in Clear Lake (0.5 per trap net in 2015), as historic catch rates have never exceeded the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 per trap net).  Despite being sparse, size of Bluegills was large, with some up to 9.8 inches being sampled.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance decreased from 3.0 per gill net in 2011 to 1.3 per gill net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.0 to 3.0 per gill net).  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 17.8 to 26.9 inches and averaged 21.4 inches.  Channel Catfish were first sampled in Clear Lake in 1987 and based on historical stocking records, DNR has never introduced them.  They were likely introduced during a high water event, or through an illegal stocking.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nSince 2005, the Black Bullhead trap net catch rate has been at or below the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 per trap net).  The trend continued in 2015 as Black Bullhead were captured at a rate of 6.8 per trap net.  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 10.6 to 14.1 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  Black Bullhead are likely being controlled by Walleye and Channel Catfish.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFRESHWATER DRUM <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were first sampled in Clear Lake in 1999, and were likely introduce by a flooding event or an illegal stocking.  Since the all-time high catch rate observed in 2007 (16.7 per gill net), Freshwater Drum abundance has stabilized around the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (8.4 per gill net).  The 2015 catch rate of 9.7 per gill net was near the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes, and was the second highest observed catch rate of Freshwater Drum in Clear Lake.  Lengths of Freshwater Drum ranged from 13.2 to 19.3 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.  While young-of-the-year (YOY) Freshwater Drum provide a prey item for Walleye, adult Freshwater Drum likely compete with Walleye for food.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2015 (1.9 per trap net) was consistent with catch rates since 2003, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  Common Carp lengths from trap nets ranged from 21.7 to 27.9 inches and averaged 24.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of Bigmouth Buffalo remained low as one 19.5 inch Bigmouth Buffalo was captured in the gill net.  Other species sampled included Yellow Bullhead (N=8) and White Sucker (N=9). <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  Clear Lake has historically been a good Walleye fishery and therefore is managed primarily for Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Clear Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye fry in the springs of 2016, 2017, and 2018 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Clear Lake was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has some Walleye spawning habitat for natural reproduction.  The year 2019 was a non-stocked year, thus a natural reproduction check using nighttime electrofishing was conducted on October 16, 2019 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Clear Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 41.0 per hour, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Clear Lake in 2019.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class but it's not certain.  Young-of-the-year Walleye captured ranged from 5.7 to 8.5 inches in length and averaged 7.4 inches.  While it is unlikely that LMS Walleye that were stocked in 2016 or 2017 would be sexually mature, fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2019 year class (no results to date).  <br> \n</p>",

ALL OF THE FISH COLLECTED FOR AGE ANALYSIS WERE AGE 4 OR OLDER AND 17 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  GROWTH IS NEAR THE STATE-WIDE AND LOCAL AVERAGES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGE 1985 YEAR CLASS.  THE LACK OF YOUNGER FISH (AGES 1-3) INDICATES THAT RECENT STOCKING EFFORTS AND NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECENT YEARS.  ONLY ONE YEP WAS COLLECTED DURING THE SURVEY, (CPUE=0.25 FISH/NET), FAR BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  THE 1987 SURVEY OF CLEAR LAKE YIELDED A CPUE OF 263 FISH PER NET, PLACING IT AMONG THE BEST YEP POPULATIONS IN THE AREA.  THE APPARENT COLLAPSE OF THE YEP POPULATION MAY EITHER BE A RESULT OF POOR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS DUE TO LOW WATER LEVELS, HEAVY FISHING PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE PREDATION BY LARGE WAE AND NOP OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS.  TWO NOP WERE CAUGHT IN GILL NETS, YIELDING A CPUE BELOW THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN OF 2.7 FISH PER NET AND THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.10 FISH PER NET.  NOP STOCKED AS ADULTS MAKE UP THE CURRENT POPULATION IN CLEAR LAKE.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS LOW, IF IT EXISTS AT ALL.  THIS IS DUE PRIMARILY TO LACK OF SUITABLE SPAWNING HABITAT IN THE LAKE.  NOP IN CLEAR LAKE EXHIBIT POOR CONDITION FACTORS, INDICATING THAT THE FORAGE BASE IS INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION.  THE 1984 STOCKING MAY HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON YELLOW PERCH POPULATION.  BLC AND LMB WERE ALSO CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY, YIELDING CATCH RATES OF 0.25 AND 0.38 FISH PER TRAP NET RESPECTIVELY, THE BLC CPUE WAS FAR BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 6.00, HOW- EVER THE LMB CPUE WAS ONLY SLIGHTY BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE BLC POPULATION IS THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION WHERE AS THE LMB ARE PROBABLY THE RESULT OF A 1985 STOCKING OF FINGERLINGS.  THE BLB CPUE WAS 236 PER TRAP NET, EXCEEDING THE LOCAL MEDIAN BY NEARLY 250 PERCENT.  THE MAJORITY OF BLB SAMPLED WERE BETWEEN 5 AND 6 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  CAP AND CCF WERE ALSO COLLECTED DURING THE SURVEY.  HOWEVER, NEITHER SPECIES REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THE CLEAR LAKE FISH COMMUNITY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in Jackson County four miles west of the city of Jackson, has surface area of 415 acres, and a maximum depth of 9 feet. Clear Lake has a very small watershed consisting mostly of cultivated land. This gives Clear Lake the unique opportunity of benefitting greatly from Aquatic Management Area purchases or other land set aside programs. In recent years, Clear Lake has developed heavy blue-green algae blooms. This became very apparent when dense mats of algae collected on our sampling nets possibly causing catch rates to drop from 77 fish per gill net in 2001 to 48 in 2003.The walleye catch rate was poor for lakes similar to Clear. Lengths of walleye ranged from 9.2 to 21.8 inches with an average length of 13.7. Although past natural reproduction has been good, recent walleye stocking has consisted of 556,080 fry in 2003, 21,974 fingerlings in 2001, and 330,150 fry in 1999. Angler reports of numerous small walleye being caught in 2002 and early 2003 suggest a good population. The low walleye net catch was most likely caused by thick mats of algae that collected on the our nets, making them more visible and less likely to catch fish.The yellow perch catch rate was above average for lakes similar to Clear. Lengths of yellow perch averaged 9.6 inches. Catches of nice sized perch were reported by anglers during the fall of 2002 and spring of 2003.Black bullhead are sought after by many local anglers and Clear Lake remains a great destination choice. A good number of large black bullheads are swimming in Clear. Lengths of black bullhead averaged 11.3 inches. Clear Lake presently harbors a quality black bullhead fishery.The population of bigmouth buffalo and freshwater drum have slowly increased their relative abundance since first being sampled in 1997 and 1999 surveys. They most likely entered Clear Lake from Loon Lake during the high water of the spring of 1997. Other species of fish sampled during the assessment included brown bullhead , black crappie, common carp, channel catfish, largemouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in Jackson County four miles west of the city of Jackson, has surface area of 415 acres, and a maximum depth of 9 feet. Clear Lake is primarily managed for walleye with yellow perch and northern pike as secondary species. Clear Lake has a small watershed giving it the unique opportunity to benefit significantly from Aquatic Management Area purchase or any type of land set aside program. Clear Lake has two public boat accesses, a fishing pier, and ample shoreline available for angling. Electrofishing done in the fall of 2004 and 2005 revealed massive numbers of small sheephead and fathead minnows. Northern pike were stocked in hopes they will utilize this large forage base. A population assessment was conducted on Clear Lake during the week of 07/05/05. Three gill nets and nine trap nets were used to assess the fish population.The walleye catch rate was average for lakes similar to Clear, and increased from the 2003 survey. Lengths of walleye ranged from 17.3 to 25.3 inches with an average length of 19.1. The average walleye swimming in Clear weighs over three pounds. Recent walleye stockings include 9960 fingerlings in 2005 and 556,080 fry in 2003.The yellow perch abundance is average. What is not average is the weight of a typical Clear Lake perch, which exceeds half a pound. Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 8.7 to12.7 inches and averaged 10.5. Clear has continued to show great natural reproduction with five year classes present. When the perch decide to \"turn on\" a quality fishery should be available now and in the near future.Clear Lake has always been known for nice black bullheads and right now is no exception. The average black bullhead measured 11.2 inches with a few individuals over 14 inches. Although the numbers are down from the last assessment in 2003, spring and fall anglers are catching good numbers of black bullheads.Northern pike numbers have increased and seem to be doing quite well. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 15.7 to 34.0 inches and averaged 21.2. In 2004 northern pike were added as management species to provide additional angling opportunity and hopefully utilize the abundant forage available particular fathead minnows and small sheephead. 4307 northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2004 followed by 4277 in 2005. 75 % of the pike sampled related to the 2004 stocking. The chances of a fishable northern population in the near future look promising.Other species sampled during the assessment include bluegill, black crappie, common carp, channel catfish, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear is a 415-acre located three miles west of the city of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Clear is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch and northern pike are managed secondarily.  The lake is presently stocked with walleye fry 3 or 4 years at 500 fish per littoral acre in an effort to boost walleye abundance and numbers of year classes.  Because of Clear Lake's popularity, the fish population is assessed every other year. <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has an average walleye population when compared to other lakes similar to Clear Lake.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 7.6 to 25.9 inches and averaged 12.9 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled were age 1 and more than likely resulted from a fry stocking in 2008 which was the first year of a new management plan to stock 500 walleye fry per littoral acre 3 out of 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nWe would also consider the yellow perch population average when compared to other lakes similar to Clear Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 7.9 to 11.9 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  There was a fair number of yellow perch in the 7.9 to just under 12 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are managed as a secondary species in Clear Lake and were stocked with fingerlings in 2004, 2005, and 2007.  Only one 32.44 inch northern pike was sampled during the 2009 assessment and that was with a trap net.  The northern pike gill net CPUE was 0.00 in 2009 compared to 0.33 in 2007, 2.33 in 2005, and 0.14 in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill are present in Clear Lake but in low numbers.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 6.3 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Lengths of bluegill caught in our nets ranged from7.4 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are also low in Clear Lake but the lengths are impressive.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 11.0 to 13.2 inches and averaged 12.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, channel catfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Clear Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 415-acre, class 43 lake, located four miles west of the City of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  Clear Lake has historically been a good Walleye fishery and therefore is managed primarily for Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Due to the documentation of sporadic natural reproduction based on previous surveys on Clear Lake, it was selected, along with 5 other lakes in the Windom area, to introduce a unique strain of Walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of other strains of Walleye in MN.  Clear Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye fry in the spring of 2016 and the spring of 2017 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Clear Lake was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on September 6, 2017 to determine if the 2017 fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 292.0 per hour, which is an extremely high catch rate, and indicates that the fry stocking was successful, natural reproduction occurred, or a combination of the two.  Walleye tissue samples were collected on 50 of the age-0 walleye captured and genetically tested.  Over 88% of those samples showed they were a byproduct of our fry stocking.  Walleye fingerlings ranged in length from 6.7 to 8.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Clear Lake is scheduled to be stocked with LMS fry 3 out of 4 years beginning in 2016.  There are now two strong Lower Mississippi Strain year classes in Clear Lake, as the electrofishing catch rate of Walleye fingerlings in 2016 was 211.8 per hour.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring the spring of 2016, an angler reported catching two adult Yellow Bass at Clear Lake, but did not save them for confirmation.  During the September electrofishing survey in 2016, YOY Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake. During the 2017 electrofishing survey, YOY and slightly larger Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake, indicating that they are successfully reproducing. <br> \n</p>",

Results, however, from our survey in 1993 indicate that the walleye numbers are average for similar lakes but the size of the walleye are small.  The average weight of walleye are about 1/2 lb. while the average length is about 10 inches.  Walleye in the 19-24 inch range are present but appear to be low in numbers.  Age 1 and age 2 walleye (7-12 inches in length) dominated the population.  Some of these fish should be around 1 lb. during the 1994 fishing season.Yellow perch populations are good for lakes similar to Clear Lake.  The average weight of the yellow perch in Clear were just over 1/2 lb. and the lengths ranged from 7-12 inches.  Yellow perch fishing should be very good in 1994.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a shallow prairie lake located four miles west of the City of Jackson.  Primary fisheries management is for walleye while yellow perch receive secondary attention.  As of the summer of 1997, the Clear Lake walleye population was in good shape.  Survey nets indicated walleye numbers were average compared to lakes similar to Clear Lake.  Walleye numbers exceeded the goal set for this lake in the DNR management plan.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 to 27 inches but 80% of the fish were 16 inches or larger.Walleye age analysis indicated fish from one to eight years old were present.  Walleye were also aged from years when stocking did not occur, indicating the presence of natural reproduction.  In addition, fall electrofishing found substantial walleye natural reproduction during 1996 and 1997.  Determining the frequency and number of fish produced from natural reproduction continues to be a high priority at the Windom Area Office.  Further research into natural reproduction should allow us to more efficiently manage Clear Lake for a quality walleye population.The yellow perch population has experienced extreme highs and lows in recent years.  It is not uncommon for yellow perch numbers to fluctuate in southwestern Minnesota lakes.  Since 1990, survey nets have indicated the population has rebounded from a very low level.  In 1997, yellow perch were primarily two and three years old and ranged from 6 to 9 inches long.  Shoreline seining also resulted in a good number of young-of-the-year yellow perch during the summer.  The next couple of years should provide decent fishing.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

The lake is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  A fair population of largemouth bass and northern pike are also present.The walleye catch rate was good for lakes similar to Clear.  Several different sizes of walleye were observed during the survey.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.8 to 20.1 inches with an average length of 12.4 inches.The yellow perch catch rate was high for lakes similar to Clear.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.6 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.Black bullhead are sought after frequently by some area anglers.  A fair number of black bullhead are present in Clear Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 4.4 to 12.6 inches with and average length of 10.4 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediments and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake, near the town of Jackson, is a 415-acre, class 43 lake at the top of the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed.  It has had a history of low dissolved oxygen during winter as it has been opened to liberalized fishing nine times since 1949.  A helixor aeration system was installed in 1977 and the lake has not been opened to liberalized fishing since, with the exception of 1979 due to an aeration malfunction.  Despite it\u0019s name, Clear Lake has had a history of heavy algae blooms.  The duration and frequency of algae blooms is somewhat surprising given the lake\u0019s location within the watershed.  Typically, lakes near the top of watersheds have lower amounts of surface water runoff, which translates to lower nutrient inputs.  Clear Lake has been surveyed every two years since 1997.  Fisheries employees, during the surveys, have been concerned about the catchability of fish in nets because of the heavy algae blooms.  The nets often become covered in algae, which may influence catchability of fish.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 9, 2007 using three gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range, but has not change since the 2005 survey.  The lake management goal strives for a catch rate of 12 walleye/net or higher, which has not happened since 1999.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 1.7 (2003) to 18/net set (1990).  Total lengths of walleye captured ranged from 12.4 to 23.3 with an average of 15.7 inches in 2007.  The condition of walleye was good, which indicated the fish were finding plenty of forage.  Growth of walleye is good as an Age 2 fish was 14.7 inches and an Age 5 fish was 22.4 inches in length.  Walleye fry (1000/littoral acre) or fingerlings (up to 2 lbs/littoral acre) are to be stocked every other year.  Although there is plenty of forage in Clear Lake and it may be difficult to get them to bite, the walleye that are caught could be \"keepers\".   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were within the expected range (2.7-25 fish/set).  The yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 16.7/set with an average total length of 8.8 inches.   Based on the lengths of the fish that were sampled, it is likely that all of the fish were from 1-year class of fish.  The condition of the perch sampled indicated the fish were finding plenty of forage.  Although the numbers of perch are good enough to produce some descent fishing, it is likely the fishing could be \"spotty\" as there is plenty of forage in Clear Lake. <br> \n <br> \nDue to the large forage base (small freshwater drum and fatheads), northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2004, 2005, and 2007.  Despite 3 years of stocking, the abundance of northern pike was not within the expected range in 2007.  Total lengths of northern pike sampled ranged from 25.2 to 30.1 inches with a mean of 27.6 inches.  Although the numbers are not great, the northerns that could be caught are respectable.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in both gill nets and trap nets was lower than expected.  Total lengths of bullheads in gill nets ranged from 8.5 to 12.6 inches with an average of 11.0 inches.  Although netting indicated the numbers are down, the sizes of bullheads are desirable for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe freshwater drum catch rate was the highest recorded catch rate in Clear Lake since 1999, when they were first sampled.  Catch rates have ranged from 1.4 to 16.7/gill net with an average length of 11.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate has also never been higher.  Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.1 (1993) to 3.3/set (2007).  It is likely these fish entered Clear Lake through the outlet from Loon Lake during the high water of 1993.  Total lengths ranged from 10.9 to 19.4 inches with a mean of 15.6 inches.  There is the possibility of getting into a few of these good-sized fish during those hot summer days of summer.   <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos     <br> \n <br> \n         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  Clear Lake has historically been a good Walleye fishery and therefore is managed primarily for Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Due to the documentation of sporadic natural reproduction based on previous surveys on Clear Lake, it was selected, along with 5 other lakes in the Windom area, to introduce a unique strain of Walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of other strains of Walleye in MN.  Clear Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye fry in the spring of 2016 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Clear Lake was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on September 29, 2016 to determine if the 2016 fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 211.8 per hour, which is an extremely high catch rate, and indicates that the fry stocking was successful, natural reproduction occurred, or a combination of the two.  A subsample of those YOY Walleye were collected during the survey that will determine whether these fish were stocked or a by-product of natural reproduction.  Walleye fingerlings ranged in length from 6.1 to 8.3 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Clear Lake is scheduled to be stocked with LMS fry 3 out of 4 years beginning in 2016.  If they survive the winter, the 2016 year class should be a very strong year class in the Clear Lake Walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring the spring of 2016, an angler reported catching two adult Yellow Bass at Clear Lake, but did not save them for confirmation.  During the September electrofishing survey, YOY Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake, marking the first time that this species has been captured in this waterbody.  <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured six species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1), Common Carp (N=1), Northern Pike (N=1), Smallmouth Bass (N=7), Largemouth Bass (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=30).  Electrofishing captured nine species of fish, including Bluegill (N=4), Channel Catfish (N=1), Common Carp (N=1), Fathead Minnow (N=4), Green Sunfish (N=2), Largemouth Bass (N=15), Smallmouth Bass (N=9), Yellow Bullhead (N=2), and Yellow Perch (N=8).  Natural reproduction exists for some species of fish in Clear Lake, as young-of-the-year Bigmouth Buffalo, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Clear Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. Clear Lake had an IBI score of 10, which is below the impairment threshold. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 415-acre lake, located four miles west of the City of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles. Water clarity was good during the survey in early June, with a Secchi disk reading of 3.5 feet.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and has historically been a good Walleye fishery. Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  The current management plan calls for Walleye fry to be stocked 3 of 4 years (2024, 2025, 2026 and 2028) at 500 per littoral acre. Northern Pike are stocked when there is surplus fingerlings and winter rescue adults are available.  Clear Lake was surveyed the week of June 5, 2023, to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThee 2023 Walleye catch rate was the lowest rate ever recorded at Clear Lake at 1.7 per gill net. Historically, catch rates of Walleye have varied from 1.7 per gill net in 2003 and 2023 to 18.0 per gill net in 1990, and have averaged 9.3 per gill net.  The catch was also below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), but lack of fish movement during the survey week may have resulted in low catches, as abundant adult Walleye were observed during a fall electrofishing survey.  Walleye ranged in total length from 13.6 to 24.6 inches and averaged 20.0 inches. Four year classes were sampled (2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019) in the June survey and all were stocked years except for 2019 (1 fish).  A natural reproduction check was done in the fall of 2023, during which Young of the Year Walleye were sampled at a rate of 140.0 per hour of electrofishing.  We know catch rates of Age-0 Walleye at 30 per hour can produce great fishing at times.  Clear Lake Walleye successfully reproduced in 2023 and likely will bode well for the Walleye population in the future for anglers.    <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2023, catch rates of Northern Pike have varied from 0.0 per gill net in both 1993 and 2019 to 5.0 per gill net in 1982 and have averaged 1.3 per gill net.  The 2023 catch rate of 7.7 Northern Pike per gill net is the highest on record at Clear Lake and is likely the result of stocking advanced stage fingerlings in 2021.  Additional large fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2023, so Clear Lake's Northern Pike population is in good shape.  Spawning habitat for Northern Pike is very limited in Clear Lake, so the population is highly dependent on maintenance stockings.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 19.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 22.4 inches.  Clear Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Clear Lake has been highly variable, ranging from 0.3 per gill net in 1990 to 263.0 per gill net in 1987, and averaging 41.5 per gill net since 1982.  No Yellow Perch were captured in the 2023 survey.  Again, this may be an instance where the fish were not moving during the survey week, nonetheless pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch will be stocked in the spring of 2024. <br> \n <br> \nIn the spring of 2016, an angler reported catching two adult Yellow Bass at Clear Lake, but did not keep them for confirmation.  During the September electrofishing survey in 2016, young-of-the-year (YOY) Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake. During several subsequent fall electrofishing surveys, YOY and older Yellow Bass have been observed throughout the lake, indicating that natural reproduction is occurring.  In 2023, Yellow Bass were captured at a rate of 10.3 per gill net, an increase from the 2019 catch rate of 4.7 per gill net. Although Yellow Bass abundance increased from the previous survey, the magnitude of the increase is not as large as what we have seen in other new illegal introductions in southwest Minnesota.  Lengths of Yellow Bass ranged from 4.6 to 10.7 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  The Yellow Bass population should continue to be monitored as diet studies have suggested that they may compete with Yellow Perch and other native species of fish.  Yellow Bass were likely illegally stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum abundance has varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1997 to 16.7 per gill in 2007.  The 2023 catch rate was 18.3 per gill net, the highest on record at Clear Lake.  Black Bullheads were scarce as only one was sampled in the whole survey.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear is a 415-acre located three miles west of the city of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Clear is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch and northern pike are managed secondarily.  The lake is presently stocked with walleye fry 3 of 4 years at 500 fish per littoral acre in an effort to boost walleye abundance and numbers of year classes.  Because of Clear Lake's popularity, the fish population is assessed every other year. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has a great walleye population when compared to other lakes similar to Clear Lake.  The gill net catch more than doubled from the 2009 assessment.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 13.5 to 19.3 inches and averaged 15.4 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled were age 2 and more than likely resulted from a fry stocking in 2009. This points out that the current walleye fry stocking plan seems to be working well, and the population is dominated with good eater sized walleyes. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to a respectable walleye population, the yellow perch numbers are impressive.  Although Clear Lake has had catch rates historically higher, the yellow perch population was well above the average when compared to other lakes.  The catch rate in 2011 was an impressive 47.7 fish per gill net compared to 25.0 fish per gill net like other similar lakes like Clear.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 7.1 to 12.7 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  Most of the yellow perch were in the 10-12 inch range which could be a great size for the frying pan. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are managed as a secondary species in Clear Lake and were stocked with fingerlings in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2010. In addition to the fingerlings in 2010, 14 adult northern pike were stocked.  Only one 35.8 inch northern pike was sampled during the 2011.  The northern pike gill net catch was 0.3 in 2011 compared to 0.0 in 2009, 0.3 in 2007, 2.3 in 2005, and 0.1 in 2003. The northern pike in Clear Lake have not had success which may be due in part to lack of spawning habitat.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are present in Clear Lake.  Crappie numbers were \"middle-of-the-road\" when compared to lakes similar to Clear Lake.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.5 to 12.1 inches with an impressive average of 9.3 inches.  The opportunity is there to catch some nice slabs. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are also present in Clear Lake.  Bluegill numbers are low, but over the last three assessments have been trending upward.  This may be due in part to sporadic spots of submergent vegetation showing up the past couple years providing some habitat.  Lengths of bluegills caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.1 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.8. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are also low in Clear Lake but the lengths are impressive.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 10.3 to 14.1 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum, channel catfish, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and fathead minnow. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Clear Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Luke Rossow <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 415-acre lake located four miles west of the City of Jackson in Jackson County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and a shoreline length of 3.8 miles. Water clarity was good during the survey in early June, with a Secchi disk reading of 5.0 feet.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and has historically been a good Walleye fishery. Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  The current management plan calls for Walleye fry to be stocked 3 of 4 years (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2024 etc.) at 500 per littoral acre. Northern Pike are stocked  when surplus fingerlings and winter rescue adults are available.  Clear Lake was surveyed the week of June 3, 2019 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in Clear Lake have varied from 1.7 per gill net in 2003 to 18.0 per gill net in 1990, and have averaged 9.9 per gill net.  The 2019 Walleye catch rate was 17.3 per gill net, which is the second highest gill net catch rate ever observed on Clear Lake, and is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Walleye ranged in total length from 7.5 to 28.2 inches and averaged 14.7 inches, with 68 percent of sampled Walleye being less than 14 inches long. Five year classes were sampled (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017) and all were stocked years except for 2015 (1 fish).  The 2019 year class (age-0) was sampled in the fall electrofishing survey at a rate of 41.0 per hour.  This year class was naturally reproduced because Clear Lake was not stocked in 2019.  Age-2 (2017) Walleye were abundant, accounting for 84 percent of aged fish.  Walleye growth was fast, indicated by a mean length at age-2 of 13.8 inches.  The current stocking regime of 500 per littoral acre in 3 of 4 years appears to be effective.  Since 2016, the Lower Mississippi Strain of Walleye (LMS) have been stocked in Clear Lake. This strain originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Sporadic natural reproduction occurs in Clear Lake, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes; however, more time is needed to fully understand if LMS Walleye do better than northern Minnesota strains of Walleye in southern Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite stocking efforts of adult Northern Pike in 2013 and 2017, no Northern Pike were sampled in the 2019 survey.  Historical catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1993 and 2019 to 5.0 per gill net in 1982 and have averaged 1.3 per gill net.  Spawning habitat for Northern Pike is very limited in Clear Lake, so the population is highly dependent on maintenance stockings.  Angling pressure is also substantial on Clear Lake, so angler harvest may keep Northern Pike abundance low.  Clear Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Clear Lake has been highly variable, ranging from 0.3 per gill net in 1990 to 263.0 per gill net in 1987, and averaging 44.5 per gill net since 1982.  The 2019 catch rate of 10.3 per gill net was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net) and was an increase from the 2015 catch rate of 4.3 per gill net.  Total lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 7.0 to 12.6 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nIn the spring of 2016, an angler reported catching two adult Yellow Bass at Clear Lake, but did not keep them for confirmation.  During the September electrofishing survey in 2016, young-of-the-year (YOY) Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake. During the 2017, 2018, and 2019 electrofishing surveys, YOY and larger Yellow Bass were observed throughout the lake, indicating that natural reproduction is occurring.  In 2019, Yellow Bass were captured at a rate of 4.7 per gill net. Lengths of Yellow Bass ranged from 9.9 to 11.5 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.  The Yellow Bass population will continue to be monitored as diet studies have suggested that they may compete with Yellow Perch and other native species of fish.  The Yellow Bass were likely illegally stocked by an angler.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2019 was 2.7 per trap net, which is near the long term average of 2.6 per trap net and is within the expected range of catch rates for class 43 lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie from both sampling gears ranged from 7.1 to 13.2 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  Black Bullheads were scarce as only five were sampled in the whole survey.  The Bluegill catch rate was 1.6 per trap net, which is the highest Bluegill catch rate recorded at Clear Lake.  The Channel Catfish catch rate was 6.0 per gill net, which is the highest catch rate ever observed on Clear Lake.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
