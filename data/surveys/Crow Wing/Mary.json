Numbers were high for this type of lake.  While the largest fish was only 9.2\", 44% were 8\" or larger.  All of the other game fish species were either low in number or small in size. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake association stocked walleyes into Mary in 2006, 2008, and 2010.  Walleyes could also migrate from Emily Lake which is stocked with walleye fry.  Seven walleyes were caught in the 2012 assessment and although 6 of those were from stocking years, stocking has not resulted in a substantial walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

The number per set in gill nets in the 1983 survey was 1.80 and the number per set in gillnets in the 1988 population assessment was 2.4. The median for the state is 2.67 per net. The growth rate for the 1-4 year class is average. Population status is average. The largemouth bass population is up from the 1983 survey, 0.5/trap net for 1988 and 1.25/trap net for 1983. The growth rate for largemouth bass is average for the state and local medians. The yellow perch population is up from 6.0/gill net in 1983 to 18.6/gill net in the 1988 population assessment. The walleye population is up 0.6/gillnet in 1983 to 1.2/gill net in the 1988 population assessment. The state median is 3.60, the local median is 2.00/gill net in 1988 population assessment. The black crappie population is down slightly from the 1983 survey, 3.0/trapnet in 1988 and 3.38 in 1983. The state median is 2.67 and the local median is 3.18. Population status average for the Brainerd areas. The yellow bullhead population is average, brown bullhead population is low. The bluegill population is up from the 1983 survey, but is still below the state median of 11.67 and the local median of 23.75. The 1988 population assessment was 9.88/trapnet. Population status is average for the Brainerd area. No public access, although it's connection with Emily Lake which is stocked with walleye on a regular basis, probably benefits Mary Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore: <br> \nA targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mary Lake was conducted on August 17-24, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eight sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data will be combined with trap net and gill net data from a survey planned in 2023 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nScore the Shore: <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Mary Lake on Sep 1, 2022 following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 38 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). he average lakewide habitat score was 74.6 (?3.6) out of 100 possible, which is moderate and near the statewide average score of 73. A moderate score indicates a a high percentage of unaltered habitat but may lack an aspect of critical habitat. Approximately 68% of the sites were developed with a mean score of 65.2 (?4.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 95.0 (?1.2). <br> \n <br> \nFLEM: <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff delineated the floating leaf and emergent aquatic vegetation of Mary lake 09/07/2022, following the protocols listed in the MN DNR Lake Plant Mapping Manual. There were a total of 35.8 acres of floating and emergent plants mapped. This consisted of 19.7 acres of emergent dominated plant communities and 16.1 acres of floating leaf plant communities. The following taxa were noted during the survey: Robbins' spikerush (Eleocharis robbinsii), bulrush (round-stem group) (Schoenoplectus spp.), bur-reed Floatingleaf Group (Sparganium spp.), burreed Emergent Group (Sparganium spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), sedge (Carex spp.), three-square bulrush (species) (Schoenoplectus pungens), watershield (Brasenia schreberi), white waterlily (Nymphaea odorata), wild rice (Zizania palustris), yellow waterlily (Nuphar variegata).

                "narrative": "<p>Mary is a 380 acre lake located two miles east of Emily, in Crow Wing County.  Access is available to the public via the Little Pine River from Emily Lake.  The lake is 34 feet deep and about 33% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is generally below average for the area, due primarily to tannic acid staining the water a brown color.  Development of Mary Lake has accelerated in recent years.  In 1998, there were 18.3 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  An additional 13 were present on the river outlet between Mary and Emily lakes.  There was one resort present on the lake.The lake was test netted in 1998.  The catch of northern pike was in the \"low\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  The catch was typical for Mary Lake, however.  Pike ranged from 15-32 inches and averaged 20 inches and 2.7 lbs.  Six age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Walleye abundance was in the \"average\" category when compared to both past catches in Mary lake and with similar type lakes.  Walleyes ranged from 7-24 inches long and average weight was 1.6 lbs..  The sample of 11 fish represented eight different year classes and growth appeared to be good.  Black crappie catches have been fairly consistent over the years.  The '98 crappie catch bordered on being \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes and equalled the previous high catch value for the lake.  Crappie growth was below average in the '98 netting.  Bluegill catch rates were in the \"low\" category in 1998, as they have been in most previous nettings.  About 25% of the bluegills measured were at least 7.0 inches long and growth was good.  Young bluegills were fairly abundant in shoreline seining stations.  Yellow perch is an important forage base for the lake's gamefish.  The 1998 perch catch was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes and was similar to most previous catches at Mary.</p>",

Average length was 5.7\", with 26% larger than 7\" and 5.6 were caught per net. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake association has stocked walleye fingerlings into Mary on a regular basis since 2006.  Walleyes could also migrate from connected Emily Lake which is stocked with walleye fry.  Walleyes were caught in average numbers (1.5/gill net) for this type of lake.  All the fish were over 13\" and had an average length of 21.3\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also of decent size, with an average length of 24.2\" and 44% of the fish above the 22-26\" protected slot.  Numbers were below average however at 3.0/gill net. <br> \n</p>",
