                "narrative": "<p>Sunken Lake is a 55 acre bass-panfish lake located six miles south of Squaw Lake, MN in the Mississippi Headwaters watershed.  Sunken Lake is within a non-motorized area of the Chippewa National Forest.  Access is gained by a hiking trail off County Road 33.  The access trail starts from a small parking area approximately one quarter-mile west of East Seelye campground.  The lake management plan lists Bluegill and Northern Pike as primary management species, with Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass as secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2016 to collect updated information on the fish population.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were lower than expected for lakes with similar habitats but average for Sunken Lake.  The lake has typically produced small Bluegill.  Sampled Bluegill in the latest survey ranged from 3.4 to 7.6 inches and averaged 4.9 inches.  Age analysis identified six year classes but few fish exceeded age 4.  Growth was considered average with fish averaging 5.6 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike in 2016 was typical for lakes with similar habitats and for Sunken Lake.   Size structure was poor with fish ranging from 13.3 to 22.1 inches and averaging 16.5 inches.  Despite the poor average size in this survey, Sunken Lake does have the potential to produce some larger pike; fish exceeding 30 inches were sampled in previous surveys.  Age analysis identified four year classes, but most fish were from the 2015 year class (age 1).  The lack of older fish suggests high adult mortality, possibly due to harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike exceeding 22 inches to improve size quality.       <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in numbers higher than expected for lakes with similar habitats, but typical for Sunken Lake.  Sampled Largemouth ranged from 4.7 to 16.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were lower than expected for lakes with similar habitats and considerably lower than the two previous surveys.  Irregular recruitment and variable catches are typical for Black Crappie populations.  Size structure was poor; the few crappie sampled averaged less than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
