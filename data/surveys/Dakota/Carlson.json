The lake drops off rather quickly to a maximum of 19 feet with approximately 26% of the surface area over 15 feet. Although an aeration system is operated (as needed) to prevent winterkill, city staff report it is not often needed.  Another nearby lake (19-0155-00), known by the same name but primarily called Quigley, results in obvious confusion. The other Carlson/Quigley (19-0155-00) is shallow and not managed for fishing. There is city property on the south and east sides, a fishing pier on the east side and a shore fishing structure on the south side, plus additional shore fishing locations located on city of Eagan property provide plenty of shore fishing access. Vegetation is sparse and is restricted to a narrow band near shore, so it should not interfere significantly with angling from shore. This electrofishing survey found a moderate abundance of Largemouth Bass.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches.  Walleyes were sampled in low abundance with two 11-12 inch fish collected.  </p>",

The lake drops off rather quickly to a maximum of 19 feet. There is city property on the south and east sides.  There is a fishing pier on the east side and a shorefishing structure on the south side, plus additional shorefishing locations located on city of Eagan property.  Vegetation is sparse and is restricted to a narrow band near shore, so it does not interfere significantly with angling from shore. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are not abundant but are of slightly above average size for a metro area lake.  Average size was just less than 6 inches and nearly 80% of the bluegill sampled measured between 5 and 7.5 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers as well. The most common size was in the 7 to 8 inch range, with very few observed over 8 inches.  Largemouth bass are found in average abundance in Carlson Lake and anglers report good bass fishing.  The largest fish sampled was 16.34 inches.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers, with only one fish sampled during this survey which was 11 inches long.  This fish corresponds to a stocking that occurred in 2010. Yearling Channel catfish (711) were stocked in June 2012 however no channel catfish were sampled in July during this survey.  Several hybrid sunfish and black bullhead were sampled and both are in low abundance in Carlson Lake.  Golden shiners were also sampled in low numbers as compared to previous surveys.   <br> \n</p>",

The lake drops off rather quickly to a maximum of 19 feet.  Approximately 26% of the surface area is over 15 feet deep.  An aeration system is operated as needed to prevent winterkill, but city staff report it is not often needed.  Another nearby lake (19-0155-00) is known by the same name, but primarily called Quigley.  This results in obvious confusion.  The other Carlson/Quigley (i.e. 19-0155-00) is shallow and not managed for fishing. There is city property on the south and east sides.  There is a fishing pier on the east side and a shore fishing structure on the south side, plus additional shore fishing locations located on city of Eagan property.  Vegetation is sparse and is restricted to a narrow band near shore, so it does not interfere significantly with angling from shore. <br> \nThis electrofishing survey found a high abundance of Largemouth Bass.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 15 inches.  Walleyes were sampled in low abundance with one 8 inch fish collected.  Three Channel Catfish were recorded during this assessment ranging from 12 to almost 19 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carlson Lake (also called Quigley Lake) is small lake in the City of Eagan.  The lake is rather deep for its size, with a maximum depth of 19 feet.  There is city property on the south and east sides.  There is a fishing platform on the east side and a shorefishing structure on the south side, plus additional shorefishing locations.  Vegetation is sparse and is restricted to a narrow band near shore, so it does not interfere significantly with angling. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant and of nice size for a metro area lake.  Average size was just under 6 inches and nearly 20% of the bluegill sampled were between 7 and 7.5 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers. The most common size was 7 to 8 inches, but very few were over 8 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant and anglers report good bass fishing.  The largest fish sampled was 18.5 inches, with the majority between 9 and 12 inches.  Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers, with lengths ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  No channel catfish were sampled, but anglers report catching fish still in the lake from a 1993 stocking.  These fish would be over 15 years old, so abundance is likely very low assuming they have not reproduced.  Pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish were all sampled in low numbers.  Golden shiners were sampled in moderate to high numbers.  </p>",
