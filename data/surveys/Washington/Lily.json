                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a 35.9 acre lake located in the City of Stillwater, Washington County. It has a littoral area of 19.7 acres and is in lake class 30. The lake has approximately one mile of shoreline and nearly 25% of that is owned by the City of Stillwater and managed for recreational use. Lily Lake park has a fishing pier, boat access (surface use restrictions in place), swimming beach, tennis courts, ballfields and an ice arena. The Fishing in the Neighborhood program (FiN) incorporated Lily Lake into its managed waterbodies beginning with this survey in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in high numbers in Lily Lake as they have been in every survey dating back to 1947. Though present in high density, the overall size structure of the bluegill population is mediocre, with the average fish measuring 4.9 inches long and only 21 of 887 fish netted measuring over six inches. The majority of fish were from the 2008 year class making them 3 years old. Black crappie were caught in low numbers and only one exceeded seven inches in length. Walleye were stocked twice in recent history and one walleye was sampled during this survey and measured 28 inches long. This fish is presumably from the stocking of fingerlings in the fall of 2001. Northern pike have been stocked into Lily Lake four times since 2000 but only one was sampled during the 2011 survey. One largemouth bass was sampled that measured 7.1 inches long. Other species seen during this survey included yellow perch, black bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish and golden shiners. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a 36 acre lake located in the City of Stillwater, Washington County. It has a littoral area of 19.7 acres, is in lake class 30, and has approximately one mile of shoreline with nearly 25% owned by the City of Stillwater and managed for recreational use. Lily Lake Park has a fishing pier, boat access (surface use restrictions in place), tennis courts, ballfields and an ice arena. The Fishing in the Neighborhood program (FiN) incorporated Lily Lake into its managed waterbodies beginning with the survey in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, Bluegills were sampled in moderate but notably lower numbers than previous surveys. The overall size structure of the Bluegill population is comprised of mainly small fish, with the average fish measuring 5.0 inches long and some fish over six inches in length. Black Crappie were caught in considerably lower numbers than in recent surveys, however there are a few quality fish present in the population. Northern Pike have been stocked into Lily Lake four times since 2000 and appear to be slightly below average in relative abundance when compared to lakes similar to Lily. Northern Pike present in the lake are faring well, and are of good size. Largemouth Bass are a primary management species in Lily Lake and were observed in slightly above average abundance when compared to similar lakes. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 6 to 15 inches.  Other species seen during this survey included Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish and White sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catches of fish from Lily Lake indicate that average populations exist for bowfin, white sucker, golden shiner, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and black crappie.  Northern pike, bluegill, and pumpkinseed catches are each indicative of a high population.  Black bullhead numbers are judged to be low.  Comparison of net catches in 1975 and 1980 for northern pike indicate that there has been a significant increase in their numbers.  In both years nets were set in the same locations and at the same time.  Although the catch per lift for yellow perch in gillnets went from 26.5 in 1975 to 4.0 in 1980, analysis does not indicate that this change was a significant decrease.The most abundant age group of northern pike were from the 1977 year class or III annulus fish.  Although numerous stockings of northern pike have been made during this period, none of that year class (1977) were made.  Since Lily Lake has extremely limited areas for northern pike reproduction, it is assumed that these are not naturally reproduced fish.  The best possible explanation is an error in scale reading.It is interesting to point out that although there has been a very significant increase in the northern pike population, there has been no associated decrease in bluegill numbers.  This is again proof that the stocking of northern pike as a means of panfish control is an erroneous assumption.  It should be pointed out that the modal size group of bluegills taken in 1975 was 4.0 to 4.4 inches (35 of 72 fish) while in 1980 the modal group was 5.5 to 5.9 inches (35 of 85 fish).  Since there are many factors which could account for this apparent change in size, it would be in error to consider that it is solely, if at all, due to the number of northern pike present.</p>",

Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, but were of large size and exhibited good growth.  These pike were probably the result of stocking in 1984 and 1986.  Natural recruitment of northern pike appears very limited.  Yellow perch and black crappie were sampled in low numbers, as were black bullheads, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Largemouth bass appear common, with natural reproduction documented by shoreline seining.</p>",

Black crappie have never been very numerous in Lily Lake, but present numbers were lower than in any previous netting.  Several small largemouth bass were sampled.  Gear used does not effectively sample adult bass, so numbers are unknown.  Brown bullhead were present in low numbers, similar to previous nettings.

No gas motors are allowed on the lake.Bluegill and hybrid sunfish dominated the catch, making up 90% of the fish sampled.  Most were small, with less than 10% over 6 inches long.  Black crappie were average in abundance with a few individuals over 10 inches long.  Yellow perch numbers were average with some over 9 inches long.Largemouth bass were the most abundant predator species sampled.  Thirty-six bass were captured during 40 minutes of daytime electrofishing, with the largest measuring 17.56 inches.  Northern pike were captured in average numbers with nearly half the fish over 25 inches long.  Eight walleye were sampled during electrofishing and trapnetting.  Sizes ranged from 19-29 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a 35.9 acre lake located in the City of Stillwater, Washington County. It has a littoral area of 19.7 acres and is in lake class 30. The lake has approximately one mile of shoreline and nearly 25% of that is owned by the City of Stillwater and managed for recreational use. Lily Lake park has a fishing pier, boat access (surface use restrictions in place), tennis courts, ballfields and an ice arena. The Fishing in the Neighborhood program (FiN) incorporated Lily Lake into its managed waterbodies beginning with the survey in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2016 Lily Lake survey Bluegills were sampled in moderate but notably lower numbers than previous surveys. The overall size structure of the Bluegill population is poor, with the average fish measuring 4.3 inches long and only 2 of 73 fish netted measuring over six inches. Black Crappie were caught in low numbers and only one exceeded seven inches in length. Walleye were stocked twice in recent history - one Walleye was sampled during this survey but it was large at 26 inches. This fish is presumably from the stocking of fingerlings in the fall of 2001. Northern Pike have been stocked into Lily Lake four times since 2000 and appear to be faring well, with catch rates around the median and good size structure. While Largemouth Bass are a primary management species, none were sampled, which suggests follow up investigation and potential stocking may be warranted.  Other species seen during this survey included Yellow Perch, Black Bullheads, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Golden Shiners. <br> \n</p>",
