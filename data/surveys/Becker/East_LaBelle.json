                "narrative": "<p>East LaBelle Lake is located in western Becker County along the eastern border of the Buffalo River watershed.  The lakes surrounding watershed is comprised primarily of rolling agricultural lands interspersed with small woodlots and wetlands.  Soils are glacial till in origin and are highly erodible.  A shallow and fertile body of water, East LaBelle is subject to periodic partial winterkill; the most recent occurring in the winter of 1993-1994.Past fisheries management actions have included: fish stocking, rough fish removal, fish population assessment netting and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring.  Since 1950, East LaBelle has been stocked nine times with walleye, three times with northern pike, two times with bluegill and a one time stocking of largemouth bass.  The current lake management plan calls for biennial walleye fry stocking at a rate of 1000 fry/littoral acre.  Also recommended are reintroductory stocking of other gamefish species following severe winterkills.  Fish removal records document the commerical harvest of 2355 pounds of bullheads since 1965.  East LaBelle has a history of five previous fish population assessments dating back to 1964.  Also documented are twenty years of dissolved oxygen monitoring and winterkill assessment.Walleye have been actively managed in East LaBelle since their initial stocking in 1971.  Both stocking annd natural reproduction have contributed to the walleye population.  Four of the five year classes identified were from non-stocked years.  The current walleye gill net catch rate of 6.25/gill net set is slightly above the normal range and is the second highest reported from these waters.  Age-class distributions indicate all walleye captures were age IV or older.  The mean weight (4.62 pounds) and PSD (100) of gill net sampled walleye also describe a size structure rich in mature fish but lacking in the younger year classes needed to replace an aging population.  Predation and competition from an exploding yellow perch population may have reduced the effectiveness of recent fry stocking.  Growth rates of aged walleye were nearly thirty percent faster than the statewide average.The current northern pike catch rate of 11.25/gill net represents a ten fold increase from 1993 and is the highest reported from this lake.  High water levels over the past five years have probably had an influence on northern pike production as evidenced by the dominance of young fish in the sample (88% age III and less).  Despite the relatively young population, mean lengths (22.9 inches) and weights (3.22 pounds) describe a quality size structure (PSD 71) and excellent growth (nearly 35% faster than statewide averages).The yellow perch population has experienced dramatic increases over the past ten years.  The current catch rate of 151.75/gill net set is nearly three times greater than that reported in 1993 and fifteen times greater than 1988.  The exploding forage base may be responsible for the expansions in the walleye and northern pike populations.  Length frequency information suggests a relatively young population that would not hold the interest of the angler.Historically, black bullhead numbers have fluctuated in concert with winterkill events.  Following the severe winterkill of 1980, black bullhead numbers exploded to levels nearly 500 times the lake class median.  As the years increased between major winterkills, black bullhead numbers have fallen and somewhat stabilized at levels 10 times the lake class median.  Historical net catch data suggests an inverse relationship between black bullhead and yellow perch abundances.  Limited by an intolerance to low dissolved oxygen levels, centrarchid species have enjoyed very limited success in these waters.  No largemouth bass have been sampled from East LaBelle, in spite of the 2,520 fingerlings stocked in 1980.Black crappies were sampled for the first time during the 1998 assessment, an apparent introduction from an unknown source.  Bluegill abundance has remained stable over the past twenty years at levels slightly below the normal range for lake class 34.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East LaBelle is a relatively shallow, fertile, prairie lake located in western Becker County along the northeastern outskirts of Lake Park, MN.  The lake's fish community is typical of many lakes that winterkill occasionally.  For the most part, fish growth rates are average or faster.Northern pike and walleye test net catches were moderate in 2003.  However, average sizes of both species were large.  Walleyes sampled in test nets averaged 4.6 pounds each while pike averaged 3.9 pounds.Trap net catches of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass increased during the past five years.  Bluegills averaged 6.7 inches and black crappies averaged 7.5 inches.  Large panfish were not common, but were present in East LaBelle Lake.Like many lakes that occasionally winterkill, this one has an abundance of black bullheads.  A good portion of those are over ten inches long and would be of interest to some anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 1, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with four sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish including 2 species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow) but no species that are intolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2015 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for East LaBelle Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East LaBelle is a relatively shallow, fertile, prairie lake located in western Becker County along the northeastern outskirts of Lake Park, MN.  The lake's fish community is typical of many lakes that winterkill occasionally.  For the most part, fish growth rates are average or faster. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike test net catches increased to a new historical high in 2008.  The average size of sampled pike was 22.3 inches in length and 2.5 pounds.  Walleyes remained a modest portion of test net catches.  Walleyes sampled in test nets averaged 2.7 pounds and 18.0 inches in length.  Perch and walleye populations are likely being impacted by the currently high numbers of northern pike, but the young pike population will probably provide some good fishing in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of bluegill remained relatively high.  Bluegill sizes were not large, but fish were quite young (most age three or younger) and should provide good fishing opportunities in coming years given the good growth rates.  Moderate numbers of bass and black crappie were also present. <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes that occasionally winterkill, this one has an abundance of black bullheads.  Most of those are currently less than eight inches long and would not be of interest to most anglers, though some larger bullheads (up to 12.5 inches) can also be found. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East LaBelle Lake is a 146-acre, class-34 lake located in western Becker County northeast of the city of Lake Park.  A culvert connecting East LaBelle to West LaBelle Lake functions as an outlet during high water events.  East LaBelle is a very productive lake and occasionally experiences low dissolved oxygen in the late winter.  The lake's fish community has undergone many changes since it was initially surveyed in 1964. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked into East LaBelle Lake annually.  Walleye catch rates have been variable since initial surveying, fluctuating between zero and six Walleye per gill net. The 2020 average catch rate was two Walleye per net, similar to the lake's historical average.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 18.8 to 24.7 inches, averaging 21.3 inches.  The lack of smaller sized Walleye in nets indicates poor recruitment of stocked fry in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate catches of Northern Pike (less than 10 pike per gill net) were documented in early surveys until 1998 when net catches began showing a steady increase.  The Northern Pike catch rate increased dramatically in the 2020 survey, averaging about 50 pike per net.  This rise in Northern Pike numbers is likely a result of improved spawning opportunity over the past decade due to high water levels.  Northern Pike surveyed in 2020 ranged in length from 13.5 to 35.8 inches, averaging 19.3 inches.  Pike between 15 and 21 inches were most abundant, accounting for over 73% of total pike catch.   <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys documented low to moderate catch rates of Yellow Perch in East LaBelle until the early 2000s when catch rates then started to decline, dropping down to about five perch per net in 2020.  Reduced numbers of Yellow Perch over the past decade are likely a consequence of heavy predation by Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch sampled in 2020 ranged in length from 4.4 to 8.9 inches, averaging 6.2 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to Yellow Perch, Bluegill abundance was moderate.  Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches long, but fish up to 9 inches long were also found.  Approximately 3% of the sampled Bluegill were eight inches or longer, indicating that the population was dominated by small to moderately sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nFew Black Crappie have been sampled in East LaBelle Lake.  Sampled Black Crappie ranged in length from 3.7 to 10.8 inches, averaging 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBass were found to range in length from 4.8 inches to 17.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the 2020 survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  Anglers can help improve East LaBelle Lake's fishery by harvesting smaller fish for eating, specifically Northern Pike under 24 inches long which have become overly abundant in the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Labelle Lake is a relatively shallow, fertile lake that is susceptible to occassional winterkills.  Asevere winterkill occurred in 1979-1980.  Walleyes, sunfish, largemouth bass and northern pike were stockedfollowing that winter.  Another, partial winterkill, occurred in 1980-1981.  Walleye fry were again stocked inthe spring of 1981.  As is typical, black bullheads, the most winterkill resistant fish, exploded in abundancefollowing these events.  The 1983 lake survey recorded 1,587 black bullheads per trapnet.  Subsequent surveys haveshown a dramatic reduction in black bullhead numbers.     Netting data from the current survey indicates a decline in walleye abundance from the previous survey butstill very much within the normal range for this lake class.  Size is far above normal, average weight = 4.4 lbs. Older fish comprise the bulk of the walleye population which explains the high average weight.   An abundance ofsubmerged vegetation and a large yellow perch forage base problably make these fish difficult to catch.  Northernpike have also declined from the previous survey.  Poor spawning success during the low water years of the late1980's is a possible explanation for their decline.  A small bluegill population is present that consistsprimarily of fast growing two year old fish.  If survival and growth are maintained through another year theyshould provide some excellent angling.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East LaBelle is a relatively shallow, fertile, prairie lake located in western Becker County along the northeastern outskirts of Lake Park, MN.  The lake's fish community is typical of many lakes that winterkill occasionally.  For the most part, fish growth rates are average or faster. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, gill net catches of Walleye were 2.5 fish per set, which is close to average for East Labelle Lake.  Walleyes averaged 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Size of Walleyes ranged from 12.0 to 23.4 inches.  As in many winterkill lakes, the growth rates for Walleye were considered faster than normal with Walleyes reaching an average length of 17.6 inches in four growing seasons.  Walleye abundance in East Labelle Lake is maintained by stocking, with fry being stocked annually since 2010. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Northern Pike catch rate was 15.8 per gill net, which was the second highest recorded since 1964.  The size range for northern Pike was 14.2 to 33.9 inches.  The average Northern Pike size was 22.1 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Northern Pike also exhibited fast growth rates with an average length of 23.7 inches by four years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled near the lake's average of 42 per gill net.  Average size of Yellow Perch was 6.9 inches and ranged from in length from 5.4 inches to 10.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAfter 20 years of relatively low and stable trap net catches, Bluegill catches were 98.3 per set in 2015, which was well above the lake's historical average of 17.4 Bluegills per trap net.  The average Bluegill length was 6.0 inches and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 inches.  Young fish dominated the Bluegill sample with four year old or younger fish comprising over 70% of the total catch. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Largemouth Bass were also present, ranging in size from 7 inches to almost 17 inches in length.  Although Black Crappie were not sampled in 2015, angler reports during the survey indicated there can be good fishing for them. <br> \n <br> \nLike many lakes that occasionally winterkill, this one has an abundance of black bullheads that could be of interest to some anglers.  Most black bullheads were around nine inches long, though some larger bullheads (up to 11 inches) were also found. <br> \n <br> \nWith continuing shoreline and watershed development, this fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  </p>",
