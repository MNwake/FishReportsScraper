                "narrative": "<p>Brackett Lake is a 47-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately eight miles east of Erhard, MN.  Maplewood State Park is located one mile north of the lake.  Brackett Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth of Brackett Lake is 39 feet; however, 67% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the lake survey was 11.5 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Brackett Lake is included in lake class 28 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The entire shoreline of Brackett Lake is privately owned.  Very little shoreline development exists.  There are only four permanent residences located along the shoreline.  The access is a privately owned earthen access which is located along the south shoreline of the lake.      Brackett Lake receives little fishing pressure because public access is restricted.  Brackett Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and pumpkinseed sunfish are the dominant fish species in Brackett Lake.  Brackett Lake also had a high catch rate of hybrid sunfish, which commonly occurs in lakes with over abundant areas of submerged vegetation.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.   Northern pike ranged in length from 19.3 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow; pike attain an average length of 18.9 inches at five years of age.  Northern pike growth may be limited by a lack of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     Brackett Lake appears to have an abundant largemouth bass population that is slow growing.  The largemouth bass test-net catch rate was above the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.1 to 14.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.1 inches at four years of age.     The black crappie test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Crappies ranged in length from 7.5 to 9.3 inches with an average length and weight of 8.2 inches and 0.3 pound.  Black crappie growth is also slow with an average length of 6.9 inches at age five.       Bluegill was the most abundant fish specie sampled during the population assessment.  The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Only one percent of the bluegill in the trap net sample exceeded 7.0 inches in length.      Pumpkinseed sunfish was the second most abundant fish specie sampled during the population assessment.  Pumpkinseed test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 28 lakes.       </p>",
