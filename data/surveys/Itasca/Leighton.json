                "narrative": "<p>Leighton Lake is a 229 acre lake located 6 miles southwest of Cohasset in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has two inlets and an outlet to the Mississippi River.  There is a DNR-owned public access at the northwest end of the lake near the outlet. <br> \n <br> \nThe initial lake management plan (LMP) was drafted in 2004.  Walleye and Northern Pike were considered primary management species and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were considered secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in July 2019 to assess the status of the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catches exceeded the average from similar lakes (2.4/net) in three of four previous surveys.  The 2019 catch of 0.3/net was a historic low for the lake.  Only two Walleye were sampled with gill-nets, measuring 15 and 22 inches.  Previous surveys noted the Walleye population was maintained by natural reproduction and/or immigration from the Mississippi River.  It appears Walleye recruitment has been poor in recent years, likely due to changes in environmental conditions.  It is unclear if this is due to fish passage barriers on the outlet stream or other changes within the system.  Similar declines in Walleye recruitment have been observed statewide. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Northern Pike have generally been above average compared to similar lakes.  The 2019 catch rate was 7.8/net and average for the lake.  Size structure was relatively poor, although a couple of large individuals were sampled.  Pike ranged from 14.8 to 35.7 inches with an average length of 20.4 inches.  Seven year classes from age 2 to 8 were identified; age 2 and 3 fish made up the majority of the sample.  Growth was considered average; pike averaged 21.7 inches after four years.  The presence of pike exceeding 30 inches demonstrates the lake has some potential to grow larger fish.  The low number of pike older than age 5 may be an indication of angler harvest of larger fish.  The north central pike zone regulation implemented in 2018 requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, while allowing for more harvest of small pike.  It is hoped that this regulation will improve size quality on Leighton Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for Bluegill was down slightly from previous surveys and below the typical range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor.  Bluegill from the trap-net sample ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.  Ages 2 through 9 were represented in the sample indicating frequent recruitment.  Growth was slightly faster than average for the lake class with Bluegill averaging 6.8 inches at age 6.  Leighton Lake provides angling opportunities for Bluegill, though the size structure may limit the popularity of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nVery few Black Crappie have been sampled in previous surveys.  The 2019 gill-net catch was near average for similar lakes. Too few crappie were captured to characterize age or size structure, but the fish were of favorable size ranging from 9.3 to 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nStandard summer netting typically does not provide a good assessment of a lake's Largemouth Bass population; night electrofishing is the preferred method to evaluate this species.  Electrofishing has not been conducted on Leighton Lake, but anecdotal reports suggest Largemouth Bass are present in fishable numbers.  Low numbers of bass were sampled in gill nets and trap nets, but catch rates were typical for lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled fish ranged from 4.7 to 17.7 inches.  Leighton Lake likely provides fair angling opportunities for bass. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Yellow Perch have varied considerably in past surveys, but have generally been at or above the lake class average.  The 2019 catch was below the typical range for similar lakes and was a historic low for the lake at 1.2/net.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.9 to 10.2 inches.  The low number of Yellow Perch likely limits production of larger gamefish like Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Tullibee trended sharply down over the two previous surveys, and no Tullibee were captured in 2019.  Species like Tullibee that suspend in open water are often not sampled well with standard nets, so catch rates cannot be considered a true index of abundance.  However, it appears that Tullibee numbers have declined substantially.  There is at least one record in the lake file of a summer fish kill affecting Tullibee. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Leighton Lake appears to offer modest angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  The Walleye population likely does not provide much of a fishery at this time, which may be related to the perceived declines in Yellow Perch and Tullibee numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the latest survey included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is 229 acres and has a maximum depth of 63 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area fisheries staff beginning on 2 July, 2019.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at six sites using the 15-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 different species: 2 species by seining and 10 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 22 July, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leighton Lake, a 229 acre lake that lies between Cohasset and Remer, is in lake class 23.  It is primarily known for producing walleye and northern pike.  Natural reproduction and immigration from the Mississippi River are sustaining the gamefish populations.The walleye gill net catch rate (3.7/set) was within the expected range for this lake class.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 14.7 to 24.2 inches and had a mean length of 20.2 inches.  Grawth rates are near the expected range for all ages.The northern pike gill net catch rate (11.7/set) exceeds the expected range.  They ranged from 11.2 to 29.0 inches and had a mean length of 18.1 inches.The largemouth bass gill net catch rate (2.5/set) was high, exceeding the expected range.  (In contrast, the trap net catch rate was 0.4/set.)  Largemouth bass are not typically sampled well in the assessment nets.  The growth rate was near the expected range for all age classes.The bluegill trap net catch rate (7.7/set) was within the expected range.  The trap net sampled bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 8.4 inches and had a mean length of 6.2/set.The yellow perch catch rate (4.8/set) was within the expected range.  They had a mean length of 6.2 inches.Other species sampled include: black, brown and yellow bullhead, black crappie, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and tullibee (cisco).</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 22.2 feet, which was just below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.4?C (48.9?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within and below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1973-2019 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1973. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.  <br> \n</p>",
