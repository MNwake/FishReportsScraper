                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have turbid and soft (unmineralized) water.  Johnson Lake is typical of these lakes except that it is larger and more irregularly shaped.Johnson Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 07/22/2002 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) to a depth of about 13 ft, where the temperature was about 72 F.  The bottom temperature was 70 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, sand, and silt.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common plants are sedges and sweetgale along the shoreline, and floatingleaf pondweed.  The inlet from Mud Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  The outlet to One Pine Lake has no fish barriers at high water levels.Fish sampling in this fish population assessment consisted of seven gillnets and nine trapnets.  Eight previous investigations dating back to 1965 consisted of 2-9 gillnets.  Trapnets (7-15) were used during six of these previous investigations.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2002 of 10.1 fish/net (7.4 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 11.9 fish/net (11.1 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2002 of 18.5 fish/net (11.5 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 14.4 fish/net (13.3 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.Fish populations in 2002 were dominated by  black crappie, bluegill sunfish, northern pike, white sucker, and walleye.Black crappie numbers in 2002 (6.1/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2002 averaged 8.7\" (0.4 lb) which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 8.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie in 2002 was 11.9\".  Growth of crappie captured in 2002 was in the second quartile for area lakes.Bluegill numbers in 2002 (8.4/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.0/trapnet for all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 5.9\" (0.16 lb), which was at the median for this lake class and was the same as the average size of 5.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2002 was 8.4\".  Growth of bluegill captured in 2002 was in the second quartile for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 2002 (1.9/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.0/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 15.0\" (0.8 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 19.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002, caught in a trapnet, was 39.8\" (14.9 lb).  All but one of the pike captured in 2002 were ages two or three.  Pike scales were difficult to read, but the growth of pike captured in 2002 appeared to be in the first quartile for area lakes.White sucker numbers in 2002 (2.9/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2002 averaged 13.0\" (1.0 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 13.8\" in all investigations on this lake.Walleye numbers in 2002 (1.1/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 18.0\" (2.1 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average of 15.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  Most walleye in 2002 were age four, from the 1998 year class.  Growth of walleye captured in 2002 was in the third quartile for area lakes.Many of the gamefish examined in 2002, particularly bluegill and northern pike, were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Black spot and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect people, are killed at temperatures used to cook fish, and are often removed by filleting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have turbid and soft (unmineralized) water.  Johnson Lake is typical of these lakes except that it is larger and more irregularly shaped.Johnson Lake does not stratify thermally in most summers and retains good oxygen (more than 5 ppm) near the bottom.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly boulder, sand, and silt.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common are sedges, sweetgale, and floatingleaf pondweed.  The inlet from Mud Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  The outlet to One Pine Lake has no fish barriers at high water.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 15 fish/net (19 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to the average catch of 13 fish/net (12 lb/net) in seven previous gillnettings in Johnson Lake dating back to 1965.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 of 28 fish/net (15 lb/net) was similar to the average catch of 16 fish/net (12 lb/net) in five previous trapnettings in Johnson Lake, also dating back to 1965.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (5/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the average catch of 3/gillnet in previous nettings.  Pike sizes in 1997 averaged 21\"; the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 39\".  Growth of pike captured in 1997 (19\" at age three) was normal for the area.Black crappie numbers in 1997 (8/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, but were similar to the average catch of 6/trapnet in previous nettings.  Crappie sizes averaged 8\"; the largest was 10\".  Most of the crappie in recent years were from strong 1991 and 1994 year classes; few crappie were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Crappie growth (5\" at age three, 8\" at age six) was slower than normal for the area.Bluegill numbers in 1997 (13/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 4/trapnet in previous nettings.  The higher bluegill catch in 1997 may be due to the earlier trapnetting date (June 23) than for previous trapnettings which had beginning dates of July 10 to August 31.  The earlier trapnetting in 1997 may have caught some bluegill spawning in the shallows where trapnets are set.  Bluegill sizes in 1997 averaged 5\", which was similar to sizes in recent trapnettings, but smaller than in earler trapnettings.  The proportion of bluegill 8\" or larger in 1997 (three percent) was similar to the 1988 and 1991 trapnettings, but much lower than the 18-57 percent found in earlier trapnettings.  Most bluegill in recent years were from strong 1991, 1994, and 1995 year classes; few bluegill were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill growth (4\" at age three, 6\" at age six) was normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1997 (2/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, but were near the average of 3/gillnet in previous nettings.  Walleye sizes averaged 14\"; the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 26\".  Growth of walleye caught in the gillnets (15\" at age five) was normal for the area.Most of the gamefish examined in 1997 were free of diseases and parasites, however 78 percent of the northern pike had Neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite found in or under the skin.  It cannot infect humans, is killed by cooking, and is usually removed by filleting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is located approximately 6 miles S of Ely in the Superior National Forest. Johnson's shorelines are lightly developed by area standards. The surrounding landcape is covered with abundant pines and other conifers. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a gravel access located on the SE side of the lake off CR 21. A discrete portage to Beaver River is located on the far W end of Johnson Lake and is most often used by snowmobiles during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey of Johnson Lake. Northern pike (33%) and bluegill (35%) dominated the gill net and trap net catches, respectively. Black crappie were sampled in numbers near their historic averages. Low numbers of other gamefish including walleye were also sampled. Of particular interest in 2018 was the first sampling of black bullhead ever recorded from Johnson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (4.5/gill net) were above the historic average (3.0/gill net) for this lake and slightly higher than average (4.0/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled measured 21.2 inches which is larger than the historic average length of 19.2 inches. Approximately 11% of the pike sampled in 2018 were 24 inches or larger with one large specimen measuring 42 inches sampled from one of the trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2018 (9.2/trap net) were above the historic average (5.8/trap net) for this lake and well above average (1.5/trap net) compared to other area lakes which are similar. The average bluegill sampled in 2018 was 6.1 inches which is nearly identical to the historic average length for Johnson Lake. Only 4% of the bluegill sampled were 8 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in 2018 (5.4/trap net) was similar to the historic average for this lake and above average (3.1/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes. Crappie average length was 7.6 inches which is slightly smaller than the historic average length of 8.1 inches. Fourteen percent of the crappie sampled in 2018 were 8 inches or larger up to a maximum length of 11.2 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 14 walleye were sampled in 2018. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every third year on Johnson Lake and in 2018 approximately 77% of the walleye sampled were from years where stocking occurred. Walleye growth appears to be below average when compared to other area lakes. Walleye lengths ranged from 9 inches to 27 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were sampled with both gear types in 2018. Their numbers are currently above average compared to other area lakes where bullheads are present. Bullhead lengths averaged about 9 inches with the largest recorded at 13.5 inches long. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is located approximately 6 miles south of Ely in the Superior National Forest. The rolling shoreline is forested in a pine-hardwood mix and is lightly developed by area standards. Maximum depth is 19 feet and much of the lake is shallower than 15 feet. A heavy bog stain limits water clarity, which was four feet at the time of the survey. Submerged vegetation is sparse, but emergent vegetation is prominent in shallow bays. <br> \n <br> \nA gravel access is located on the southeast side of the lake off CR 21. Shallow rocks and tight corners can make launching a large boat difficult.  A 3/4 mile portage to the Beaver River is located on the west end of Johnson Lake and is most often used by snowmobiles. <br> \n <br> \nEleven species of fish were sampled in this survey of Johnson Lake. Total yield for both gill nets (22.6 lbs/net) and trap nets (27.7 lbs/net) were the highest on record for the lake. Northern pike dominated the gill net catch and bluegill dominated the trap net sets. Black crappie were sampled in numbers near their historic average. Low numbers of other gamefish, including walleye and largemouth bass, were also sampled. Black bullhead were first detected in 2018, and were present in greater size and abundance in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers (7.3/gill net) were the highest surveyed for the lake and above the third quartile (6.3/gill net) when compared to similar lakes in the area. The average pike measured 21 inches which was larger than the historic average of 19.5 inches. Seventeen percent of the pike were longer than 24 inches, and the largest pike was 31 inches. Though not represented in this survey Johnson has produced trophy pike occasionally. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers (23.8/trap net) were also the highest on record and well above the third quartile (6.3/gill net) of the lake class. The average bluegill was just over 6 inches which was similar to the average for Johnson Lake. Only 2% of the bluegill were 8 inches or larger. Growth rates were average for the lake class. The largest bluegill was nearly 10 inches long. Anglers are encouraged to release large bluegill to maintain quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance (6.3/trap net) was on par with the historic average for this lake and above average (3.1/trap net) for its lake class. The crappie average length was just over 8 inches, which was near the overall lake average. Forty-six percent of the crappie sampled in 2018 were 8 inches or larger with a maximum length of 11 inches. The 2014 and 2018 year classes were most prevalent. <br> \n <br> \nSix walleye were sampled with the majority captured in trap nets. Sizes ranged from 15.5 to 23 inches and growth rates were normal for the area. Eighty percent of aged fish were from stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured in low abundance but at a quality size of 18 inches. Standard survey nets traditionally undersample bass and they are likely more abundant than this survey suggests.  <br> \n <br> \nA few of the game fish examined in 2022 were infected with neascus (black spot). It is a common parasite native to the area.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Low numbers of bluegill, rock bass, and yellow perch are also present. Rock bass sizes are larger than average for the area, while bluegill sizes are smaller than average. Some large walleye are present. Bluegill recruitment is quite even from year to year, while crappie recruitment is erratic. Almost all walleye are from fingerling stocked year classes. Bluegill and crappie growth is average for the area. Walleye growth is initially slow, but becomes faster than average by age 5. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have turbid and soft (unmineralized) water.  Johnson Lake is larger and more irregularly shaped than most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nJohnson Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 06/18/2007 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 62 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 15 ft, where the temperature was 62 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Johnson Lake are mostly boulder, sand, and silt.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common plants are sedges and sweetgale along the shoreline, and floatingleaf pondweed.  The inlet from Mud Lake has beaver dams that limit fish movement.  The outlet to One Pine Lake has no fish barriers at high water levels. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in this fish population assessment was done with six gillnets and nine trapnets.  Eight previous fisheries investigations dating back to 1965 used 2-9 gillnets.  Seven of these previous investigations used 7-15 trapnets. Shoreline seining for small fish was done during three of these previous investigations. <br> \n  <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2007 of 19.6 fish/net (15.1 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 13.5 fish/net (12.5 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The gillnet catch was dominated by northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2007 of 13.6 fish/net (14.7 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 14.0 fish/net (14.7 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch was dominated by northern pike, bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (3.5/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median pike catch of 3.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 20.6\" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 19.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2007 (caught in a trapnet) was 32.4\".  Most pike captured in 2007 were age three, four, and five.  Pike growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish numbers in 2007 (5.8/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median bluegill catch of 4.9/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 5.5\" (0.15 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 5.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2007 (caught in a gillnet) was 8.5\".  Most bluegill captured in 2007 were ages two, five, and six.  Bluegill growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2007 (1.8/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median crappie catch of 5.6/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2007 averaged 8.3\" (0.4 lb) which was near the median for this lake class and was identical to the average size of 8.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie caught in 2007 was 11.9\".  Crappie growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked every third year in Johnson Lake since 1986.  Walleye numbers in 2007 (1.5/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median walleye catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 13.2\" (0.9 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 14.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2007 (caught in a trapnet) was 26.1\".  All but one of the walleye captured in 2007 were from years in which fingerlings had been stocked.  Walleye growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass may be more abundant in Johnson Lake than indicated by the low catches in the trapnets and gillnets.  Bass are \"net-shy\" and difficult to catch in standard sampling nets.  <br> \n <br> \nA few of the game fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus.  A few of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is 465-acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet located six miles south of Ely in northeastern St. Louis County. There is an earthen public access on the east end of the lake off of county road 21. The access can be treacherous with submerged boulders out front when the lake is low. The lake is lightly developed since most of the shoreline is public land.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Johnson is in lake class 12. Lakes in this class typically are small in size with much of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Other area lakes in the same lake class include:  Ed Shave, Everett, Moosecamp, and Grassy Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe primary predator fish in Johnson Lake is northern pike. Their abundance in 2012 was typical of other class 12 lakes. Pike ranged in length from 17 inches to 25 inches with an average length of about 20 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerling stocking provides an opportunity for anglers to catch walleye in Johnson Lake. Ten of the 12 walleye captured in the 2012 investigation were from stocked years. Walleye sampled in the assessment ranged from 9 to 19 inches, averaging 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, bluegill abundance was the highest ever recorded and higher than what would typically be found in this lake class. The reason for this high abundance is consistent recruitment from many different years. Nine different year classes were present but the 2006 year class (age 6) made up 43% of the sample. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches but most were under 7 inches long. Anglers are encouraged to throw back the largest bluegills and keep a few of the medium-sized fish for table fare. This allows large fish that grow fast to breed, which helps maintain the good size structure of the population. <br> \n <br> \nAnother panfish found in Johnson Lake is black crappie. Most crappie were 4 to 5 inches long with a few in the 9 to 12 inch range.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled were rock bass, white sucker, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead. No largemouth bass were captured in 2012, however they can be found in Johnson Lake.  <br> \n</p>",
