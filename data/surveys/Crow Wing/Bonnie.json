                "narrative": "<p>Bonnie lake is 63 acres in size and is located about seven miles north of Merrifield.  There is no public access on this lake.  Development included about 12 homes/cabins in 1994.  The lake has moderately-hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for the area.  About 62% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and silt.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species like bulrush often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species grew to a depth of about 20 feet in 1994.  These species provide cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Northern pike and largemouth bass were the most abundant gamefish species in the 1994 netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, northern pike abundance was \"high.\"  However, average length was 24 inches and average weight was 3.1 lbs..  Seven age classes were sampled in fairly uniform numbers and growth was good.  Largemouth bass were also caught in \"high\" numbers.  Average weight was 1.6 lbs. and six age classes were present.The bluegill catch was \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.  Seven age classes were sampled and growth was slow.  About 12% of bluegills sampled were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Other panfish sampled included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds and black crappies.Forage species sampled included \"average\" numbers of yellow perch and white suckers.  Other species sampled included brown bullheads and yellow bullheads.</p>",

Seven species were captured, with Yellow Bullhead (9.5/trap net) and Bluegill (6.5/trap net) being the most numerous.
