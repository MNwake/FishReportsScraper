                "narrative": "<p>     Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grassland interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 12.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 14.5 feet.  <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development along the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located on the northwest shoreline with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shoreline.  A carry-in water access is also located along the northwest shoreline.     <br> \n     Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Prior to 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established in 1990 and public access was allowed to the lake, angling pressure was extensive, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  In an attempt to re-establish the quality of the fish populations, Annie Battle Lake was closed to angling from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a \"heritage fishery\" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling for largemouth bass and northern pike and a reduced bag limit for bluegill (5 per day).  The restrictions also include an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie with a daily bag limit of five.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve and maintain the size structure of these species. <br> \n     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Northern pike are moderately abundant.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.9 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill population is also moderately abundant.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 40% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills  attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.  The reduced bag limit may be having a positive influence on the size structure of the bluegill population.      <br> \n    Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Annie Battle Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.4 to 17.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of individual pike was 1.1 pounds.  Northern pike ranged in age from II+ through IV+.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance was below the area median at 15.0 per trap net lift.  The bluegill population appears to be lightly exploited as 52% of the sample measured greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance was 4.6 per trap net lift, which is well above the area median.  Crappie reproduction appears to be consistent as fish age-III+ through age-V+ were sampled.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 6.0 per gill net lift, which is equivalent to the area median.  The average weight of individual walleye was 2.1 pounds.  Annie Battle Lake has never been stocked with walleye.  The walleye population is characterized by older fish as the ages in the sample ranged from age-IV+ thru age-IX+. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grassland interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.5 to 14.5 feet. Annie Battle Lake is included in class 31 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development on the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located along the northwest shore with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shore.  In addition, there are three other small cabins on the north shore which are rented on a daily basis for meetings and conferences.       Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed with a DNR permit.       A carry-in boat access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Prior to 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established in 1990 and public access was allowed to the lake, angling pressure was extensive, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  In an attempt to re-establish the quality of the fish populations, Annie Battle Lake was closed to angling from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a \" heritage fishery\" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling only for largemouth bass and northern pike and a reduced bag limit for bluegill (5 per day) .  The restrictions include an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie and a daily bag limit of five.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the size structure of those species.     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure and growth rates have improved in recent assessments.  Thirty-seven percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length and 14% were 28.0 inches or greater in length.  In the 1999 assessment, no pike were sampled that exceeded 24.0 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 34.1 inches with a mean length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 19.0 inches at four years of age.   Data from this assessment indicate that the catch and release regulation may be having a positive affect on the northern pike population.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  The catch rate was the highest recorded for any assessment of Annie Battle Lake.  The long term trend has been an increase in the catch rate.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 62% of the bluegills exceeding 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills  attain an average length of 7.3 inches at seven years of age.  The reduced bag limit may be having a positive affect on the bluegill population.         Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Annie Battle Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.8 to 17.5 inches with an average length and weight of 12.3 inches and 1.0 pound.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 12.2 inches at five years of age.       Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 14.5 feet.  <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development along the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located on the northwest shoreline with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shoreline.  A carry-in water access is also located along the northwest shoreline.     <br> \n     Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Prior to 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established in 1990 and public access was allowed to the lake, angling pressure was extensive, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  In an attempt to re-establish the quality of the fish populations, Annie Battle Lake was closed to angling from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a \"heritage fishery\" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and a reduced bag limit for Bluegill and Black Crappie (5 each per day).  The intent of this regulation is to improve and maintain the size structure of these species. <br> \n     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth bass, and Bluegill are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Northern Pike are moderately abundant.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n The Bluegill population is also moderately abundant.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 40% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at six years of age.  The reduced bag limit may be having a positive influence on the size structure of the Bluegill population.      <br> \n    Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 16.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Annie Battle Lake is located entirely within Glenadough State Park, about five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake.  Until 1990, the lake was within the Glenadough Game Farm, and did not have public access.  The land surroundling the lake was subsequently donated to the Nature Conservancy, who in turn gave it to the state of Minnesota to be managed as a state park.  A survey of the fishery in 1990 documented quality populations of several species of fish, with sizes typically well above average.  Once the land became public, initial fishing pressure was heavy.  In order to offset negative impacts to the quality of the fishery, a temporary closure of the lake to fishing was enacted from 1993 to 1997.  The closure was intended to allow fish populations to recover from heavy initial pressure, and to allow time for the rule making process to develop protective regulations for the lake.  There was interest in maintaining a fishery that was reminiscent of the \"good old days of fishing,\"  where methods of angling were simple and the quality of fishing was high.  To this end, the lake was designated a \"heritage fishery\" when it reopened to fishing in 1997.  Special regulations were enacted that prohibited the use of electronic equipment (e.g., fish finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any kind (including power augers) on the lake.  In addition, the bag limit was reduced to five sunfish and only catch-and-release angling is allowed for largemouth bass and northern pike.     Annie Battle Lake lies within a chain of lakes between West Battle and Otter Tail Lake.  Balmoral Creek flows from West Battle to Molly Stark Lake, then to Annie Battle and Blanche Lakes, before emptying into Otter Tail Lake.  Annie Battle Lake has an area of 358 acres.  The maximum depth is 51 feet, but 42% of the lake is less than 15 ft. deep.  Extensive areas of the shoerline harbor hardstem bulrush, and most areas shallower than 17 ft. have submerged vegetation.     The lake presently harbors quality populations of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  Lower numbers of above-average sized walleye are present.  Several species of non-game fish are present as well.     The bluegill catch averaged 17.3 per trap net in the 1999 survey, which is similar to previous surveys (14.7 in 1996 and 15.0 in 1990).  Average size was very good; 52% of the bluegills sampled were greater than 7.0 inches in length, and 10% exceeded 8.0 inches.  It appears that the reduced bag limit for bluegill has protected the quality bluegill population; the 1996 and 1990 surveys found that 58% and 52%, respectively, of bluegill were greater than 7.0 inches in length.  Although the average size is large, growth is slow for this type of lake.  Bluegills reached an average of 5.9 inches at age 7, while the average for lakes of this type in the Fergus Falls management area is 6.8 inches.  Growth is down slightly from 1996, when the average was 6.2 inches at age 7.       Black crappie averaged 0.9 per trap net in a special spring trapnetting assessment.  The average size was good, as 90% of the crappies sampled were greater than 10.0 inches in length.  Averaged length was 11.4 inches.  Previous surveys have also found good crappie populations.     There was an average of  3.3 largemouth bass per gill net, which is well above what is expected for this type of lake.  It appears that the catch-and-release regulation is maintaining the quality largemouth population, as the 1996 survey had an identical average catch.  Because gill nets do not sample bass very effectively, it is likely that the bass population is under-represented in this survey.  The average size of bass sampled was 11.1 inches and 0.8 lbs.  The largest was 14.8 inches, but larger bass are not typically sampled well in gill nets. Bass reach an average of 11.3 inches by age 4, which is typical for this type of lake.     Walleye averaged 2.1 per gill net, which is similar to the previous survey (1.9), and near what is typical for this type of lake.  Annie Battle lacks gravel and rubble shoals needed for walleye to spawn, as does Balmoral Creek, so lower numbers are expected.  Most of the walleye in the lake are probably migrants from either Otter Tail or West Battle Lake.  Walleye averaged 17.9 inches and 1.9 lbs., with 18 of 19 fish exceeding 15.0 inches in length.  At age 4 fish averaged 16.0 inches, which is better than expected for this type of lake.  Growth rates were similar in 1996.     Northern pike catches were typical of lakes of this type, averaging 3.2 per gill net.  Size structure declined from 1996.  In 1996, fifteen percent of the pike sampled exceeded 24.0 inches  compared to no fish above 24.0 inches in this survey.  This was unexpected, considering the no harvest regulation for pike currently in place.  Pike reached 15.7 inches by age 4, which is similar to previous surveys.     Yellow perch catches were low, averaging 0.2 per gill net.  Catches have typically been low in this lake.  Tullibee averaged 1.6 per gill net, about what is expected from this lake type.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grassland interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 6.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 14.5 feet.  <br> \n     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development along the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located on the northwest shoreline with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shoreline.  A carry-in water access is also located along the northwest shoreline.     <br> \n     Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Prior to 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established in 1990 and public access was allowed to the lake, angling pressure was extensive, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  In an attempt to re-establish the quality of the fish populations, Annie Battle Lake was closed to angling from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a \"heritage fishery\" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and a reduced bag limit for Bluegill and Black Crappie (5 each per day).  The intent of this regulation is to improve and maintain the size structure of these species. <br> \n     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A low-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 32.2 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 19.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill size structure is excellent with 60% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length and 9% measuring 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.  The reduced bag limit may be having a positive influence on the size structure of the Bluegill population. <br> \n    Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.2 to 17.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n    The Black Crappie population is moderately abundant.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 5.4 to 12.2 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches.  Forty-three percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n    Walleyes ranged in length from 14.7 to 23.5 inches with an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at five years of age.    <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Annie Battle Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located entirely within Glendalough State Park approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grassland interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was 14.5 feet which is indicative of excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.5 to 14.0 feet. Annie Battle Lake is included in lake class 31 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' lake classification scheme.     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development on the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located along the northwest shore with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shore.  In addition, there are three other small cabins on the north shore which are rented on a daily basis for meetings and conferences.       The predominant shoreline substrate is sand.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed with a DNR permit.       A carry-in boat access is located along the northwest shoreline.  Until 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established and public access was allowed to the lake, fishing pressure became heavy, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  As a result, the fishing season was closed from 1993 until 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a \" heritage fishery\" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling only for largemouth bass and northern pike and a reduced bag limit for bluegill.  A minimum size limit and reduced bag limit for black crappie will be implemented in 2003.  The restrictions will include an 11-inch minimum size limit and a daily bag limit of five.  The purpose of this regulation is to improve the size structure of those species.     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       The northern pike gill net catch rate was within the expected range for class 31 lakes.  Northern pike size structure and growth rates have improved since the 1999 lake survey.  Nineteen percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length and 7% were 28.0 inches or greater in length.  In the 1999 survey, no pike were sampled that exceeded 24.0 inches in length.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.4 inches at six years of age.   Data from this lake survey indicate that the special regulation may be having a positive affect on the northern pike population.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Since the 1990 lake survey, the trend has been an increase in the percentage of bluegill that are 8.0 inches or greater in length.  The percentage has increased in each successive survey.  In this survey, thirty percent of the bluegill sampled were 8.0 inches or greater in length and bluegill up to 9.8 inches in length were sampled.  Bluegill growth rates also have improved.  Bluegill now attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.  The reduced bag limit appears to be having a positive affect on the bluegill population.          Test-net catch rates indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Bass ranged in length from 4.4 to 14.5 inches.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction may be consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at age four.</p>",
