The northern pike gill-net catch rate, although high, is still within the expected range for this type of lake.  The average size of the fish sampled is relatively small (19.8 inches), but pike up to 34 inches were sampled.  Growth of young northern pike appears to be good.     Yellow perch are the main forage for northern pike.  The yellow perch catch rate is low, below the expected range.  However, they are relatively large.  They averaged 8.9 inches and perch were sampled up to 12.0 inches.     Black crappie catch rates are lower than the expected range for both gill nets and trap nets.  However, the few that were sampled had an average length of 12.5 inches and average weight of 1.1 pounds.     Bluegill were also sampled at low rates, although the catch rate is still within the expected range.  Although the average length of bluegill was only 5.0 inches, some were sampled up to 10.5 inches.     Other species sampled include; largemouth bass, tullibee, bowfin (dogfish), yellow and brown bullhead, white sucker and pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

Panfish were present in near normal numbers for lakes of this type.  The walleye population in late June appeared low, and was mostly of larger-sized fish.  It seems likely that considerable variation in the walleye population occurs in this lake since it is part of a lake since it is part of a lake chain, up which a considerable walleye run from downstream Jessie Lake occurs.  The walleye population is very likely considerably larger during late May and early June.</p>",
