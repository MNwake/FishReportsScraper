                "narrative": "<p>Hogback Lake is 40 acres with 60% littoral area, having a maximum depth of 43 feet.  Located 12.2 miles east of Isabella, MN on USFS  Road #172 (Dumbbell Lake Road), there are three drive-in campsites, one remote campsite  (water access), an outhouse, a back-in gravel ramp access to the lake and a barrier-free fishing pier.  Anglers can also fish from shore on Hogback Lake at various places along the hiking trail, on the north and east sides of the lake.  Designated Stream Trout Lake signs are posted near each access point on the north side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nHogback Lake is one of the more popular managed stream trout lakes in the Finland Management Area and gets high fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons. Splake fingerlings are stocked annually in the fall and rainbow trout yearlings are stocked annually in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nThe splake numbers sampled in Hogback Lake were average for the Finland Area and similar to catches in previous investigations.  The average length of the catch was 13.4 inches (1.1 pound); the largest splake sampled was 22.7 inches (3.9 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout numbers were slightly above average for stream trout lakes in the Finland Area.  The average weight of rainbow trout sampled in the 09/28/2011 investigation was 0.8 pound (12.6 inches) also above average for the Finland Area; the largest rainbow trout was 17.2 inches (1.9 pounds).  Rainbow trout populations are difficult to assess with standard sampling gear, this fall trap net assessment was an attempt to collect a larger sample.  Angling for rainbow trout is often better for the public in Hogback Lake than population assessment catch rates indicate. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hogback Lake is 40 acres with 60% littoral area, having a maximum depth of 43 feet.  Located 12.2 miles east of Isabella, MN on USFS  Road #172 (Dumbbell Lake Road), there are three drive-in campsites, one remote campsite  (water access), an outhouse, a back-in gravel ramp access to the lake and a barrier-free fishing pier.  Anglers can also fish from shore on Hogback Lake at various places along the hiking trail, on the north and east sides of the lake.  Designated Stream Trout Lake signs are posted near each access point on the north side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nHogback Lake is one of the more popular managed stream trout lakes in the Finland Management Area and gets high fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons. Splake fingerlings are stocked annually in the fall and rainbow trout yearlings are stocked annually in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nThe splake numbers sampled in Hogback Lake were average for the Finland Area and similar to catches in previous investigations.  The average length of the catch was 8.9 inches (0.4 pound); the largest splake sampled was 22.7 inches (4 pounds).  Sixty-seven percent of the splake sampled in 2011 were yearlings, stocked as fingerlings in the fall of 2010, which brought down the average size of the fish in this report. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout numbers sampled in 2011 were above average for the Finland Management Area.  The average length of rainbow trout in the catch was 11 inches (0.7 pound), the largest rainbow trout 20.3 inches (3.7 pounds).  More than 50% of the rainbow trout sampled were yearlings stocked in the spring of 2011, which brought down the average size of the fish in this report.   Rainbow trout populations are difficult to assess with any sampling gear, many different methods have been tried to attain a larger sample without much success.  Angling for rainbow trout is often better for the public in Hogback Lake than population assessment catch rates would indicate. <br> \n <br> \nOne yellow perch was collected in the 2011 lake survey, the first time yellow perch were sampled in Hogback Lake since the 2002 lake rehabilitation project.  Yellow perch are a problem in managed stream trout lakes, out-competing the stocked fish for food and negatively affecting trout survival and growth <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hogback Lake is a 40.2 acre designated trout lake managed for Rainbow Trout and Splake in the Superior National Forest.  The maximum depth is 43 feet and it has fairly clear water.  The lake is located 10 miles east of Isabella.  Access is a gravel ramp off of USFS Rd. #172 (Wanless Road) to the north shore of the lake.  Hogback Lake is stocked annually with Rainbow Trout yearlings and Splake fingerlings.    <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, four automatic temperature loggers were deployed in the access basin at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 feet from August 6 to October 24, 2018.  Five temperature loggers were placed in the back basin at depths of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 feet during the same time period.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same locations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that during the summer of 2018, Hogback Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to check the suitability of Hogback Lake for trout stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hogback Lake is a designated trout lake and is located just over 12 miles east of Isabella, Minnesota off of USFS Rd. # 172 (Wanless Rd.).  The access is a back-down gravel ramp on the northern end of the lake.  The access is located in a U.S. Forest Service Campground, which has three campsites, several picnic areas, hiking trails, and an accessible fishing pier.  There is one remote campsite located on the northern shore of the south basin.  Hogback Lake is one of the most heavily used trout lakes in the Finland Area as it is easily accessible and the lake has a history of producing nice trout.  Fishing pressure is presumed to be high throughout the year.  Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nHogback Lake has an area of 40 acres and is comprised of two lake basins separated by a narrow and shallow channel.  The southern basin has a maximum depth of 43.0 feet and comprises 14 acres of the lake, while the northern basin reaches a maximum depth of 24.0 feet.  Water clarity is good with visibility down to 19 feet in the light green water for both basins.  The entire shoreline is under federal ownership and is covered by a mixture of deciduous and coniferous forest with a small portion on the western shore of the northern basin covered in wetland.  The aquatic and riparian plant community was diverse with 21 types present in the lake.  The lake bed consists of gravel, rubble, and muck.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Splake catch was average to similar lakes in the Finland Area.  The average length of Splake from gill nets was 12.16 inches and had an average weight of 0.87 pounds.  The largest Splake sampled in the gill nets was 19.49 inches long and weighed 2.43 pounds.  There were four year class of Splake found in the sampled based on scale aging and growth is average for compared to other lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The Splake population in Hogback Lake is maintained by annual fall stockings of 4,000 fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of two Rainbow Trout were caught in the 2016 survey, which was below average of the Finland area.  They both measured 11.02 inches long and weighed 0.45 pounds.  The two previous surveys had gill net catches for Rainbow Trout near average for the area.  Hogback Lake is stocked annually in the spring with 1,000 Rainbow Trout yearlings to maintain the Rainbow Trout population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey was the second consecutive survey to sample Yellow Perch in Hogback Lake.  Gill nets sampled 32 Yellow Perch, which was above average relative to similar lakes.  A total of 239 Yellow Perch were caught in the trap nets.  The small mesh trap nets sampled an additional 256 Yellow Perch.  The average length of Yellow Perch sampled was 6.39 inches and average weight was 0.11 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch measured 8.50 inches long and weighed 0.26 pounds.  There were two year classes of Yellow Perch based on scale aging and growth of Yellow Perch was fast for the Finland Area.  Yellow Perch are an undesirable fish species in Hogback Lake and often will outcompete the trout in designated trout lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nA single White Sucker was caught in the gill nets and measured 15.55 inches (1.55 pounds).  This was the first time White Sucker have been sampled in any gear type in Hogback Lake since the 2002 reclamation.  White Sucker are also an undesirable fish species to have in a designated trout lake as they will compete with the trout for food.  Other species sampled in six small mesh trap nets sets in 2016 were Fathead Minnow, Northern Redbelly Dace, and Iowa Darter.   <br> \n <br> \nHogback Lake has a good population of Splake and an average population of Rainbow Trout compared to other Finland Area trout lakes.  Both species of trout have the populations maintained by annual stocking and both species are targeted by anglers throughout the year.  As the populations of Yellow Perch and White Sucker continue to grow, the quality of the trout fisheries in Hogback Lake may start to decline.   <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet and is quite clear, with a Secchi disc visible to a depth of 16 feet. There is a gravel boat ramp on the north shore and a fishing pier at the picnic area midway along the north shore. A U.S. Forest Service hiking trial originates at Hogback Lake and passes near three other lakes, including two designated trout lakes. A few vehicle accessible campsites are located along the road on the north side of the lake. Hogback Lake was reclaimed in the fall of 2002 and is stocked every year with yearling rainbow trout and splake fingerlings. No live bait is allowed on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006 rainbow trout were collected in above average numbers.  However, the unusually high catch was primarily due to capture of a high number of recently stocked fish; most of the rainbow trout that were sampled had been stocked as yearlings a few weeks earlier and averaged about 11 inches. The largest rainbow trout collected was 22.4 inches and a few 15-16 inch fish were also sampled. Rainbow trout are difficult to capture in netting gear and netting results may not present an accurate view of the population. <br> \n <br> \nSplake were collected in average numbers, and included fish up to 18.5 inches. The splake were in three size ranges, with several between 7-9.5 inches, fair numbers between 12-14 inches, and a few fish 17-18 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

White Suckers were sampled in very low numbers (3/gillnet, 0.1/trapnet). The White Sucker trapnet catch before the 1984-85 sucker removal was 27/lift. Yellow Perch densities have increased considerably since the sucker removal, indicated by a gillnet catch of 65/lift.</p>",

DNR test nets in 1993 sampled a small number of Rainbow Trout most of which were between 8\" and 11\". But Hogback Lake does support some large trout such as the 6.3 lb fish observed during the survey.     Hogback Lake is one of the more popular Designated Stream Trout Lakes in the Finland/Isabella area. Vehicle accessible campsites, a good boat access and a barrier-free fishing pier all factor into this popularity.</p>",

There is a public access with earthen ramp and ample parking for several vehicles.  The Lake is popular with anglers and other recreational users with a 3 site US Forest Service campground, a picnic area, one water access campsite, a handicapped accessible fishing pier and hiking trails.  The lake is 40 acres with a maximum depth of 43 feet.  A standard survey was completed on October 19 and 20, 2020 to evaluate current management goals and provide data to inform future management.  Rainbow Trout and Splake are the primary managed species and the lake is stocked with 1,000 yearling Rainbow Trout each spring and 4,000 fingerling Splake each fall.   <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout catch was 1.5 per net, with an average weight and length of 0.8 pounds and 13.1 inches.  Fish from each of the last two seasons were captured indicating at least some fish do carry over past first year. <br> \n <br> \nSplake catch was 7 per net, with an average weight of 0.7 pounds and average length of 12.1 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 20.2 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Fish from three of the last four years of stocking were sampled with age-2 fish making up over half of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout gill net catch of 2.5 per net was average compared to similar lakes.  The average weight and length was 1.7 pounds and 15.7 inches.  This was a one-time stocking event due to covid restrictions, which prevented some of Finland's remote Brook Trout lakes from being stocked in 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in 2011 and have become established in the lake.  Yellow Perch catch of 10/net, with an average weight of 0.17 pounds were both near the upper end of the normal range for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 10.8 inches long and weighed 0.5 pounds, and 15% of the catch was at least nine inches long.  One White Sucker was sampled with a length of 17.9 inches and weight of 2.5 pounds.  Yellow Perch and White Sucker populations will continue to be monitored as Hogback Lake is a potential candidate for lake reclamation.  <br> \n</p>",

Possessing live minnows or using them for bait on designated stream trout lakes is prohibited.  Only one line is permitted at any time.  Fishing hours for stream trout on inland waters are from one hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.  All stream trout must have head, tail, fins and skin intact when being transported.     The only fish collected in DNR test nets in 1999 where a few white sucker, various minnows species and an extremely high number of yellow perch.  The fact that no rainbow trout were collected in nets, even though they are stocked regularly, is not too unusual as they are a species that is difficult to catch with nets.  However in this case the competition from an exploding yellow perch population may be impacting rainbow trout numbers.  It is inevitable that with yellow perch becoming more abundant a successful rainbow trout fishery will not be maintained.  In order to return good trout fishing to the lake it will be necessary to eliminate the yellow perch through a lake reclamation.  Depending upon budget constraints a reclamation will be proposed for the fall of 2001 with the lake to be restocked the following spring.</p>",
