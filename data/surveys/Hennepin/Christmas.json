                "narrative": "<p>Christmas Lake is a 265-acre class 23 lake in Hennepin County.  A public boat access is located on the north side of the lake, however parking is limited. Christmas Lake is unique because it is one of the few lakes in the Metro Region that can support a two-story fishery.  This means sufficient oxygen levels and cool water temperatures in deeper portions of the lake allow the over-summer survival of cold-water species, while warm-water species inhabit the warmer water above the thermocline.  Thus, rainbow trout and occasionally brown trout have been stocked since 1986 to utilize this unique resource.\n\nA total of 21 rainbow trout were sampled which represents the highest catch of rainbow trout in Christmas Lake to date.  Mean length and weight was 19.5 inches and 3.5 pounds for gill net caught rainbow trout.\n\nBluegill abundance is high for this type of lake.  Thirtyfour percent of bluegills are larger than 7 inches and individuals up to 8.2 inches were sampled.  Pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish were also sampled but at considerably lower densities.\n\nNorthern pike in Christmas Lake are abundant but tend to be small.  Average length was 19.6 inches and mean weight was 1.92 pounds.  Despite the small average size, 19 percent are longer than 25 inches, which has increased from 5 percent in 2001. \n\nThirteen largemouth bass were sampled representing 5 year classes, ranging from 2 - 7 years old.  Mean length was 6.8 inches and mean weight was 0.3 pounds.  \n\nAlthough not overly abundant, other species of interest to anglers are black crappie, and yellow perch. \n</p>",

This means that the lake is cold enough and has enough oxygen to support trout at depths normally devoid of fish during the summer.  To support the two-story fishery the lake continues to be stocked with catchable size adult rainbow trout.  The average length of rainbow trout captured was 20.1 inches long while average weight was 4.5 pounds.Bluegill, as well as pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, were captured with relatively high abundance for this lake type.  Bluegill average weight was 0.25 pounds and mean length was 6.2 inches.  Seventy-five percent of bluegill captured were greater than 6.0 inches while 42% were greater than 7.0 inches  No black crappie were captured during the survey.Northern pike were sampled with relatively high abundance, although sizes tended to be small.  Lengths ranged from 12.8 to 29.3 inches long with an average length of 17.1 inches.  Average northern pike weight was 1.1 pounds.One 21.6 inch (3.5 pound) walleye was captured during the survey.   Other species of angler interest within Christmas Lake are largemouth bass, green sunfish, and yellow perch.  However, abundance levels and size for these species was found to be very low.</p>",

NOP WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS AND EQUAL TO OR SLIGHTLY BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE NOP SAMPLED WERE AGE III+ OR YOUNGER.  AS A RESULT OF THIS YOUNG POPULATION STRUCTURE THE CALCULATED RSD 21=6.67% FOR NOP SAMPLED WITH ALL GEAR TYPES.  UP THROUGH AGE 5+ GROWTH RATE FOR NOP APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE.  LMB WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAPNETS.  ELECTROFISHING PROVIDED THE ONLY LMB OF QUALITY SIZE AND A PSD=21.4% WAS REALIZED FROM THIS SAMPLE.  ONE SCHOOL OF LARGE ADULT BASS WAS OBSERVED SWIMMING AROUND SOME DOCKS DURING THIS ASSESSMENT.  GROWTH RATE FOR LMB APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.  ONE WAE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WAS CAPTURED WHILE ELECTROFISHING.  NO BNT OR RBT FROM PREVIOUS STOCKINGS OF BROODSTOCK CULLS WERE SAMPLED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT EVEN THOUGH GILL NETS WERE SET RELATIVELY DEEP TO ATTEMPT CAPTURE OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS.  BLG WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH TYPES OF GEAR.  THE BLGS SAMPLED AVERAGE 6.05 FISH PER POUND AND REPRESENT A CALCULATED PSD=28.3%.  BLG INDICES REPRESENTED IN THE HISTORIC NETTING RECORDS APPEAR TO BE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH, WHILE THOSE FOR NOP ARE DOWN FROM THE 1986 FISH SURVEY.  GSF WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS AND RANGED IN SIZE FROM 3.5 TO 6.9 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  YEBS WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH GEAR TYPES AND AVERAGED 1.79 FISH PER POUND.  BLB AND BRB WERE SAMPLED, BUT IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS. SEVERAL SCHOOLS OF LARGE CAP WERE OBSERVED, BUT ONLY TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE CAUGHT.  THESE FISH AVERAGED ABOUT 30 BLCS AND YEP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN NUMBERS, WHILE PMK, WTS AND BOF WERE SAMPLED NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Christmas Lake is 267 acres, with a maximum depth of 87 feet. It is located southeast of the City of Excelsior, in southwestern Hennepin County. Public access is provided by a city-owned boat ramp located on the northwestern shore. Christmas Lake is a unique metro lake with exceptionally clear water and abundant summer dissolved oxygen. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels are present in Christmas Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPast management of Christmas Lake focused on establishing a put-and-take trout fishery. Since discontinuation of trout stocking after May 2016, Christmas Lake management has shifted towards Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Bluegill fisheries. A Standard Survey was conducted during the summer of 2023 to assess fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high, with 7.2 fish per gill net sampled in 2023. Pike averaged 22.4 inches, with the largest measured at 34.6 inches. The Northern Pike population in Christmas Lake could benefit from the Northern Pike north-central zone regulation that took effect in 2018, where 10 fish may be kept, but not more than 2 over 26\" and all fish from 22-26\" must be immediately released. Sixty-nine percent of pike sampled were outside of the protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass sampling was not conducted in 2023.  Five bass were incidentally sampled in the gill nets and trap nets, ranging in length from 5.3 to 14.4 inches.  When bass electrofishing was previously conducted, in 2018, the fish were abundant, and size ranged between 10.3 and 18.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in Christmas Lake was high, with 61.7 fish per trap net sampled. Bluegill averaged 5.9 inches, with the largest measured at 8.6 inches. While there are a lot of small individuals in the population, anglers still have an opportunity to catch fish greater than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Brown Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and Yellow Bullhead.  No Rainbow Trout were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Christmas Lake is a relatively infertile lake with a water clarity of 25 feet on June 24, 1996. The lake is managed as a two-story lake which means that warmwater species, such as bluegills, and coldwater species, such as rainbow trout, can survive in the same lake. Christmas Lake is one of the few lakes in the metro area with habitat to support trout all year long. Surplus rainbow trout from state fish hatcheries are occasionally stocked when they become available. Catchable size trout, 8 to 11 inches, have also been stocked in the past. During the summer the trout move to deeper, cool, well oxygenated water.The shallower waters of the lake contain a diverse aquatic plant community where a majority of the fish species are located. Bluegills are relatively abundant in the lake although the slow growth limits the number of fish attaining a size prefered by anglers. The average size of bluegills sampled in the trapnets was 6.2 inches, with 60% 6 inches or longer, and 19% 7 inches or longer. Individuals up to 7.9 inches were sampled. Pumpkinseed, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were present in lower abundance when compared to the bluegills. None of these three species exceeded 7.5 inches in length. Largemouth bass were present in the lake but the sampling gear used is not very effective at capturing bass. Black crappie and yellow perch remained in very low abundance. Northern pike are abundant for this infertile lake. The average size sampled was 17.1 inches and 1.1 pounds. Yellow bullheads were five times more abundant than black bullheads which reflects the good water quality of Christmas Lake. Black bullheads were low in abundance, while yellow bullheads were moderately abundant for lakes similar to Christmas Lake. Bullheads up to 12.4 inches were present.Bowfin, carp, and white suckers were sampled in average numbers for this type of lake. The fish were large with bowfin averaging 4.3 pounds, white suckers averaging 2.5 pounds, and carp averaging 12.1 pounds.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Christmas Lake is 267 acres in size, with a maximum depth of 87 feet. It is located southeast of the City of Excelsior, in southwestern Hennepin County. Public access is provided by a city-owned boat ramp located on the northwestern shore. Christmas Lake is a unique metro lake with exceptionally clear water (29 foot visibility) and abundant summer dissolved oxygen. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels have been found in Christmas Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nPast management of Christmas Lake focused on establishing a put-and-take trout fishery. Since discontinuation of trout stocking after May 2016, Christmas Lake management has shifted towards Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. A Standard Survey (trap nets, gill nets, and boat electrofishing) was conducted during the week of 6/25/2018 to assess fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2018 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the first time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were high, with 80.7 fish/hour. Despite the high numbers, few large fish were sampled. Largemouth Bass averaged 10.3 inches, with the largest measured at 18.6 inches. Over 70% of bass sampled were less than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in Christmas Lake was high, with 35.8/net. Bluegill averaged 5.9 inches, with the largest measured at 8.5 inches. While much of the Bluegill population was composed of small individuals, anglers are still provided an opportunity to catch fish greater than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high, with 7.2/net. Pike averaged 20.0 inches, with the largest measured at 29.1 inches. Despite smaller sizes, Northern Pike in Christmas Lake stand to benefit from the new Northern Pike regulation (effective 2018), where 10 fish may be kept, but not more than 2 over 26\" and all fish from 22-26\" must be immediately released. Over 80% of pike sampled were outside of the protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead; no rainbow trout were sampled. <br> \n</p>",
