WALLEYE CAPTURED THIS SURVEY HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF 3.83 PDS AND IN 1984 THE MEAN WALLEYE WEIGHT WAS 1.42 PDS. THE PSD FOR FISH 20 INCHES OR MORE IN 1984 WAS FIVE AND IN 1989 IT WAS 44. FIVE OF THE NINE WALLEYE CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS WERE AGE SIX; POSSIBLY RESULTING FROM A STOCKING OF 200,000 WALLEYE FRY IN 1983. IT APPEARS THAT LITTLE IF ANY RECRUITMENT RESULTED FROM THE 1985 AND 1988 FRY STOCKING; NO WALLEYE LESS THAN FIVE YEARS OLD OR 19 INCHES IN LENGTH WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY. PERHAPS PREDATION BY BLACK BULLHEAD AND BLACK CRAPPIE ELIMINATED THE 1985 AND 1988 COHORTS. GROWTH FOR ALL WALLEYE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY APPROXIMATED THE STATE AVERAGE. BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND APPEARS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2.8 TIMES THE ABUNDANCE FOUND IN 1984. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLUEGILL CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY WAS 0.40 PDS. THE PRESENT STOCK APPEARS TO BE EXCLUS- IVELY AGE TWO AND AGE THREE FISH. NO AGE ONE BLUEGILL WERE CAPTURED. ALL BLUEGILL CAPTURED DUR- ING THIS STUDY AROSE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. BLUEGILL GROWTH GREATLY EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED. ALTHOUGH LESS THANT THE 1984 CPUE, THE 1989 BLACK CRAPPIE CPUE OF 32.80 FISH PER TRAP NET FALLS WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN BLACK CRAPPIE. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED IN 1984 WAS 0.20 POUNDS AND IN 1989 IT WAS 0.26 PDS. THE 1984 STOCK WAS EXCLUSIVELY AGE TWO AND FOUR FISH. IN 1989 THE STOCK WAS COMPOSED OF FOUR AGE GROUPS WITH AGE FOUR FISH DOMINATING. NO AGE ONE FISH WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY. GROWTH FOR BLACK CRAPPIE IN THE WINDOM AREA USUALLY EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE BUT FIRST FULDA FISH GROWTH ONLY APPROXIMATED THE STATE AVERAGE. THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE IS FIVE TIMES THAT FOUND IN 1984 AND IS TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE FISH CAPTURED IN 1989 WAS 2.38 PDS. OF THE FIVE NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED, FOUR WERE AGE THREE AND ONE WAS AGE FOUR. GROWTH FOR FIRST FULDA NORTHERN PIKE WERE AGE THREE AND ONE WAS AGE FOUR. GROWTH FOR FIRST FULDA NORTHERN PIKE EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED. BASED ON REPRODUCTION CHECKS, NORTHERN PIKE DO SPAWN IN THE FIRST FULDA WATERSHED. IN 1984 THE YELLOW PERCH CPUE WAS 114.50 FISH PER GILL NET. IN 1989 NO YELLOW PERCH WERE CAPTURED IN TWO GILLNET SETS AND ONLY ONE WAS TAKEN IN THE TRAPNETS. BASED ON REPRODUCTION CHECKS, IT APPEARS THAT YELLOW PERCH SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN 1983, 1984, 1985 AND 1988. APPARENTLY, FEW YOY YELLOW PERCH ARE RECRUITING TO THE CATCHABLE POPULATION. ALTHOUGH 4,950 FLATHEAD CATFISH FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1980, NO CATFISH HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN EITHER FULDA LAKE SINCE THEN. THE WHITE SUCKER CPUE OF 3.50 FISH PER GILL NET IS FIVE TIMES THAT RECRODED IN 1984. THE BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE, ALTHOUGH 6.2 TIMES THAT RECORDED IN 1984, IS STILL ONLY APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN. IN 1984 THE MEAN BLACK BULLHEAD WEIGHT WAS 0.53 PDS; IN 1989 THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.16 PDS. THE YELLOW BULLHEAD CPUE OF 1.40 FISH PER TRAP NET IS TEN TIMES THE CPUE RECORDED IN 1984.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nFirst and Second Fulda Lakes, 179 and 60-acres, are located in Murray County and surrounded by the City bearing its name; Fulda.  A channel between the two lakes maintains a connection throughout the year.  After several winters of severe winterkill, rough fish such as Common Carp and Black Bullhead were highly abundant in the lakes resulting in poor water quality that limited angling opportunities.  As a result, a reclamation using rotenone was done in 2008 (following a partial draw down in 2007), in cooperation with the Fulda community, to \"restart\" the lakes.  In 2009, the lake was stocked with Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and in 2010 was stocked with Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  Despite the reclamation and redesigned dam with an electric barrier, Common Carp and Black Bullhead have been sampled in Fulda Lakes, likely reentering the system from downstream during a 100 year high water event in the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011.  However, their populations have been held in check by the abundant predator populations.  Fulda Lakes are managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as well as Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 24, 2019 to monitor fish populations using 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  Largemouth Bass were electrofished on May 28, 2019 to monitor their population.  <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \nDaytime electrofishing resulted in 39 Largemouth Bass ranging in length from just over 3 inches to nearly 20 inches.  The catch rate of 39 per hour was the lowest on record since 2011.  It appears from the lengths of fish in the sample that there were more than 5 different year classes indicating good natural reproduction.  The average length (12.8 inches) and weight (1.7 pounds) was good.  The population appears to be dominated by adult fish with a PSD-Q of 93 and a PSD-P of 60.  Some harvest of Largemouth Bass could be good to reduce the numbers of moderate sized adult fish.  There should be decent fishing for Largemouth Bass over the next few years.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nBluegill were caught at a rate of 50.9 per trap net in 2019, the highest catch rate observed since reclamation in 2008.  Additionally, the 2019 catch rate was greater than twice the interquartile range of 1.2 to 20.0 for class 43 lakes.  The take home message here is that Fulda is loaded with Bluegills.  Bluegill in the trap net sample ranged in length from 3.7 inches to 7.1 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches (PSD-Q of 19).  When analyzing the length frequency distribution it is impossible to discern age groups. Overall, small size and clumped age groups indicates a potentially stunted Bluegill population.  A predator was needed to reduce the number of small Bluegill in Fulda Lakes.  Winter rescue adult Northern Pike were stocked in December of 2019 with the intention of increasing their abundance for anglers as well as providing a predator for stunted Bluegill.  Bluegill should remain plentiful, however, it is preferred if the Northern Pike eliminate some fish in order to increase their maximum size and improve angler satisfaction.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE     <br> \nThree Northern Pike were caught in 2 gill nets in 2019.  The fish were 20 inches, 25 inches, and 27 inches. Overall, the abundance of Northern Pike was down sharply from 2015 when 7 per gill net and 2.8 per trap net were caught.  The 2019 catch rate was still in line with the long-term average of just under 1.5 per gill net, however, the long-term average includes the period of time with degraded habitat prior to the reclamation.  Over 600 winter rescue adult Northern Pike from a northern Minnesota lake were stocked in December of 2019 to increase the abundance of Northern Pike.  This is the most adult Northern Pike that we have ever stocked in Fulda Lakes at one time.  Northern Pike angling opportunities should increase dramatically over the next several years.  Fulda Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, which has a limit of two Pike that must be longer than 24 inches. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nSeventy-seven Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and trap nets.  The gill net catch rate of 27.5 per net was just above the upper expected value of 25 for similar lakes.  The trap net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes but trap net catch is not always indicative of abundance for Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from just under 5.5 inches to just over 8.5 inches with an average length of over 7 inches.  There did not appear to be any change in health of the fish as they grew larger indicating good conditions for all ages of Yellow Perch.  The population appears to be doing well and are at a length that should provide good angling in the next several years as well as providing food for top predators like Northern Pike and Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE   <br> \nOnly a few Walleye were caught in the 2019 survey, 3 in the gill nets and 2 in the trap nets.  Walleye fingerling are stocked every other year, and in years when extra fingerling are harvested each fall.  Therefore, Walleye have been stocked in 7 out of 9 years since 2011 (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019).  The length of Walleye in the gill and trap net samples ranged from 14.5 inches to just over 26.5 inches with an average near 18 inches.  Large fish are present in Fulda Lakes and may help to keep Black Bullhead and small Common Carp numbers down due to predation.  The actual number of Walleye in Fulda Lakes could be higher than what is seen in this survey due to the amount of submerged vegetation.  When vegetation is abundant, Walleye typically move less and do not net as well as in lakes without vegetation.  Fishing for Walleye could be good in Fulda Lakes, an opportunity to catch a large fish exists.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOther species sampled in Fulda Lakes in 2019 were Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, and Common Carp.  All 3 species were caught at levels less than their expected ranges.  This indicates that those species may be a low abundance and are not a significant member (in terms of pounds per acre) of the fish community <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nFirst and Second Fulda Lakes, 179 and 60-acres, are located in Murray County within the City of Fulda.  A channel between the two basins maintains a connection throughout the year; therefore, they are managed as one system.  After several winters of severe winterkill, rough fish such as Common Carp and Black Bullhead were highly abundant in the lakes resulting in poor water quality, limited angling opportunities, and a basin devoid of aquatic vegetation (spawning and nursery habitat for fish).  As a result, a reclamation using rotenone was done in 2008 (following a partial draw down in 2007), to \"restart\" the lakes.  The following year (2009), the lake was stocked with Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and in 2010 was stocked with Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  Despite the reclamation, Common Carp and Black Bullhead have been sampled in Fulda Lakes, likely reentering the system from downstream during a high water event in the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011 due primarily to a failure in the electric barrier and a 100 year precipitation event.  However, their populations have been held in check to date by the abundant predator populations.  Additionally the improvement in water quality and clarity has created a basin with native vegetation that doesn't allow those species the competitive edge to expand and thrive thus far.  Fulda Lakes are managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year beginning in 2011 at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017).  Northern Pike fingerlings are stocked every other year if they are available.  Other secondary management species sustain their populations through natural reproduction and therefore are not stocked on a regular basis.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 6, 2015 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Fulda Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 2004 to 65.0 per gill net in 1996, and averaging 18.5 per gill net since 1984.  Post reclamation, Walleye were captured at rates of 18.0 per gill net in 2011 and 1.0 per gill net in 2015, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  The trap net catch rate in 2015 was 1.8 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.3 to 2.0 per trap net).  Walleye were 13.3 to 23.0 inches long and averaged 19.9 inches, with 82 percent of Walleye being larger than 19.0 inches.  Despite the lower than desired Walleye catch rate, the intensive stocking regime has been maintained.  It is likely that abundance of the Walleye population was underestimated by gill nets because aquatic vegetation was extremely dense in Fulda Lakes during the summer of 2015.  Gill nets do not fish as effectively when vegetation is dense because vegetation caught in the net makes the net more visible and/or the fish may not have to move around as much to find prey.  Additionally, it is possible that some of the fingerlings leave the lake by going over the dam and downstream to West and East Graham Lakes.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass in Fulda Lakes are thriving in abundance primarily because of the great habitat in the lakes.  Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 81.3 per hour in 2015, down from the 2011 catch rate of 121.0 per hour, but higher than catch rates considered to be \"good\" at 20-30 per hour.  Sizes of Largemouth Bass were small as lengths ranged from 2.8 to 17.5 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Largemouth Bass were plump indicating that they are foraging successfully.  Multiple year classes of Largemouth Bass are present in Fulda Lakes, typical of a stable population.  The aggressive nature of Largemouth Bass should make them easy to catch in the Fulda Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 7.0 per gill net and 2.8 per trap net, both of which are well above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net; 0.1 to 0.9 per trap net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 11.8 to 31.0 inches and averaged 24.4 inches.  Northern Pike were plump, indicating that food is available for them.  With an average length of 24.4 inches, the opportunity to catch good numbers of nice sized pike in the Fulda Lakes is present.  Both summer and winter angling and spearing reports from Fulda also confirm their success. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Bluegill have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1996 to 21.8 per trap net in 2011, and have averaged 5.3 per trap net since 1984.  Bluegill were scarce in Fulda Lakes prior to the reclamation; however, post-reclamation, Bluegill have been more abundant at 21.8 and 16.7 per trap net in 2011 and 2015, respectively.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net).  Size of Bluegill was small as lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.3 inches and averaged 4.9 inches.  Bluegill angling was excellent in the couple of years following the reclamation. Many of the large Bluegill observed in the 2011 survey were likely harvested, which accounts for the lack of large Bluegill in the 2015 survey. Bluegill should attain a larger size with an additional year or two of growth and be available for anglers to harvest.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate increased from 0.2 per trap net in 2011 to 2.1 per trap net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Size structure of Black Crappies was small as lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.8 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  Crappie recruitment tends to be cyclic, where a strong year class is produced every 3 to 5 years, resulting in highly variable catch rates like those observed on Fulda Lakes. Additionally, both bluegill and yellow perch are thriving and likely occupying a similar niche.  As a result of that, the Black Crappie population will likely continue at a low density.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in Fulda Lakes have been highly variable, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 1989 and 2004 to 114.5 per gill net in 1984, and averaging 35.5 per gill net since 1984.  The 2015 catch rate of 46.0 per gill net was similar to the 2011 catch rate of 42.0 per gill net, both of which exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were small as lengths ranged from 5.7 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches with the majority of them (96 percent) being less than 7.0 inches in length.  Yellow Perch naturally reproduce in Fulda Lakes, as it appears there are at least four year classes present in the population.  With an additional year or two of growth, Yellow Perch should attain a size that is acceptable to anglers to harvest.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nIn the last decade, Common Carp abundance has steadily decreased from 11.0 per gill net in 2004 to 7.0 per gill net in 2011 to 2.0 per gill net in 2015, which is low when compared to similar lakes in the area.  Common Carp lengths were 15.2 to 25.4 inches long and averaged 18.3 inches.  The reclamation, an electric barrier downstream of the lakes, and the intensive predator stocking program are likely helping keep Common Carp numbers in check in Fulda Lakes; however, overtime they will likely establish a self-sustaining population.  If water quality and habitat continues to be excellent in Fulda, along with a robust Bluegill population abundance, and limited stressors during winter (winterkill), it is hopeful their population will remain low.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance remained low in the post reclamation era, as they were captured at a rate of 2.9 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Black Bullhead were 6.0 to 9.2 inches long and averaged 7.7 inches.  The Black Bullhead population is also likely being suppressed by populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fulda Lake is a 179-acre aerated lake with a maximum depth of 6.5 feet.  In spite of being aerated, Fulda has historically had a fish community that was more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen such as yellow perch, black bullheads, and crappies.  In 1990-91 Fulda experienced a severe winterkill caused in part by extremely high phosphorus levels from within the sediment.  During the winter of 2000-2001 Fulda Lake experienced another significant winterkill that eliminated most game fish.  Due to the morphometry of the lake and the connection to the Heron Lake Watershed, spring movement of fish species, such as common carp, bigmouth buffalo, white suckers, and black bullheads, is not uncommon and complicates fisheries management.  Following the winterkill of 2000-2001, common carp and white suckers likely repopulated Fulda from the connection to the Graham lakes.  Fulda is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for channel catfish and black crappie.  Currently the management plan calls for stocking walleye fingerlings 2 out 3 years at one pound per littoral acre.  A population assessment was conducted the week of June 14, 2004 using 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.Walleyes sampled in 2004 were rather low in abundance and of small size.  Total lengths in trap nets ranged from 7.4 to 13.4 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  Most of the fish sampled were in relatively poor condition.  All of the fish sampled corresponded to DNR stockings, which indicated natural reproduction is limited.  It is likely that the winterkill of 2000-2001 established a fish community that will be challenging and time consuming to change.  Despite the fact that not many walleye were sampled, it is hopeful that stockings sustains a fishery and that better days are ahead. The most abundant gamefish in Fulda Lake is black crappie.  Total lengths ranged from 4.4 to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Although average numbers of black crappie were sampled, the fish are small but in good condition.  Because a winterkill check in the spring of 2001 failed to sample any black crappie, adults were re-introduced in 2001, 2002, and 2004 in an effort to establish a naturally reproducing population.  It appears that the broodstock are naturally reproducing and will likely start to turn the fish community in a positive direction.No channel catfish were sampled in the 2004 survey.  Channel catfish yearlings were re-introduced in the fall of 2002 as a top-level predator on black bullheads.  Typically, channel catfish grow quite slowly in our shallow pothole prairie lakes and would not have been sampled by the 2004 survey.Unfortunately black bullhead and common carp were the most numerous fish species sampled in gill nets and trap nets during the 2004 survey.  Most of the carp sampled were from 12 to 17 inch range and likely the first year class produced following the winterkill of 2000-2001.  A total of twelve species of fish were sampled, including bluegill, green sunfish, hybrid sufish, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Fulda through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First Fulda Lake is a 179 acre lake located in Murray County.  This class 43 lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for channel catfish, black crappie, and yellow perch.  First Fulda has a maximum depth of 6.5 feet.  The lake morphometry contributes to the history of low dissolved oxygen in winter months and liberalized fishing.  In 1990-1991, First Fulda experienced a severe winterkill caused in part by extremely high phosphorus levels from internal loading as determined by the MN PCA.  The operational plan calls for stocking walleye two out of three years.  Walleye fry will be stocked in the spring of 2002.  Channel catfish fingerlings are to be stocked at 50 fish/littoral acre every third year.     Gill nets are typically used to assess walleye and yellow perch relative abundance and size structure.  The average walleye catch rate was 3.33 fish/gill net in 2000, 65.00 fish/gill net in 1996, 52.50 fish/gill net in 1992, 4.50 fish/gill net in 1989, and 3.00 fish/gill net in 1984.  The catch rate of walleyes in gill nets was slightly higher than the lower average range (2.28 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of walleyes captured in gill nets ranged from 13.03 to 27.95 inches with a mean of 20.37 inches.  Half the fish captured in gill nets in 2000 were from the 1997 fingerling stocking.  Four walleyes captured in 2000 were aged to the 1990 fingerling stocking.  Walleye fishing has probably been better in previous years but nice sized fish can be caught.       The average yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 1.33 fish/gill net in 2000, 80.00 fish/gill net in 1996, 0.50 fish/gill net in 1992, 0 fish/gill net in 1989, and 114.50 fish/gill net in 1984.  The catch rate for yellow perch in gill nets was half the lower average range (2.65 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Yellow perch relative abundances tend to cycle approximately every three years which means the yellow perch density is likely on the rebound.  Perch numbers have historically been better, so anglers may want to focus their effort on the crappie population.      The average catch rate of channel catfish in trap nets was 2.56 fish/trap net in 2000 while 0 fish/trap net were captured in all previous surveys.  Total lengths of channel catfish captured in trap nets ranged from 9.76 to 26.65 inches with a mean of 20.18 inches.  There are some nice \"cats\" that could be caught during those \"dog days of summer\".     Trap nets are typically used to assess black crappie relative abundance and size structure.  The average black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 239.67 fish/trap net in 2000, 10.22 fish/trap net in 1996, 0.13 fish/trap net in 1992, 32.80 fish/trap net in 1989, and 54.29 fish/trap net in 1984.  The catch rate for black crappie in trap nets was more than 11 times greater than the upper average range (20.50 fish/trap net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of black crappie captured in trap nets ranged from 6.22 to 11.61 inches with a mean of 6.89 inches.  Most of the fish (96%) were from the 1998 year class.  The number of black crappies is phenomenal, however the size of fish is likely to improve in the next couple of years.     Both gill nets and trap nets can be used to assess black bullhead relative abundance and size structure.  The average black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 103.67 fish/gill net in 2000, 31.00 fish/gill net in 1996, 22.00 fish/gill net in 1992, 322.50 fish/gill net in 1989, 0 fish/gill net in 1984.  The catch rate was near the upper average range (150.62 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Additionally, the average black bullhead catch rates in trap nets was 521.56 fish/trap net in 2000, 116.11 fish/trap net in 1996, 431.25 fish/trap net in 1992, 89.20 fish/trap net in 1989, and 14.50 fish/trap net in 1984.  Both gears indicate a high density population that is dominated by smaller individuals.  This population provides a good opportunity to teach kids how to fish because of the fast action this population will create.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Fulda through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First and Second Fulda Lakes, 179 and 60-acres, are class 43 lakes located in Murray County surrounded by the City of Fulda.  A channel between the two basins maintains a connection throughout the year; therefore, they are managed as one system.  After several winters of severe winterkill, rough fish such as Common Carp and Black Bullhead were highly abundant in the lakes resulting in poor water quality and limited angling opportunities.  As a result, a reclamation using rotenone was done in 2008 (following a partial draw down in 2007), in cooperation with the Fulda community, to \"restart\" the lakes. Over time, Common Carp and Black Bullhead got back into the system, but the abundant predator populations had kept them in check, resulting in clear water and dense vegetation in most years.  During the winter of 2022-2023, dissolved oxygen levels in Fulda Lakes were below 0.7 parts per million for most of the winter, despite operating an aeration system.  Several calls were received reporting a foul odor emanating from the aeration hole, and the presence of dead fish in the aeration hole, both an indication that a winterkill was occurring.  Fulda Lakes are managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  A winterkill check was done in the spring of 2023 using electrofishing, gill netting, and trap netting to determine the extent of the kill at Fulda Lake. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was conducted on April 24, 2023 on Fulda Lake, with no fish being sampled or observed during 10 minutes of on-time.  A gill net and a trap net were deployed on May 4, 2023 because electrofishing did not sample fish.  The gill net did not catch any fish and the trap net caught 102 Yellow Perch, which were likely from a Perch stocking (n=875) that was done on April 18, 2023.  Fulda Lakes likely suffered a nearly total winterkill.  Following the winterkill, Yellow Perch, Walleye fry and fingerlings, Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike were restocked to restore the fish community in Fulda Lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fulda Lake covers 187 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  The shoal water areas are dominated by sand.   As with most lakes in our area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  The north side of the lake is within Fulda city limits and surrounded primarily by residential areas.  The remaining portion of the lake is surrounded by developed and undeveloped woodland areas.  The majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  The lake suffered a severe winter fish kill event in 1990-91.  Currently, Fulda Lake is primarily managed for walleye while providing secondary populations of black crappie and channel catfish.Walleye numbers are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye collected in gillnets ranged in length from 10 ? to 23 inches with an average length of approximately 16 ? inches.  Good numbers of quality sized fish (greater than 15 inches) should provide anglers with good fishing opportunities.  The walleye population appears to be supported through stocking efforts.  Walleye were stocked in 1991, 1993, 1994, and 1996.The black crappie population appeared to have recovered naturally from the 1990-91 winter fish kill event as crappie were not officially stocked.  Presently, black crappie number are considered normal compared to other lakes in our area.  Black crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from 4 to almost 11 ? inches with an average length of approximately 8 inches.The population is comprised mainly of fish in the 7 to 9 inch range.  Data suggest the black crappie population is healthy and self-supporting.   Adult channel catfish were stocked in 1992 and supplementally stocked with fingerlings in 1995 to establish a catfish fishery in Fulda Lake.  Channel catfish were not observed during the 1996 survey.  Future assessments are necessary to fully evaluate channel catfish stocking efforts.Yellow perch also appeared to have recovered naturally from the 1990-91 winter fish kill event.  Perch numbers are presently considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow perch sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 5 ? to almost 9 inches with an average length of approximately 7 inches.  Although the population is dominated by small fish, with adequate time, the perch population should provide anglers with good numbers of quality sized fish (greater than 8 inches).  Data suggest the yellow perch population is healthy and self-supporting.  Black bullhead numbers are considered normal.  Black bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 4 to more than 11 inches with an average length of 8 inches.Carp and bigmouth buffalo numbers are considered low to normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Commercial fishermen removed 6,000 pounds of carp and 5,600 pounds of bigmouth buffalo in 1994-95.Other species observed during the 1996 survey include northern pike, yellow bullhead, white sucker, orangespotted sunfish, green sunfish, fathead minnow, and johnny darter.Overall, a quality fishery exists in Fulda Lake, and barring future winter fish kill events, should provide  anglers with good fishing opportunities in subsequent years.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fulda Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>First and Second Fulda Lakes, 179 and 60 acres respectively, are located in Murray county within the city of Fulda.  A substantial connection exists between the two lakes and from a fisheries standpoint they can be viewed as one Lake.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 17 and indicates a fairly large connection between the watershed and the lake.  Historically the Fulda Lakes have been managed for walleye, yellow perch, black crappie, and channel catfish.  Due to poor water quality and high levels of non-managed species (black bullhead and common carp) along with several years of winterkills, the community along with the MN DNR partnered to reclaim the lake with a water level draw-down and rotenone treatment in 2007 and 2008.  The following year, the lake was restocked with bluegill, largemouth bass, and walleye.  In 2010, the lake was stocked with black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The lake is currently managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for largemouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike to provide for a diverse fish community.  Following lake reclamation and restocking, vast amounts of snow coupled with large scale rain events in the fall, winter, and spring of 2010 and 2011 led to failure of an electric barrier downstream of the dam.  A lack of drop over the dam due to high water and failure of the barrier allowed black bullhead and common carp an opportunity to reenter the lake, and for some managed species to be flushed out of the lake.  A vegetation survey, fish population assessment (gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing for largemouth bass), and nearshore fish community sampling (IBI sampling) took place during the spring and summer of 2011 to assess the habitat quality and fish community. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe vegetation survey conducted in August 2011 revealed 8 species of aquatic plants growing to a maximum depth of 6 feet and floating filamentous algae mats.  The terrestrial species were jewelweed, reed canary grass, and swamp milkweed; the emergent species was cattail and the submergent species found were coontail (common hornwort), flat-stem pondweed, northern milfoil, and sago pondweed.  Overall, the aquatic plant community appears to be robust and establishing very good habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch, and walleye.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe management plan for Fulda Lake calls for maintenance of a walleye population at or above 12.0 fish per net with a balanced size structure.  The 2011 catch rate was 18.0 fish per net exceeding the management plan and was also within the normal range (2.3 to 18.1 fish per net) for Fulda Lake.  The trap net catch rate was 3.7 per net which was above the normal range of 0.5 to 3.0 fish per net.  The mean length of the walleye in the gill net and trap nets was 10.8 inches and 10.6 inches respectively with a range from 6.9 to 12.2 inches.  Overall, it appears that the walleye population is primed to do well in Fulda Lake, an additional stocking of fingerling walleye in 2011 will help to sustain the population at management levels.  Fulda Lake should be considered as a destination for walleye fishing, many keeper size fish will be available in the next several years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were originally stocked in Fulda Lake in 2001, then after the reclamation in 2008 the lake was restocked with 50 adult largemouth bass in 2009.  In June of 2011 spring electrofishing resulted in an excellent catch of 121 largemouth bass per hour of electrofishing, a good catch rate is considered to be above 20 to 30 fish per hour.  The average length of largemouth bass in the sample was 8.8 inches with a range from 5.4 to 18.0 inches.  Overall, as the largemouth bass population matures in Fulda Lake it appears it will maintain a balanced population characterized by a wide range of sizes as evident from the natural reproduction and good growth that is occurring within the population.  An excellent opportunity exists in Fulda Lake for largemouth bass anglers.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill gill net and trap net catch rates in 2011 were 15.0 fish per gill net and 21.8 fish per trap net.  The current catch rate of 21.8 fish per trap net is above the normal range of 1.2 to 20.0 fish per net.  The average length of bluegill in the trap nets was 6.7 inches with fish ranging in length from 5.6 to 10.0 inches.  Overall, the bluegill population is at high population abundance levels and is characterized by larger fish with excellent body condition.  Fishing for bluegill should be very successful in Fulda Lake over the next 2 to 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net and trap net catch rates in 2011 were 42.0 fish per gill net and 0.2 fish per trap net.    The gill net catch rate of 42.0 fish per net was greater than the normal range of 2.7 to 25.0 fish per gill net.  The yellow perch in the gill net sample had an average length of 7.8 inches with fish ranging from 5.5 to 10.4 inches.  Overall, it appears that the yellow perch population is at a relatively high population level with a balanced size structure and good body condition.  Fishing for yellow perch is improving in Fulda Lake and the opportunity to catch good numbers of fish is becoming a reality.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, only 2 black crappie were caught in the trap nets (0.2 fish per net) and no northern pike were caught in trap nets or gill nets.  Black crappie and northern pike were stocked in 2010 as adults so their population is just starting and their abundance may be low.  Additionally, spring and fall flood events in 2010 may have flushed black crappie and northern pike from Fulda Lake. Northern pike adult were stocked again in the fall of 2011 to boost the population.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe common carp gill net and trap net catch rates in 2011 were 7.0 and 1.0 fish per net respectively.  Both catch rates were within the normal ranges for gill nets (1.0 to 13.8 per net) and trap nets (1.0 to 5.5 fish per net).  The average length of common carp in the gill nets and trap nets was 9.5 and 12.2 inches respectively and they ranged in length from 8.1 to 13.7 inches.  The population is currently dominated by one age group.  Common carp most likely entered Fulda Lake as pre-spawn adults breaching the dam during high water in 2010.  The establishment of healthy walleye, largemouth bass and bluegill populations should keep common carp expansion in check, but over the long-term common carp may establish a self sustaining population.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled with gill nets and trap nets were black bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  These species were not stocked in Fulda Lake and are most likely residents as a result of the high water in 2010.  As with common carp, these species may be kept in check for a while as a result of walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill abundance but overtime they may produce natural reproducing populations in Fulda Lake.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSpecies sampled in the nearshore IBI sampling were bluegill, fathead minnow, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, walleye, and yellow perch.  The fathead minnow is the only species sampled in IBI sampling that was not sampled with gill nets and trap nets.  The yellow perch in the IBI sample were age 0 indicating natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFulda Lake is currently characterized by a simple fish but diverse community with 12 species present.  The presence of undesired species (common carp and black bullhead) indicates how connected rivers and lakes can be.  The barriers at Fulda Lake (dam and electric) should not have be seen as completely effective at stopping all fish all the time, rather they are intermittent barriers that slow the expansion of undesired fish.  Continued improvement of the watershed landuse practices to include best management strategies for field drainage and erosion should help to increase the water quality, in-lake habitat, and fish community as a result.  If poor water quality and haphazard landuse practices are allowed to continue in the watershed, it is almost certain that Fulda Lake will return to what is was before the reclamation. <br> \n   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",
