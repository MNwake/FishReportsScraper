                "narrative": "<p>Ham Lake is located five miles southeast of Nevis in Hubbard County. It is 178 acres in size with a maximum depth of 22 feet and mean depth of 7 feet.  Nearly 100% of the lake is littoral (less that 15 feet deep). Although there is township-owned property along the north end of the lake the site is not suitable for boat launching. Minnesota lakes are grouped into 43 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Ham Lake is in Lake Class 39. Other area lakes in this class include Minnie, Paine, Peysenske, Hennepin, Shallow, Upper Twin, and Stocking (by Menahga). Ham Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass with northern pike, black crappie and bluegill as secondary species.  Ham Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population. Normally bass tend to avoid gill and trap nets, but numbers of bass sampled by both gears were above average for this lake class. Largemouth bass in trap nets were mostly nine inches or less, while gill nets sampled bass up to 14 inches.  Northern pike abundance was average for this lake type. Sampled northerns averaged 20.6 inches long. Gill nets sampled good numbers of northerns in the 20-28 inch range, but larger northerns were not seen. Yellow perch and white sucker, present in low numbers, provide the main prey for northerns. Black crappie abundance was good in the 2000 survey, with a size range up to 11.2 inches. Ages of crappie were 2-7 years and indicated fairly consistent reproduction and recruitment.  Bluegill trap net catch rates were higher than average for this type of lake. Largest numbers of bluegills were in the 5 ?-6 inch range; there were no bluegills larger than 7.8 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish were slightly larger, with good numbers of 7 inch fish and lengths up to 8.5 inches. Other species sampled in 2000 include brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and rock bass.</p>",

There is no developed public access on Ham Lake.  Ham Lake provides fishing opportunities for largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ham Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include; Minnie, Paine, Peysenske, Hennepin, Shallow, Upper Twin, and Stocking (near Menahga). <br> \n <br> \nHam Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Anglers will find good numbers of largemouth bass in the 12-14 inch size range.  Largemouth bass exhibited very slow growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  Panfish are abundant in Ham with good numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  While bluegill are abundant, size tends to run small, with most bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Panfish growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find that Ham has a low northern pike population composed of large-sized fish.  Northern pike abundance (3.7 pike/gillnet) was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but higher than past surveys.  Northern pike growth rates were very fast when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker, and low numbers of yellow perch, brown bullhead, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

There is no public access on Ham.  Ham provides fishing opportunities for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Class 39 lakes have the characteristics of being shallow lakes, with a very high littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet deep), and a regular shaped shoreline.  Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Minnie, Paine, Peysenske, Hennepin, and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nHam supports abundant Largemouth Bass and Bluegill populations.  Anglers will find good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the 12-14 inch size range and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Black Crappie were sampled in low numbers, down from past surveys.  Previous surveys have shown the Black Crappie population to fluctuate at moderate numbers for this lake class.  Anglers will find that Ham has a low Northern Pike population composed of larger-sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 26.5 to 32.3 inches.  Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers with fish measured up to 11.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of White Sucker and Rock Bass, and low numbers of Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
