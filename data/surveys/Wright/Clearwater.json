The current average size is significantly above local averages, although all age classes are represented and growth rates are normal. Local reports and tournament results indicate an excellent Largemouth Bass population. Largemouth Bass exhibit a somewhat better than average growth rate. Bluegill net catches (19.5/ trap net) are nearly double the 1980 catch, while the reverse is true for Black Crappie (3.4/trap net). Both are currently slightly below the local average. Yellow Perch sustained a massive decline between the 1974 netting and the 1980 netting (153.9 to 3.6/gill net) and currently remain below the local average (3.6/gill net). Walleye also suffered a major decline between 1974 and 1980 (9.0 to 2.9/gill net). They currently remain at low level, though slightly above the local average (2.4/gillnet). A gap exists between young and old Walleye in the age distribution (ages 4, 5, and 9 are poorly represented), typifying a decline in natural reproduction followed by recent stocking. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye all exhibit normal growth rates. A decline in net catches of Black Bullhead since 1980 (2.2/trap net to 0.5/trap net) has been offset by an increase in Yellow Bullhead (1.1/trap net to 5.6/trap net). Rough fish populations in general are not excessive. One Tullibee was netted during the current survey.</p>",

Prior to this, the Walleye population was sustained through fingerling stocking. Fry stocking has been augmented with surplus fry in three of the last four years. Fall electrofishing results have mostly been poor, exceeding the target catch rate of 25 Young of the Year (YOY) Walleye per hour in only three surveys since 1998. Catches have ranged from 3.6 (2017) to 120 (2008) per hour with an average catch of 29 per hour. However, electrofishing stations were standardized and expanded in 2014 and results since then may have been lower than if only the original stations were used. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY catch rate in 2018 was 5.2/hr (on time), similar to 2017 results (3.6/hr). Lengths ranged from 6.8 to 8.2 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches. The catch of age one and older Walleye was 4.2/hr and lengths ranged from 12.1 to 24.5 inches. The most recent summer lake survey (2014) had a Walleye catch of 2.8 per gill net, below the expected range of values for lakes similar to Clearwater and below the management goal of 5 7/gill net. A summer survey is planned for 2019. <br> \n <br> \nIf electrofishing catches and gillnetting results continue to be poor, fingerlings may need to be stocked again. This would be difficult and expensive, but could be necessary to reach management goals. Some natural reproduction of Walleye has been documented as ages corresponding to non stocked years have been seen in gill net catches. It would be helpful to conduct electrofishing in non stocked years to see the extent of natural reproduction. Zebra mussels were found in the lake in 2016 and increased water clarity was noted by staff in 2017 and 2018. The impact of zebra mussels on future fry survival is unknown, but likely negative. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye is a primary managed species in Clearwater Lake, but the management goal of > 4/gill net has not been met in the last two surveys (2019 and 2022). The population has been sustained through biennial fry stocking since 1998 but fall electrofishing results have exceeded the target catch rate of 25 young-of-year (YOY)/hour only three times since then. Fry were stocked annually from 2014 to 2019 with mostly poor results. In 2014 electrofishing stations were standardized with sites being added so results since then may have been lower than if only the original stations were used. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted on October 19, 2022, to evaluate natural reproduction in Clearwater Lake. The YOY catch rate was 3.4/ hour. Only six YOY Walleye were collected and ranged in length from 6.5 to 8.1 inches. The catch rate of age-1 and older Walleye was 5.0/hour and lengths of those fish ranged from 15.0 to 26.5 inches. The most recent lake survey (2022) had a Walleye catch rate of 2.7/gill net, again below the goal of > 4/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nBecause of consistently poor fry survival,  1,579 lbs. of fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2022 to supplement the population. Fingerling stocking is expensive, time consuming, and subject to availability, so biennial fry stocking will continue with supplemental fingerling stocking taking place as needed. Zebra mussels were found in the lake in 2016 and increased water clarity has been observed. Lower Walleye catch rates preceded zebra mussel infestation, so zebra mussels are probably not to blame for lower Walleye abundance. However, their future effect on fry survival is uncertain and may be negative. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 3,158 acre lake located two miles north of the city of Annandale in Wright and Stearns Counties.  The watershed primarily consists of cultivated crops, pasture, and deciduous forest. The lakeshore is highly developed, and is a popular recreation and sport fishery.  There are two public accesses and both are located in the west basin.  Clearwater Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Walleye fry are stocked by the DNR every other year at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre. <br> \nA special assessment for Black Crappie was conducted after hearing concerns from anglers that fishing was not as good as experienced in previous years.  A total of 667 fish were sampled with fish ranging in length from 5 to 14.4 inches. Many age classes were present during the spring assessment (ages 2-13, with the exception of 12), indicating that recruitment is occurring in most years. The mean length at age-4 was 10.3 inches. Clearwater Lake has a healthy population of black crappies in terms of their size and age structures.  Fish of a variety of sizes were seen; furthermore, fish were reaching sizes that are considered preferable to anglers.   <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled via nighttime electrofishing.  A total of 149 fish were sampled in approximately three hours and twenty minutes for a catch rate of 44.9 fish/hour.  Largemouth Bass varied in size from 7.2 to 20.4 inches, averaged 12.9 inches, and had 30% of the fish measured over 15 inches in length. The length distribution and average length was similar to the results in 2005. The 2014 catch rate of Largemouth Bass is near the Montrose Area Lakes average catch of 52 fish/hour.  Largemouth Bass are a popular targeted species in Clearwater Lake, and rightfully so considering the large size distribution and moderate abundance. <br> \nThe catch rate for Walleye deceased from 2005 and was below the 1980-2014 average. Walleye ranged in length from 7.7 to 28.0 inches and averaged 18.1 inches and 2.2 pounds. Eight different year classes of Walleye were present, with the 2010 year class making up 47% of the fish sampled. The 2008 year class represented 21% of the sampled Walleye. Although the catch rate was low, the Walleye population is still considered to be relatively healthy.  It has a variety of age classes, large size distribution, and average size that many anglers would agree to be of preferred size. <br> \nNorthern Pike started increasing in abundance in the mid-1980s and have been in high abundance when compared to similar lakes. The 2014 catch rate was similar to previous three surveys. Length of Northern Pike ranged from 13.7 to 34.6 inches with the average fish being 21.9 inches and 2.2 pounds. Three percent of the fish sampled were over 30 inches in length. Northern Pike on Clearwater Lake is one species that can likely withstand a higher rate of harvest, especially on Northern Pike less than 24 inches in length.  <br> \nBluegill varied in length from 3.0 to 8.9 inches in length with an average size of 5.5 inches and 0.2 pounds. The number of Bluegills decreased from the previous survey, and was below the average expected value for Clearwater Lake. However, length ranges were similar to previous surveys. In addition to Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed include all three species of Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. Bowfin and Common Carp are not sampled well in lake surveys due to the gear being used are not selective for these species and these species are not targeted during ideal times and conditions.  During night Largemouth Bass Electrofishing numerous Bowfin and Common Carp were seen. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 3,158-acre lake located two miles north of the City of Annandale on the border of Wright and Stearns County. The watershed is large (>100,000 acres) and land use is primarily agriculture with some forest. Clearwater is the largest lake in the Sauk Rapids management area and a popular destination for bass fishing  and other recreation. The lake is divided into an east and west basin. There are two public accesses on the west basin and a private fee access located on the east basin. A targeted gill net survey was conducted in 2022 as part of the ongoing statewide Walleye/zebra mussel study as well as to update data last surveyed in 2019. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating-leaf vegetation was abundant, particularly in the west basin. Primary species were bulrush, cattail, and white waterlily. Submerged vegetation was also abundant, but not surveyed. Water clarity was good; average summer Secchi depths for both basins 6.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 36 feet in the east basin, but only 22 feet in the west basin. Invasive species present include Eurasian Watermilfoil (since 1989) and Zebra Mussels (since 2015). All boaters should take extra care not to spread these species to other water bodies. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye fishery is sustained through fry stocking with additional supplemental stocking (fry, fingerling, and other life stages) during years with poor fry survival. Walleye numbers in 2022 were below the expected range of values for lakes like Clearwater but higher than 2019, which was the lowest on record. Lengths ranged from 9 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and 3 pounds. Thirty-four percent of Walleye were 20 inches or longer. Six year classes were represented and Walleye grew to 15 inches in three years. A few Walleyes were from non-stocked years and indicate a low level of natural recruitment. Walleye catches have declined since 1997 although it is unclear why Walleye abundance has been declining. However, abundant Northern Pike prey on young Walleye and fry survival appears to be poor as well. Zebra mussels are not likely to blame because the decline began well before they were established in the lake. Fry stocking will continue with supplemental fry and fingerling stocking as needed. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were down significantly from 2019 and below the historical average. The decrease marks the first time since 1985, where the pike catch was within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Clearwater. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 15 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.5 pounds. Seventeen percent of pike were 26 inches or longer and 3% were 30 inches or longer. New Northern Pike regulations began in 2018, allowing more harvest of small pike in central Minnesota. It is hoped that this will result in lower pike abundance and better size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass electrofishing was not completed in 2022, however the catch rate in 2019 of 42.2/hour was below the Sauk Rapids area average of 74/hr, but similar to 2014 results (44.9/hr). Bass lengths in 2019 ranged from 6 to 20 inches with an average length of 12.8 inches. Thirty-four percent of Largemouth Bass were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBased on summer surveys, Black Crappie abundance has been declining since 1980; however, recent spring targeted surveys shows just the opposite. The Black Crappie catch in 2022 (1.7/ gill net) was higher than 2019 (0.9/gill net) and above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Clearwater. In addition to the summer gill netting, a targeted panfish survey was conducted in May 2022 to better assess the size structure of the Black Crappie population. A total of 726 crappie were sampled with lengths ranging from 5 to 14 inches with an average length of 10 inches. Ninety-four percent of the crappie sampled were eight inches or longer and 57% were 10 inches or longer. Spring nets showed a diversity of sizes and ages and much higher numbers than seen during standard summer surveys. The Black Crappie population in Clearwater Lake appears healthy based on these results. The targeted spring panfish survey also provided a better look at the size structure of the Bluegill population. A total of 1,404 Bluegill were sampled in the spring and ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches with a mean length of six inches. Six percent of Bluegill sampled were eight inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Yellow Perch were captured during the survey. Perch numbers have always been low , but catch rates dropped noticeably in the 1990s. Northern Pike numbers also increased during the 1990s, possibly contributing to the decline of Yellow Perch. However, small perch have been commonly seen during fall Walleye electrofishing. Fall night electrofishing and small mesh gill nets were used in 2019 as part of a research project to evaluate Yellow Perch populations among lakes statewide. Preliminary results show relatively high numbers of small perch in Clearwater Lake, mostly too small to catch in standard gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.</p>",

Surplus fry were available in 2015 and Clearwater Lake was stocked with the standard total of 1,500,000 fry. The next fry stocking is scheduled for the spring of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe fall young of the year (YOY) catch rate in 2015 was 19.3/hr (on time), similar to the 2014 catch (24.1/hr). Past catches have ranged from 5.3 to 120/hr. The catch of older Walleye was 12.9/hr and appears to consist mainly of fish from the 2014 fry stocking. From 1998 to 2012, seven fall nighttime electrofishing evaluations were conducted, of which three were considered successful (>25/hr; 2002, 2006, and 2008). Electrofishing stations were standardized and expanded in 2014 and results from 2014 and 2015 may be lower than if only the previous stations had been sampled. Walleye ages corresponding to non stocked years have been seen frequently in gill net catches, indicating that some natural reproduction appears to be taking place. Sampling should be conducted in non stocked years as time permits to evaluate the extent of any natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches from summer lake surveys have only met the management goal of 5 7/gill net in 2005. The most recent catch in 2010 (2.8/gill net) was below the expected range of values for Lake Class 24. Clearwater Lake will be surveyed more often in the future. If gill net catches remain low, the stocking plan may need to be changed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike numbers increased significantly in the east basin while remaining stable in the west basin since the last survey.  Catch rates were high (12.1/gill net east, 5.7/gill net west) due to a strong 1986 year class and average size was large. Reproduction has occurred yearly, as indicated by the presence of age 1-7 Northern Pike.  Growth rates were average.  Walleye numbers were average.  Walleye showed a significant increase in the east basin but remained stable in the west.  Average size of Walleye was large in the west basin but small in the east basin.  Different age structures in the catches between the two basins could account for the size difference.  Ages 2-8 and 11 were present. Growth rates were average, although age and growth data were affected by the stocking of different age Walleye (fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked.)  \n\nPanfish species sampled in trap nets included Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Catch rates were average to high for most panfish with the exception of Rock Bass, which was low.  Sizes were generally average.  Black Crappie had high numbers and small average size in both basins.  Yellow Perch numbers remained low throughout the lake, and average size was small.  The most common length group was 5.5-6.4 inches.  Common Carp catch rates were average for this lake class and White Sucker numbers were low.  Catch rates were low for Black Bullhead, high for Yellow Bullhead, and average for Brown Bullhead. Cisco were sampled in this lake and other lakes in the Clearwater Chain, although habitat appears to be marginal.  Anglers report that Largemouth Bass are abundant.  Seven age classes were represented in the tournament caught sample.  Reproduction appears excellent and growth was generally average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is 3,158-acre lake located two miles north of the City of Annandale along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties. The lake has a large watershed with primary land use consisting of cultivated crops, pasture, and deciduous forest. Clearwater Lake is a popular recreational  and fishing destination and is considered one of the better all-around fishing lakes with the Sauk Rapids Fisheries Management Area. There are two public accesses, both located in the west basin. There isa small pay access located on the east side of the lake.  A targeted panfish assessment was conducted on Clearwater Lake from May 9-13, 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nTargeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of panfish abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 726 Black Crappie were sampled with fish ranging in size from three inches up to 14.4 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches. Ninety-four percent of crappie sampled were eight inches or longer and 62% of crappie were ten inches or longer. Previous spring crappie assessments conducted in 2014 and 2015 had similar size distributions and length ranges. No aging structures were taken but given the large size-distribution seen it is safe to assume that multiple year classes are present. The Black Crappie population in Clearwater Lake appears healthy based on these results. <br> \n <br> \nUnlike previous spring trap net assessments, sampling in 2022 included sunfish species including Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. A total of 1,404 Bluegill were sampled in the spring with fish up to 9.5 inches and an average length of 6.3 inches. Sixty four percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six inches and 8% were longer than eight inches. A total of 103 Hybrid Sunfish were sampled with fish up to 9.9 inches and an average length of 7.4 inches. A total of 511 Pumpkinseed were also sampled with fish up to 9.0 inches and an average length of 6.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to 4 years for crappie, and 8 years or more for Bluegill to reach 8 inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger panfish and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill and Black Crappie available. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The population has been sustained through biennial fry stocking since 1998, but fall electrofishing results have exceeded the target catch rate of 25 young-of-year (YOY)/hour only three times since then. Fry have been stocked annually since 2014 with mostly poor results. However, electrofishing stations were standardized and expanded in 2014 and results since then may have been lower than if only the original stations were used. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY catch rate in 2019 was 18.8/hour (on-time), higher than 2018 (5.2/hour) and 2017 (3.6/hour), but below the target catch rate of 25/hour. YOY lengths ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with a mean length of 6.7 inches. The catch rate of age one and older Walleye was 8.4/hour and lengths ranged from 10.7 to 20.3 inches. The 2019 standard survey had a Walleye catch rate of 1.7/gill net, below the goal of > 4/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nFingerlings were stocked in Clearwater Lake in the fall of 2019 following electrofishing. Fingerling stocking is expensive, time consuming, and subject to availability, so biennial fry stocking will continue with supplemental fry and fingerling stocking as needed. Zebra mussels were found in the lake in 2016 and increased water clarity has been observed. Lower Walleye catch rates preceded the zebra mussel infestation, so zebra mussels are probably not to blame for lower Walleye abundance. However, their future effect on fry survival may be negative. <br> \n <br> \nYear\tFry stocked\tYOY/hr <br> \n2004\t1,500,000\t8.8 <br> \n2006\t1,500,000\t74.2 <br> \n2008\t1,500,000\t119.6 <br> \n2010\t1,500,000\t--- <br> \n2012\t1,500,000\t23.4 <br> \n2014\t1,500,000\t24.1 <br> \n2015\t1,500,000\t19.3 <br> \n2016\t2,600,000\t16.3 <br> \n2017\t1,500,000\t3.6 <br> \n2018\t2,050,000\t5.2 <br> \n2019\t1,650,000\t18.8 <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Prior to 1998, fingerlings were stocked every other year.  Fry stocking evaluations have also occurred each corresponding fall with the exception of 2010 when mechanical problems with the electrofishing boat prevented a timely evaluation.  The most recent gill net assessments were done in 2005, and a year round creel survey was completed in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 1998, fall electrofishing evaluations have yielded young of year catch rates as follows: 1998 (14.8/hr), 2000 (5.3/hr), 2002 (31.1/hr), 2004 (8.8/hr), 2006 (74.2/hr), and 2008 (120/hr). <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing on the evening of October 2, 2012 produced a fingerling catch rate of 23.4/hr with a mean length of 7.3 inches.  The catch rate of older walleye (> age 1) was 37.5/hr.  Based on length frequency data, it appears that the 2010 fry stocking was successful as numerous walleye from 10 to 11 inches were sampled as well as a group of walleye from 12 14 inches.  Considering the relative success of walleye fry stocking in Clearwater Lake it will remain the stocking strategy of choice. The next stocking will take place in 2014. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 3,158 acre lake located two miles north of the city of Annandale on the border of Wright and Stearns County. The watershed is large (>100,000 acres) and land use is primarily agriculture with some forest. Clearwater is the largest lake in the Sauk Rapids management area and a popular destination for bass fishing (6 to 8 tournaments annually) and other recreation. The lake is divided between a west and an east basin and there are two public accesses on the west basin. A private fee access is located on the east basin. Maximum depth is 73 feet and the last survey was in 2014. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating-leaf vegetation was abundant, particularly in the west basin. Primary species were bulrush, cattail, and white waterlily. Submerged vegetation was also abundant, but not surveyed. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 7.0 feet in late July for both basins. MPCA data show a ten year summer average Secchi depth of 6.6 feet. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 18 feet in the east basin, but only 10 feet in the west basin. Invasive species include Eurasian Watermilfoil (since 1989) and Zebra Mussels (since 2015). All boaters should take extra care not to spread these species to other water bodies. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye fishery has been sustained by biennual fry stocking with additional fry, fingerling, and other life stages stocked to supplement years with poor fry survival. Walleye numbers in 2019 were below the expected range of values for lakes similar to Clearwater and the lowest on record. Walleye catches have declined since 1997. Lengths ranged from 8.3 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.7 pounds. Seventy-one percent of Walleye were 20 inches or longer. Eleven year classes were represented and Walleye grew to 15 inches in two to three years. A few Walleye were from non-stocked years and indicate a low level of natural recruitment. It is unclear why Walleye abundance has been declining. However, abundant Northern Pike prey on young Walleye and fry survival appears to be poor as well. Zebra Mussels are not likely to blame because the decline began well before they were established in the lake. Biennual fry stocking will continue with supplemental fry and fingerlings stocked as needed. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were similar to 2014 and the historical average, but well above the expected range of values for the lake class. Catches have been trending higher since 1997. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 12.7 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.4 pounds. Nine percent of pike were 26 inches or longer and three percent were 30 inches or longer. New Northern Pike regulations began in 2019, allowing more harvest of small pike in central Minnesota. It is hoped that this will result in lower pike abundance and better size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing on June 5 and June 6. The catch rate of 42.2/hour was below the Sauk Rapids area average of 73.6/hr, but similar to 2014 results (44.9/hr). Bass lengths ranged from 5.5 to 20.4 inches with an average length of 12.8 inches. Thirty-four percent of Largemouth Bass were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher than 2014 and within the expected range of values. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 4.9 inches and one percent of Bluegill were eight inches or longer. A targeted trap net survey was conducted on June 19 and 20 to better assess the size structure of the Bluegill population. Bluegill were somewhat larger than in summer nets; two percent were eight inches or longer, average length was 5.1 inches, and the largest Bluegill was 8.5 inches long. However, a late ice-out and rapidly warming water may have resulted in missing the pre-spawn period when large Bluegill are most vulnerable.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was similar to 2014 and within the expected range of values. Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 11.8 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches. A targeted survey in the spring of 2014 and 2015 was used to better assess the Black Crappie population. Spring trap nets showed a diversity of sizes and ages and much higher numbers than seen during standard summer surveys. The Black Crappie population in Clearwater Lake seems healthy based on these results.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Yellow Perch were captured during the survey. Perch numbers have been below the expected range of values in all previous surveys, but catch rates dropped noticeably in the 1990s. Northern Pike numbers increased during the 1990s, possibly contributing to the decline of Yellow Perch. However, small Yellow Perch have been commonly seen during fall Walleye electrofishing in Clearwater Lake. Fall night electrofishing and small mesh gill nets were used as part of a research project to evaluate Yellow Perch populations among lakes statewide. Preliminary results show relatively high numbers of small perch in Clearwater Lake, mostly too small to catch in standard gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The population has been sustained through biennial fry stocking since 1998 but fall electrofishing results have exceeded the target catch rate of 25 young-of-year (YOY)/hour only three times since then. Fry have been stocked annually since 2014 with mostly poor results. In 2014 electrofishing stations were standardized and expanded and results since then may have been lower than if only the original stations were used. <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY catch rate in 2019 was 18.8/hour (on-time), higher than 2018 (5.2/hour) and 2017 (3.6/hour), but below the target catch rate of 25/hour. YOY lengths ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with a mean length of 6.7 inches. In 2021, only one YOY walleye was sampled and was 8.4 inches long. The catch rate of age-1 and older Walleye was 4.2/hour and lengths ranged from 10.7 to 20.3 inches. The most recent lake survey (2019) had a Walleye catch rate of 1.7/gill net, well below the goal of > 4/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nFingerlings were stocked in Clearwater Lake in the fall of 2019 following electrofishing. Fingerling stocking is expensive, time consuming, and subject to availability, so biennial fry stocking will continue with supplemental fry and fingerling stocking as needed. Zebra mussels were found in the lake in 2016 and increased water clarity has been observed. Lower Walleye catch rates preceded the zebra mussel infestation, so zebra mussels are probably not to blame for lower Walleye abundance. However, their future effect on fry survival may be negative. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 3,158-acre lake located two miles north of the city of Annandale in Wright and Stearns Counties.  The lake is made up of two basins (east and west).  The lakeshore is highly developed, with 80% of the shoreline being taken up by homes or cabins.  There are two public accesses located on the west basin.  In 2005, a lake survey was conducted in order to assess the fish populations in Clearwater Lake.  With its vast emergent vegetation and complicated submerged structure Clearwater will provide a delightful challenge to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass  <br> \nClearwater Lake has a reputation as one of Minnesota's best bass fisheries.  Approximately 10 tournaments are held each year. We sampled largemouth bass with electrofishing and found that the population is large and consists of fish from five to 20 inches or more.   The catch rate of largemouth bass was 73.3 fish/hour, which exceeds the typical catch rate for lakes in the Montrose area.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate was near the upper end of expected values for similar lakes.  Mean length and weight of northern pike sampled was 21.9 inches and 2.4 pounds.  During a creel survey in 2005 mean length and weight of northern pike harvested by anglers was 23.5 inches and 3.0 pounds.  This indicates a selective harvest on the part of the anglers.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small fish in order to improve the size structure. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in 2005 (5.4 fish/net) was lower than observed in 1997 (7.2 fish/net), but was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Mean length and weight of walleye sampled was 16.4 inches and 1.6 pounds, slightly larger than the walleye that anglers harvest, 15.2 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The fishery is characterized by young fish which are the result of successful fry stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate in 2005 (18.1 fish/net) was similar to 1997 (16.7 fish/net) and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 2.8 inches to 7.9 inches.  Sunfish were the most common species taken by anglers during the 2005 creel.  The average size harvested was 7.2 inches, considered good by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are rarely taken with trap nets at Clearwater Lake.  However, it was estimated that more than 8,600 black crappie were harvested by anglers during the summer 2005 creel survey.  Harvested fish ranged in length from 6.0 to 16.0 inches with a mean length of 9.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: black, brown and yellow bullheads, bowfin, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

Prior to 1998, fingerlings were stocked every other year.  Fry stocking evaluations occurred in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006.  Recent gill net assessments were done in 1997 and 2005, and a year-round creel survey was completed in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 1998, fall electrofishing evaluations have yielded young-of-year catch rates as follows: 1998 (14.8/hr), 2000 (5.3/hr), 2002 (31.1/hr), 2004 (8.8/hr), and 2006 (74.2/hr).  <br> \n <br> \nResults from 2008 were the most successful yet.  Electrofishing on the evening of 10/9/08 produced a catch rate of 120/hr with a mean length of 6.6 inches.  This is one of the higher catch rates we have seen for fall walleye electrofishing.  The next stocking will take place in 2010.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Clearwater Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 29, 2019. Twenty-four sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 23 sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 14 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at 2 sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at eight sites. Nearshore sampling captured 27 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
