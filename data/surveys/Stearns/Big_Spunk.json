Walleye abundance wasabove the expected range, while northern pike abundance was between second and third quartilesand yellow perch abundance was between first and second quartiles for lake class 31.The gill net catch rate for northern pike has appeared to increase from 5.30/lift in 1992 to 8.67/liftin 1998.  Length of fish sampled in 1998 ranged from 11.5 to 28.0 inches, with a mean length of19.0 inches.  Northern pike growth was average for Minnesota lakes as fish reached 15.3, 18.33,20.14, 22.6, 25.6 inches by Age II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively.     The gill net catch rate for walleye 6.17/lift was similar to that of  1992 (6.50/lift); however, meanweight per fish decreased from 1.99 to 1.33 lbs.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1993, 1995,and 1997, and the 1998 gill net survey indicated good survival from the 1995 year class.  Walleyegrowth was slightly faster than the statewide average as fish reached 12.3, 14.1, 16.2, and 18.1inches by Age I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has significantly decreased from 40.00/lift in 1992, to3.83/lift in 1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained at 0.08 lbs.  Yellow perch sampledin 1998 ranged in length from 4.5 to 7.0 inches, with a mean length of 6.0 inches.  Growth wasaverage as fish reached 5.17 inches by Age II, 5.88 inches by Age III, and 6.37 inches by Age IV.Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of five major species:bluegill (80.14/set), green sunfish (7.86/set), hybrid sunfish (7.43/set) pumpkinseed sunfish(4.14/set), and yellow bullhead (4.14/set).  Bluegill and green sunfish abundance were above thirdquartile values, pumpkinseed sunfish abundance was slightly below the second quartile value andyellow bullhead abundance was slightly above the second quartile value for lake class 31.The trap net catch rate for bluegill has appeared to decrease from 93.90/set in 1992 to 80.14/setin 1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained similar at 0.13 lbs. Growth was averagewhen compared to other Minnesota lakes as  Age III, IV, V and VI fish reached 4.19, 5.47, 6.72,and 7.24 inches, respectively. The trap net catch rate for green sunfish has appeared to decrease from 23.00/set in 1992 to7.86/set in 1998; however, abundance estimates for both years were above the third quartile forlake class 31.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.5 inches, with a mean length of4.0 inches.  The trap net catch rate for hybrid sunfish remained similar from 7.29/set in 1992 to7.43/set in 1998. Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a mean lengthof 5.8 inches.  The trap net catch rate for pumpkinseed sunfish has appeared to increase from 3.71/set in 1992 to4.14/set in 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a meanlength of 5.3 inches.  The trap net catch rate for yellow bullhead has increased from 0.43/set in1992 to 4.14/set in 1998.  Yellow bullhead sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 6.0 to 13.0inches, with a mean weight per fish of 0.70 lbs.  Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing during spring.  A total of 26 largemouthbass were sampled with a catch rate of 8.43/hour on-time, lower than the area mean of 41.50/houron-time.  Largemouth bass sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.0 to 19.0 inches, with a meanlength of 10.0 inches and a mean weight of 0.64 lbs.  Growth was average as fish reached 7.26,9.80, 12.22, and 13.15 inches by Age II, III, IV, and V, respectively. Largemouth bass PSD was32, and RSD-15 was 15.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Spunk Lake is a 440 acre lake located near of the city of Avon in Stearns County with maximum depth of 38 feet. A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. \n\nNorthern Pike abundance increased to rate of 10.5/gill net which is at the upper limit of the normal range for similar lakes.  Four age classes were sampled and growth rates appeared to be average.  Walleye abundance also increased from the previous survey to above average. Four age classes were sampled with age 2 Walleye being most abundant and growth rates were average. The Yellow Perch catch rate declined tenfold in gill nets since the 1975 survey, but shoreline seining showed that reproduction and abundance were similar.  Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at rate of 33.9/net which is within the range expected for similar lakes.  Black Crappie were sampled at a rate of 5.2/gill net, which is above the expected range for lakes like Big Spunk. \n\nThe rough fish population is at or above average abundance.  Length frequency data showed several years classes present.  Common Carp were sampled in trap nets at a rate greatly exceeding the range typical of similar lakes. One adult Common Carp sampled, while the rest appeared to be mostly yearlings.  \n\nOther species sampled in low numbers included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish) hybrid and Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. \n\nThe number of Northern Pike sampled declined from an abundant 10.5/gill net in 1981 to a more average 7.2/ gill net. This is still above the local median and is similar to the 1975 netting. Seventy-nine percent of the sample was from 1984 and 1985 year classes. The average weight which had appeared steady dropped to 1.9 pounds. \n\nWalleye abundance also declined from 1981 but was similar to the 1975 netting. Ages 3 through 7 were sampled indicating some natural reproduction. Growth of Walleye was good. \n\nLargemouth bass were sampled in the fall by night electrofishing at a rate of 41.2/hour. Fifty-four percent of the 107 fish sampled were young of the year, and an additional 26% were yearlings. Each year class had good growth. In shoreline seine hauls, 31 of 34 bass caught were young of the year fish. \n\nBluegill were abundant and have increased steadily since 1975 and 1981. Seventy-five percent of the catch were five inch fish. All age classes had good growth. Other changes in sunfish populations since the last netting include: a decrease in Pumpkinseed from 9.0/trap net to a scarce 1.4/ trap net and hybrid sunfish from an abundant 7.7/ trap net to a more typical 3.3/trap net. Green Sunfish and Rock Bass were present in low numbers.\n \nThe Black Crappie catch was more than 17 times that of previous survey and indicates an abundance of this species. Crappie have good growth at the ages sampled with the 1984 year class being dominant. \nYellow Perch abundance increased considerably from the 1981 survey but was still average for this area and is less than the 1975 survey. \n\nCisco, which were caught in abundant numbers in 1975, were not sampled in 1981 and were scarce in this netting. The average number of Bowfin (dogfish) and Common Carp caught represent a decline from more abundant numbers in 1981. While trap nets indicate a low numbers of Black Bullheads, gill nets indicate this species to be of average abundance and similar to past surveys. Black Bullhead average 0.5 pounds. Yellow Bullheads have decreased from abundant in 1981 to an average 3.0/ trap net.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big (Upper) Spunk Lake is a 440-acre lake located within a mile of the City of Avon in Stearns County. Big Spunk Lake has a maximum depth of 38 feet and an average summer water clarity of 10 feet. Oxygen levels were adequate for sport fish to a depth of 19 feet during the last week of June. Big Spunk Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community growing in dense beds around the lake out to a depth of 16 feet with Chara and coontail being the most common species. There is one public access on the northwest shore of the lake with parking available for six vehicle/trailer combinations as well as a dock and portable toilet. The Big Spunk Lake watershed is moderate in size and covers about 15,000 acres. Land use practices within the watershed consisted of 29% forest, 25% agriculture, 14% hay/pasture, 14% wetland, 11% open water,6% residential, and 1% grassland. Near shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) sampling and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping were also completed to evaluate the physical habitat of Big Spunk Lake. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation covered approximately 73% of the shoreline with cattail and yellow waterlily being the most common. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2023 to monitor any changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of Northern Pike remained high and was above the normal range of expected values as well as above the long-term average for Big Spunk Lake. Pike ranged from 12 to 33 inches and averaged 21 inches and 1.6 pounds. Only 12% percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the small pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n  <br> \nBig Spunk Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades. The gill net catch of Walleye in 2023 was similar to the 2016 survey and was within the range of what we would expect to see for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 15 to 28 inches and averaged 19 inches and 2.6 pounds. Growth was fast compared to statewide averages, taking four years to reach 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent Largemouth Bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 21 inches. A total of 72 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.6 hours of electrofishing in June 2023. This was just below the average daytime catch rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area. Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass (> 8 inches), 51% were longer than 12 inches and 14% were longer than 15 inches. Although not collected in this survey, Smallmouth Bass are also found in low numbers in Big Spunk Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch decreased in 2023 but remained within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Big Spunk. Bluegill only averaged five inches and fish over eight inches comprised only two percent of the sample. Anglers can expect to catch smaller Bluegill on Big Spunk with an occasional larger one mixed in.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch also decreased from 2016 and fell below the long-term average for the lake. Fish ranged in length from four to ten inches with an average length of seven inches. Black Crappie catches are known to fluctuate widely depending on the success of spawning which is largely dependent on environmental factors. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, 11 Tullibee were sampled in gill nets. While common in Middle Spunk Lake, this marks the first time since 1998 that Tullibee were sampled in Big Spunk, and the most ever sampled in a single survey. Other species sampled in low numbers during this survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nChanges in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake. It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Spunk Lake was conducted on September 5-7, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and steep drop offs. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at four sampling stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Rock Bass, and Pugnose Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead minnow, and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured ten species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass) and one tolerant species (i.e., Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, and Northern Pike comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Big Spunk Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Big Spunk Lake was fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. The recent survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi (Sartell) River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Spunk Lake is a 494-acre recreational development lake located within a mile of the City of Avon in Stearns County.  The aquatic plant community was diverse and vegetation grew to a depth of 16 feet.  Muskgrass was abundant and coontail common, but all other aquatic plant species were rare.  Curled pondweed grew over 5.2 acres, 1.2% of the lakes_ surface.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was available only to 18 feet during early July. Big Spunk Lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades.  This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nSome changes in the fishery have occurred over the last 16 years.  The catch of northern pike has increased significantly since the 1992 survey, whereas the catch of both walleye and yellow perch has decreased significantly.  Northern pike will limit the survival of yellow perch and walleye, which are favorite prey.  The biennial stocking of walleye fingerlings will have to continue in order to provide an opportunity to catch walleye.   At the same time, anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike in order to restore balance to the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass is a primary management species for Big Spunk Lake.  There is an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish in excess of 19 inches.  A total of 103 largemouth bass was captured in 1.2 hours of electrofishing on May 22, 2008.  The catch rate was calculated at 86.6 fish/hour.  This was above the average catch rate for Stearns County lakes and greater than that reported in 1998.  Fifty percent of bass were 12 inches or larger and averaged 1.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of northern pike was above the normal range.  Pike ranged from 12 to 35 inches with an average length of 21 inches and weight of 2.2 pounds.  In 1998, the average length was 19 inches and average weight was 1.6 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of walleye in 2008 was within the normal range for similar lakes, but down significantly from 1998, when it had been above the normal range.  Overall, walleye ranged from 6 to 28 inches with an average length of 20 inches and weight of 3.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were less than that of 1998, but within range of expected values for similar lakes. Overall, bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 7.8 inches with an average length of six inches at six years of age.  This growth rate was the same for bluegill from similar lakes.  Historically, bluegill have been abundant and small. <br> \n <br> \nRelatively few black crappie were sampled during the summer survey.  However, large numbers of crappie were observed during night electrofishing in mid-May, which were approximately eight inches in length.  Growth of black crappie was below that found in similar lakes, and grew six inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in 2008 were bowfin, black and yellow bullhead, banded killifish, bluntnose minnow, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, Iowa and Johnny darter, and white sucker. <br> \n  <br> \nImproving water quality by reducing nutrients entering Big Spunk Lake should be a high priority of both the county and landowners around the lake.  Adding buffer strips on inlets and lakeshore property, maintaining adequate septic systems and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake are ways to limit nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess vegetation growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big (Upper) Spunk Lake is a 440-acre lake located within a mile of the City of Avon in Stearns County. Big Spunk Lake has a maximum depth of 38 feet and an average water clarity of six feet during the summer. Oxygen levels were adequate for sport fish to a depth of 18 feet during the first week of July. Big Spunk Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community growing in dense beds around the lake out to a depth of 16 feet with Chara and coontail being the most common species. There is one public access on the northwest shore of the lake with parking available for six vehicle/trailer combinations as well as a dock and portable toilet. The Big Spunk Lake watershed covers 14,811 acres with a watershed to lake surface ratio of 33.7 to 1. Land use practices within the watershed consisted of: 26% agriculture, 26% forest, 19% hay/pasture, 11% open water, 7% grassland, 6% wetland, and 5% residential. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped and covered approximately 73% of the shoreline with cattail and yellow waterlily being the most common. Near shore Index of Biotic Integrity sampling and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping were also completed to evaluate the physical habitat of Big Spunk Lake. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor any changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2008.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of Northern Pike remained above the normal range and above the long term average for Big Spunk Lake. Pike ranged from 12 to 30 inches and averaged 21 inches and two pounds. Twenty percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the small pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n  <br> \nBig Spunk Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades. The gill net catch of Walleye in 2016 increased from the 2008 survey and was within the range of what we would expect to see for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 18 to 27 inches and averaged 21 inches and 2.7 pounds. Growth of Walleye was similar to statewide averages as Walleye reach 18 inches in five years.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent Largemouth Bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches. A total of 141 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.7 hours of electrofishing in May 2016. This was above the average catch rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area and very similar to what was reported in 2008. Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass, 70% were longer than 12 inches and 28% were longer than 15 inches. Although not collected in this survey, Smallmouth Bass are also found in low numbers in Big Spunk Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch increased in 2016 and was considered high however, Bluegill only averaged five inches and fish over seven inches were rare. Anglers can expect to catch smaller Bluegill on Big Spunk with an occasional larger one mixed in.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch increased from 2008 and equaled the long term average for the lake. Black Crappie catches are known to fluctuate widely depending on the success of spawning which is largely dependent on environmental factors. Anglers should be able to expect good fishing for Black Crappie in the next couple of years on Big Spunk as fish ranged in length from 6 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches. Forty-two percent of Black Crappie sampled were greater than nine inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. All of these species were sampled at rates either within or below the range of expected values for the respective Lake Class. In 2016, a 5.3 pound 22.9 inch Channel Catfish was sampled in the gill nets. This was the first time that a Channel Catfish has ever been sampled in any of the Spunk Lakes. It is likely that the Channel Catfish migrated into the lake from the Mississippi River via Spunk Creek. <br> \n <br> \nChanges in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake. It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Spunk Lake was conducted on July 13th, 2023, by Sauk Rapids Area Fisheries staff. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and steep drop offs. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at five sampling stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Rock Bass, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Big Spunk Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Big Spunk Lake was fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. The recent survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi (Sartell) River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on June 22, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including several species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of lake. The FIBI score for Big Spunk Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Sartell watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\nBig Spunk Lake is a 440 acre lake located near of the city of Avon in Stearns County with maximum depth of 38 feet. A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake. \n\nPrincipal species caught in trap nets during the spring assessment were Northern Pike (3.5/net), Walleye (0.3/net), Largemouth Bass (0.6/net), and Black Crappie (1.9/net). \n\nIn the summer mainly Bluegill (93.9/trap net) and hybrid sunfish (23.0/net) were sampled.  Bluegill numbers have steadily increase since the 1975 survey (15.8/ net) reaching above average levels in 1992.  Bluegill were of average weight (0.1 lbs), and average weight did not change significantly from the 1987 assessment.  The Black Crappie catch from summer sampling was below average (0.4/net) for the lake class and fell sharply from the level of the 1987 assessment (19.5/net).  Spring trap nets revealed a higher catch rate (1.9/net) suggesting that Black Crappie may not have been as susceptible to the gear during the summer assessment.  The overall cooler water temperatures present in 1992 relative to 1987 may have also reduced our overall catch.  The average weight of Black Crappie caught in the summer was 0.4 lbs., which fell within expected values for the lake class.\n\nThe principal species caught in gill nets included: Northern Pike (5.3/net), Black Bullhead (30.3/net), Yellow Perch (40.0/net) and Walleye (6.5/net).  Northern Pike net catches were average, however Black Bullhead, Yellow Perch and Walleye catches were high and all reached the highest values ever reported in 1992.  Northern Pike numbers varied from the 1987 assessment (7.2/net) but remained within expected values for the lake class.  The average weight of Northern Pike sampled was greater than expected (3.1 lbs) and showed an increase from the 1987 assessment (1.9 lbs).  Growth rates for Northern Pike were average, and the majority of fish captured were age 3-8.  Walleye gill net catches, while not significantly different, increased from 2.0/net in the 1987 assessment to 6.5/net in the 1992 assessment.  The average weight of Walleye fell within expected values for the lake class (2.0 lbs) and did not change significantly from the 1987 assessment (2.1 lbs).  Growth rates for Walleye were fast and 7 age classes (age 1-7) were sampled during sampling.  Largemouth Bass numbers were estimated from summer trap net data.  Relative density (0.5/ net) and average weight (0.9lbs.) were average for the lake class.  Growth rates calculated were average and the majority of the fish sampled were age 2.\n</p>",
