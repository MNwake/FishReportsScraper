                "narrative": "<p>  In July 1988 a lake survey was conducted on Long Lake.  Two gillnets and four trapnets were set to obtain data of the present fish population.  Shoreline seining efforts were conducted in August to evaluate natural reproduction in conjunction with the lake survey.\n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The northern pike (4.50/set) net catch was up from the previous survey net catch (1.00/set, in 1967).  This catch was an increase to a level above the local median catch (3.88/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 18.0 to 28.9 inches with a median length group of 20.0-20.9 inches.  Mean weight was 2.70 pounds.  Thirteen northern pike were from age groups II to VI years.  Their growth rates expressed normal growth when related to statewide average growth rates.\n  The yellow perch (1.00/set) net catch was well below the local median catch (24.27/set).  In previous surveys the yellow perch did not show up in test nets, however, young-of-year were always recorded by shoreline seining efforts.\n  Largemouth bass were not taken by trapnetting, but one was caught in the gillnets (0.50/set).  This fish was 11.2 inches and was of age group III.  In previous surveys largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  Shoreline seining efforts in 1988 recorded 7 young-of-year largemouth bass in the 0.36 acre area seined.\n  The bluegill sunfish (24.00/set) net catch was nearly the same as the previous survey catch (24.40/set) and was just below the local median catch (25.67/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 5.5 - 5.9 inches.  Forty-four bluegill sunfish were aged, which represented a good age distribution, ranging from I to VIII years.  The growth rate for each year-class was similar to the year-class growth rates of the 1955 survey.  Overall, bluegill sunfish in Long Lake appear to be growing at rates slower to that of the statewide average growth rates.  Shoreline seining efforts in 1988 recorded 878 young-of-year bluegill sunfish in the 0.36 acre area seined.\n  The black crappie (3.00/set) net catch was down from the previous survey catch (9.20/set) and remains below the local median catch (18.45/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.5 to 12.9 inches with a median length group 7.0 - 7.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.31 pounds.\n  The white crappie (0.75/set) was sampled for the first time in Long Lake.  The median length group was 8.0 - 8.4 inches with a mean weight of 0.23 pounds.  They were from age groups II to IV.  It was suspected that migration via the Kettle River introduced the present white crappie population.\n  Seven other species were sampled by test nets (golden shiner, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish) and were below their respective local median net catches.\n</p>",

Populations of Largemouth Bass are also present.  To assess fish populations, a survey was conducted using trap and gill nets in June 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was 20 fish, resulting in a catch rate of 6.7 fish per net.  This catch was the highest catch rate dating back to the 1960s.  The average length of pike in gill nets was 19.5 inches, with a range of 13.1 to 28.7 inches. Three pike were caught in trap nets that had an average length of 13.2 inches.  Age classes represented in the catch were age-2 to 6 and 9.  There were very few fish caught over 26 inches (10%) and 81% were under 22 inches.  Overall numbers were high, but the size structure was skewed towards smaller fish. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the number of Black Crappies sampled with trap and gill nets, the total catch for both gears was the second highest.  The average size of crappies was 7.7 inches for both gears combined, with a length range of 5.7 to 12.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used to evaluate Bluegill number and size. The total trap net catch was 160, and the catch rate was 19.1 per net.  This was the highest catch and second highest catch rate of the past five surveys, indicating the population is high at this time.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets and gill nets combined ranged in size from 3.1 to 8.8 inches with most fish ranging from 7.0 to 7.5 inches.  Bluegill had an average length of 6.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass occur in low numbers.  Bass were not targeted with electrofishing gear in this survey, and only one was caught in a gill net.  That fish was 14.8 inches long.  The last time bass were targeted with electrofishing gear was in 1998, and 9 were caught in that survey.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye were sampled in this survey.  Walleye were stocked between 2000 and 2009 but stocking was discontinued due to lack of survival and return to the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on Long Lake can be good for several species.  There are respectable numbers of Northern Pike and Black Crappie, although they are currently on the small side. Bluegill numbers are high but have average size.  Largemouth Bass are present, although the population is low in number.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake, located in Pine County near the town of Rutledge, has a surface area of 75 acres and has been assigned to lake class 32.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary species.Historical records indicate that fish stocking, which took place sporadically from 1910 to 1965, included such species as northern pike, crappie, bass, and sunfish.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 27, 1998 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Standardized gear types used to evaluate the fish population included spring night electrofishing, three gill nets, six trap nets, and four shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.Northern pike numbers were found to be at a normal level for lakes of this type, while the average weight, at 1.4 pounds, was below normal.  Measured northern pike lengths extended from 12.3 to 26.9 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  Growth was determined to typical of normal when compared to statewide average growth.One walleye, which weighed 0.9 pounds, was sampled during the 1998 survey.  Historically, walleye have never been sampled or stocked in Long Lake by the MN DNR.  Scale analysis found the 13.6 inch walleye to be 4 years old.Spring night electrofishing was the selected method to sample for largemouth bass on Long Lake for the first time.  On June 2, 1998, three stations sampled shoal water areas for largemouth.  A catch rate of 10.3 fish/hour (on-time) was calculated.  Currently, catch rate averages for this gear type by lake class have not been formally developed, so comparisons were not made.  The sample of 9 largemouth bass had lengths ranging from 9.2 to 17.5 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Long Lake largemouth growth was within a normal range when compared to statewide averages.The abundance of bluegill sunfish was found to be within a normal range along with the average weight.  Bluegill sunfish lengths ranged from 3.3 to 6.5 inches with an average length of 4.9 inches.  When compared to statewide average growth at each age for bluegill, growth was normal at ages 1-3 and below normal at ages 4-7.Black crappie numbers and the average weight were determined to be at normal levels for this type of lake.  Total lengths extended from 5.0 to 9.7 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Black crappie growth was representative of normal at ages 1-3 and 7 and below normal at ages 4-6.During the 1998 survey, white crappie were sampled for the first time in Long Lake.  A total of 2 fish were captured with their lengths at 9.5 and 10.0 inches.  Scale analysis determined their ages to be 4 and 5 years old, respectively.On August 28, 1998, four shoreline seine hauls were utilized for sampling natural reproduction success.  Bluegill sunfish showed good reproductive success while largemouth bass and yellow perch showed some successful natural reproduction.The fish species composition in Long Lake also included black, brown, and yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  For this type of lake, all bullhead species were found to be below normal in numbers, while pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker were within a normal range.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake, located in Pine County near the town of Rutledge, has a surface area of 75 acres and has been assigned to lake class 32.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary species.  A public access is located on the north end of the lake just off Long Lake Drive north of Rutledge.  The lake is well developed with sixty lakeshore dwellings and one resort.  The water clarity is pretty good with a secchi disk reading of 8.8 feet.  The shore and shallow water substrate is predominately sand.      <br> \n <br> \nSince 1999, seventy five pounds of walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially.  Stocking was begun following the acquisition of the public access in hopes of increasing angling opportunities for walleye.  The long-range goal of the management plan is to maintain walleye levels of at least 3 per net lift.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 28, 2008 to evaluate the current status of the fish population relative to the lake management plan and historic data. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were found to be below the normal level for lakes of this type, while the average weight, 3 pounds, exceeded the 75th percentile.  The northern pike catch decreased from 6 per gill net in 1998 to 2.7 per net presently, however size structure improved dramatically with a two-fold increase in mean weight.  Northern pike lengths extended from 16.9 to 30.5 inches, with an average length of 23.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite repeated stocking since the previous assessment, walleye were not captured during current sampling.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for both walleye and northern pike, were also absent in the netting.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance and size were very similar to the previous sample and within the normal range for the lake type.  Bluegill sunfish lengths ranged from 3.4 to 7.4 inches with a 5.8 inch average.   <br> \n <br> \nBasins in lake class 32 typically have low black crappie numbers. Long Lake is no exception.  The current catch rate fell below the lake class norm and all previous catch rates.  The five black crappies measured ranged from 5.6 to 8.4 inches. <br> \n</p>",
