                "narrative": "<p>This deepwater assessment consisted of 29 standard survey gillnets set below the thermocline at depths ranging from 40' to 120'.  Temperatures at these depths ranged from 46 F to 41 F and oxygen levels ranged from 8 ppm to 4 ppm depending on location.This assessment revealed fish populations dominated by lake whitefish and cisco, followed by lake trout and burbot.  A few northern pike were also present at these depths.  Lac La Croix consists of deep, complex basins at the east and west ends separated by a large shallow basin in the middle of the lake.  Standard deepwater nets were set in the west basin as far east as Fortyfive Island and in the east basin as far west as Twentyfive Island.  There were significant differences in deepwater fish populations between the east and west ends of the lake as revealed by this assessment and by a separate smelt assessment.  SMELT:A deepwater smelt assessment (reported separately) showed fair numbers of smelt (35.5/standard smelt net) in the west basin as far east as Twentyfive Island.  The average size of these smelt was 5.8\".  High numbers of cisco (26.5/standard smelt net, averaging 8.7\") were found in the east end of the lake, as far west as Twentyfive Island.  Smelt and small cisco overlapped only in the net southwest of Twentyfive Island.  CISCO:Similar to results of the smelt netting, cisco numbers in standard gillnets were much higher in the east end of the lake (20.6/net) than in the west end (0.8/net).  Cisco sizes ranged from 3.5\" to 17.9\" (averaging 8.6\") in the east end and from 6.0\" to 13.9\" (averaging 8.9\") in the west end.LAKE WHITEFISH:Whitefish numbers were also higher in the east end (7.6/standard gillnet) than in the west end (3.5/gillnet).  Whitefish sizes ranged from 6.5\" to 24.9\" (averaging 13.3\") in the east end and from 6.5\" to 21.9\" (averaging 15.0\") in the west end.  LAKE TROUT:Lake trout numbers were lower in the east end (0.8/gillnet) than in the west end (2.9/gillnet).  Lake trout sizes ranged from 10.0\" to 37.5\" (averaging 20.6\") in the east end and from 14.0\" to 27.5\" (averaging 19.1\") in the west end.  Lake trout were eating smelt in the west end and appeared to be growing faster than trout in the east end.  BURBOT:Burbot numbers were lower in the east end (1.1/gillnet) than in the west end (2.2/gillnet).  Burbot sizes ranged from 8.3\" to 23.3\" and averaged 17.7\".SUMMARY:  Deepwater fish populations in the east end of the lake are dominated by cisco and whitefish.  Fish populations in the west end of the lake are dominated by smelt, lake trout, and burbot.  The total number of fish/gillnet (24.3/net) and the total weight of fish/net (19.5 lbs/net) is high for deepwater nets.  SHALLOW WATER GILLNETS:This assessment consisted of 14 shallow standard gillnet sets.  Six nets were set in the west end of the lake as far east as the east side of Twentyseven Island.  Eight nets were set in the east end of the lake as far west as the west side of Twentyfive Island.  A series of deepwater gillnets and smelt gillnets were set concurrently with this assessment, with a similar division between the east and west ends of the lake.  These deepwater and smelt assessments are reported separately.  No trapnets were set.Overall, shallow water fish populations were dominated by walleye (10.4/net), followed by northern pike (3.2/net), white sucker (1.4/net), and rock bass (3.4/net).  Very low numbers of other species (less than one/net) were captured.Fish sizes were generally unexceptional.  A 12\" black crappie and two smallmouth bass over 16\" were captured.  The average size of walleye (15.6\") was good and 9 percent of the walleye were over 20\".  Quality sized smallmouth, crappie, northern pike, and walleye are caught by anglers each year.Shallow water fish populations were higher in the west end of the lake.  Nets in the west end captured an average total of 28.7 fish/net (43.7 lbs/net) compared to an average total of 15.3/net (23.1 lbs/net) in the east end of the lake.  Of the dominant species, walleye were much more abundant in the west end (17.3/net) than the east end (5.5/net).  Rock bass were also more abundant in the west end (5.5/net) than in the east end (1.8/net).  Northern pike, however, were more abundant in the east end (4.3/net) than in the west end (1.8/net).  All ten sauger caught in this assessment were in the east end.  Walleye in the west end of the lake were eating smelt and their growth was faster (15.0\" at annulus IV) than walleye in the east end (11.1\" at annulus IV).  Age three through six walleye were well represented in both ends of the lake.  Northern pike were also eating smelt in the west end of the lake and their growth was faster than in the east end.  SMELT GILL NETS:Smelt were first confirmed in Lac La Croix in 1989 by a netting crew from the University of North Dakota.  These smelt were captured just south of Snow Bay, at the western end of the lake.  We do not know if nets were set in other locations on the lake.  A 1984 DNR assessment captured no smelt in standard deepwater gillnets, and no smelt were found in gamefish stomachs that were examined.  No smelt nets were set in 1984.In 1994 standard smelt nets were set in Lac La Croix at depths ranging from 50' to 95'.  Smelt were found in four nets in the west portion of the lake as far east as Twentyfive Island.  Smelt were evenly distributed among these nets, with a mean catch of 35.5 per net.  In other lakes with smelt, densities over 100 per standard smelt net are common.  No smelt were caught in the other three nets in the east part of the lake.  The average size of the smelt was 4.8\" with a range of 3.7\" to 8.0\".  We do not know why smelt are present only in the western half of the lake.  There are no physical barriers to their movement throughout the lake.  Cisco were found in four nets in the east portion of the lake with the westernmost net just southwest of Twentyfive Island.  These fish were unevenly distributed among the four nets.  The average size was 5.8\" with a range of 3.8\" to 8.1\".  The absence of cisco in the western half of the lake is not a surprise as smelt introductions have been related to cisco extirpation in other lakes.Sculpins (6 total) and troutperch (3 total) were found in the east end of the lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac la Croix is a large, sprawling body of water located northwest of Ely and lies along the Canadian border.  The whole lake is 34,070 acres with 19,820 acres in Minnesota and 14,250 in Ontario.  All of the water in Minnesota is within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and nearly all of it is non-motorized.  The only Minnesota water motor boats can legally be used on is the portion between Beatty Portage and south of Snow Bay.  The entire Ontario portion is open to year round motor use.  There are numerous portage accesses throughout the lake but the most commonly used motor access comes in on the west side and is via two mechanical rail portages from Crane Lake through the Loon River and Loon Lake.  These rail portages are capable of carrying very large water craft which are often used by resorts and visitors on the Canadian side.  The lakes two major inlets, the Basswood River along the border and Maligne River in Ontario, drain massive areas of land and lakes to the east.  The two major outlets are the Namakan River to the north (entirely within Ontario) and the Loon River to the west.  Both of these rivers (after several series of lakes on each) reconvene several miles downstream in Namakan Lake.  Lac la Croix has a maximum depth of 168 feet and the water color at the time of the survey was clear on the west end and brown from bog-stain on the east end. \n\nThis population assessment consisted of deep water, shallow water, and small mesh gillnet sets and was conducted during the week of July 7th to 11th, 2014.  It should be acknowledged that this assessment and all previous surveys were only done on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  \n\nFour DO/temperature profiles were taken between July 7th and 10th at four different locations on the lake.  All four profiles showed thermal stratification with surface temps ranging from 69F to 74F and bottom temps all around 41F.  At all locations, water temps suitable for trout (<55F) were reached around 33 feet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are mostly absent except for some shallow bays.   \n\nThe overall deep water gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 23.4 fish/net which is average compared to historic catches from the lake.  Fish species sampled in deep water gill nets were cisco, lake whitefish, lake trout, burbot, and northern pike.  The overall shallow water gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 16.1 fish/net which is just below average compared to historic catches for the lake.  Fish species sampled were walleye, northern pike, white sucker, rock bass, sauger, cisco, smallmouth bass, burbot, lake whitefish, shorthead redhorse, yellow perch, and lake trout.  The overall small mesh gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 7.8 fish/net which is low compared to previous surveys.  Fish species sampled were cisco, sculpin, lake trout, rainbow smelt, and trout-perch.   \n\nThe deep water gillnet catch for lake trout in 2014 was 1.5 fish/net which is average for historic surveys of Lac la Croix.  This catch rate also ranks 34th out of 70 recent investigations of lake trout populations in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 37 inches with an average of 21 inches.  The average and maximum sizes were on par with previous surveys.  Average weight was nearly 4.3 lbs/fish but down from highs of 8.0 lbs/fish in 1999 and 9.0 lbs/fish in 2004.  Fish between 12 and 29 inches were aged to be from 4 to 17 years old.  No single year class was overly strong and from 2000 to 2008 there were no missing year classes.  Based on catch numbers and size structure, the lake trout population seems to be fairly consistent in Lac la Croix.  Older ages were reported in previous surveys, however no larger trout were aged in this survey.  \n\nEighty-eight walleye were sampled in the shallow water gill nets for a catch rate of 6.3 fish/net.  With the exception of the 1963 survey, catch rates have been at fairly constant levels (5.5 to 10.4 fish/net).  Lengths ranged from 7 to 24 inches with an average of 15 inches.  This average length is slightly better than the historic average.  The maximum length of 24 inches is not vastly different than previous surveys.  Growth is somewhat slow compared to other walleye populations in Tower Area lakes.  Ages ranged from 1 to 11 with no missing year classes from 2003 to 2013.  The 2008 and 2011 year classes were the strongest with over 45% of the total catch coming from those years.  \n\nThe sauger population on Lac la Croix has consistently been at low levels.  The 2014 shallow water gillnet catch rate of 0.9 fish/net is the highest on record, however an average length of 9 and maximum length of 11 inches are both the lowest on record.  Ages ranged from 4 to 5 with ten of the twelve fish coming from the 2010 year class.  \n\nThe northern pike shallow water gillnet catch was 3.7 fish/net which is above average compared to previous surveys.  Lengths ranged from 16 to 37 inches with an average of 22 inches.  Both the average and maximum lengths are on par with previous surveys.  It's interesting that the sizes aren't larger with a strong cisco forage base.  The largest pike sampled in the lake was 43 inches and was caught in 1984.  That is the only over 40 inch fish ever sampled by DNR nets in Lac la Croix.  \n\nFive smallmouth bass were sampled in shallow water gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4 fish/net which is average for the lake.  The average weight for shallow water gillnetted fish was 1.5 lbs/fish.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 18 inches with an average of 13 inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 10 years.  \n\nThe deep water gillnet catch for lake whitefish in 2014 was 3.5 fish/net which is close to average compared to previous surveys of Lac la Croix and ranks 24th out of 56 recent surveys of whitefish populations in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 8 to 25 inches with an average of 15 inches.  Historic average lengths from Lac la Croix have ranged from 14 to 17 inches.  Average weight was 1.5 lbs/fish.  The largest fish sampled (25 inches) was 34 years old.    \n\nThe deep water gillnet catch for burbot was 0.7 fish/net which is close to average compared to historic surveys of Lac la Croix.  This catch rate ranks 20th out of 63 recent surveys of burbot populations in the Tower area.  Lengths ranged from 11 to 20 inches with an average of 16 inches.  Maximum length was the lowest on record and has trended down with every survey that has been done on Lac la Croix (28.5 in 1984, 23.3 in 1994, 22.8 in 1999, 21.2 in 2004, and 20.4 in 2014).\n\nBoth deep water gillnet and small mesh gillnet catches are used in assessing the cisco population.  The deep water gillnet catch for cisco was 17.7 fish/net which is second only to the 1984 survey that sampled cisco at 31.4 fish/net and ranks 15th out of 96 recent investigations of cisco populations in the Tower area.  Average (8 inches) and maximum (17 inches) lengths were similar to previous assessments.  The small mesh gillnet catch was 5.4 fish/net compared to the next best assessment at 15.1 fish/net in 1994.  Average (6 inches) and maximum (8 inches) length were also similar to previous assessments.  \n\nIt should be noted that recent analysis of cisco populations in many lakes throughout the state has lead us to believe that we are often dealing with multiple different species of cisco within the same lake.  This appears to be the case on Lac la Croix.  The problem however, is distinguishing the sometimes very subtle differences between species while in the field.  With this in mind, the numbers provided for the cisco sample on Lac la Croix should be acknowledged as being of likely two to three different cisco species.  Previous research done on Lac la Croix indicate that the likely species we were sampling were northern cisco/tullibee (Coregonus artedi), shortjaw cisco (C. zenithicus), and possibly Nipigon cisco (C. nipigon).\n\nRainbow smelt are a non-native invasive fish that were first documented in Lac la Croix in 1989 by a University of North Dakota crew specifically looking for smelt.  The previous DNR netting done in 1984 captured none, however after their discovery by UND, small mesh nets were added to the DNR survey in 1994 and smelt were then sampled.  Previous surveys of smelt captured them at rates of 20.3 in 1994, 46.1 in 1999, and 12.5 in 2004.  In 2014 only three rainbow smelt were sampled in the small mesh gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4 fish/net.  This is quite surprising as other lakes within the Tower Area that have smelt populations see the smelt numbers fluctuate to a certain degree, but no other lake has shown a drop in their catch rate this dramatically.  In several smelt lakes, evidence has shown that they can be quite detrimental to populations of lake whitefish and cisco.  In Lac la Croix, the larger sized cisco seem to be doing fine and the whitefish population has remained relatively consistent.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac La Croix is in Ecological Lake Class 2, which consists of 15 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have very irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  With a surface area of 34,070 acres, maximum depth of 168 ft, littoral area of about 25 percent, total alkalinity of 12-16 ppm, Secchi water clarity of 8 ft on the east end and 15 ft on the west end, and a Shoreline Development Factor of about 7.1, Lac La Croix is very typical of lakes in this lake class.Lac La Croix was thermally stratified on 07/12/2004 with surface temperatures about 73 F and bottom temperatures about 43 F.  On the west end of the lake, 7.0 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 100 ft (the length of the sampling probe cable) over a bottom depth of 120 ft at WQ-1 and 9.0 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 100 ft over a bottom depth of 106 ft at WQ-2.  On the east end of the lake, 6.9 ppm oxygen was retained to the bottom depth of 130 ft at WQ-3, and 7.5 ppm oxygen was retained to the bottom depth of 120 ft.  On both ends of the lake, the depth at which the water temperature was good for trout (55 F) was about 35 ft.Lac La Croix is a very rocky lake with little aquatic vegetation present.  The major inlets are the Basswood River and the Maligne River, entering at several points along the east end of the lake, and the outlets are the Namakan River and the Loon River, exiting on the north and west ends of the lake, respectively.This fish population assessment consisted of 12 shallow gillnets set in depths of 8-26 ft where water temperatures were warmer than 55 F, 29 deep gillnets set in depths of 43-124 ft where the water temperatures were colder than 55 F, and 8 smelt nets set in depths of 54-100 ft.  The shallow and deep gillnets used were standard Minnesota survey gillnets 6' x 250' with five 50' panels, one panel each of 0.75\", 1.0\", 1.25\", 1.5\", and 2.0\" bar mesh twisted nylon, graduated from smallest to largest mesh.  The smelt nets were 6' x 200' with two 100' panels, one panel each of 0.375\" and 0.5\" bar mesh twisted nylon.  Approximately equal numbers of nets were set on each end of the lake, with the large shallow central basin between Twentyfive Island and Twentyseven Island being the dividing line between the east and west ends.   Because of the stratified sampling (separate deep and shallow gillnets) used in this assessment, the CPUE quartiles developed for standard gillnet sampling for this lake class cannot be used as a basis for comparison and are omitted from this report.  Standard sampling consists of gillnets set from shallow to deeper water, with the entire net set in oxygenated water, but with variable amounts of net sampling shallow (warm) and deep (cold) water.  In general, warm water is probably sampled more intensively than cold water with standard sampling because the species of interest are warm water game fish.  With stratified sampling, cold water is often sampled more intensively than warm water because the species of interest is usually lake trout.Previous Minnesota DNR Investigations were conducted in 1963 (shallow nets only - cooperatively with Ontario MNR), in 1984 (shallow and deep gillnets - Minnesota DNR only), and in 1994 (shallow, deep, and smelt gillnets, cooperatively with Ontario MNR).SHALLOW GILLNETS:For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of fish (all species combined) in the shallow gillnets in 2004 of 12 fish/net (27 lb/net) was similar to catches in 1984, 1994, and 1999, but was lower than the catch in 1963.  More walleye and white sucker were caught in 1963 than in later investigations:Date of netting\t   07/ /63   08/06/84   07/11/94   07/12/99\t2004Number of gillnets   12\t        12\t   14\t      12\t12Number of fish/net   33\t\t18\t   21\t      17\t12Pounds of fish/net   30\t\t22\t   31\t      25\t27Shallow water fish populations in 2004 were very similar on the east end of the lake in 2004 (13 fish/net, 26 lb/net) and on the west end of the lake (12 fish/net, 28 lb/net).  In general, gillnet catches of shallow water fish on both ends of the lake were dominated by walleye and northern pike.For Lac La Croix as a whole, walleye catches appeared to gradually decline, from a high of 14/net in 1963 to a low of 5.5/net in 2004.  Net locations and depths were not recorded in the 1963 investigation, so we cannot separate catches from the east and west ends of the lake in that investigation. Walleye numbers in the east end of the lake in 2004 (5.8/net) were similar to the median catch of 6.5/net in all four shallow water investigations in which east end catches were kept separate, beginning in 1984.  East end walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 15.5\", which was larger than the average size of 13.7\" in all investigations on the east end of this lake.  The largest walleye on the east end was 24.4\" (all fish lengths in this report are total lengths).  Walleye aged two through seven were captured in 2004 with no particular year class being dominant.  Walleye growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.  Twenty nine of 33 walleye stomachs examined were empty, the remaining stomachs contained cisco (2) or yellow perch (2).   No smelt were found in walleye stomachs on the east end of the lake.  Walleye numbers in the west end of the lake in 2004 (5.2/net) were lower than previous catches of 8.3/net in 1984, 17.3/net in 1994, and 7.0/net in 1999.  West end walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 15.8\", which was larger than the average size of 14.6\" in all investigations on the west end of this lake.  The largest walleye on the west end was 23.7\".   Most of the walleye were age two (20 %) and age three (42 %).  Walleye growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.  Twenty five of 30 walleye stomachs examined were empty, the remaining stomachs contained smelt (5).The proportion of walleye greater than 500 mm fork length is used by Ontario as an indicator of fish size quality.  Using the conversion Total Length = Fork Length x 1.06 and converting to English units results in a quality size of 20.7\".  Using this criterion, walleye of quality size in the 2004 catch were few, but were more abundant than in past assessments (numbers of fish in parenthesis):Date of netting\t  East end\t\t  West end\t   \tEntire lake07/ /63\t\t  No data\t\t  No data\t\t 2.3% (4 of 169)08/06/84\t0.0% (0 of 36)\t\t 1.7% (1 of 58)\t\t 1.1% (1 of 94)07/11/94\t2.4% (1 of 41)\t\t 1.9% (2 of 104)\t 2.0% (3 of 145)07/12/99\t6.7% (4 of 60)\t\t 0.0% (0 of 42)\t\t 3.9% (4 of 109)07/12/04\t8.5% (3 of 35)\t\t19.3% (6 of 31)\t\t13.6% (9 of 66)The mean age of walleye in 2004 was somewhat higher than in previous assessments on this lake.

These results were similar to previous investigations (numbers of fish in parenthesis):Date of netting\t  East end\t  West end\t  Entire lake07/11/94\t  61% (41)\t  75% (102)\t  71% (143)07/12/99\t  56% (59)\t  64% (42)\t  59% (101)07/12/04\t  52% (31)\t  68% (31)\t  60% (62)Although sample sizes were small, male walleye appeared to mature earlier in the west end of the lake than in the east end in 2004 (numbers of fish in parenthesis):Age of\t  East end\t  \tWest end        \tEntire lakewalleye\t  Male    Female  \tMale    Female\t\tMale    Female12\t  0% (1)\t\t  0% (2)   0% (4)   \t  0% (3)   0% (4)3         0% (1)   0% (3)\t 25% (4)   0% (9)\t 20% (5)   0% (12)4\t 50% (4)   0% (5)\t100% (1)   0% (2)\t 60% (5)   0% (7)5\t 75% (4)   0% (1)\t100% (1)\t\t 80% (5)   0% (1)6\t100% (3) 100% (3)\t100% (1) 100% (2)\t100% (4) 100% (5) 7\t100% (2) 100% (2)\t \t 100% (2)\t100% (2) 100% (4)8\t\t\t\t\t 100% (2)\t\t 100% (2) \t\t9\t\t\t\t100% (1)\t\t100% (1)Gillnet catches of northern pike in Lac La Croix have been remarkably consistent over time, ranging from 3.1gillnet in 1984 to 4.6/net in 1963.  The 2004 pike catch of 3.7/net falls in the middle of this historic range.  Similar numbers of pike were captured in the east and west ends of the lake in 2004 as in previous investigations.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 25\" (3.6 lbs) and were similar in the east and west basins, but were somewhat larger than the average size of 23\" in all investigations on this lake.   The largest pike, caught on the east end, was 39\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike from ages two through seven were present and pike growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.In summary, shallow water fish populations in 2004 were dominated by walleye and northern pike:Walleye numbers have been stable on the east end of the lake over time, but have declined on the west end, and in 2004 similar numbers of walleye were captured on each end of the lake.  Walleye sizes historically have been somewhat larger on the west end of the lake, but in 2004 walleye sizes were similar on each end of the lake.  The average age of walleye captured on the west end of the lake was younger than on the east end of the lake.  Walleye growth was faster on the west end of the lake, and some walleye stomachs contained smelt.  Male walleye matured earlier on the west end of the lake.Pike numbers have been quite consistent over time and have been similar on each end of the lake.   The average size of northern pike in 2004 and previous investigations was somewhat larger on the west end of the lake.  Growth of pike captured in 2004 appeared to be similar on each end of the lake, although pike scales were difficult to read.  DEEP GILLNETS:For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of fish (all species combined) in the deep gillnets in 2004 of 19 fish/net was lower than catches in 1984, but was similar to catches in 1994 and 1999:  Date of netting\t\t08/06/84\t07/11/94\t07/12/99\t07/12/04Number of gillnets\t    9\t\t   29\t\t   28\t\t29Number of fish/net\t   39\t\t   24\t\t   19\t\t19Pounds of fish/net\t   28\t\t   20\t\t   24\t\t22Deep water fish populations were higher on the east end of the lake in 2004 (29 fish/net, 26 lb/net) than on the west end (7 fish/net, 14 lb/net), due mostly to higher numbers of cisco on the east end.  In general, deep water fish populations on the east end were dominated by cisco, lake whitefish, and lake trout, while fish populations on the west end were dominated by smelt (reported in the following section), lake whitefish, and lake trout.Cisco numbers on the east end of the lake in 2004 (25.9/net) were similar to previous catches on this end of the lake, which ranged from 22.6/net to 25.9/net.  East end cisco sizes in 2004 averaged 9.4\"; the largest was 18.2\".Cisco numbers on the west end of the lake in 2004 (1.2/net) were similar to the catch of 0.8/net in 1994 and 0.9/net in 1999, but were much lower than the catch of 35.3/net in 1984.  West end cisco sizes in 2004 averaged 8.8\"; the largest was 14.1\".Lake whitefish numbers on the east end of the lake in 2004 (1.6/net) were lower than previous catches, which ranged from 4.0/net to 7.6/net.  East end whitefish sizes in 2004 averaged 16.6\"; the largest was 23.4\".  Lake whitefish numbers on the west end of the lake in 2004 (3.5/net) were similar to previous catches, which ranged from 2.2/net to 3.5/net.  West end whitefish sizes in 2004 averaged 15.9\"; the largest was 23.3\".Lake trout numbers on the east end of the lake in 2004 (1.1/net) were similar to previous catches, which ranged from 0.7/net to 1.4/net.  East end trout sizes in 2004 averaged 29.6\"; the largest was 37.6\".   Historically, most trout captured in the east end of the lake have been 20\" or larger, the exception being in 1999 when 10 of 21 trout were smaller than 20\".  Five of six trout stomachs examined in 2004 contained cisco, and one stomach was empty.  Ages of the eight lake trout killed from the east end of the lake in 2004 ranged from 6 to 23, based on otolith readings.Lake trout numbers on the west end of the lake (0.7/net) were lower than previous catches of 2.7/net in 1984 and 3.0/net in 1994, but were identical to the catch of 0.7/net in 1999. West end trout sizes in 2004 averaged 25.2\"; the largest was 35.0\".  In contrast to assessments in 1984 and 1994 when many of the captured trout were under 20\", only one of nine trout captured on the west end in 1999 was less than 20\" and no trout in 2004 was under 20\".  Three of five trout stomachs examined in 2004 were empty, while two stomachs contained smelt.  Ages of the five trout killed from the west end of the lake in 2004 were 6 (two trout) and 7 (three trout).  Although sample sizes were small and there was little age overlap, it appears that trout from the west end of the lake were growing faster than on the east end. Burbot numbers have declined in each end of the lake over time, and their numbers in 2004 were quite low: 0.1/net on the east end and 0.7 on the west end.DEEP SMELT GILLNETS:Smelt were not captured or observed in game fish stomachs during the 1984 assessment.  Smelt were first captured in Lac La Croix in 1989, south of Snow Bay, by a University of North Dakota crew specifically looking for smelt.Smelt nets set in 2004, as in 1999 and 1994, captured smelt in the west end of the lake as far east as net 56, about one mile southwest of Twentyfive Island.  Smelt numbers in the five westernmost smelt nets in 2004 (including net 56, the westernmost of the eastern smelt nets), averaged 20.0/net, which was lower than the 1999 average catch of 73.8/net and the 1994 average catch of 38.5/net in these same five nets.  As in 1994 and 1999, all but a few of the smelt captured in 2004 were in the 0.375\" bar mesh, except that the easternmost net had about half of the smelt in the 0.5\" mesh.  Smelt sizes in 2004 averaged 4.9\"; the largest was 6.7\".  Smelt were found in the stomach of a lake trout in the bay west of Fish Stake Narrows in 2004.  Previously, the farthest east smelt had been observed in Minnesota waters of Lac La Croix were in a lake trout stomach four miles south of Twentyfive Island in 1999.East end cisco numbers in the 2004 smelt nets (57.2/net) were similar to the 1999 catch of 60.8/net, and were higher than the 1994 catch of 16.5/net.   Most cisco were in the 0.5\" bar mesh, and east end cisco sizes in the smelt nets averaged 5.7\".West end cisco numbers in the 2004 smelt nets (3.5/net) were similar to the 1999 catch of 4.2/net and were higher than in 1994, when no cisco were captured in the west end.  All the cisco in 2004 were in the 0.5\" bar mesh, and west end cisco sizes in the smelt nets averaged 5.5\".In summary, deep water fish populations are dominated by cisco, whitefish, and lake trout in the east end of the lake, and by smelt, whitefish, and lake trout in the west end of the lake.  Smelt and cisco populations overlap in the vicinity of Twentyfive Island.  Smelt were observed as far east as the bay west of Fish Stake Narrows, which is the farthest eastern observance to date.  Lake trout catches have declined in the west end of the lake and were similar to east end catches in 1999 and 2004.  Few small lake trout (less than 20\") were captured in 2004, and all lake trout were age six years old or older.  Lake trout on the west end are eating smelt and growing faster.  The apparent lack of recruitment of cisco (and perhaps lake trout) in the west end of the lake and the faster growth of walleye and lake trout in the west end of the lake is consistent with the responses to smelt introductions reported elsewhere.</p>",

Walleye sizes are small, and their growth is slow, especially for a lake trout lake.The walleye population appears to be dominated by a strong 1981 cohort appearing now as III+ fish. No complete reproductive failures are seen although success appears variable. Smallmouth bass numbers may be larger than the gillnetting indicate, judging by the good success anglers were having. Crappies were another commonly caught Centrarchid. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac La Croix is in Ecological Lake Class 2, and with a surface area of 34,070 acres, maximum depth of 168 ft, littoral area of about 25 percent, total alkalinity of 15 ppm, Secchi water clarity of 12 ft, and Shoreline Development Factor of about 7.1, it is very typical of lakes in this lake class.Lac La Croix was thermally stratified on 07/12/99.  Surface oxygen levels were 8.4 ppm.  On the west end of the lake, 6.5 ppm was retained to a depth of 100 ft (the length of the sampling probe cable) over a bottom depth of 120 ft at WQ-1 and 8.2 ppm was retained to a depth of 100 ft over a bottom depth of 106 ft at WQ-2.  On the east end of the lake, 5.2 ppm was retained to a depth of 130 ft over a bottom depth of 134 ft at WQ-3, and 7.6 ppm was retained to a depth of 120 ft over a bottom depth of 122 ft.  On both ends of the lake, the depth at which the water temperature was 55 F was about 30 ft.Lac La Croix is a very rocky lake with little aquatic vegetation present.  The major inlets are the Basswood River and the Maligne River, entering at several points along the east end of the lake, and the outlets are the Namakan River and the Loon River, exiting on the north and west ends of the lake, respectively.This fish population assessment consisted of 12 shallow gillnets set in depths of 8-25 ft where water temperatures were warmer than 55 F, 28 deep gillnets set in depths of 43-105 ft where the water temperatures were colder than 55 F, and 8 smelt nets set in depths of 50-90 ft.  Approximately equal numbers of nets were set on each end of the lake, with the large shallow central basin between Twentyfive Island and Twentyseven Island being the dividing line.  The Ontario MNR simultaneously conducted shallow and deep netting in Ontario waters, using standard Minnesota gillnets.  Their results will be reported separately. Because of the stratified sampling (separate deep and shallow gillnets) used in this assessment, the CPUE quartiles developed for standard gillnet sampling for this lake class cannot be used as a basis for comparison and will be omitted from this report.  Standard sampling consists of gillnets set from shallow to deeper water, with the entire net set in oxygenated water, but with variable amounts of net sampling shallow (warm) and deep (cold) water.  In general, warm water is probably sampled more intensively than cold water with standard sampling because the species of interest are warm water game fish.  With stratified sampling, cold water is often sampled more intensively than warm water because the species of interest is usually lake trout.SHALLOW GILLNETS:For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of fish (all species combined) in the shallow gillnets in 1999 of 17 fish/net (25 lb/net) was similar to catches in 1984 and 1994, but was lower than the catch in 1963, due to higher catches of walleye and white sucker in 1963:Date of netting\t   07/ /63   08/06/84   07/11/94   07/12/99Number of gillnets   12\t        12\t   14\t      12Number of fish/net   33\t\t18\t   21\t      17Pounds of fish/net   30\t\t22\t   31\t      25Shallow water fish populations were higher on the east end of the lake in 1999 (20 fish/net, 32 lb/net) than on the west end (13 fish/net, 18 lb/net), due mostly to higher numbers of walleye and white sucker on the east end.  In addition, several species (sauger, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon) were caught on the east end of the lake in 1999, but not on the west end.  In general, shallow water fish populations on both ends of the lake were dominated by walleye and northern pike.Walleye numbers in the east end of the lake (10.0/net) were higher than previous catches of 5.1/net in 1994 and 7.2/net in 1984.  East end walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 13.4\"; the largest was 29.7\".  Many of the walleye (48 percent) were from the 1996 year class.  Growth of most age groups of walleye was slow (in the first or second quartile) for area lakes.  Thirty one of 38 walleye stomachs examined were empty, the remainder contained fish remains (1 stomach), cisco (2), yellow perch (3), and smelt (1).  The walleye with the smelt was in net 10, just south of Twentyfive Island.  Walleye numbers in the west end of the lake (7.0/net) were lower than previous catches of 17.3/net in 1994 and 8.3/net in 1984.  West end walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 13.9\"; the largest was 19.2\".  Most of the walleye (62 percent) were from the 1996 year class.  Growth of most age groups of walleye were somewhat fast (in the third quartile) for area lakes.  Thirty one of 42 walleye stomachs examined were empty, the remainder contained smelt (10 stomachs), and perch (1).The percent of walleye greater than 500 mm fork length is used by Ontario as a indicator of fish size quality.  Using the conversion Total Length = Fork Length x 1.06 and converting to English units results in a quality size of 20.7\".  Walleye of quality size in 1999 were few, but were apparently more abundant than in past assessments.  The faster growth of walleye in the west end of the lake in recent years has apparently not resulted in a higher proportion of quality sized fish in that end of the lake (numbers of fish in parenthesis):Date of netting\t  East end\t  West end\t   Entire lake07/ /63\t\t  No data\t  No data\t 2.3% (4 of 169)08/06/84\t0.0% (0 of 36)\t1.7% (1 of 58)\t 1.1% (1 of 94)07/11/94\t2.4% (1 of 41)\t1.9% (2 of 104)\t 2.0% (3 of 145)07/12/99\t6.7% (4 of 60)\t0.0% (0 of 42)\t 3.9% (4 of 109)Northern pike numbers in the east end of the lake (3.8/net) were similar to previous catches of 4.3/net in 1994 and 2.8/net in 1984.  East end pike sizes in 1999 averaged 22.5\"; the largest was 29\".  Pike recruitment was fairly even from year to year.  Growth of most age groups of pike was normal (near the median) for area lakes.  Sixteen of 21 pike stomachs examined were empty, the remainder contained cisco (3) and crayfish (2).Northern pike numbers in the west end of the lake (3.2/net) were similar to previous catches of 1.8/net in 1994 and 3.3/net in 1984.  West end pike sizes in 1999 averaged 23.9\"; the largest was 31.3\".  Pike recruitment was fairly even from year to year.  Growth of most age groups of pike was somewhat fast (in the third quartile) for area lakes.  Fourteen of 19 pike stomachs examined were empty, the remainder contained smelt (2 stomachs), perch (1), burbot (1), and crayfish (1).Rock bass numbers were similar on the east end (2.0/net) and the west end (2.3/net).  Rock bass numbers in previous investigations were similar to 1999.  Rock bass sizes in 1999 averaged 7.0\" on the east end and 6.0\" on the west end.White sucker numbers on the east end (1.8/net) were similar to previous catches of 1.8/net in 1994 and 2.0/net in 1984.  Sucker numbers on the west end (0.2/net) were lower than previous catches of 0.8/net in 1994 and 2.1/net in 1984.Other shallow water species were present in low numbers in 1999.In summary, shallow water fish populations in 1999 were dominated by walleye and northern pike, with more walleye present in the east end of the lake.  Average sizes of walleye and northern pike were slightly larger on the west end, and growth rates were faster.  Few walleye of quality size were present, especially in the west end where only one walleye was older than age four.  The apparent faster growth of walleye and northern pike on the west end is consistent with smelt introductions reported elsewhere.DEEP GILLNETS:For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of fish (all species combined) in the deep gillnets in 1999 of 19 fish/net was lower than catches in 1984 and 1994, but the biomass (24 lb/net) was similar.Date of netting\t\t08/06/84\t07/11/94\t07/12/99Number of gillnets\t    9\t\t   29\t\t   28Number of fish/net\t   39\t\t   24\t\t   19Pounds of fish/net\t   28\t\t   20\t\t   24Deep water fish populations were higher on the east end of the lake in 1999 (29 fish/net, 29 lb/net) than on the west end (7 fish/net, 18 lb/net), due mostly to higher numbers of cisco and lake trout on the east end.  In general, deep water fish populations on the east end were dominated by cisco, lake whitefish, and lake trout, while fish populations on the west end were dominated by smelt (reported in the following section), lake whitefish, and lake trout.Cisco numbers on the east end of the lake (22.6/net) were similar to previous catches of 25.9/net in 1994 and 23.7/net in 1984.  East end cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 9.5\"; the largest was 17.4\".Cisco numbers on the west end of the lake (0.9/net) were similar to the catch of 0.8/net in 1994, but were much lower than the catch of 35.3/net in 1984.  West end cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 8.9\"; the largest was 13.0\".Lake whitefish numbers on the east end of the lake (4.0/net) were similar to previous catches of 7.6/net in 1994 and 4.3/net in 1984.  East end whitefish sizes in 1999 averaged 16.5\"; the largest was 24.5\".  Lake whitefish numbers on the west end of the lake (3.5/net) were similar to previous catches of 3.5/net in 1994 and 4.3/net in 1984.  West end whitefish sizes in 1999 averaged 16.4\"; the largest was 23.1\".Lake trout numbers on the east end of the lake (1.4/net) were higher than previous catches of 0.8/net in 1994 and 0.7/net in 1984.  East end trout sizes in 1999 averaged 24.1\"; the largest was 39.8\".   In contrast to previous assessments when few small trout were captured, 10 of 21 trout captured on the east end in 1999 were less than 20\".  Eight of 18 trout stomachs examined were empty, the remainder contained cisco (6), yellow perch (1), unidentified fish remains (1), smallmouth bass (1), and smelt (1).  The lake trout with the smelt was in net 35, about 4 miles south of Twentyfive Island.  Roundworms were observed in the air bladder of one of the 15 trout examined internally, and argulus was observed on the fins of one of the 15 trout examined externally.Lake trout numbers on the west end of the lake (0.7/net) were lower than previous catches of 3.0/net in 1994 and 2.7/net in 1984.  West end trout sizes in 1999 averaged 27.0\"; the largest was 35.5\".  In contrast to previous assessments when many of the captured trout were small, only one of nine trout captured on the west end in 1999 was less than 20\".  Three of 4 trout stomachs examined were empty, the remaining stomach contained sculpins and a lake whitefish.  Roundworms were observed in the air bladder of one of the four trout examined internally.Too few lake trout otoliths were taken to draw many conclusions about growth, except that it appears that lake trout under 20\" in the east end of the lake are growing slowly when compared to other area lake trout lakes.Northern pike numbers in the deep water nets in 1999 (east: 0.7/net, west: 0.5/net) were similar to previous catches in 1994 and 1984.  Three of the pike stomachs examined in the east end were empty, the remaining four contained cisco.  Only one west end pike stomach was examined, it contained a sculpin and a whitefish.  These deep water pike were larger than their shallow water counterparts, averaging 26.8\" (largest: 31.3\") on the east end and averaging 27.7\" (largest: 37.6\") on the west end.  Northern pike were the only species captured in both deep and shallow water nets in substantial numbers.Burbot numbers in 1999 (east: 0.3/net, west: 1.2/net) were lower than in 1994 (east: 1.1/net, west: 2.2/net) and in 1984 (east: 1.3/net, west: 2.5/net).  Burbot sizes in 1999 averaged 17.1\" (largest: 20.4\") on the east end and 18.2\" (largest: 22.8\") on the west end.DEEP SMELT GILLNETS:Smelt were not captured or observed in game fish stomachs during the 1984 assessment.  Smelt were captured in 1989, south of Snow Bay, by a University of North Dakota crew specifically looking for smelt.Smelt nets set in 1999, as in 1994, captured smelt in the west end of the lake as far east as net 56, about one mile southwest of Twentyfive Island.  Smelt numbers in the five westernmost smelt nets in 1999, including net 56,  averaged 73.8/net, which was higher than the average catch of 38.5/net in 1994.  As in 1994, all except a few of the smelt captured in 1999 were in the 0.375\" bar mesh.  Smelt sizes averaged 5.0\"; the largest was 9.3\".  One smelt in the west end of the lake had young-of-year perch in its stomach.As mentioned previously, smelt were observed in a lake trout stomach four miles south of Twentyfive Island in 1999, which is the farthest east they have been captured in Minnesota waters of Lac La Croix.Cisco numbers in 1999 (60.8/net) in the four east end smelt nets (including net 56) were higher than the catch of 16.5/net in 1994.  Most of the cisco were in the 0.5\" bar mesh.  East end cisco sizes averaged 5.1\".Cisco numbers in the four west end smelt nets in 1999 (4.2/net) were higher than in 1994, when no cisco were captured in the west end.  All the cisco were in the 0.5\" bar mesh.  West end cisco sizes averaged 5.3\".In summary, deep water fish populations are dominated by cisco, whitefish, and lake trout in the east end of the lake, and by smelt, whitefish, and lake trout in the west end of the lake.  Smelt and cisco populations overlap in the vicinity of Twentyfive Island.  Smelt were observed as far east as four miles south of Twentyfive Island.  Lake trout were more abundant in the east end than in previous assessments, and more abundant than in the west end.  More small lake trout (12\"-20\") were captured in the east end than in previous assessments; the converse was true for the west end.  The apparent lack of recruitment of cisco and, perhaps, lake trout in the west end of the lake is consistent with smelt introductions reported elsewhere.</p>",
