Only 34 (6.9%) of the fish were over 6 inches in length with 7 (1.7%) over 7 inches long.  Black crappie were present in very low numbers.  Northern pike were the most abundant predator, with most fish between 22 and 28 inches long.  Largemouth bass appear to be abundant, although the species does not catch well in gill or trap nets.  Yellow bullhead were present in moderate numbers with fish up to 14 inches long.  A few black bullhead and one white sucker were sampled.</p>",
