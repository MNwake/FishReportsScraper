                "narrative": "<p>IN JULY 1988 A POPULATION ASSESSMENT TOOK PLACE ON UPPER PINE LAKE. FIVE GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAP- NETS WERE SET TO OBTAIN DATA OF THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION. OF THE FOUR TRAPNETS USED, ONE WAS ELIMINATED FROM THE SURVEY DUE TO EXCESSIVE MUSKRAT HOLES. SHLORELINE SEINING EFFORTS WERE CONDUCTED IN AUGUST TO EVALUATE NATURAL REPRODUC- TION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POPULATION ASSESSMENT BASED ON RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH SHOWED LITTLE CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS SUR- VEY IN 1983. BOTH CATCHES REMAIN ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN NET CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBU- TION RANGED FROM 14.0 TO 23.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 18.0 - 18.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.39 POUNDS. THIS WAS NOTICEABLY LOWER TO THE MEAN WEIGHTS OF THE 1978 AND 1983 SURVEYS, WHERE THE MEAN WEIGHTS WERE 3.83 AND 2.88 POUNDS, WITH MEDIAN  LENGTH GROUPS OF 20.0 - 20.9 AND 21.0 - 21.9 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT 74% OF THE FISH AGED IN 1988 WERE OF AGES III AND IV, AS COMPARED TO 83% OF THE 1983 SAMPLE BEING OF AGE IV AND V. THIS CAN PERHAPS EXPLAIN WHY THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP AND MEAN WEIGHT APPEAR TO BE LOWER FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE WALLEYE REMAINS AT A VERY LOW NET CATCH RATE WHEN COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN. SHOAL WATERS OF UPPER PINE LAKE INDICATE A LIKELIHOOD OF SOME SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION, HOWEVER; MIGRA- TION IS PROBABLE VIA THE PINE CREEK OUTLET. AN ANY RATE, THE PRESENCE OF WALLEYE HAS BEEN NOTED IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND BY LOCAL FISHERMEN. LAST WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING WAS IN 1978 AND 1974. YELLOW PERCH HAVE EXHIBITED A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND REMAINS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBERS BY TEST NET GEAR. ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS TAKEN IN GILLNETS AND NONE WERE CAPTURED IN THE TRAPNETS. THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RECORDED IN LOW NUMBERS WHEN ASSESSED BY SURVEY TEST NETS. FOUR SHORELINE SEINE HAULS IN AUGUST FOUND TWELVE YOUNG-OF-YEAR IN A 0.40 ACR E AREA. THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCH DROPPED BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 4.5 TO 4.9 INCHES. IN THE PAST TWO SURVEYS, 1983 AND 1978, THE NET CATCHES WERE ABOVE THE LOCALMEDIAN AT 36.00/SET AND 34.33/SET RESPECTIVELY. BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE DECLINED SOMEWHAT FROM THE TRAPNETS OF 1983, FROM 4.80/SET TO 7.20/SET. PRESENTLY, THEIR MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP HAS CHANGED FROM 1983. THE PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH AND BROWN BULLHEAD WERE ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCHES. THE ABUNDANCE OF PUMPKINSEEDS MAY BE CONTENDING WITH THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN FOR THE DECREASE IN THE BLUEGILL MEDIAN LENGTH. BROWN BULLHEADS, HOW- EVER, HAVE HAD UP AND DOWN POPULATIONS SINCE THE 1973 SURVEY. OTHER SPECIES TAKEN IN TEST NETS (GOLDEN SHINER, WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULLHEAD, AND YELLOW BULLHEAD) DO NOT APPEAR TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE OR BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS NOR TO HAVE UNDERGONE ANY NOTEWORTHY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS.</p>",

Standard netting and electrofishing procedures were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Upper Pine Lake is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  All fish species present are self-sustaining, except walleye which were last stocked in 1978.Northern pike abundance was normal for this lake type with fish up to 30 inches captured.  The average size was 22.0 inches  weighing about 2.5 pounds.  These fish were 4 and 5 years old.  Northern pike were once stocked on an infrequent basis, but netting records show that this lake does quite well providing its own offspring.Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing during the spring.  Their abundance was fair with fish captured up to 18.0 inches and the average being 15.0 inches.  Mean weight was 1.6 pounds.  Ages ranged from 3 to 8 years old.The bluegill abundance was higher than what would be expected for a lake of this type.  Although fish up to 9.5 inches were sampled, the average size was 5.3 inches.  Fish were plentiful in the 5.0-6.5 inch range.  Similar findings were revealled in the past 3 surveys (1978-1988).The black crappie abundance has remained at normal levels with most being in the 7.0 to 8.5 inch range.  Fish up to 10.0 inches were sampled.Yellow perch abundance were sampled at normal levels for a lake of this type.  They were all in the 5.0 to 6.5 inch range.  Perch act as a good forage base for the northern pike in this lake.  Few fish reach to over 9 inches.The remainder of the fish population consisted of pumpkinseeds, bullheads, and white suckers.  Their abundance levels were typical of normal for this lake type.  No walleyes were captured during test netting procedures.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Pine Lake (lake class 39), located in Pine County, is a shallow (max. depth = 15') 210 acre lake that is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass with bluegill sunfish and black crappie as the secondary species.According to historical records, Upper Pine Lake has been included in winter oxygen monitoring efforts since the 1960's.  Partial winterkills were recorded in 1986, 1996, and 1997.  Because largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie were not sampled during the Spring of 1997 winterkill evalutation, these species were scheduled for stocking in May and June of 1997.  A total of 100 pre-spawn bluegill and 40 pre-spawn black crappie were stocked in May followed by stocking of pre-spawn largemouth bass, 45 total, in June.  In addition, because of the rapid growth potenial and low competition associated with winterkills, 210,000 walleye fry were also stocked in May of 1997 and 1998.  Historical records indicate that past management has consisted primarily of sporatic stocking of fish species such as; northern pike and walleye from 1960 to 1983 and northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill before 1960.To determine the present status of the fish population in Upper Pine Lake a population assessment was conducted during the week of July 14, 1998.  Sampling gear consisted of night electrofishing, five gill nets, nine trap nets, and four shoreline seine hauls.The abundance of northern pike along with average weight was found to be typical of normal for a lake of this type.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 13.5 to 27.7 inches with an average length of 19.4 inches.  Growth rates were determined to be normal when compared to statewide averages.Walleye numbers were within the normal range with lengths ranging from 9.3 to 11.1 inches.  The average length was calculated to be 10.3 inches.  Of the 13 walleye aged, 100% of the sample were 1 year old.  Because previous records indicate that walleye have not been stocked or sampled since 1978 and 1988, respectively, the one year old fish sampled were composed entirely of walleye that oringinated from the spring fry stocking in May of 1997.  Above average growth was determined when compared to statewide averages.  In addition to the walleye sampled during summer netting, approximately 150 7-9 inch walleye were observed during spring electrofishing.Spring electrofishing was conducted on May 28, 1998 to assess the largemouth bass population in Upper Pine Lake.  Only two bass were sampled with their lengths at 11.6 and 13.1 inches.  Largemouth growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.The 1998 bluegill abundance and size were calculated to be at a normal level for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.Black crappie numbers were found to be below normal.  The one fish captured was 8.2 inches in length.Abundance of yellow perch was slightly below normal for this type of lake while the average weight was within a normal range.  Total lengths of captured perch ranged from 5.6 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.Evaluation of natural reproduction was conducted on August 28, 1998 using shoreline seining.  Bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass reproduction success was very successful with their average lengths at 1.5 and 2.3 inches, respectively.  Pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch showed some success and no age 0 black crappie were sampled.During the 1998 population assessment, six additional species made up the fish composition in Upper Pine Lake (white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, black and yellow bullhead, emerald shiner, and Johnny darter).  The abundance of pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and black bullhead were found to be at a normal level while yellow bullhead were below nomal in numbers.</p>",

Located 4 miles west of Finlayson in west central Pine County, the lake has a state administered, public access on its north-end.  Although the recovery from the severe fish kill in the winter of 1996-97 was considered complete, the fish population has changed since the 2003 assessment.  Walleye and yellow perch are no longer abundant.  Largemouth bass catch rate also decreased.  Northern pike numbers have remained stable with an increase in size quality.  Bluegill and black crappie are still in normal abundance for lakes similar to Upper Pine.  Bluegill and crappie size structure is satisfactory with one-fourth the bluegill and one-half the crappie catch reaching sizes acceptable to most anglers.  </p>",

Located 4 miles west of Finlayson in west central Pine County, the lake has a state administered, public access on its north end.  The Upper Pine fishery has recovered well after a severe fish kill in the winter of 1996-97.  Anglers can expect an established population of acceptable sized walleye and a similar abundance of northerns.  All walleye year classes correspond to the fry stockings that occured from 1997 through 2000.  Bluegill and black crappie are not as abundant as in the nearby North and South Big Pine lakes but are also of acceptable size.  Yellow perch are neither abundant nor large and serve more as a forage species in Upper Pine Lake.  Largemouth bass are readily available with an averages exceeding 12 inches and 1 pound.  Fall shoreline seining found reproduction of perch, northerns, bass, and bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Pine is a 210 acre lake with a rock dam at its outlet that maintains the water level at a 15 foot maximum.  Located four miles west of Finlayson in west central Pine County, the lake has a state administered, public access on its north end.  The lake's fishery has changed since a severe fish kill in the winter of 1996-97.  The Walleye population is now comprised of a few large fish after peaking in abundance in the years immediately following the post winterkill restocking efforts.  Yellow Perch are still less abundant when compared to the pre-winterkill numbers.  Both Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike have increased in abundance and average size since the 2008 assessment.   Bluegill and Black Crappie are still in normal abundance for lakes similar to Upper Pine and have increased in each assessment since the winterkill.  Bluegill and crappie size structure is satisfactory with sizes acceptable to most anglers.  Bass and Northern Pike should also provide angling interest.  Most Largemouth Bass exceeded 12 inches and half the Northern Pike were 22 inches or better.</p>",
