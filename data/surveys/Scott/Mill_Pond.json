Bluegill abundance is considered within normal levels for this type of lake. The average length of bluegills was 5.6 inches. Both species have been stocked into Jordan Mill Pond since the late 1050's.White crappies were captured in normal numbers and averaged 8.1 inches in length. One golden shiner, one hybrid sunfish, and two yellow perch were also sampled.One walleye and two northern pike were sampled in the trapnets. The walleye measured 22.6 inches in length, and the northern pike measured 30.6 and 31.7 inches respectively. These fish most likely were a result of illegal stocking. Local residents reported that individuals have stocked fish from Sand Creek into Jordan Mill Pond.</p>",

It is stocked annually with bluegill sunfish, black crappies and largemouth bass.  This is the first survey completed on the Mill Pond since 1996.  <br> \n <br> \nThe City of Jordan dredged the Mill Pond to remove accumulated sediments.  They also partnered with the Fish Lake Sportsman's Club and FiN to install a fishing pier in 2009.  A shoreland buffer was added to the east shoreline as well. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish and black crappies were the most abundant species captured during this survey.  Bluegills abundance was on the lower end for this type of lake.  Lengths of bluegills ranged from 3.1 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 4.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies ranged in size from 6.3 to 8.7 inches in length with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Trap net abundance was relatively high for this type of lake. <br> \n <br> \nOne northern pike was captured in a gill net during this survey. It weighed 5.1 pounds and measured 28.4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough electrofishing is the ideal way to sample largemouth bass, there were still a significant number captured during the survey.  Abundance was high for this type of lake.  Length of largemouth bass ranged from 5.2 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 5.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThree walleyes were captured in trap nets.  Walleyes ranged in length from 16.7 to 18.7 inches with an average length of 17.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during this survey included black bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Four painted turtles were also captured. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Some Mill Pond shoreline is in the city's Lagoon Park; the pond outlets into Sand Creek. This pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001. It is stocked annually, or as needed, with Bluegill sunfish, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. Several other non-stocked fishes, including gamefish species, have been previously sampled and reported. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey was conducted in 2016 to collect information about the fish community and water characteristics. The most abundant species sampled was Bluegill, which had a trap net abundance of 193 per net. Lengths of Bluegills ranged from 3.4-7.5 inches with a mean length of 5.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies ranged in size from 5.3-9.3 inches in length with an average length of 7.2 inches. Trap net abundance was relatively high for this type of lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFour Walleyes were captured in a gill net during this survey, despite no planned or privately permitted stocking. Walleyes ranged in size from 17.9-24.4 inches, with and average length of 20.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Northern Pike were captured in the single gill net during this survey. The two Northern Pike were 23.4 and 24.8 inches long and averaged 3.4 pounds. Two Northern Pike were also captured in trap nets. The two Northern Pike captured in trap nets were 26.3 and 33.6 inches in length and averaged 6.2 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during this survey included Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin.  <br> \n</p>",
