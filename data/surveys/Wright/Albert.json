Age group 2 is dominant. Growth is fast for young fish and a limited sample of older fish suggests that growth is average. A small Largemouth Bass sample comprised entirely of age 2 fish shows average growth. The Bluegill population is three times the area average. This is up substantially from 8.7/trap net in 1973. Age classes 1 and 4 are well-represented with age 4 dominating. Growth is average. Black Crappie abundance is one hundred times the local median. This is a dramatic increase from 35.3/trapnet in 1973. Age classes 2 and 3 comprise almost the entire sample. Growth is average. The Black Bullhead population is high compared to the local average, but the size of individual fish is small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Albert Lake is a natural environment lake with small size (53 acres) and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  An initial fisheries survey was done in 1973 with a resurvey in 1983, and population assessment in 1989.  Land for a public access has been acquired but not developed by the Parks and Trails Division. This was the first full lake survey since 1983. <br> \n <br> \nProblems with degraded water quality and the abundance of pollution tolerant species like common carp were noted immediately.  The water clarity was slightly better than one foot in late June.   Most Wright County lakes maintain good clarity through June.  Total phosphorous concentrations were 0.103 ppm, a level that will result in nuisance algal blooms as the water warms.  Only one submersed vegetation species was noted, Sago Pondweed, and grew out to less than one foot in depth.  Concentrations of carp were observed in the shallows in May.  The gill net catch of carp was five times higher than the expected range.  Average size of carp was small suggesting a growing population.  Catches of panfish have varied widely likely due to instability in the fishery.  Yet Albert Lake does not appear to winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect fair fishing for largemouth bass and panfish.  Northern pike, while rare in the survey were above average in size, 25 inches and four pounds. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 27 largemouth bass were collected during day-time electrofishing on 5/9/09.  Largemouth ranged in length from 7 - 18 inches with an average length of 14 inches.   <br> \nBluegill (13.8/trap net) were within the range of expected values but average length was small, five inches.    Bluegill abundance has varied widely ranging from 56.0/trap (1983) to 2.5/trap (1989). <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie (14.8/trap net) was within the range of expected values for the lake class.  Black crappie were small, 6.7 inches, and weighed less than 0.2 pounds.  Like bluegill, the catch of crappies has varied considerably: 405.3/trap (1983), 67.8/trap (1983). <br> \n <br> \nA total of six walleye were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Walleye ranged in length from 19 - 26 inches. No walleye have been sampled in previous assessments, and no stocking is known to have occurred. Two walleyes approximately 20 inches in length were determined to be seven years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads (12.2/trap net, 40/gill net) were abundant though still within the range of expected values.  Black bullheads were small.   Average length and weight were 6.5 inches and 0.26 pounds.</p>",

Bluegill abundance decreased from 1983, when 56.0 per trap net were captured, and was well below the statewide and local medians. Growth of Bluegills was good. Black Crappie abundance remained high and the population was dominated by 7.5-8.9 inch length groups. Shoreline seining efforts captured 108 young-of-year Largemouth Bass. No forage species were collected in the seine. Black Bullhead abundance remained high. The modal length increment was 8.5-9.0 inches. Common Carp and Brown Bullheads were sampled in low numbers.</p>",
