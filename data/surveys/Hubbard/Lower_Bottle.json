A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 10 and 12, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and five sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at five sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 14 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mimic Shiner, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 6, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Lower Bottle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Lower Bottle Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is a 652-acre, hard-water lake located six miles north of Dorset, Minnesota.  It has a maximum depth of 110 feet with oxygen available during much of the year to the bottom.  About 25% of the surface area has emergent aquatic vegetation which includes wild rice, hardstem bulrush, and cattail.  Shoal water soils are mainly sand, marl, and gravel.  The shoreline is fairly well developed with five resorts and 30 private homes and cottages present.  There were 27 privately owned boats and 43 resorts located around the shoreline.The lengths of walleyes taken during test netting ranged from 8.5 to 21.9 inches and were taken in numbers about double the regional median catch per set.  There has been no walleye stocking since 1952 so this indicates very good natural reproduction within this lake.Besides being a good fishing lake it also maintains some good duck hunting each fall.  Mallard and ringneck ducks are taken most commonly.There is no public access on this lake at the present time.Fish Stocking:From 1915 to 1945 the two Bottle Lakes together received bass, walleyes, crappies, sunfish, muskies, and northern pike at various time.  Since that time the stocking record for Lower Bottle Lake is as follows:Year    Species  Size      Amount1946    Walleye fingerling       8,3601947    Walleye fingerling       4,3681947    Northern pike fingerling         8601948    Northern pike fingerling       4,0001948    Largemouth bass fingerling       6,2401948    Walleye fingerling      22,2481949    Walleye fingerling      35,0001951    Walleye fingerling      18,0001952    Walleye fingerling      19,8001956    Muskellunge fingerling         56Special Regulations:Closed to fishing in posted spawning beds from 1944 to 1953, 1955 to 1960, and 1962.

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 4 miles north of Dorset. Lower Bottle is separated by a narrows from Upper Bottle, but both lakes have a similar fish community and are generally managed together.  Lower Bottle has a surface area of 641 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet. A DNR public access is located on the North Shore of Upper Bottle Lake, and navigation is through a channel between the lakes. Boating access is also available by small boats through the shallow river connecting Emma Lake to the south.  Lower Bottle provides multi species opportunities to anglers, with good populations of walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Lower Bottle is in Lake Class 22. Class 22 lakes are generally very large, very deep, clear, hard water lakes, with very irregularly shaped shoreline and low littoral zone. Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2013 was the highest ever recorded, and well above management goals. Multiple year classes of walleye were sampled with most walleye in the 12 to 16 inch range.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in moderate numbers for this Lake Class. Yellow perch were small in size, with very few perch of acceptable size for angling.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Lower Bottle.  Northern pike sampled in 2013 had an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 33 inches.  While not known as a panfish lake, Lower Bottle does provide angling opportunities for black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed. Anglers can expect to find low numbers of black crappie over 9 inches. Bluegill abundance was low compared to other similar lakes. Anglers will find most bluegill in the 5-8 inch size range.  Lower bottle has both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass, with low numbers sampled for both species. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Bottle. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, four miles north of Dorset.  Lower Bottle Lake has a surface area of 641 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the north shore of Upper Bottle Lake.  Boats can navigate to Lower Bottle Lake through a channel between the lakes.  Boating access is also available to the Bottle Lakes by small boats through the shallow river connecting Emma Lake to the south.  Lower Bottle Lake provides multi species opportunities to anglers for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lower Bottle Lake is in Lake Class 22.  Class 22 lakes are generally very large, very deep, clear, hard water lakes, with very irregularly shaped shoreline and low littoral zone.  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes catch rates were in line with past samples, but below the historic high in 2013.  Most Walleye were in the 14 to 17-inch size range, with fish sampled up to 24 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in very low numbers.  Yellow Perch were small, with very few perch an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in Lower Bottle Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 39 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLower Bottle Lake provides angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed, but in relatively low numbers.  Lower Bottle Lake has both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass present.  Bass abundance was in line with past samples, and they were an average size of 14 inches for Largemouth Bass and 15 inches for Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Bottle Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is located eleven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Lower Bottle has a surface area of 652 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  Lower Bottle is connected to Upper Bottle Lake and is easily navigated with a boat.  Lower and Upper Bottle are actually one body of water and share the same fish population.  Lower and Upper Bottle have a combined acreage of 1,117 acres.  There is a public access on the north shore of Upper Bottle.  The outlet of Lower Bottle flows into Emma Lake and boating access between the two lakes is limited to smaller boats.  Lower Bottle is well known for it's walleye fishery, but also provides angling for northern pike and black crappie as well as a bonus largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower Bottle is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato.Walleye were sampled in good numbers (10.7 walleye/gillnet) and near the management goal of 12.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have shown Lower Bottle to have an abundant walleye population with gillnet catch rates above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled walleyes had an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Lower Bottle has a good forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) which was reflected in good growth rates for this area.  Lower Bottle has excellent water quality and walleye spawning habitat.  The walleye population in Lower Bottle is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and fingerling stocking.  Lower Bottle is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Anglers will find good northern pike fishing in Lower Bottle, however the population is dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Lower Bottle has the characteristics to produce large pike, however, the number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Lower Bottle has both largemouth and smallmouth bass populations, but provides more of a quality than quantity bass fishery.  Present and past surveys have sampled bass at low to moderate levels when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers have reported catching some big largemouth and smallmouth bass in recent years.  The panfish fishery in Lower Bottle is known mainly for black crappie.  Like bass, the black crappie fishery is known more for size than numbers.  Bluegill abundance was up (19.5 bluegill/net), with trapnet catch rates within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have sampled bluegill in low numbers.  Average size of bluegill was 6.2 inches, however, anglers will find good numbers of 7-8 inch bluegill.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white suckers, and low numbers of brown bullhead and common shiner.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is located eleven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Lower Bottle has a surface area of 652 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  Lower  Bottle is connected to Upper Bottle Lake.  They are really one lake and if you combine Upper and Lower Bottle they total 1,117 acres.  There is a public access located on the northeast shore of Upper Bottle.  The outlet of Lower Bottle flows into Lake Emma and boating access between the two lakes is limited to small boats.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower Bottle is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato.  Lower Bottle is best known for its walleye fishery, but also provides fishing for northern pike with a bonus smallmouth and largemouth bass population.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (14.1/gillnet), well above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The walleye catch rate was lower in 1993 (6.6/gillnet), while historical surveys have shown walleye abundance similar to the 1998 survey.  Walleyes had an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.0 pound.  Lower Bottle has a plentiful forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) which was reflected in good walleye growth rates for this area.  Strong 1994 and 1995 year classes (13 to 16 inches) accounted for over half of the walleyes sampled.  These were years when no walleye were stocked.  Natural reproduction of walleye appears to be contributing to the population as 79% of the sample (77 fish) were from non-stocked years. Lower Bottle has excellent water quality and walleye spawning habitat.  Fall electrofishing also documented good walleye natural reproduction.  Forty-five walleye from the 1998 year class were sampled (28.9 fish/hour).  Lower Bottle was stocked with walleye  fingerlings in odd years until 1993, then switched to even years starting in 1996 to correspond with other walleye stockings in this chain of lakes.Northern pike were sampled within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that northern pike have fluctuated from low to high abundance.  Size of northern pike was small, averaging 19.7 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Larger pike are present, however, with fish measured up to 32.4 inches.  The 1995 and 1996 years classes dominated the catch accounting for over 80% of the sample.Lower Bottle has both a smallmouth and largemouth bass population, but provides more of a quality than quantity bass fishery.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and catch rates for both species were surprisingly low (0.6 largemouth bass/hour & 1.7 smallmouth bass/hour).  Smallmouth bass up to 19.4 inches were sampled.  Anglers reported catching big smallmouth bass during the fall of 1998.The panfish fishery in Lower Bottle is limited mainly to black crappie.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Like bass, the black crappie fishery is known more for size than numbers.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was low.  Lower Bottle has an abundant rock bass population.Other species sampled include white sucker, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Lower Bottle and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle Lake is located four miles north of Dorset in southern Hubbard County.  Lower Bottle is separated by a narrows from Upper Bottle, both lakes having similar fish communities and are generally managed together.  Lower Bottle has a surface area of 641 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore of Upper Bottle Lake, and navigation is through the channel between the lakes.  Boating access is also available by small boats through the shallow river connecting to Emma Lake to the south.  Lower Bottle provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lower Bottle is in lake class 22.  Class 22 lakes are generally very large, very deep, hard water lakes, with very irregularly shaped shorelines, and a low littoral zone (lake area less than 15 feet deep).  Other class 22 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance remained strong in Lower Bottle with gill net catch rates similar to past surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 22.8 inches with an average length of 14.1 inches.  Good numbers of smaller Walleye (8-12 inches) were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow Perch were small in size with fish measured up to 7.1 inches.   <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant Northern Pike population in Lower Bottle.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.6 pounds with fish measured up to 34.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a bass - panfish lake, Lower Bottle does provide angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  Present and past surveys have shown the population of these species to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Rock Bass and White Sucker and low numbers of Brown Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nFaucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Bottle.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of the walleyes sampled was 1.4 pounds, and 51% were in the 15 to 23 inch length range.  Natural reproduction is contributing to the population as 32% of the aged walleyes were from non-stocked year classes.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to similar lakes.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 1993 was 21.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass and black crappies have not been efficiently sampled enough with standard survey nets to assess their abundance and size structures.  The bluegill trapnet catch indicated a population approching low density for lakes with the physical and chemical characteristics of Lower Bottle Lake.  The bluegill size structure is small; no bluegills over 8 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch are abundant in Lower Bottle Lake and provide both an excellent forage base for walleyes and northern pike and a good fishery of their own.  Forty-seven percent of the yellow perch measured were over 8 inches, and fish up to 12 inches were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Bottle is located eleven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Lower Bottle has a surface area of 652 acres and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  Lower Bottle is connected to Upper Bottle Lake and is easily navigated with a boat.  Lower and Upper Bottle Lakes are actually one body of water and share the same fish population.  Lower and Upper Bottle have a combined acreage of 1,117 acres.  There is a public access on the north shore of Upper Bottle Lake.  The outlet of Lower Bottle flows into Emma Lake and boating between the two lakes is limited to smaller boats.  Lower Bottle is well known for it's walleye fishery, but also provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and largemouth and smallmouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower Bottle is in lake class 22.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Sand, Kabekona, Long, and Potato. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (16.7 walleye/gillnet) was above the current management goal (12.0 walleye/gillnet) and the highest gillnet catch rate for all surveys dating back to 1962.  Past surveys have shown Lower Bottle to have an abundant walleye population, with gillnet catch rates above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.7 pounds, with walleye measured up to 27.9 inches.  Lower Bottle supports a good forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco), which was reflected in good walleye growth rates for this area.  Lower Bottle has excellent water quality and walleye spawning habitat.  The walleye population in Lower Bottle is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and fingerling stoking by the DNR.  Lower Bottle is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Anglers will find good northern pike fishing in Lower Bottle; however, small, \"hammer handle\" pike dominated the sample.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.5 inches.  Lower Bottle has the forage base of tullibee (cisco) and white sucker to produce large pike, but the number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Lower Bottle has both largemouth and smallmouth bass populations, but provides more of a quality than quantity bass fishery.  Present and past surveys have sampled bass at low to moderate levels when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers have reported catching some big largemouth and smallmouth bass in recent years.  Like bass, the black crappie fishery is known more for size than numbers.  Black crappie up to 14.1 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance (8.9 bluegill/trapnet) was at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has fluctuated, but has generally been sampled in low numbers.  Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and low numbers of common shiner. <br> \n</p>",
