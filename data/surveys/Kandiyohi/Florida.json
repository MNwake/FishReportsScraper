                "narrative": "<p>Florida is a moderate size lake (674 acres) with a maximum depth of 40 feet. Emergent vegetation (reed canary grass, common cattail) is very sparse around the lake. Submergent vegetation is also sparse throughout the lake with exception of the southeast bay area where sago and curled pondweed are often abundant. Analysis of the water quality indicates that Florida has moderate to low fertility (Total phosphorus=0.022 ppm 6-18-91). Nutrient inputs enter the lake from the surrounding watershed via inlets (Shakopee Creek), ditches, and tile due mainly to agricultural runoff (feedlots, drainage of cultivated land, pasture). There are several large marsh complexes connected to Florida located along the west and south shorelines. The immediate shoreline is primarily mixed hardwoods on gradual slopes. Primary species management has occurred in the past for walleye and northern pike. The most recent (1992) Lake Management Plan long range goals were to reduce black bullhead catch rate below 10 fish/gillnet, achieve a northern pike catch rate between 6.5 and 10.5 fish/gillnet with a PSD above 50 and RSD-P to 10, reduce carp catch rate below 0.5 fish/gillnet, maintain walleye catch rate between 2.5 and 7.5 fish/gillnet with a PSD above 50 and RSD-P above 15, maintain a yellow perch catch rate above 15 fish/gillnet. Since 1989, walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year (473 - 535 lbs per year). In years prior to 1986, walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked at various rates. Winter rescue northern pike have been stocked throughout the years, especially during the early 1980's. A major source of winter rescue northern pike has been the nearby Florida Slough area connected to the southwest portion of Florida Lake. A fixed crest dam is located between Florida Slough and Florida Lake. A northern pike spawning area has been operated sporadically on the east side of the lake. The use of this spawning area may be precluded due to problems resulting from possible increases in the water table at adjacent low lying residential homes during use.     Walleye catch rate in 1993 (9.2 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.3 - 5.7 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but similar to the historical average (11.4 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1993 (2.0 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (1.6 lbs). About 59% of the fish captured were greater than 15 inches. Growth rates appear to be slightly above average compared to other local lakes. The present walleye density, average size, and population size structure appear optimal for Florida.     Northern pike catch rate in 1993 (1.2 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.5 - 10.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (3.0 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1993 (2.6 lbs) was above the historical average (2.0 lbs). Growth rates appear average to good compared to other local lakes. The highest recorded density of northern pike occurred in 1983 (11.5 fish/gillnet), however the average size was only 1.5 lbs. Natural reproduction has been poor in recent years due to erratic spring water levels.     Yellow perch abundance in 1993 (67.7 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (3.7 - 39.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (41.6 fish/gillnet). The highest recorded catch rate (83.8 fish/gillnet) was in 1983. The average size in 1993 (0.1 lbs) was slightly below the historical average (0.2 lbs). The average length was 6.5 inches in 1993. Growth rates appear good compared to local lakes.     Bluegill catch rate in 1993 (8.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (6.0 - 49.6 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (17.0 fish/trapnet). Bluegill average length was only 4.5 inches. Growth appears below average compared to other local lakes. The best bluegill average size and optimal density (average size=0.2 lbs, 18.9 fish/trapnet) occurred in 1987.     Black crappie catch rates in 1993 (0.0 fish/trapnet, 0.2 fish/gillnet) were below the historical averages (6.6 fish/trapnet, 0.9 fish/gillnet). Black crappie catch rate in 1993 was also below the normal range (0.8 - 3.4 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. Black crappie densities have been poor in many area lakes in recent years. Among other factors, lack of suitable habitat (bulrush) may be also limiting crappie populations in Florida.     Freshwater drum abundance in 1993 (6.7 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (5.5 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size (1.7 lbs) was also above the historical average (1.1 lbs). Freshwater drum present in the Shakopee Creek subwatershed are under utilized by anglers. Presently, there is no local commercial market for freshwater drum.     Black bullhead abundance in 1993 (2.9 fish/trapnet, 2.7 fish/gillnet) were below the historical averages (15.7 fish/trapnet, 34.8 fish/gillnet). Black bullhead abundance in 1993 was within the normal range (0.8 - 7.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The 1993 average size caught from gillnets (0.5 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (0.4 lbs). Declines in black bullhead abundance have also been apparent in other local lakes in recent years. Commercial fishermen removed 900 lbs in 1993, 3,500 lbs in 1992, and 7,200 lbs in 1991.     Yellow bullhead abundance in 1993 (0.3 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.3 - 10.0 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (2.8 fish/trapnet). The average size in 1993 (1.2 lbs) was above the historical average (0.6 lbs.). The highest abundance of yellow bullhead was documented in 1987 (6.4 fish/trapnet, average size=0.4 lbs).     Carp catch rate in 1993 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (2.1 fish/trapnet). The 1993 average size (6.0 lbs) was above the historical average (4.6 lbs). The highest carp catch rate was documented in 1957 (9.8 fish/trapnet). Commercial fishermen removed 19,400 lbs in 1991 and 400 lbs in 1986. Presently, the carp population does not appear to be a problem in Florida.     Management options for Florida should include increasing habitat (planting bulrush) for black crappie, working with area landowners to reduce nutrient inputs, increasing the northern pike density through winter rescue stocking and the operation of the northern pike spawning area when feasible, maintaining the walleye population through stocking, and maintaining a healthy yellow perch forage base for both walleye and northern pike. Commercial fishermen should be encouraged to continue black bullhead, carp and also freshwater drum removal operations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Florida is a moderate size lake (674 acres) of which the littoral area encompasses 40%of the total surface area. The maximum depth is 40 feet. Emergent vegetation (reed canarygrass, common cattail) is very sparse around the lake. Submergent vegetation is also sparsethroughout the lake with exception of the southeast bay area where sago and curled pondweedare often abundant. Analysis of the water quality indicates that Florida has moderate to lowfertility (Total phosphorus=0.022 ppm 6-18-91). The secchi disk reading on 7-22-96 was 6.0feet. Nutrient inputs enter the lake from the surrounding watershed via inlets (ShakopeeCreek via Florida Sloughs), ditches, and tiles due mainly to agricultural runoff (feedlots,drainage of cultivated land, pasture). There are several large marsh complexes (FloridaSloughs) connected to Florida located along the west and south shorelines. The immediatewatershed is primarily agricultural (40%) in addition to marshes (20%), grasslands (20%),mixed hardwoods (10%), and residential lake lots (10%). The immediate shoreline is primarilymixed hardwoods on gradual slopes. Primary species management has occurred in the past forwalleye and northern pike with secondary species management for largemouth bass, bluegill,and yellow perch. In 1995, there were 1,279 lbs of walleye fingerlings stocked into Florida.Walleye fingerlings were stocked every other year at 2 lbs/littoral acre (about 534 lbs) from1989-1993. In years prior to 1986, walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked at various rates.Winter rescue northern pike have been stocked throughout the years, especially during theearly 1980's. A major source of winter rescue northern pike has been the nearby FloridaSlough area that connects to the southwest portion of Florida Lake. A fixed crest dam islocated between Florida Slough and Florida Lake. The Florida Slough connection acts as aninlet when high water conditions exist upstream on Shakopee Creek. However, water may flowfrom Lake Florida into the sloughs during low water conditions within the Shakopee Creek. Inrecent years, there have been few winter rescue northern pike available due to poor naturalreproduction during the drought years of the late 1980's and erratic spring water levels inthe early 1990's. A northern pike spawning area had been operated sporadically on the eastside (adjacent to Dickerson's Resort) of the lake. The operation of this spawning area hasbeen discontinued due to problems from the water table rising and causing water to enteradjacent low lying residential homes. However, fish may still naturally move into the marsharea to spawn without water level manipulation. A new \"Florida\" northern pike spawning areaupstream of an inlet marsh area (north side of lake) has been used since 1995. Commercialharvest of bullhead and carp have occurred on Florida since 1925. Commercial fishermenremoved 29,650 lbs of bullhead and 19,400 lbs of carp from 1986-1991. In 1996, commercialfishermen removed 100 lbs of buffalo fish and 1,700 lbs of carp.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (14.0 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and above the historicalaverage (11.8 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (2.3 lbs from gillnets) was above thehistorical average (1.6 lbs). The largest walleye captured was 28.1 inches. The 1996 PSD andRSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 80.6 and 30.6 respectively. The catch rate ofquality size walleye (> 15 inches) was the highest recorded value (10.0 fish/net, gillnetsand trapnets combined) in 1996 (historical average=4.6 fish/net). Growth rates appear averagecompared to other local lakes. About 58% of the walleye captured belonged to year classes inwhich fingerling stocking occurred. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 1995 todetermine walleye young of year abundance due to natural reproduction, however no fish werecaptured in the survey. There is some walleye natural reproduction occurring in Florida basedon scale aging from the 1996 summer survey, however successful natural reproduction isprobably sporadic within Florida. Local anglers have reported limited success fishing forwalleye in Florida even though fish are abundant within the lake. Local sources indicate thebest success for walleye angling usually occurs during the first few hours preceding sunrise.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (6.6 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but above the historicalaverage (3.4 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (21.6 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was above the historical average (20.4 inches). The largest northern pike capturedwas 34.2 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 51.4 and 5.7respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to other local lakes. About 37% of thefish captured in the 1996 survey belonged to the 1993 year class. There were 4.1 young ofyear northern pike caught per hour during a fall night electrofishing survey in 1995. Thereappears to be adequate spawning and rearing marshes (Florida Sloughs, Florida NPSA, DickersonSlough) adjacent to Lake Florida for producing northern pike.     Largemouth bass abundance in the 1996 spring electrofishing survey (15.2 fish/hour) wasbelow the local area median (25.9 fish/hour). Largemouth bass abundance in a 1991 springelectrofishing survey was 9.6 fish/hour. The 1996 spring average size (1.3 lbs) was slightlyabove the local area mean (1.1 lbs). The largest bass captured was 19.4 inches. The 1996spring PSD and RSD-P was 41.2 and 29.4 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared toother local lakes. About 37% of the fish captured during the spring electrofishing surveybelonged to the 1993 year class.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (55.5 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (4.4 - 49.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and above the historicalaverage (21.8 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (4.0 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was below the historical average (5.4 inches). The largest bluegill captured in the1996 survey was 6.5 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 0.7and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear slightly below average for ages V-VI. About 55% ofthe fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (45.4 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and similar to thehistorical average (42.1 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.5 inches from gillnets andtrapnets combined) was slightly below the historical average (6.8 inches). The largest yellowperch captured in the 1996 survey was 9.7 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets andtrapnets combined) was 10.8 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to otherlocal lakes. About 47% of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.     There were no black crappie captured in the 1996 survey. The historical average catchrate is 5.8 fish/trapnet. The highest recorded catch rate occurred in 1957 (32.15fish/trapnet, average size=0.5 lbs average from trapnets). The historical average length is8.5 inches for gillnets and trapnets combined.      Freshwater drum \"sheepshead\" abundance in 1996 (16.6 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (2.0 - 9.4 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and the highestrecorded value (historical average=6.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Florida. The 1996 average size(15.6 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was above the historical average (14.5inches). The largest freshwater drum captured in the 1996 survey was 18.9 inches. Freshwaterdrum is an under utilized fish by anglers. It is generally considered an inferior tastingfish by local residents.     Carp abundance in 1996 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.2 - 1.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (1.8 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (19.8 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was slightly above the historical average (18.3 inches).     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (9.0 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.3 - 2.6 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (14.8 fish/trapnet). The 1996 black bullhead average size (7.5 inches from gillnetsand trapnets combined) was below the historical average (9.2 inches). Yellow bullheadabundance in 1996 (0.8 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range(1.2 - 5.2 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historical average (2.6fish/trapnet). The 1996 yellow bullhead average size (9.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was slightly below the historical average (9.8 inches).     Management options for Lake Florida should include increasing habitat (planting bulrush)for black crappie; encouraging catch and release of larger bluegill (> 7 inches) and blackcrappie (> 10 inches); encouraging area landowners to implement best management practices(conservation tillage, wetland restoration, proper feedlot and manure management, plantingbuffer strips, using low/no phosphorus on lawns, replacing dysfunctional septic systems) inorder to improve water quality within the watershed; maintaining the northern pike densitybetween 4.0 - 7.0 fish/gillnet through winter rescue stocking or the operation of thenorthern pike spawning area when feasible; maintaining the walleye population throughfingerling stocking; maintaining a healthy yellow perch forage base for both walleye andnorthern pike. Commercial fishermen should be encouraged to continue black bullhead, carp,and also freshwater drum removal operations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Florida is a moderately deep and sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. The waterquality is generally good throughout the summer months. Nutrient productivity is moderate inFlorida. The water clarity was fair on July 20, 1998. Submergent vegetation densities areusually moderate in Florida, but emergent (i.e hardstem bulrush) stands are sparse and few.Florida is a popular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass.Local residents report the best fishing success for walleye occurs during the early morninghours of the early summer months or during the fall. Walleye natural reproduction is  rareand usually occurs with minimal success. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every odd year intoFlorida. Walleye fingerlings (10,249 fish, 677 lbs.) were last stocked in 1997 by DNR SpicerFisheries personnel. Other fish species stocked by DNR Fisheries personnel in recent yearshave included winter rescue northern pike (500 adults, 500 lbs.) from the connected FloridaSloughs and black crappie (705 adults in 1997) from local brood lakes. The Florida LakeAssociation had 38 black crappie adults and 3,895 fingerlings stocked into Florida by privateaquaculturists during October of 1998.     Walleye were abundant in 1998 (13.40 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historicalaverage (11.93 fish/gillnet). The largest walleye captured in the 1998 survey was 24.5inches. The 1998 walleye average weight was moderate (1.80 lbs., gillnets). The two mostfrequently occurring walleye year classes were from fingerling stockings (38% from 1997, 36%from 1995).     Northern pike were abundant in 1998 (9.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (4.02 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average weight was small (1.90 lbs.,gillnets). The largest northern pike captured during the 1998 survey was 31.3 inches. The1997 northern pike year class comprised 54% of the 1998 northern pike survey catch.     Largemouth bass were abundant in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (32.57 fish/hour)compared to the historical average (19.12 fish/hour). The 1998 spring electrofishinglargemouth bass average weight was good (1.48 lbs.). The largest bass captured during the1998 spring electrofishing survey was 19.9 inches. The 1994 largemouth bass year classcomprised 61.5% of the 1998 spring electrofishing catch.     Bluegill numbers were moderate in 1998 (23.60 fish/trapnet) and similar to thehistorical average (21.99 fish/trapnet). The 1998 bluegill average length was moderate (5.6inches, trapnets). The largest bluegill captured during the 1998 survey was 7.2 inches. The1995 bluegill year class comprised the majority of the 1998 survey.     Other species of interest that were captured in the 1998 survey included abundantnumbers of freshwater drum (13.80 fish/gillnet), moderate numbers of yellow perch (28.40fish/gillnet), and low numbers of black bullhead (6.30 fish/trapnet). The freshwater drumaverage size was moderate (1.87 lbs., gillnets). The yellow perch average size was small (6.2inches, gillnets). The black bullhead average size was moderate (7.3 inches, trapnets).     Florida had good bluegill and largemouth bass fishing in 1998. Walleye fishing successhas been moderate in recent years. Northern pike fishing should be good in the next few yearsdue to the abundant numbers present. Black crappie fishing has been poor since the 1970's dueto the lack of adequate habitat (hardstem bulrush). DNR Spicer Fisheries personneltransplanted hardstem bulrush along the south shore in 1998, it will take several years todetermine if the bulrush planting is a success. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continueto work with local residents regarding water quality issues in Florida and the surroundingwatershed. We will monitor adult fish population numbers every four years by summer testnetting and spring electrofishing, and YOY walleye numbers from natural reproduction by fallnight electrofishing every year walleye fingerlings are scheduled to be stocked in order toevaluate management practices on Florida.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of the fish population was conducted on Lake Florida in July of 2001. Florida is a moderately sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. Florida receives moderate to high recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to a resort, and lakeshore homeowners. There are approximately 217 lakeshore homes and cabins along the Florida shoreline. Water quality and clarity is moderate in the lake. Aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant within the lake. Florida is connected to Shakopee Creek via the Florida Sloughs wetland complex. A concrete fixed crest dam is located at the connection of the lake and the Florida Sloughs. The Florida Sloughs connection can act either as an outlet or inlet depending upon water levels in the Lake Florida or upstream in the Shakopee Creek and Lake Andrew. The Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed which includes Florida and several other upstream connected lakes (Andrew, Henchien, Middle, Games, Norway) is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, feedlots, grasslands, and residential homes. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters group encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Florida for a variety of fish species that include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch. Local anglers reported good angling success for walleye and large bluegill in recent years. The Florida Lake Association has purchased black crappie (3,000 fingerlings in 2001) for stocking Florida in recent years.Black crappie numbers were low in 2001 (1.0 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historical average (0.8 fish/gillnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was small (0.17 lbs. and 5.5 inches from gillnets). Approximately 80% of the black crappie captured in the 2001 summer survey were young fish hatched in 2000. The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 summer survey was 10.7 inches.Bluegill numbers were high in 2001 (87.3 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average (28.5 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.09 lbs. and 4.9 inches from trapnets). There were moderate numbers of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill in the 2001 summer survey (13.2 fish/trapnet) for Florida. Approximately 72% of the bluegill captured in the survey were young fish hatched in 1998. Bluegill growth rates in Florida were below average for fish 4 years old or younger, but above average for fish 5-7 years old compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer survey was 8.1 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were low in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (17.5 fish/hour). The 2001 largemouth bass average size was small (0.56 lbs. and 9.4 inches) from spring electrofishing. Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the previous spring electrofishing survey in 1998 (34.6 fish/hour, 1.48 lbs. average weight). About 94% of the largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey were young fish hatched in 1998 and 1999. Largemouth bass growth rates in Florida were above average for fish 3 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 15.6 inches. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2001 (5.2 fish/gillnet), but slightly above the historical average (4.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was large (3.44 lbs. and 24.0 inches from gillnets). Growth rates for northern pike in Florida were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 summer survey was 36.6 inches. High northern pike fingerling numbers are naturally and frequently produced in the connected Florida Sloughs wetland complex.Walleye numbers were high in 2001 (13.8 fish/gillnet), and slightly above the historical average (12.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.78 lbs. and 15.9 inches from gillnets). The largest walleye captured in the 2001 summer survey was 27.8 inches. Walleye growth rates in Florida were generally above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant during most years in Florida, thus the population is maintained by walleye fingerling stockings.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2001 (9.8 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average (37.5 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size was small (0.15 lbs. and 6.8 inches). The largest yellow perch captured in the 2001 summer survey was 9.1 inches.Other notable fish species captured in the Florida 2001 summer survey included high numbers of freshwater drum (10.0 fish/gillnet), moderate numbers of black bullhead (6.8 fish/gillnet), and low numbers of yellow bullhead (3.0 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 7.9 fish/gillnet for freshwater drum, 28.2 fish/gillnet for black bullhead, and 4.7 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead. Current fish management activities on Florida include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, restoring emergent vegetation (bulrush) through transplanting, participating in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project, and stocking walleye fingerlings every other year. The Florida fishery will be surveyed again in the spring and summer of 2005.</p>",

THE 1991 NOP CATCH INDEX (1.25 PER GN) WAS THE LOWEST SINCE THE 1957 SURVEY.  THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A MEASUREABLE 1990, 1989, OR 1988 NOP YEAR-CLASS (LOW WATER CONDITIONS FOR SPAWNING IN ADJACENT MARSHES).  THE BLC 1991 CATCH INDICES (0 PER TN, 0.50 PER GN) WERE NEAR THE LOWEST RECORDED SINCE THE 1950 SURVEY (0 PER GN IN 1987 SURVEY).  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY RECENT BLC YEAR-CLASSES. THE 1991 BLG CATCH INDEX (32.80 PER TN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES AND WAS THE SECOND HIGHEST EVER RECORDED (37.20 PER TN IN 1978), HOWEVER, THE SIZE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION (AND AVERAGE SIZE) WAS LOWER THAN MOST PREVIOUS SURVEY'S.  MOST OF THE SAMPLED BLG WERE FROM THE 1988 YEAR-CLASS WHICH COULD PROVIDE FISH IN THE 6-7 CONTRIBUTE TO THE '93 FISHERY AT >7.0 INCHES.  THE 1991 YEP CATCH INDEX (39.00 PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES AND WAS NEAR THE HISTORICAL MEAN FOR LAKE FLORIDA (37.5 PER GN).  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (5.75 PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL MEAN SINCE 1978 (5.1 PER GN, THE 1990 AND 1957 INDICES WERE OMITTED BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH VALUES WHICH WAS INFLUENCED BY THE STOCKING PROGRAM). THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE 1991 GN CAUGHT WAE WAS A RESPECTABLE 1.78 POUNDS.  THE 1989 AND 1986 YEAR- CLASSES (FINGERLING STOCKED) PREDOMINATE THE CURRENT FISHERY AND THE MAJORITY OF WAE CAUGHT IN 1992 SHOULD BE WITHIN THE 14-20 INCH RANGE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A NATURALLY REPRODUCED YEAR-CLASS OF WAE BASED ON THE AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION AND STOCKING SUMMARY.  THE 1991 BLB CATCH INDEX WAS EASILY THE HIGHEST RECORDED (106.0 PER GN).  THE MAJORITY WERE WITHIN 7.5-9.5 INCHES (TOO LARGE FOR PREDATION BY MOST PREDATORS), HOWEVER, THEY APPEARED TO BE IN VERY POOR CONDITION.  THE LMB ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATED THE RELATIVE DENSITY AND SIZE-STRUCTURE OF THE POPULATION BECAUSE IT WAS POST-SPAWN AND POOR ELECTROFISHING CONDITIONS (WINDY, COLD FROM MOVING IN, VISIBILITY WAS LOW).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of Lake Florida was conducted in July 2010. Florida is a moderately sized (674 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and a low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Florida has two public accesses, one located on the north side (DNR owned) and one on the east side (township access). Residential development (220 homes and Dickerson's Resort) has occurred throughout the entire shoreline except for a small portion along the south shore. Prairie Woods Environmental Learning Center is located near the southeast shore. Water clarity in July 2010(secchi disc= 9.0 feet) was excellent. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is sparse in Florida. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderately abundant within the littoral zone. Eurasian milfoil was discovered in 2009, and as of 2010, covers less than 15% of the littoral acres. Florida is connected to several periodic winterkill (Florida Slough, Crook) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Andrew) via the Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Shore fishing access is possible on the outlet dike area (DNR owned) and shore fishing structure on the north shore of Florida lake. Florida is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was moderate in 2010 (8.60 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes, but low compared to the historical catch rate (13.85 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The 2010 walleye average size was moderate (1.48 pounds and 15.03 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.68 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (4.00 fish/gillnet) in Florida. Walleye growth rates in Florida were within the normal ranges for the Spicer area. The walleye population in Florida is due primarily to stocking. Florida was stocked with walleye in the fall of 2009 (22,299 fingerlings, 2,008 pounds). The 2009 walleye year class (fingerlings stocked and/or natural reproduction in 2009) comprised 49% of the walleye catch in the 2010 survey with 2008 and 2007 year classes contributing 16% and 15% respectively. The largest walleye captured during the 2010 survey was 25 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2010 (12.80 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range compared to similar lakes and for lake Florida historically.  The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.53 fish/gillnet for Florida. The 2010 northern pike average size was small (1.66 pounds and 18.59 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.17 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (2.60 fish/gillnet) in Florida. Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2009 and 2008 northern pike year classes comprised 64% and 21% respectively of the northern pike caught in the 2010 survey. The largest northern pike captured during the 2010 survey was 29.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in 2010 (15.70 fish/trapnet) was high compared to similar lakes and to the historical catch rate (1.65 fish/trapnet) for Florida. The 2010 largemouth bass average size was 5.41 inches from trapnets. The largest largemouth bass captured during the 2010 survey was 17 inches. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2010 due to time constraints. The last spring an electrofishing survey for largemouth bass was done in Florida was 2001. Low numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (17.59 fish/hour, 9.4 inches average length). The Florida spring electrofishing largemouth bass historical averages are 18.79 fish/hour and 10.7 inches average length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2010 (3.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average catch rate (4.37 fish/trapnet) for Florida. The 2010 black crappie average weight and length were small (0.07 pounds and 4.65 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.30 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (0.20 fish/trapnet) in Florida. Black crappie growth rates in Florida were at the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1 through 3, but above the normal range for age 4. The 2009 year class comprised 92% of black crappie captured in the 2010 survey. The largest black crappie captured during the 2010 survey was 11.25 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2010 (31.60 fish/trapnet) was moderate compared to similar lakes and to Florida historically. The bluegill historical average catch rate was 30.04 fish/trapnet in Florida. The 2010 bluegill size was average (0.15 pounds and 5.45 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (13.64 fish/trapnet) was slightly above average in Florida. The largest bluegill captured in the 2010 survey was 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in 2010 (49.40 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Florida and for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 35.64 fish/gillnet for Florida. The 2010 yellow perch size was average (0.14 pounds and 6.87 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.15 pounds. The largest yellow perch captured during the 2010 survey was 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance in 2010 (0.80 fish/gillnet) was near the lower end of the normal range for similar lakes, but was well below the historical average (23.85 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The 2010 black bullhead size was slightly above average (0.59 pounds and 9.65 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nBrown bullhead abundance in 2010 (1.20 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes and comparable to the historical catch rate (1.50 fish/gillnet). The 2010 brown bullhead average size was (1.41 pounds and 13.89 inches) from gillnets. The brown bullhead historical average weight is 0.67 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum abundance in 2010 (1.00 fish/gillnet) was low compared to similar lakes and to the historical catch rate (6.73 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The 2010 freshwater drum average size was 2.76 pounds and 18.15 inches from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 1.60 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp abundance in 2010 trapnets (0.40 fish/trapnet) was within the normal ranges for Florida and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.29 fish/trapnet for Florida. The 2010 carp average weight and length were 5.49 pounds and 19.14 inches from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 5.36 pounds from trapnets. Carp abundance in 2010 gillnets (2.40/gillnet) was within the normal ranges for Florida and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 1.12 fish/gillnet for Florida. The carp historical average weight is 3.14 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, monitoring Eurasian milfoil abundance and treatments, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in 2015 in the spring for largemouth bass and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Florida was conducted in July of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). An Index of Biotic Integrity \"FIBI\" targeted survey for all near shore fish species was conducted in August of 2019. A Fall Electrofishing targeted survey for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye in September of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nFlorida is a moderately sized (705 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Two public access sites are present on Florida with one boat ramp along the north side (DNR) and one shore fishing site on the west side. The shore fishing site is located on the west side of the outlet dike area (DNR owned). A concrete shore fishing structure was installed at this site in 2009. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of a small portion of the south side. There are approximately 220 homes (2010 survey). A resort with 13 cabins is located on the east shore (www.willmarlakesarea.com). Prairie Woods Environmental Learning Center is located near the southeast shoreline area. The immediate shoreline area is residential development with lesser amounts of wetlands and hardwoods. The surrounding watershed consists of marshlands, croplands, and hardwoods with some pasture and grasslands. Florida is connected to several periodic winterkill (Florida Slough Lake, Crook) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Andrew) via Shakopee Creek. The outlet is a fixed concrete sill which flows into the wetland/creek complex known as the Florida Sloughs on the southwest corner of the lake. It can also act as an inlet depending upon corresponding water levels in Shakopee Creek and Florida. Shakopee Creek outflows from Lake Andrew through the Florida Sloughs, several other shallow basins and eventually into the Chippewa River. Water levels were above normal during 2019. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is sparse in Florida. Dissolved oxygen was above 3.0 ppm at depths down to 30 feet. Water clarity was good (secchi reading=10.0 feet) during the July survey. Submergent and macro algae vegetation densities (bladderwort, clasping-leaf pondweed, Frie's pondweed, sago pondweed, coontail, floating pondweed, white water buttercup, water moss, northern milfoil, Eurasian water milfoil, muskgrass and curly-leaf pondweed) within the lake were moderately abundant within the littoral zone areas during 2019. A few stands of Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in 2009, with scattered stands present in 2010 covering less than 15% of the littoral acres. Eurasian watermilfoil was found at 37% of the 30 vegetation transect sites in 2010 and 43% of the transect sites in 2019. Currently, scattered Eurasian watermilfoil and native submergent species stands were also present along the break line (>10 feet deep) areas. Eurasian milfoil is providing added habitat for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Walleye and Northern Pike. Zebra Mussels were found in Florida during 2016. Presently, Zebra Mussels do not appear abundant in Florida. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel and rubble along with a few areas with silt, detritus, and clay. Scattered boulders are present along the shoreline.  <br> \n <br> \nFlorida lies within the larger Chippewa River Watershed District and sub watershed of Upper Shakopee Creek. The Chippewa River Watershed District was the lead agency for coordinating: nutrient reduction measures, protection from invasive species, information/education, storm water management and the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project prior to 2019. The local Soil Water Conservation District is currently the lead agency. <br> \n <br> \nA comprehensive set of in-lake and watershed projects since the mid-1990's have been conducted/proposed as part of the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project (e.g., lakeshore re-vegetation demonstration sites, buffer strips and grassed  waterways, wetland restorations, septic system upgrades, livestock exclusion projects and other various agricultural and shoreland best management practice implementations) to reduce nutrient, bacteria and sediment inputs. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project was composed of individuals representing several lake associations (Florida, Norway & Games and Andrew), private landowners and various government agency personnel in order more efficiently enact beneficial watershed projects. Thus far, DNR Fisheries has provided assistance with lakeshore re-vegetation and water quality monitoring projects within the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey of nearshore fish species was conducted by seine hauls and backpack electrofishing at 14 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations from August 19-21, 2019. Approximately 20 different fish species (13 species from backpack electrofishing, and 18 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), potentially large sized non-gamefish (Yellow Bullhead) and small sized non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Fathead Minnow, Bluntnose Minnow, Tadpole Madtom, Logperch, Spottail Shiner and Blacknose Shiner).  <br> \n <br> \nFish that require narrow habitat (e.g. continual water flow, submerged woody material, gravel substrate, abundant bulrush vegetation, undisturbed near shore areas, etc.) or water quality conditions (e.g. high clarity, low iron concentrations, moderate phosphorus availability, specific temperature/oxygen ranges, etc.) are classified as intolerant habitat disturbance species. Examples of intolerant habitat disturbance species captured included: Iowa Darter, Logperch and Banded Killifish in Florida. High tolerant habitat disturbance species captured included: Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow from near shore sampling; Black Bullhead and Common Carp from gillnets and trapnets. The nearshore data were combined with trapnet and gillnet data from a July 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score was poor at 36 for Florida, which is below the impairment threshold (45) for this set of similar statewide lakes. Although the FIBI score was below threshold, Spicer Area Bass/Bluegill dominated lakes with no or limited river flow through connections tend to have lower fish species diversity and corresponding FIBI scores even though water quality and clarity may be excellent as is for Florida. A lack of habitat variety is more likely the cause of lower fish diversity and poor FIBI scores in Florida. It is unknown the long term effects of different invasive species on fish diversity within lakes and rivers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe following results are based on standard summer survey gillnetting and trapnetting, spring Largemouth Bass Electrofishing and YOY Walleye fall electrofishing catches: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in 2019 (5.33 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average catch rate (10.43 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.89 pounds and 16.55 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were fair in Florida. The 2014 and 2017 year classes comprised 25% and 20% respectively of the 2019 Walleye summer survey catch. The Walleye population is due primarily to stocking. Young of year \"YOY\" Walleye abundance was low (fry stocked years) in 2017 (20.57 YOY/hour, 6.22 inches) and 2019 (2.40 YOY/hour, 5.24 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Florida was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (22,299 fingerlings, 2,008 pounds), 2011 (19,233 fingerlings, 965 pounds; 1,410 yearlings, 290 pounds), 2013 (23,502 fingerlings, 1,130 pounds), 2015 (4,135 fingerlings, yearlings and adults combined, 1,681 pounds), 2017 (256,823 fry; 18,170 fingerlings, 1,069 pounds) and 2019 (267,702 fry; 12,621 fingerlings, 1,160 pounds; 126 adults/yearlings, 28 pounds). Walleye anglers have been generally more successful in low/no light conditions of early morning or late evening due to excellent water clarity in Florida. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2019 (10.00 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average catch rate (7.29 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The highest Northern Pike catch rate occurred in 2015 (25.67 fish/gillnet, 19.42 inches) for Florida. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was small (1.74 pounds and 19.54 inches) from gillnets. There were no Northern Pike greater than 28.00 inches captured in the 2019 gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern Pike growth rates were slow for all ages. The 2013 year class comprised 27% of the 2019 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Florida in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2019 (4.33 fish/gillnet). The 2019 Largemouth Bass average size was large (1.54 pounds and 13.44 inches) from gillnets. A post spawn Largemouth Bass night electrofishing survey was conducted during mid-June of 2019. Sampling was done at 6 representative sampling stations. Abundant numbers of Largemouth Bass were captured (37.00 fish/hour, 1.34 pounds, 12.57 inches) in the 2019 June electrofishing survey. One Largemouth Bass over 20.00 inches was caught in the 2019 electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slow in Florida. There were many different year classes captured including numerous fish 8 years and older in the 2019 spring electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2019 (0.50 fish/trapnet, 1.0 fish/gillnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 3.81 fish/trapnet and 0.99 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Black Crappie sizes were variable (6.00-13.50 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2019 (32.80 fish/trapnet) and comparable to the historical average catch rate (31.65 fish/trapnet) in Florida. The 2019 Bluegill average size was large (0.29 pounds and 6.77 inches) from trapnets. Abundant Bluegill numbers of 8.00 inches and larger were captured in the 2019 trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were slow in Florida. Over 50% of the 2019 Bluegill catch was comprised of fish 8 years or older. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (1.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 30.67 fish/gillnet for Florida. Yellow Perch abundance was considerably higher (49.40 fish/gillnet) in the 2010 survey, but the 2019 survey abundance was similar to the 2015 survey (0.67 fish/gillnet). The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.09 pounds and 5.88 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured during 2019 included abundant numbers of Black Bullhead (17.33 fish/gillnet) and Yellow Bullhead fish/gillnet (33.33 fish/gillnet). Both Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead average weights were close to 0.65 pounds. Low numbers of Freshwater Drum (2.33 fish/gillnet) and Common Carp (0.60 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2019 survey. The 2019 Freshwater Drum average size was large (3.57 pounds and 19.67 inches) from gillnets. The 2019 Common Carp average size was large (8.33 pounds and 26.21 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, monitoring Eurasian watermilfoil abundance and treatments, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2022 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Florida was conducted in July of 2015. Florida is a moderately sized (705 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Two public access sites are present on Florida with one boat ramp along the north side (DNR) and one shore fishing site on the west side. The shore fishing site is located on the west side of the outlet dike area (DNR owned). Residential development (220 homes and 1 resort) has occurred throughout the shoreline area with exception to a portion of the south side owned by the Prairie Woods Environmental Learning Center. The immediate shoreline area is mostly residential development with lesser amounts of wetlands and hardwoods. The surrounding watershed consists of marshlands, croplands, and hardwoods with some pasture and grasslands. The outlet is a fixed concrete sill which flows into the shallow wetland/creek complex known as the Florida Sloughs near the southwest corner of the lake. Florida is connected to several periodic winterkill and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Andrew) via Shakopee Creek. Water clarity was good (secchi reading=10.0 feet) during the 2015 July survey. Water levels were below normal during the spring and fall, but normal during the summer of 2015. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is sparse in Florida. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderately abundant within the shallow (<15 feet deep) areas. A few stands of Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in 2009, with several stands present in 2010 covering less than 15% of the water 15 feet deep or less. Currently, Eurasian watermilfoil stands are moderately abundant within the shallow areas. Zebra mussel veligers were first sampled in water samples taken during the late summer of 2016. DNR personnel will continue follow up sampling for veliger and adult zebra mussels in Florida. Shoalwater substrates are primarily sand, gravel and rubble along with a few areas with silt, muck, and clay. Florida has been managed for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearby connected Florida Sloughs often act as an excellent spawning/nursery area for various fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Common Carp, and Black Bullhead. A swinging finger fish barrier is attached to the outlet sill. However, small sized fish (fingerlings/yearlings) can easily move between the steel fingers of the barrier. High spring flows can also reduce the effectiveness of the barrier by allowing adults passage in or out of the Florida Sloughs.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were overly abundant in 2015 (25.67 fish/gillnet) as compared to the normal range and Florida historical average (7.08 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Northern Pike average size was small (1.58 pounds and 19.4 inches) compared to the historical average (2.12 pounds) from gillnets. There were no Northern Pike greater than 28.00 inches captured in the 2015 gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern Pike growth rates are slow in Florida. Small Northern Pike can often move into Florida Lake via the outlet from the Florida Sloughs during high water events. Present high Northern Pike numbers are probably negatively affecting numbers of other fish species such as Yellow Perch and small sized Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2015 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Florida historical average (32.95 fish/gillnet). Yellow Perch abundance was considerably higher (49.40 fish/gillnet) in the previous 2010 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2015 (5.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range, but below the Florida historical average (10.82 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was moderately large (2.28 pounds and 17.6 inches) compared to the historical average (1.72 pounds) from gillnets. The Walleye population is due primarily to stocking. Florida was recently stocked with Walleye in the 2009 (16,632 fingerlings, 927 pounds), 2011 (19,233 fingerlings, 965 pounds; 1,410 yearlings, 290 pounds), 2013 (23,502 fingerlings, 1,130 pounds) and 2015 (4,135 fingerlings, yearlings and adults combined, 1,681 pounds). In recent years, larger sized Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults have been stocked to increase survivability in lakes with higher Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass populations like Florida. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were high in 2015 (2.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.78 pounds and 11.1 inches) from gillnets. Abundant off shore stands of Eurasian milfoil provide favorable habitat and cover for various fish species such as Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass in Florida. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2015 (0.40 fish/trapnet) compared to Florida historical average (4.07 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Black Crappie average size was moderate in the trapnets (0.44 pounds and 8.49 inches), but larger in gillnets (0.63 pounds, 9.82 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant (49.90 fish/trapnet), but the average size was small (0.14 pounds, 5.5 inches). The Bluegill historical average catch rate and size was 31.56 fish/trapnet and 0.15 pounds respectively in Florida. There were very few Bluegill captured over 7.0 inches, however two Bluegill captured in survey nets were almost 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of interest captured in the 2015 survey included moderate numbers of Black Bullhead, abundant numbers of yellow bullhead, low numbers of Freshwater Drum \"Sheepshead\" and Common Carp. Both Yellow and Black Bullhead average sizes were moderately large (10.0 plus inches). Freshwater Drum average size was also large (17.1 inches). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, monitoring invasive species abundance and treatments, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Florida was conducted in July of 2005. Florida is a moderately sized (674 acres), moderately deep (40 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Prairie Woods Environmental Learning Center is located near the southeast shoreline area. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of a small portion of the south side. Two public access sites are present on Florida with one along the north side (DNR boat access) and one on the east side (township access). Shore fishing access is possible on the outlet dike area (DNR owned) of the north shore of Florida. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is sparse in Florida. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderately abundant within the littoral zone areas. Florida is connected to several periodic winterkill (Florida Slough Lake, Crook) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Games, Andrew) via the Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Water clarity (secchi=10.5 feet) was excellent in 2005. Florida is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Florida. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2005 (2.70 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average catch rate (4.46 fish/trapnet) for Florida. The 2005 black crappie average size was moderate (0.47 pounds and 9.4 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.35 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger black crappie was high (2.20 fish/trapnet) in Florida. Black crappie growth rates in Florida were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for age 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-5. The 2001 black crappie year class comprised 50% of black crappie captured in the 2005 assessment.Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2005 (12.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.87 fish/gillnet for Florida. The 2005 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.25 pounds and 20.8 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.22 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was high (5.00 fish/gillnet) in Florida. Northern pike growth rates in Florida were within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2004 northern pike year class comprised 52% of the northern pike caught in the 2005 assessment. The largest northern pike captured was 33.7 inches in the 2005 assessment. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2005 (3.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 34.39 fish/gillnet for Florida. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.1 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.15 pounds. Walleye numbers were moderate in 2005 (5.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but low compared to the historical average catch rate (11.49 fish/gillnet) for Florida. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate (2.09 pounds and 15.3 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.70 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was low (1.60 fish/gillnet) in Florida. Walleye growth rates in Florida were generally within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The walleye population in Florida is due primarily to stocking. Florida was stocked with walleye in the 2005 fall (31,150 fingerlings, 1,001 pounds; 70 yearlings, 35 pounds; 42 adults, 42 pounds). The 2003 walleye year class (fingerlings stocked and/or natural reproduction in 2003) comprised 53% of the walleye catch in the 2005 assessment. The largest walleye captured was 27.9 inches in the 2005 assessment. Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2005 (43.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 29.89 fish/trapnet in Florida. The 2005 bluegill average size was large (0.27 pounds and 7.0 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was high (41.41 fish/trapnet) in Florida. The largest bluegill captured was 10.2 inches in the 2005 assessment.Brown bullhead numbers were abundant in 2005 (5.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2005 brown bullhead average size was large (1.45 pounds and 13.5 inches) from gillnets. The brown bullhead historical average weight is 0.76 pounds from gillnets.Largemouth bass numbers were low in 2005 (0.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was 6.22 inches from trapnets. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2005 due to time constraints. The last spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass in Florida was done during 2001. Low numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (17.59 fish/hour, 9.4 inches average length). The Florida spring electrofishing largemouth bass historical averages are 18.79 fish/hour and 10.7 inches average length.Freshwater drum numbers were low in 2005 (1.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 7.25 fish/gillnet for Florida. The 2005 freshwater drum average size was moderate (1.80 pounds and 16.21 inches) from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 1.48 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in the 2010 spring for largemouth bass and 2010 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Florida was conducted during September 14, 2017. Florida is a moderate sized (705 acres), moderate depth (40 feet maximum), good water clarity (10 feet secchi on 7/21/15), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation species are abundant within Florida. Invasive species such as Eurasian Watermilfoil (2009) and Zebra Mussels (2016) are present in Florida. There are abundant numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike during most years in Florida. Northern Pike numbers (25.67 fish/gillnet, 1.6 pounds average weight) were at a historic high in Florida during the 2015 summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in past years for Florida was due primarily to fingerling or yearling stockings based on previous surveys and historical data review. Moderate adult Walleye numbers (5.67 fish/gillnet) were caught in the 2015 summer survey. Multiple year classes (2013, 2011 and 2010) comprised 73% of the 2015 Walleye summer survey catch. Although past Walleye fingerlings stockings have been successful, a less expensive Walleye fry stocking was attempted in 2017. Additional fry stockings will occur in the near future (2019 and 2021), in order to evaluate a change in Walleye stocking strategies for Florida and several other area lakes (Games, Andrew, Monson and Eagle). Walleye fingerling/yearling stockings are contingent the same year if the fry stockings are unsuccessful as documented by fall electrofishing. Florida was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (16,632 fingerlings, 927 pounds), 2010 (4,740 yearlings, 158 pounds), 2011 (19,233 fingerlings, 965 pounds; 1,410 yearlings, 290 pounds), 2013 (23,502 fingerlings, 1,130 pounds), 2015 (113 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 3,943 yearlings, 1,597 pounds; 76 adults, 63 pounds) and 2017 (256,823 Spicer strain fry). Walleye fry were stocked from a truck fish tank with a stocking tube at the Lake Florida public access site, unlike successful (>50 YOY/hour) fry stocked lakes such as Games and Andrew. These successful lakes were stocked by boat with 5-6 jugs (each 5 gallon size jug containing oxygen, water and fry) in the deeper portion near the middle of the lake during 2017. Predation upon fry by other fish (i.e. Bluegill or other species) may be greater in the near shore areas of moderate to excellent clarity lakes like Andrew, Games and Florida. Both fry stocking methods have been successful in shallow and turbid lakes during the past. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (20.57 YOY/hour, 6.22 inches average length) were caught (fry stocked year) in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey as compared to other Spicer Area lakes. However, YOY Walleye catch rates from 10-30 fish per hour may be adequate for providing a moderate year class in larger or clearer lakes. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2017. Two prior fall electrofishing surveys were conducted during the mid 1990's, but no YOY Walleye were caught.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Florida during May 30 to June 1, 2023 as part of the ongoing statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative. Ten standard lake survey trapnets were set at historical stations to target Bluegill. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long (Hawick, Minnesota), Diamond, George and Florida) currently entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Sunfish or Crappie. The Florida regulation is a ten Sunfish bag limit. Submergent vegetation densities were moderate. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Trapnet sampling pre-spawn Bluegill during early/mid-May or September is preferred to summer (June-August) netting for regulation evaluation. <br> \n <br> \nFlorida is a moderate sized (705 acres), moderate depth (40 feet maximum), good water clarity (10 feet secchi on 7/21/15), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation species are abundant within Florida. Invasive species such as Eurasian Watermilfoil (2009) and Zebra Mussels (2016) are present in Florida. There are abundant numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike during most years in Florida.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant (53.20 fish/trapnet) in the late May 2023 survey. The Bluegill average size was moderate (0.24 pounds and 6.38 inches). The Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) was moderate (28.40 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) was low (3.00 fish/trapnet). The 2020 year class comprised 29% of the 2023 Bluegill catch. Other moderate year classes included 2017 (18%) and 2018 (21%). Bluegill growth rates in 2023 were similar to the 2019 survey. Growth rates were slow for ages 1-4, but moderate for ages 5-8 compared to local lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish numbers were low (3.00 fish/trapnet) in 2023. The Pumpkinseed average size was large (0.30 pounds, 6.78 inches) in 2023. Hybrid Sunfish numbers were also low (1.10 fish/trapnet) in 2023. The Hybrid Sunfish average size was small (0.10 pounds, 4.92 inches). Both Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish numbers were low (0.20 fish/trapnet) in a 2019 July standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Florida include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, evaluating the Sunfish special regulation, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Florida fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
