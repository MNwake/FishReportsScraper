                "narrative": "<p>East Stay is a 224 acre lake located near the city of Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7 feet and is in lake class 43.  East Stay has good spawning habitat for northern pike and yellow perch.  Shoalwater substrates are comprised of mostly gravel and sand. The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species with northern pike and yellow perch managed as secondary species.Walleye numbers would be considered average to high for lakes similar to East Stay.  Catch rates for walleye increased from 5 in 1992 to 14.5 fish/net in 1996.  The lengths of walleye ranged from 15 to 19 inches and averaged about 18 inches.  The walleye sampled during the survey more than likely originated from a fry stocking in 1994.  The average weight of walleye in East Stay was almost 2 ? pounds.Northern pike numbers were high compared to lakes similar to East Stay.  Catch rates for northern pike increased from 0.5 in 1992 to 14 fish/net in 1996.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 17 to 32 inches and averaged about 19 inches.  The average weight of northern pike in East Stay was almost 2 pounds.Catch rates for yellow perch decreased from 83 in 1992 to 42.5 fish/net in 1996, but are still considered very high for lakes similar to East Stay.  The high catch rates in 1992 were primarily the result of a strong hatch in 1991.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 4 to 12 inches and averaged just over 8 inches.  Our data suggests a well-balanced population of yellow perch with four year classes present.  The average weight of yellow perch in East Stay was about 1/3 pound.  Local anglers reported excellent yellow perch fishing during the winter of 1995.Black bullhead numbers are average for lakes similar to East Stay.  Catch rates for black bullhead decreased from 47 in 1992 to 26 fish/net in 1996.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7 inches.  Our data suggests the black bullhead population is dominated by small fish.  The average weight of black bullhead was about 1/4 pound.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Stay Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stay Lake is a 221-acre lake located near Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 6 feet and is a class 42 Lake.  Stay is managed primarily for northern pike while walleye and yellow perch are managed secondarily.  Walleye fry stocking one of three years starting in 1997 has been very successful in Stay Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nStay Lake has a good northern pike population present.  The numbers of northern pike are similar to what they were in 2004.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 16.7 to 25.1 inches and averaged 20.6 inches <br> \n <br> \nStay Lake has an excellent walleye population present.  We would expect to catch 7.3 walleye per gill net and we caught 32.5 walleye per net in 2008.  Although we have seen natural reproduction in Stay, the fish aged in this survey were all from years we stocked fry.  An ear bone from the walleye was removed and looked at under a microscope to determine the age of the fish.  Annual rings similar to a tree are formed on all bony structures.  Each ring represents one year\u0019s growth.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 11.5 to 23.8 inches and averaged 14.4 inches.  The majority of the walleye caught were the result of a fry stocking in 2006.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is doing very well in Stay Lake.  Stay Lake has a history of good yellow perch fishing and this should continue based on the results of the 2008 netting survey.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 11.4 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are down compared to the numbers we had from past surveys.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 5.2 to 11.7 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers were once again very high in Stay Lake, which bodes well for those of you who enjoy bow fishing.  Lengths of common carp ranged from 13.8 to 28.0 inches and averaged 21.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Stay Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Stay Lake is located near the town of Arco in Lincoln County, has a surface area of 224 acres, a maximum depth of 7 feet, and is in lake class 43.  Historically, the lake commonly experienced winterkill, making the implementation of management plans difficult.  Aeration of the lake was initiated in 1989 and no substantial winterkills have been observed since.  In the early 1990's, East Stay was managed primarily for walleye; however, walleye recruitment to the fishery was inconsistent and unreliable.  In addition, the lake has excellent northern pike spawning and rearing habitat.  Therefore, the management plan was altered in 1997 to focus on maintaining a self-sustaining northern pike population, with secondary management of yellow perch and walleye.Northern pike gill net catch rates were 10.0 fish/net, exceeding a majority of lakes in lake class 43.  The upper 25% of lakes in class 43 maintain northern pike gill net catch rates of 8.0 fish/net.  Northern pike abundance, as indexed by gill net catches, has varied from 0.5 fish/net in 1992 to 14.0 fish/net in 1996.  Conversely, trap net catches of northern pike rose slightly from 4.0 fish/net in 1996 to 5.2 fish/net in 2000.  Therefore, northern pike abundance likely remained somewhat stable, with a slight decline possible between 1996 and 2000.  Regardless, northern pike numbers should still be considered quite good.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 17 to 33 inches and the average weight was 3.4 lbs.  In addition, northern pike size structure improved since 1996, with a nearly 15% increase in the number of pike between 28 and 32 inches.  Larger pike (>33 inches) continued to be absent from the catch data.  Growth rates of northern pike in East Stay Lake have also declined.  In 1996, age-1 northern pike reached an average total length of 13.3 inches and 3-year old fish reached lengths of 30.0 inches.  In 2000, age-1 pike did not surpass an average length of 12.0 inches and it now takes 5 years to reach 30 inches of total length.  Likewise, the typical body condition, a measure of weight for fish of a given length, has also dropped substantially from 1996 to 2000.  Declines in body condition and growth rates often indicate food resources or other environmental limitations.Walleye were caught at a rate of 6.5 fish/net in the gill nets and 1.4 fish/net in the trap nets.  These catch rates both fall within close proximity of averages (1.3 for trap nets and 6.8 for gill nets) for lakes in class 43.  The gill net catch rates dropped from a recorded high of 14.5 fish/net in 1996.  Regardless of this decline, walleye numbers continue to be stronger than observed in 1992 and 1988.  Although relative walleye abundance has declined in East Stay Lake, size structure has remained nearly constant with many fish in the 16 to 21 inch range. The mean weight of walleye captured in the gill nets was 2.63 lbs./fish.  There has been no notable change in walleye growth rates or body condition between 1996 and 2000 and data indicate that feeding and environmental conditions for walleye are near optimal. The primary forage species for walleye and northern pike in East Stay Lake are likely yellow perch and black bullheads.  Yellow perch were captured at a rate of 6.5 fish/net and fell below the average perch catch rate of 8.0 fish/net for lakes in class 43.  Relative abundance of yellow perch has steadily declined in each survey since 1988; however, yellow perch year class strength can be highly variable.  Therefore, a relative abundance check completed in 4-year intervals can be somewhat inconclusive. Regardless, yellow perch gill net catch rates in 1988, 1992, and 1996 were 128.0, 83.0, and 42.5 fish/net, respectively.  The proportions of the yellow perch population in the 6 to 10 inch range has remained nearly constant since 1988; however, the proportion of the perch population exceeding 11 inches has substantially been reduced.  The largest perch captured in the 2000 assessment was 10.5 inches.  Typically, when relative perch abundance declines, growth rates and condition remain good; however, this was not observed in East Stay Lake.  Expected weights for yellow perch in lake class 43 waters at given lengths were not achieved.  In 1996, the mean back-calculated length for an age-3 perch was 9.93 inches, whereas in 2000, a decrease to a mean length of 8.68 inches has been documented.  Natural reproduction of yellow perch was observed during the 2000 seining assessment.Black bullhead gill net catch rates were higher in 2000 (205.0 fish/net) than in 1988, 1992, and 1996 (all <100 fish/net).  The 2000 bullhead catch rates greatly exceeded most lakes in class 43.  Although the gill net catch rates increased, the 2000 trap net catch rate of 32.2 fish/net has remained quite consistent since 1988.  The black bullhead population continues to be dominated by individuals <6 inches total length.  Common carp catch rates have been variable from 1988 to 2000.  In the 2000 survey, the gill net catch rate was 17.0 fish/net and the trap net catch rate was 15.3 fish/net.  In terms of carp abundance, the gill net catches would place East Stay Lake in the upper 25% of class 43 lakes.  Numerous local residents have commented that carp numbers appeared to increase substantially over the past few years.  There have minimal changes in the carp size structure.  A slight increase in the number of small (<21 inches) carp can be detected.  Increases in the number of small carp can be cause for concern, as subsequent declines in water quality and vegetation density often result.Other species captured in the 2000 population assessment included single specimens of white sucker and tadpole madtom.  Previous assessments and surveys had documented the presence of a low-density white crappie population; however, none were recorded in the current survey.  Orange-spotted sunfish and fathead minnows were also documented in the shoreline seine samples.  The management plan objectives for East Stay Lake have been met.  Northern pike gill net catch rates exceeded the 8.0 fish/net goal and the size structure has improved, surpassing our target range.  Fortunately, increases in size structure have been achieved without sacrificing relative abundance.  Northern pike spawning habitats are currently high quality; however, the connecting sloughs and other spawning and rearing habitat areas must be protected.  Therefore, excessive siltation or the loss of vegetation caused by poor watershed management or additional increases in black bullhead and common carp densities may need to be addressed.  Although yellow perch abundance has declined, relative abundance of perch is within our target range.  Walleye abundance has also met management objectives; however, future fry stocking could be problematic if bullhead numbers continue to increase, as excessive predation on and competition with the walleye fry and fingerlings could reduce walleye success.  If walleye fry stocking fails, walleye fingerling stocking may be more useful.  Overall, the management plan established in 1997 has been successful and should continue as scheduled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Stay Lake is a shallow (max depth of 6 ft.) 224-acre southern Minnesota located in Lincoln County.  Despite aeration, partial winterkills occasionally occur and restocking of gamefish is needed to sustain or improve fishing.  East Stay Lake has one of the few remaining natural spawning runs for Northern Pike in Windom fisheries management area, as it is connected to several shallow basins that provide quality spawning habitat.  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch are one of a few native species that can be fairly tolerant of low dissolved oxygen during the winter.  As a result, East Stay Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of August 31, 2020 to monitor the fish community using 1 gill net and 9 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured at a rate of 7 per gill net and 1.4 per trap net.  Trap nets are usually poor indicators of relative abundance during summer but gill nets are an effective summer gear.  Seven Northern Pike per gill net is an above average catch rate, equal to the 75 percentile similar lakes.  Northern Pike in the gill net and trap net sample ranged from 12 to just under 32 inches with an average size of 25.5 inches in gill nets and trap nets.  Condition of most fish was good and was stable with increasing length, except for two 25 inch Northern Pike that were skinny.  Overall, the Northern Pike population appears to be doing well. There was some concern after the last survey in 2016 with no Northern Pike caught. However, a range of sizes and year classes were caught in 2020 including a new age-0 year class!  No stocking is necessary to sustain the Northern Pike population in East Stay Lake unless there is a major winterkill.  Fishing should be good for Northern Pike over the next several years.  Be aware that there is a southern Minnesota regulation and possession limit of 2 Northern Pike over 24 inches, so all Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released.    <br> \n  <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred and twenty Walleye were sampled combined in gill nets (26 fish) and trap nets (94 fish).  The gill net catch rate of 26 per net was more than the long-term catch rate average of 20.6 per gill net and greater than expected.  The trap net catch rate of 10.4 was also greater than expected.  Of particular note was the wide range of sizes caught, from 7 to 26 inches.   Walleye were last stocked in East Stay with fry in 2019 with a rotation of 3 years stocked with 1 year no stocking that started in 2013 (stocked in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016-No stocking; 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020-No Stocking).  A subsample of 20 Walleye were aged and indicated 6 different year classes, 12 age-0 from 2020, 2 age-1 from 2019, 5 age-3 from 2017, 1 age-5 from 2015, 1 age-6 from 2014, and 4 age-7 fish from 2013.  All but 1 age group, age-0 from 2020, were from stocked years.  In addition, the age-0 was the most abundant year class.  Natural reproduction is not common in East Stay but is the most likely answer for the presence of those age-0 Walleye.  There was no stocking done in 2020 due to COVID-19 postponement of statewide egg-take operations.  Fin clips of age-0 fish were taken and sent for genetic analysis.  Genetic analysis revealed that multiple strains of Walleye were responsible for natural reproduction including the recently introduced Lower Mississippi Strain (from Lake Sarah egg-take).  Walleye stocked in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye.  In addition to high numbers and many sizes of Walleye observed in 2020, the condition of Walleye in the sample was excellent with plump fish that resembled footballs!  Overall, the Walleye population is doing very well in East Stay Lake and is at an abundance that should result in excellent fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Yellow Perch in 2020 was 187 per gill net, exceeding the expected catch rate range for similar lakes, and nearly twice the long term average of 99.1 per gill net, and a record high catch rate on East Stay. Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from just over 5.5 inches to just above 11 inches and averaged nearly 7.5 inches.  No stocking is needed to sustain the Yellow Perch population, Yellow Perch in East Stay are self-sustaining with several year classes present in the length frequency histogram.  Angling for Yellow Perch can be very good at East Stay Lake and the population is fast growing which makes it one of the best locations for an opportunity to catch a Jumbo perch in the Windom Fisheries Management Area.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 121 per gill net exceeding the 75 percentile for similar lakes (91.4 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 3.6 to 10.6 inches in the gill net sample and averaged just over 6 inches.  Other species sampled were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Orangespotted Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, and White Sucker.  All species were caught within (all except Common Carp, see the end of this paragraph) expected catch rate ranges, except for Largemouth Bass, Freshwater Drum, and Tadpole Madtom which are uncommon in East Stay Lake or found for the first time (Freshwater Drum).  High water levels the past 2 years likely led to the introduction of Freshwater Drum and the return of uncommon species in East Stay Lake such as Tadpole Madtom and Largemouth Bass.  Common Carp are another species that was present, but it appears immigration from downstream sources has increased the population.  Future monitoring will help to track the status of these species that are less important to anglers, but may influence the lake in positive and negative ways.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Stay Lake is a shallow (max depth of 6 ft.) 224-acre lake located in Lincoln County.  Despite aeration, partial winterkills occasionally occur, with the most recent winterkill occurring during the winter of 2012 -2013.  East Stay Lake has one of the few remaining natural spawning runs for Northern Pike in Windom fisheries management area, as it is connected to several shallow basins that provide quality spawning habitat.  It is not surprising following a winterkill to see more than normal submergent aquatic vegetation as we have had many reports.  Submergent vegetation can improve water quality and water clarity while providing abundant fish spawning and nursery habitat.  Thus, East Stay Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of July 18, 2016 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and eight trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nFollowing the 2012-2013 winterkill, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 3.0 per trap net, indicating that it was a partial kill and that there were enough brood fish left to sustain the population.  In 2016, zero Northern Pike were captured in the survey.  The lack of Northern Pike in the survey could be the result of a winterkill or summer kill that was not reported or documented, or could be a survey anomaly where the Northern Pike were not actively moving during the survey and thus were not sampled.  If available, Northern Pike fingerlings will be stocked in the spring of 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, the Walleye catch rate was 43.0 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate observed on East Stay Lake, and is greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net).  Age-3 Walleye, which were stocked in 2013 following the partial winterkill, were the most abundant, comprising 68 percent of the sample.  Other year classes sampled included 2010, 2014, and 2015, which were all stocked years.  Lengths of gill netted Walleye ranged from 11.1 to 21.8 and averaged 18.2 inches.  Mean length at age-3 was 18.4 inches, which indicated that Walleye grow very fast in this lake.  Walleye angling should be phenomenal on East Stay Lake, as Walleye are abundant and are large.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Yellow Perch in 2016 was 95.0 per gill net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 26.5 per gill net) and slightly above the long term average of 88.1 per gill net. Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 12.4 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  The Yellow Perch population appears to be self-sustaining, as at least three year classes were present.  Good numbers of 9-plus inch perch were sampled, which should provide a great Yellow Perch angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 49.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (9.6 to 91.4 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 4.1 to 9.7 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  The Common Carp catch rate was 0.6 per trap net, which is the lowest catch rate ever recorded in East Stay Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Stay Lake is a 224 acre lake in Lincoln County near the town of Arco with a maximum depth of 6 feet.  East Stay has winterkilled occasionally in the past, but installation of an aeration system in 1989 has prevented winterkills since.  Historically managed for walleye, East Stay has been managed primarily for northern pike since 1997 due to its suitable pike spawning habitat and lack of successful walleye natural reproduction prior.  Currently, the lake is also managed for yellow perch, walleye, and white crappie as secondary species.  Following its current management plan, East Stay is stocked with walleye fry at the rate of 1000 fish per acre once every three years.  In addition, winter-rescue northern pike and available yellow perch are stocked when assessments deem it necessary.The northern pike gill net catch rate was 3 fish per net, average for lakes with characteristics similar to those of East Stay.  In addition, trap net efforts averaged just under 3 northern pike per net.  The lengths of the captured pike ranged from nearly 18 inches to just over 31 inches, with an average weight of just under 5 lbs per fish.  Aging of the northern pike revealed 4 distinct ages, fish from 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 year classes.  The northern pike growth rate has stayed pretty similar to that of the previous assessment.  In 2000, age 2 pike had an average total length of 17 inches and 4-year-old fish reached lengths of 26 inches.  In 2004, age 2 pike averaged just under 20 inches in total length and the 4-year-old fish sampled averaged over 25 inches.  Since East Stay has never been intentionally stocked with pike, the population is attributed to suitable spawning habitat and successful natural reproduction.Yellow perch (as well as black bullheads) are assumed to be the primary forage for East Stay's northern pike population.  2004's yellow perch gill net catch rate was a historical high for the lake with 139 fish per net captured, a dramatic increase over the approximate 6 fish per net of the 2000 assessment.  The perch ranged in length from just under 5 inches to over 13 inches long, and aging revealed 6 strong year classes present.  Exactly half of the fish were longer than 9 inches, providing ample entertainment for perch anglers.  Similar to the pike population, yellow perch have not been stocked within East Stay, making the present population a result of successful reproduction within the basin.East Stay's 2004 walleye gill net catch rate was 51 fish per net and the trap net catch rate was 8 fish per net.  These catch rates greatly exceeded average catch rates for lakes similar to East Stay and were great increases over the 2000 numbers for both gears (just over 6 fish per gill net and 1 fish per trap net).  Captured walleyes ranged in length from just over 10 inches to over 26 inches long and many fish (43%) were in the angler desired 14 to 21 inch range.  Current management strategies relating to walleyes in East Stay Lake will continue.Although managed as a secondary species in East Stay, no white crappie were sampled in 2004 or in the previous assessment in 2000.  As a result, it has been recommended that the lake no longer be managed for the species.  Stocking of white crappie may take place in the future if a source for the fish becomes available.The black bullhead gill net catch rate (124 fish per net) was lower than the 2000 assessment (205 fish per net), and about average for lakes with characteristics similar to those of East Stay.  In addition, the 2004 trap net catch rate of just over 9 bullheads per net was also lower than the 2000 catch rate (about 32 fish per net), and well below averages for similar lakes.  Similar to previous assessments, the black bullhead population was dominated by individuals smaller than 7 inches long (83% of catch).Common carp have historically been quite abundant in East Stay and continue to be.  Since 1988 common carp catch rates have hovered around the high end of \"average\", and the 2004 assessment was no exception.Other species captured in the 2004 assessment included orangespotted sunfish and a pair of tadpole madtoms.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of East Stay Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

Despite aeration, partial winterkills occasionally occur, with the most recent winterkill occurring during the winter of 2012 -2013.  East Stay Lake has one of the few remaining natural spawning runs for Northern Pike in Windom fisheries management area, as it is connected to several shallow basins that provide quality spawning habitat.  Thus, East Stay Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Stay Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nZero young-of-the-year Walleye were sampled suggesting that the fry stocking was unsuccessful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nEast Stay Lake is located adjacent to the village of Arco in Lincoln County, has a surface area of 224 acres, a maximum depth of six feet when full, and is a DNR class 42 lake.  Minnesota DNR Fisheries classifies lakes with similar characteristics, such as size, depth, water chemistry, etc. on a statewide basis for comparison of data.  Historically, this lake has commonly experienced partial winterkills, which makes it difficult to manage on a long term basis.  Aeration of the lake was initiated in 1989 and a variety of systems have been installed over the years.  Although it is aerated, this basin still suffers occasional partial winterkill events, most recently in the winter of 2009-2010. This lake is relatively shallow and connects to several other shallow basins upstream of the inlet.  These adjoining basins include West Stay Lake which has a maximum depth of four feet, and a large wetland with attached floodable grasslands.  This complex provides one of the few remaining natural spawning runs for northern pike in Windom's management district.  Therefore East Stay Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, while yellow perch and walleye are secondary management species.  Two species, northern pike and yellow perch, tolerate the lower oxygen levels that sometimes occur here much better than walleye do.  To assess fish populations and evaluate management plan objectives, test netting was conducted by Windom Area Fisheries personnel during the week of July 9, 2012 with the following results. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for northern pike was 7 fish per net which was slightly above the historical long term average of 6.5 fish per net for all surveys conducted on East Stay.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2008 to supplement lower than average numbers in the 2004 (3 per net) and 2008 (3 per net) netting.  There is no way to determine if the current population is a result of stocking or natural reproduction, or a combination of both. The majority of the northern pike captured were between 20 and 25 inches with two 29 inches long.  These fish had an average weight of 3.5 lbs. and should continue to grow rapidly with the abundance of smaller carp and a wide variety of perch sizes available as forage. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch was 6 fish per net which was less than half the long term historical average of 14.5 fish per net for this lake.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 15 inches to 22 inches with only one fish being longer than 18 inches.  Walleye numbers from eight trap nets were lower than average with only four 16-17 inch fish recorded.  These fish showed excellent growth with an overall average weight just under 2 lbs. per fish.  The plentiful forage available for walleye consists mainly of yellow perch, black bullheads and fathead minnows.  All of the walleye sampled were aged from growth rings on a bony internal structure called otoliths.  The majority of these fish were 2 years old with some 3 year olds also present.  This would correspond with walleye fry stockings in 2009 and 2010.  East Stay has shown it can support considerably larger walleye populations if winterkill doesn't occur.  Therefore we are increasing walleye fry stocking frequency to 3 out of 4 years at a rate of 500 per acre beginning in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nBoth trap net and gill net catch rates of yellow perch were record highs for East Stay.  The 184 perch per gill net was more than double the long-term average, and the 53 perch per trap net was more than five times the long-term average.  Yellow perch lengths were nearly similar in both gears ranging from 5 inches to just under 12 inches.  Since perch have not been stocked in recent years and many year classes are present, they are a self-sustaining population even through moderate winterkill.  Angling for yellow perch should be good on East Stay Lake over the next several years.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nIn just four years common carp have declined from a record high of 37.5 fish per net to a record low of 4 fish per net.   This most likely can be attributed to the substantial winterkill of 2009-2010.  Already carp are attempting to reestablish themselves with three year classes under 16 inches present.  Hopefully the quality habitat remaining allows northern pike to reproduce annually and keep this undesirable species under control.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population has rebounded from a record low catch in 2008 of 5 fish per gill net to 98 fish per gillnet in 2012.  This occurred even though there was substantial mortality of some species (walleye and carp) during the recent winterkill.  Black bullhead total lengths in both gears ranged from 4 inches to just under 10 inches, and weights were somewhat below average. <br> \nWhite sucker abundance in gill nets was at a historical high of 26 fish per net in 2012 compared to less than 1 per net during all previous surveys on East Stay.  The suckers were well above average weight and ranged in length from 9 inches to nearly 18 inches.  Their good condition and dramatic increase in numbers may be due to lack of competition with common carp and other species since the winterkill, and they should provide excellent forage for the northern pike in the future. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the 2012 population assessment in low densities included tadpole madtom, orange-spotted sunfish, and green sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nWith continued protection of the quality northern pike spawning habitat, forgoing severe drought or winterkill, angling for pike should bode well into the future.  Plans to increase frequency of walleye fry stocking will also increase the quality of angling opportunities for this species.  Yellow perch abundance and an increasing size structure should provide both excellent fishing and forage for walleye and northern pike for years to come. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Chuck Obler <br> \n</p>",
