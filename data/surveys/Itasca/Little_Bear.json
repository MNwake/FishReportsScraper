                "narrative": "<p>Little Bear Lake is a 142 acre lake located in northern Itasca County near the town of Togo in the Little Fork River watershed.  The water is bog-stained with a Secchi disk transparency of 7.5 feet.  Maximum depth is 35 feet with 68% of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  The lake has periodically experienced partial winterkills in the past.  Submerged vegetation growth was very dense during the 2011 assessment which made for difficult conditions to set nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch was below the expected range at 2.2/net.  Catches in previous surveys ranged from 2.7 to 14/net.  Sampled pike varied from 15.0 to 26.4 inches, with a mean length of 19.7 inches.  Recruitment appeared relatively consistent with ages 2 through 7 represented in the sample.  Growth of northern pike was similar to the statewide average, with fish reaching 20.4 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for black crappie was below the expected range at 0.2/net, while the gill-net catch rate was near the lake class median at 1.8/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have varied from 0 to 4.8/trap net, and from 0 to 1.5/gill net.  Gill-net sampled crappie ranged from 6.0 to 9.1 inches, with a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Recruitment appeared relatively consistent with ages 3 through 7 represented in the sample.  Growth of black crappie was below the statewide average, with fish reaching 7.6 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for bluegill was within the lake class expected range at 12.7/net, and similar to the catch of 14/net in 2001.  The two highest catch rates have occurred in the two most recent assessments.  Catches in prior surveys varied from 0 to 7.5/net.  Size structure in the 2011 sample was relatively poor, with fish ranging from 2.9 to 7.8 inches, with a mean length of 5.3 inches.  Bluegill growth was similar to the lake class average, with fish reaching 4.7 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was 0.2/net; below the expected range but similar to the previous assessment.  Catches in historical surveys have varied considerably, ranging from 0.5 to 28/net.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike; consequently low abundance can limit abundance and growth of predator species. <br> \n <br> \nNo walleye were captured in gill nets in this assessment, despite walleye fry stocking in four of the previous ten years.  Catches in historical surveys have varied from 0 to 2/ gill net, although the catch has only once exceeded 0.8/net.  One 19.5 inch walleye was sampled in a trap net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets in this assessment included largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and golden shiner.  Near-shore IBI (index of biotic integrity) sampling with seines and back-pack electrofishing also sampled blackchin shiner, central mudminnow, Iowa darter and Johnny darter. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Bear Lake is a 142-acre lake in northern Itasca County located near Togo.  The water was bog stained with a secchi disk transparency of 7 ft and previous surveys indicate low fertility.  Maximum depth is 35 ft and 68% of lake is less than 15 ft deep.  Little Bear Lake also has a history of winterkills in some years.Only five walleye were caught in this assessment, resulting in a gill-net catch of 0.8/net, which is similar to the expected value for similar lakes.  Abundance in previous assessments has been low and varied from 0 to 2.0/net.  Size structure was good with fish varying in length from 17 to 27 inches.  Walleye growth was excellent, exceeding statewide averages for all ages sampled.  Walleye fry have recently been stocked in 2001, 1998, and 1991.  Of the five walleye sampled, three correspond to stocked year classes and two fish were sampled from the 1994 year class; a nonstocked year.  Walleye stocking does not appear to result in an abundant population, and natural reproduction is poor despite a walleye-spawning reef constructed in 1996.Northern pike gill-net catch was 5.3/net which is also within the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 2.7 to 14.0/gill net.  Although the abundance is generally high, size structure was moderate to poor with few fish greater than 24 inches.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for ages 1 to 6.  Black crappie abundance was 1.0/gill net and 0.9/trap net.  Both values were within the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in trap nets in past assessments has varied from 0.5 to 4.8/net.  Size structure in the 20001 assessment was good with fish up to 12 inches in length.  Only three yellow perch were sampled resulting in a gill-net catch of 0.5/net, which is below the expected range.  Yellow perch abundance has fluctuated in the past, varying from 2.2 to 28.0/gill net.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike; consequently low abundance can limit abundance and growth of predator species.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 14.0/net which is within the expected range.  The abundance in the 2001 assessment is the highest catch rate ever sampled on Little Bear Lake.  Abundance has generally been low in past assessments varying from 0 to 4.8/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish greater than eight inches.  Other fish sampled include black bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  Releasing northern pike greater than 24 inches and walleye greater than 19 inches today, allows these fish to grow into the trophy fish of tomorrow.  </p>",
