Size ranged from 9.4-12.4 inches with a mean size of 11.0 inches and a median size of 11.0 inches.  All crappies were at least 8.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was 17.30/TN, similar to the 2006 catch of 14.63/TN.  Size ranged from 5.7-9.5 inches with a mean and median size of 8.0 inches.  Ninety percent of bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish and pumpkinseeds were also measured in 2009.  Pumkinseeds were caught at a rate of 0.90/TN.  Size ranged from 6.6-8.8 inches with a mean size of 7.83 inches and a median size of 7.5 inches.  Eighty nine percent of pumpkinseeds were at least 7.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish were caught at a rate of 0.3/TN.

The gillnet CPUE of 9.0 fish/net remains high (above the third quartile for the lake group) while the average size remains small (0.89 lbs.). Growth on the northern pike is slow as compared to the statewide average (20.9 inches) at age 5 in Goodrich Lake versus 24.9 inches statewide. The bluegill trapnet CPUE declined from 97.7 in 1982 to 19.8 in 1988. however, the size structure remains fair with only 20 of 197 fish sampled (10.1%) greater than 7.0 inches. Growth of the bluegills is considerably slower than the statewide average. A 5-year old bluegill in Goodrich Lake is 4.4 inches compared to 7.1 inches statewide. The pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and black crappie populations are average for the lake group, while the bowfin, brown bullhead and walleye populations are lower than average. No yellow perch were sampled during the survey.</p>",

Fish were small, averaging only 18.5\" and 1.5 lbs., with 11% measuring 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at the rate of 62.5/hr run-time during spring electrofishing.  Average length was 12.4\" and 55% were 12\" or larger.  Three smallmouth bass were also captured during electrofishing that ranged from 12.5\" to 14.3\".  Largemouth bass were captured in above average numbers in gill nets (5.8/gill net) and trap nets (1.9/trap net). <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was average in both gill nets (4.0/gill net), with an average length of 9.3\".  The trap net catch rate was also average (2.0/trap net), with an average length of 9.0\".  When both net types were combined, 95% of the fish were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was average (22.8/trap net).

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Goodrich Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting on June 14, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with two sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 18 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Goodrich Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Special regulations are currently in place, reducing the daily possession limit to five fish for each of these two species.  Black crappies were also netted while night electrofishing for largemouth bass to supplement the trap net numbers.  Size with both gears combined ranged from 7.8-13.3 inches with a mean length of 10.7 inches.  All but one of the crappies were at least 8.0 inches long.  Bluegill numbers totaled 200 fish ranging in size from 4.4 to 9.8 inches.  Mean length was 8.3 inches and 95% were at least 7 inches long.</p>",

A special regulation of 5 sunfish and 5 crappies implemented in 2005 appears to be working.  Though both bluegills and crappies were sampled in low numbers in 2012, average size was good for both species.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were 10.0/gill net, down from 13.3/gill net in the 2006 survey.  The size of northern pike was relatively small, averaging 17.3\" with only 7% that measured 24\" or larger.  The largest northern pike sampled was just over 36\". <br> \n <br> \nBass, both largemouth and smallmouth, also provide anglers with another opportunity for quality fish.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 84/hr while smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 7/hr while electrofishing.  The average size of largemouth and smallmouth was 12.8\"and 17.1\" respectively.  Sixty-nine percent of the largemouth were 12\" or larger with the largest being 16.7\".  All smallmouth were over 12\" with the largest being 18.1\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been purchased and stocked in the past by the lake association.  Due to the high numbers of northern pike and bass this has resulted in a low numbers but quality sized fish population.  There were only 2 walleyes sampled in the survey but the sizes of these fish were 25\" and 25.9\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullheads, yellow perch, and various minnow species.  <br> \n</p>",

The reduced daily limit began in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies ranged in length from 7.5 to 12.3 inches.  Average length was 9.4 inches and 57% of the crappies measured 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills ranged in length from 4.3 to 9.8 inches.  Average length was 8.2 inches and 94% of the Bluegills measured 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe five crappie and five sunfish daily limits have been successful in maintaining the quality panfish angling opportunities in Goodrich Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goodrich lake is a 360 acre lake located 5 miles northeast of Crosslake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet and water clarity is very good.  Much of the shoreline has waterlilies with emergents scattered in small patches around the lake.  A mixed forest of hardwood and conifer exists around much of the lake with moderate development of cottages, homes and one boy scout camp on the lake.The lake is primarily a northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish lake.  Walleye have been stocked yearly but have contributed little to the fishery.Walleye catch rate of 1.8 fish/net is considered in the normal range for this lake type.  Sizes ranged from 20.1 to 27.4 inches.All fish except one were at least 10 years old.  Walleyes have been stocked annually for 11 years.  Consequently, survival of stocked fish is extremely low.  Northern pike numbers of 8.3 fish/net is considered in the normal range for this lake class type, and is quite similar to past nettings.  Average size was 17.9 inches and weighed 1.4 lbs.  The maximum size observed was 29.2 inches.  Largemouth bass were observed in moderate numbers with sizes ranging from 8.2 to 16.1 inches.  Black crappie populations have historically been good.  The catch rate of 4.2 fish/trap net in 1999 is normal for this lake type.  Sizes ranged from 4.5 to 12.4 inches.  Bluegill were represented in average numbers with a catch rate of 41.3/trap net and sizes ranging from 3.2 to 8.1 inches. Average size was 6.2 inches.  Yellow perch were found present only in seine hauls.  The abundant northern pike population and low perch abundance makes it difficult to maintain a walleye fishery when both species prefer perch and without a buffer (yellow perch) northern pike probably feed on the young walleyes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Goodrich Lake was conducted on August 17-18, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured nineteen species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data will be combined with a trap net and gill net data survey planned in 2024 to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nThese results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goodrich is a 360 acre lake located near Crosslake in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the western shallower basin.  Goodrich reaches depths of 35', with 66% less than 15' deep.  Water clarity is good with a Secchi disk reading of 14.0'.  Goodrich has a 5 fish possession limit for both crappies and sunfish.  The intent of this regulation is to preserve the high quality of the crappie and sunfish populations.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in low numbers in trap nets (6.9/net) when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 6.3\" with 40% measuring at least 7\" in length.  Bluegills captured in gill nets averaged 8.4\" with 92% measuring at least 7\" in length.  <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in high numbers in gill nets at 5.2/net.  Average length was nice at 10.2\".  The trap net catch of 1.4/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 9.4\".  For both gears combined 89% measured at least 8\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 117.7/hr run-time.  Average length was 12.6\" with 71% measuring at least 12\" in length.  The gill net catch of 2.0/net was high, with an average length of 13.0\".  Eight smallmouth bass were sampled during the electrofishing survey.  Lengths ranged from 18.0\" to 19.2\" with an average of 18.6\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 10.8/gill net.  Most ran on the small side, with an average length of 18.9\".  Northern pike at least 24\" in length made up only 8% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked by the DNR, but are occasionally stocked as fingerlings by the lake association.  The last stocking took place in 2016.  The walleye gill net catch was average at 0.8/gill net.  All fish were over 20\" with an average length of 21.8\". <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Goodrich Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
