                "narrative": "<p>The special assessment started on October 21, 2013 was conducted to verify the presence of Lake Whitefish in Harriet Lake.  One whitefish was sampled in the initial investigation of Harriet Lake on July 26, 1951 weighing 1.6 pounds.   A September 14, 1971 assessment captured one whitefish (10+ inches).  An October 30, 1980 special investigation captured a 4.0 pound female and 4.5 pound male whitefish.  Whitefish had last been collected in 1981 when a commercial fisherman was permitted to fish Harriet Lake, from 09/24 to 10/30 with pond net (12'x12'x8'), capturing 500 pounds of whitefish averaging five pounds.  There were no whitefish sampled from 1984 to 2009 in standard sampling in Harriet Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSix large-frame trap nets were set on 10/21/2013 at locations in the southern half of the lake.  Steep dropping shoal areas made sampling much of shoreline with these nets difficult.  The three whitefish caught were 19.6 inches (2.9 pounds), 19.4 inches (2.9 pounds) and 22.4 inches (4.1 pounds).  Also sampled were seven walleye (17.4 to 22.7 inches), seven northern pike (20.1 to 36.6 inches), one black crappie 7.0 inches and two white suckers. <br> \n</p>",

Data collected during this survey will be used by the MPCA as part of an assessment of surface waters in the Lake Superior North Watershed. At the time of this survey, the TDO3 value was 20.8 degrees Celsius. This indicates that oxythermal habitat was poor for Lake Whitefish and failed to meet the water quality standard of a TDO3 of 17.2 degrees Celsius or less for lakes that support Lake Whitefish currently proposed by the MPCA. Lake Whitefish were last sampled in Harriet Lake during late fall of 2013 as part of a targeted survey of the population. Prior to that, the last time Lake Whitefish were sampled was in the fall of 1980. In both cases, the numbers of fish sampled were small.  </p>",

White Sucker removal should be done again possibly starting in 1982.     The lake will be checked in the fall of 1981 to determine the population status of whitefish, which are in the lake in unknown numbers. Test netting in the late fall of 1980 caught a 4.5 pound male and 4.0 pound female. According to cabin owners large schools of whitefish are seen surface feeding in the summer.          </p>",

A no fee USFS campground is located here with ample space for parking. The old access is a carry-in on the south end of the lake, west bay. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye population was well above average for the lake class with a catch of 16 fish per net although this catch was similar to past investigations on Harriet Lake. The average length was 13.8 inches with 26% of the catch larger than 17 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were above average for this lake class; although the average length of 18.2 inches was below average. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch numbers were well above average (7.5 per lift) but their average size was only 6.7 inches and no perch greater than 9.0 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were again sampled in the 2009 investigation.  It appears sporadic reproduction provides a self-sustaining population at low abundance levels.  The crappies tend to grow fast and attain a nice average size in Harriet Lake. <br> \n</p>",

The 1990 gillnet catch showed a 45% increase over the previous catch due primarily to strong Age III & IV year classes which comprised 47% and 26% of the gillnet catch respectively.      The Northern Pike gillnet catch was over 2 times the previous catch, however still within the historical range.      White Sucker continue to thrive, and combined with the abundant predator population, this may be suppressing the Yellow Perch densities.     Black Crappie are present but historical catches indicate conditions exist that limit their numbers.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harriet Lake is a 265 acre lake located within the Superior National Forest about 13 miles northwest of Schroeder. There is a public boat access with concrete log ramp and dock located at the US Forest Service no fee rustic campground off Lake County 7 with parking for about five vehicles and trailers. Walleye and Northern Pike are two popular gamefish that anglers are most likely to target while fishing on the lake. Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are also present, but not often targeted by anglers because the crappie are not very abundant and the perch are small. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch of 26.17 per gill net was above the normal range for similar lakes and above the average of nine previous surveys of Harriet Lake. These fish ranged from 6.9 to 23.0 inches long with an average size of 12.4 inches and 0.78 pounds. Data from the survey show the current population has a diverse size and age structure, which indicates natural reproduction regularly produces adequate year classes. Based on these results, anglers should have good opportunities to catch and harvest 12 to 16 inch Walleye in the coming years with a fair chance for larger fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 4.83 per gill net was also above the normal range for similar lakes and above the average of the nine previous surveys of Harriet Lake. The average size of these fish was 20.4 inches long and 1.86 pounds with the largest pike measuring 25 inches long. The size structure of the catch was similar to previous surveys that have sampled relatively few pike longer than 24 inches. Although not a destination for trophy pike, anglers should continue to have opportunities to catch and harvest modest sized pike in the future. <br> \n <br> \nA few Black Crappie were again sampled in 2022, which is similar to each of the nine previous surveys of the lake. These results indicate a low density population continues to persist in Harriet Lake through sporadic recruitment. The low abundance may make it difficult to catch a limit of crappie, but anglers that target them might be able to catch a few.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Yellow Perch are important forage species sampled in the lake and not historically targeted by anglers. The 2022 survey found White Suckers in normal abundance and Yellow Perch in high abundance for similar lakes. However, all perch were less than nine inches long and not likely of interest to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harriet Lake is located 13 miles northwest of Schroeder in the Superior National Forest. There is a concrete back in boat access along with a no fee USFS rustic campground with 6 sites present.  Contact the USFS Tofte district at 218-663-8060 or check the Superior NF website for information on camping and activities in the Superior NF.  The lake has an area of 265 acres and a maximum depth of 37 feet.  Walleye are the primary management species with Northern Pike considered a secondary management species.  The fish community is sustained by natural reproduction as no stocking is done on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nHarriet Lake is one of the Finland Area Lakes that is also surveyed by the Fond du Lac (FdL) Band and the 1854 Authority.  FdL biologists performed an assessment of adult spawning Walleye using night electrofishing in the spring of 2017.  As part of this investigation, colored wire tags were placed near the back of the dorsal fin on all Walleye greater than 10 inches to calculate a population estimate for the lake.  These population estimates are used to set tribal harvest quotas in lakes within the 1854 ceded territory.  Although Harriet Lake was declared for possible tribal harvest in 2017, no fish were taken.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2017 to update the status of the fish community, evaluate current management goals, and provide information to direct future management activities.  The Walleye gill net catch in six sets of 7.7/net was slightly higher than average when compared to other similar lakes, but the lowest catch on Harriet Lake since 1973.  Average weight and length was 1.1 pounds was 13.8 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 26.3 inches long and weighed 6.1 pounds.  Walleye recruitment was consistent with no exceptionally strong year classes.  In conversations with people fishing on the lake, they stated that Walleye fishing had been poor in 2017.  We explained that most of the Walleye we sampled had bellies full of young-of-the-year perch, which is likely why the bite was difficult. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch of 5.3/net was above average compared to similar lakes and nearly equaled the historical high catch.  The average weight and length was 1.8 pounds and 20 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 31.7 inches long and weighed 7.5 pounds.  Age analysis found consistent natural reproduction with 2013 by far the strongest year class representing 36% of the aged fish.  Growth rate of Northern Pike is average for the Finland Area.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch of 0.6/net was about average for the lake class.  The average length and weight was 10.8 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 12 inches long and weighed 1.2 pounds.  Growth rate of Black Crappie is average for the Finland Area, and like most of the lakes in the Finland Area, recruitment is very sporadic.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 9.3/net was well above average, as was the trap net catch of 6.2/net, and both were the highest catch rate ever recorded on Harriet Lake.  The largest fish sampled was 8.1 inches long with the majority of the catch around 6 inches long and 0.1 pounds.  Recruitment was consistent with no exceptionally large year classes present.  Growth rate of Yellow Perch is slow for the Finland Area.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch of 9.2/net and trap net catch of 1.3/net were both slightly above average for the lake class.  The average weight of about 2.3 pounds is also slightly above average.  The largest fish sampled was 20.9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the survey were Blacknose Shiner, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, and one Burbot.  A small population of Lake Whitefish are present in Harriet Lake but are rarely sampled, and fall recreational gillnetting is not allowed. <br> \n</p>",

The Walleye taken during the present survey were small and the growth rate slow. The small average size of the Walleye is due to the large numbers of the 1947 year class taken by the gillnets. The slow growth rate is perhaps caused by the short growing season and the relative infertility of the waters, aand is comparable to the growth rate of similar waters in the same region.     White Sucker and Walleye are present in numbers and weight far above the state average even though two gillnets were set below the thermocline and took very few fish. Northern Pike are present in numbers equal to the state average but below the average weight taken per set. The preponderance of young fish taken probably accounts for this difference.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 2004 was above average compared to other lakes in this class.  It is not unusual to catch high numbers of walleye in assessments on Harriet Lake.  Walleye from 7.2 to 28.4 inches (7.8 lb) were sampled, including some fish in the 2 to 3 lb range; however, their average size was small, about 3/4 lb.  It appeared a relatively strong year class had been produced in 2001.  All the walleye in this lake are naturally produced.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers as they had been in the last three assessments.  Historically the average size of northern pike in this lake has been small.  This held true in this assessment where most of the fish collected were smaller than two pounds.  A small number of fish between 2 and 3 pounds were collected.  One very large northern pike (17.4 lb) was sampled in this assessment; however, fish this size are not common in Harriet Lake.Yellow perch are not abundant and most are smaller than anglers would accept.  Fish up to 10.7 inches were sampled; however, over 90% of the yellow perch were smaller than 8 inches.Black crappie were sampled in this assessment and have been taken in many other assessments; however, they have always been sampled in very low numbers.  The size of black crappie has normally been above average and this was the case in 2004 where the average size was 1.2 lb.Harriet Lake has a U.S. Forest Service maintained public access on the south end of the lake with a concrete boat ramp.  Free camping is allowed in a large grassy field near the access.</p>",
