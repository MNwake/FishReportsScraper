                "narrative": "<p>The largemouth bass population is at a low level and the cause is not well understood.  There appears to be pretty good habitat for largemouth bass but they are not responding as we would hope.  Some young-of-the-year largemouth bass were sampled in our shoreline seines in 1993.  Drought conditions throughout the late eighties may have adversly affected the largemouth bass reproduction as well as many prey species.  With increased water levels, we are relatively optimistic that the largemouth bass population will improve.    The walleye population in Sisseton Lake has never been an exceptional fishery and will likely never be one.  However, the number of walleye is about what would be expected for lakes like Sisseton.  The size of walleye in Sisseton Lake has been gradually declining since 1984.  Most walleye are 15 inches or shorter.  This may be a result of angling pressure and lower levels of available food due to the drought and a high freshwater drum population.  The freshwater drum population has decreased substantially and water levels have increased, so hopefully the walleye population will respond accordingly.  We are also investigating other options for managing the walleye population.      Yellow perch populations have also been declining since 1984; however, there are still good numbers of perch up to 9 inches.  In addition to aquatic vegetation, fallen tree branches and trees are important for successful yellow perch reproduction.  The yellow perch population should continue to do well if the habitat necessary for reproduction is not lost.  Yellow perch is one of the main prey fishes in Sisseton Lake so it is important to protect the habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sisseton Lake is located within the city of Fairmont.  Sisseton Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and bluegill.The walleye population was about normal in 1997 when compared to lakes similar to Sisseton.  Walleye numbers were similar to those found in 1993.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10.4 to 19.8 inches and averaged 12.7 inches.  Walleye in Sisseton Lake tend to grow slow, reaching only 9.1 inches in two years.  It will require more investigating to determine why walleye growth is slow.  Sisseton Lake has had one of the better yellow perch populations on the Fairmont Chain.  However, yellow perch numbers declined in each of the last four assessments.  Although yellow perch numbers have decreased, the population is still considered to be normal for lakes of this type.  Yellow perch ranged from 6.5 to 10.2 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Yellow perch have experienced fairly consistent reproduction in Sisseton Lake.  If the spawning habitat is not degraded, yellow perch should bounce back.Bluegill have followed a trend similar to other panfish in the Fairmont Chain.  The number of bluegill caught in trap nets declined from 1984 to 1993 and stayed low from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, bluegill ranged from 4.8 to 8.4 inches and averaged 6.7 inches.  Bluegill do best when abundant vegetation exists and that is not the case in Sisseton Lake.  Adult bluegill spawn near vegetation and after the young hatch, they use it as cover to avoid predators.  The bluegill population will probably remain low unless vegetation can be increased.Sisseton Lake also has fair populations of black crappie and white crappie.  Both species were within the normal range for lakes similar to Sisseton Lake.  Black crappie averaged 8.8 inches while white crappie averaged 9.5 inches.  In addition, a northern pike was caught that was nearly 40 inches.  There were not many northern pike but if you tie in to that \"big dog\" you will know it!Fish communities in the Fairmont Chain have undergone many changes during the last 12 to 15 years.  It appears that in the early 1980's, there was more vegetation, more panfish, and better growth rates of predators.  In addition, there were few common carp and freshwater drum.  Throughout the late 1980's, bullhead, carp, and freshwater drum all increased while nearly all other species decreased or remained stable.  Black bullhead and common carp negative effects on vegetation are well accepted.  In addition, since freshwater drum are opportunistic feeders, they likely compete with other more desirable species and feed on their young of the year.  The available data does not allow us to know whether the increase in bullhead, carp, and drum caused the decrease in gamefish by destroying vegetation and by predation or if the decrease in gamefish allowed the bullhead, carp, and drum to fill a void that was left when the gamefish numbers decreased. Since Sisseton Lake has limited vegetation, it is important to leave overhanging and fallen branches and trees for habitat.  Although yellow perch in particular like to spawn on this type of habitat, many other species can benefit from its presence.  For example, young bluegill, black and white crappie, and largemouth bass all will use this habitat.  Young fish use the cover to hide from predators and feed on the insects that live on the branches.  Many minnow species also spawn on this type of habitat.  In a lake where walleye grow slow, an increase in minnows could become an important part of  their diet.In order to promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Sisseton Lake through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed but lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing lawns down to the lakeshore can also be harmful.  Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sisseton is a 140 acre lake located within the City of Fairmont in Martin County.  This class 24 lake has a maximum depth of 19.0 feet and is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch, bluegill, and channel catfish.  Wilmert, Mud, Amber, Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George lakes are all connected and therefore fish movement is common.  The Fairmont chain of lakes is basically devoid of vegetation due to turbidity.  Sisseton Lake, along with the other lakes, receives moderate to heavy angling pressure because of its close proximity to the city of Fairmont.  Most of the Fairmont chain of lakes has been dredged in varying degrees.  The shoreline of Sisseton has been extensively developed with homes except where high banks preclude development.  The shoreline of Sisseton tends to be dominated by gravel and sand substrates with an occasional overhanging branch.  The overhanging branches and submerged branches provide the only nursery habitat for Age 0 fish and spawning habitat for yellow perch.  The current stocking regime calls for stocking walleye fry and fingerlings.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 20, 2001 and utilized 3 gillnets, 2 trapnets, and 3 seine hauls.The walleye catch rate in gillnets was 0.67/set which was lower than what the fisheries area office expects.  Normal catch rates in gillnets range from 1.17/set  to 6.33/set so the population was somewhat depressed.  The fact that many of the Fairmont chain of lakes are connected and due to the surplus of walleye fingerlings in 2001, walleye fingerlings (447 lbs) were stocked into Budd and Hall lakes.  It is very probable that some of these walleyes will eventually end up in any of the Fairmont chain of lakes.The yellow perch catch rate in gillnets was 5.00/set which was within the normal range and they averaged 7.23 inches in length.  Nearly all of the yellow perch captured were from the 1999 year class.   Efforts to keep or improve yellow perch spawning habitat in the lake (ie. downed branches, submerged and emergent vegetation) should be encouraged by shoreline owners.  Lakeshore owners that have had  branches fall into the water should know this is good yellow perch spawning habitat and good for attracting fish for angling.The 14 adult bluegill sampled averaged 6.60 inches in length.  Bluegill natural reproduction appears to occur often enough to maintain a viable population.  However, due to the lack of submerged vegetation and other nursery habitat, the bluegill population density seems to fluctuate.Only one 12-inch channel catfish was sampled.  According to the stocking records, channel catfish have never been directly stocked into Sisseton Lake.  However, channel catfish have been stocked into Amber (1986) and Hall (1992) which are connected to Sisseton.  Perhaps consideration should be given to stocking channel catfish fingerlings into Sisseton because it is a species of secondary management.  However, according to survey information from the Fairmont chain of lakes, channel catfish natural reproduction has occurred because the determined ages of channel catfish doesn't always correspond to the stocking records. The black crappie catch rate in gillnets was 13.33/set which was by far the highest catch rate ever recorded based on previous surveys.  The lengths of black crappie sampled averaged 8.19 inches.  Three different year classes (1998, 1999, and 2000) were captured with the 1999 year class dominating the catch. The white crappie catch rate in gillnets was similar to the historical catch rate of black crappie with catch rates that were considerably higher than historical surveys.  Total lengths of white crappie captured in gillnets averaged 8.00 inches.  Three different year classes (1998, 1999, and 2000) were captured with the 1999 year class dominating the catch.  The 1999 year class for both black and white crappie was evidently a strong year for natural reproduction.  The size structure of both black and white crappies would convince an angler that their limited fishing hours would be well spent on this lake.Freshwater drum remain consistently abundant in Sisseton and the other Fairmont lakes.  The length frequency of freshwater drum population indicated the population was dominated by smaller individuals.The common carp catch rate in gillnets was 3.33/set which was higher than the upper normal range.  The surveys done on Sisseton since 1993 have had carp catch rates higher than average.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Sisseton Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Other species captured during the survey were black bullheads, white suckers, northern pike, quillback, yellow bullhead, bluntnose minnow, green sunfish, johnny darter, largemouth bass, and  spottail shiner.Prepared by: Ryan Doorenbos        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Sisseton Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 21-22 June 2023.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including four species (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Sisseton Lake in July 2018 resulting in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community in Sisseton Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  These results are similar to previous findings, which indicated that Sisseton Lake was impaired for aquatic life use based on the Fish IBI. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Blue Earth River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sisseton is a 140 acre lake of which 100 acres are 15 feet deep or less.  The lake has a maximum depth of 19.0 feet and is located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  Walleye are managed primarily on the lake while yellow perch, bluegill, channel catfish and crappie are managed secondarily.  Sisseton is stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings and is due to be stocked again in 2006.  Presently the DNR is working with a landowner on the Northeast side of the lake to restore approximately 300 feet of shoreline to natural conditions.Results of our netting in 2005 indicated that the walleye population is similar to other lakes like Sisseton.  The gill net catch rate was 4.0 walleye per net.  An expected catch rate for lakes similar to Sisseton would range from 1.2 to 6.3.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 inches and averaged 12.9 inches.  Three different ages of walleye were sampled during the assessment.  Two of the ages coincided with years we stocked fingerlings while one coincided with a year we stocked walleye fry.Catch rates for yellow perch appeared to be down a little from the last two assessments which were done in 2001 and 1997, however the population is still similar to other lakes like Sisseton.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.9 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.Sisseton has a good crappie population with both white and black crappie present.  An obvious difference between the two is that a white crappie has vertical lines on the body where a black crappie doesn't.  Lengths of crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged from 3.1 to 11.0 inches and aveaged about 9.4 inches.  Four different ages of crappie were sampled during the 2005 assessment.The bluegill trap net catch rate of 2.6 was below the typical range of 7.5 to 62.5 fish per net we would expect for lakes similar to Sisseton.  There were some very nice bluegill captured in our nets however.  Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 9.2 inches and the average weight was 0.5 pounds.  Six different ages of bluegill were captured in trap nets indicating that they have good reproductive success.This was the first time since 1997 channel catfish were sampled in trap nets in Sisseton.  Lengths of channel catfish ranged from 19.5 to 25.8 inches and averaged 4.4 pounds.  Six of the fish aged were eight years old while one fish was nine years of age.Other species sampled included largemouth bass, black bullheads, freshwater drum, carp, yellow bullheads, white suckers, and golden shiners.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Sisseton Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nSisseton Lake is a 139-acre, with a maximum depth of 19 feet, located in the City of Fairmont in Martin County. Sisseton Lake is part of the Fairmont chain-of-lakes which includes Amber, Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George lakes.  Sisseton Lake's gravel and sand shoreline substrate with abundant woody debris provides good habitat for fish and invertebrates. Angling intensity is typically high due to its urban setting.  Sisseton Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge and secondarily for Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Channel Catfish, and Crappie.  A combination of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked since 2004, with the current stocking calling for Walleye fingerlings to be stocked every other year (2018, 2020, 2022, &) at one pound per littoral acre. A standard fish survey was conducted during the week of August 21, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE   <br> \nThe catch rate of 2.5 per gill net was within the expected range (1.2 to 6.3 per gill net) for similar lakes, and was equivalent to the long-term catch rate of 2.4 per gill net. Historically, catch rates have varied from 1 per gill net in 2001 and 2013 to 4 per gill net in 2005.  Because the gill net catch rate was equivalent to the long-term average, Walleyes may be more abundant than usual in Sisseton Lake. Size structure of Walleyes favored larger fish, as Walleyes ranged from 16 to 25 inches in gill nets and trap nets and averaged just over 17 inches in the gill net sample and 25 inches in the trap net sample. <br> \n  <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nHistorically, Bluegill catch rates in Sisseton Lake have been low. Bluegill catch rates have ranged from about 1 per trap net in 1993 to 19.5 per trap net in 1984 and have averaged just under 7 per trap net since 1984. More recently, since 2001, the trap net catch rate has only fluctuated from a low of 2.6 in 2005 to a high of 9.7 in the 2018 sampling. The 2018 catch rate of 9.7 per trap net is a positive sign that increased stocking and potential habitat improvements are helping Bluegill.  The Fairmont Lakes Foundation (the local lake association) has purchased and stocked Bluegill through a permit from the Minnesota DNR in 2015 and 2018.  These fish have been able to reproduce because young fish are now present.  Bluegill ranged in length from just under 4 inches to just over 8 inches with an average length of 7 inches in the trap net sample.  Bluegills typically do well in lakes that are relatively clear and have abundant aquatic vegetation. Sisseton Lake's turbid water and lack of aquatic vegetation may be preventing the Bluegill population from attaining a higher abundance, but reproduction and an increasing catch rate are encouraging.  Stocking of adult Bluegill will continue through a partnership with the Fairmont Lakes Foundation.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has steadily declined since surveys began in 1984, going from a high of 79 per gill net in 1984 to a low of 3 per gill net in 2005 and averaging 23.9 per gill net. In 2018, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 4 per gill net.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from just under 6 inches to nearly 9 inches and averaged 7 inches in trap nets.  Yellow Perch appear to be doing ok, but there is some concern that the recently established Yellow Bass are competing with Yellow Perch.  A diet study was done for Yellow Perch, Yellow Bass, and Black Crappie during August 2018 from fish in the trap net and gill net samples.  It was determined that Yellow Perch and Yellow Bass have a highly similar diet.  With a similar diet, they will directly compete with one another for food when food is limited.  More information will be collected in other months to determine if this is a seasonal observation or something more.   <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nBlack Crappie and White Crappie populations have been highly variable in Sisseton Lake. Black Crappie abundance has ranged from 0 per trap net in 1984 to 12 per trap net in 2001, and has averaged 4.5 per trap net over that time. White Crappie abundance has ranged from just above 0 per trap net in 1993 to 46.5 per tap net in 2001, and has averaged just above 10 per trap net. In 2018, catch rates of both Black and White Crappies were within expected ranges at 10.2 per trap net and 0.7 per trap net, respectively.  It appears that the Black Crappie population is dominated by 1 year class in the 8.5 to 9.5 inch range, with two additional year classes present in low numbers. The White Crappie population also appears to be dominated by a single year class in the 9 to 11 inch range, with only 1 fish outside that range. Lengths of Black Crappies ranged from just under 6 to 12 inches and averaged nearly 9 inches. Lengths of White Crappies ranged from just above 6 inches to over 10.5 inches and averaged 9 inches. Both Black and White Crappie appeared healthy indicating that they are foraging successfully. Crappies do well in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes and should be the most abundant sportfish for anglers to target.  Some large Crappies could be caught, with the ability to catch a limit of 10 from time-to-time. <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \nChannel Catfish were first sampled in Sisseton Lake in 1997, and have been increasing in abundance ever since. The 2018 catch rate of 2.5 per gill net for Channel Catfish was the second highest catch rate since surveys began in 1984. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 17 to 23 inches and averaged 20 inches.  Channel Catfish populations tend to be increasing throughout southwest Minnesota, so it is not surprising to see an increase in abundance in Sisseton Lake. Studies suggest that Channel Catfish may be highly effective at controlling black bullhead populations, which may account for the low catch rates of black bullheads in Sisseton Lake.  Channel Catfish have not been stocked since 1992 in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes and are now self-sustaining.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW BASS <br> \nYellow Bass are a recent likely illegal introduction to the Fairmont chain-of-lakes first documented in Hall Lake in 2013.  They were most likely stocked by someone dumping them in with a bucket from another Lake.  Since that time they have expanded within all the lakes, except Amber Lake.  The gill net catch rate in Sisseton Lake was 73 per net which is the greatest catch rate observed on any of the Fairmont chain-of-lakes.  The trap net catch rate was 3.1, indicating Yellow Bass were found mainly offshore in August.  The average length of Yellow Bass caught in gill nets was just over 7.5 inches and was 8 inches in trap nets with fish ranging in length from 6 to just shy of 11 inches.  Additionally, there are 3 ages of Yellow Bass present from 2013, 2016, and 2017 indicating that natural reproduction is occurring.  A diet analysis was done for Yellow Bass, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie and it was determined that Yellow Bass and Yellow Perch have a highly similar diet while Black Crappie are different.  With a similar diet, Yellow Bass will directly compete with Yellow Perch for food when food is scarce.  More samples from additional months will be taken to further analyze the potential impact of Yellow Bass in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes.  However, at this point, there is some indication that Yellow Perch will be the most vulnerable species.  Regardless, there should be an excellent angling opportunity for Yellow Bass in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes as they are fun to catch and excellent to eat.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOther species sampled in Sisseton Lake during 2018 were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  These species are typical of southwest Minnesota and can become major components of the fishery especially Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and Freshwater Drum.  Freshwater Drum can be fun to catch and they are excellent to eat.  Please consider keeping Freshwater Drum, as harvest of this species will be good for the lake.     <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls and electrofishing captured 13 species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=16), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=1), Bluegill (N=107), Channel Catfish (N=1), Bluntnose Minnow (N=7), Green Sunfish (N=14), Hybrid Sunfish (N=2), Largemouth Bass (N=103), Spotfin Shiner (N=105), Spottail Shiner (N=1), Yellow Bullhead (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=5). Natural Reproduction exists for some of the species in Sisseton Lake, as young-of-the-year Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Sisseton Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye have been managed for many years in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes. Past stockings have included Walleye fry, fingerling, yearlings, and adults. Essentially, whatever life stage of Walleye was available they would be stocked into the lakes. However, since 2019 the Fairmont chain-of-lakes has been stocked with Walleye fry from the Lake Sarah egg take operation. Other southwest Minnesota lakes saw good success when Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2023. Therefore, daytime electrofishing was conducted in September to determine if Walleye fry stocking was successful on Sisseton Lake, Budd Lake, and Hall Lake. One 15 minute station was done on each lake.  <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-seven age-0 Walleye were captured on Sisseton (N=16), Hall (N=5), and Budd (N=6) Lakes. Catch rates varied from lake-to-lake; 57.6 per hour on Sisseton Lake, 22.9 per hour on Budd Lake, and 20.0 per hour on Hall Lake. However, the overall catch rate for the chain-of-lakes after 45 minutes of electrofishing was 36.0 per hour. It has been determined from previous Minnesota age-0 Walleye electrofishing that a fall electrofishing catch rate over 30 per hour has a good chance of resulting in a fishable year-class of Walleye for anglers 2 or 3 years later. Additionally, the average length of Walleye was 8.1 inches in Sisseton Lake, 8.2 inches in Budd Lake, and 7.9 inches in Hall Lake. When Walleye reach lengths exceeding 6 inches in their first year of growth, there is a good chance that they will survive the winter and avoid predation. A gill net and trap net survey was conducted on Sisseton Lake in August 2023 and age-0 fish were very abundant with 10 out of 14 caught in gill nets from the newly stocked 2023 year class. All that to state, there is a great chance that the 2023 Walleye year-class on the Fairmont chain-of-lakes will result in an abundant fishable population for anglers, only time will tell.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sisseton Lake is a 139-acre, class 24 lake, located in the City of Fairmont, in Martin County. Sisseton Lake is part of the Fairmont chain-of-lakes which includes Amber, Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George lakes. Sisseton Lake has a maximum depth of 19.0 feet, which is relatively deep for southwest Minnesota lake. Residential development has altered much of the Fairmont chain-of-lake's shoreline and many areas are altered with rock rip-rap or sand blankets. Additionally, a relatively large agricultural watershed contributes high nutrient runoff to the Fairmont chain-of-lakes as well.  Sisseton Lake's gravel and sand shoreline substrate with abundant woody debris provides some habitat for fish and invertebrates. Angling pressure on the Fairmont chain-of-lakes is typically high due to its urban setting. Sisseton Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge and secondarily for Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Crappie. A combination of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked since 2004, with the current stocking regime calling for Walleye fry to be stocked annually with fingerlings, yearlings, or adults stocked when they are available. During the winter of 2022-2023, Sisseton Lake experienced a partial winterkill, like many Windom area lakes.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 14, 2023 to monitor fish populations using 2 gill nets and 8 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nEighteen species of fish were captured. Freshwater Drum, Walleye, and White Sucker were the most abundant species by percent biomass with 26.8%, 13.2% and 10.6% respectively.  Channel Catfish (9.9%), Yellow Bass (9.0%), Black Crappie (6.6%), Northern Pike (6.3%), and Bigmouth Buffalo (5.5%) were the only other species with a biomass above 5%.  These values may be indicative of true abundance, but caution should be used, and comparison of 2023 catch rates should be made in relation to historical catch rates to observe true trends for each species. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch rate of 7.5 per gill net was the greatest ever observed and the first time Lake Sisseton ever had a gill net catch rate exceed the normal range for class 24 lakes.  Also, the gill net catch rate was more than twice the long-term catch rate of 3.0 per gill net. Historically, catch rates have varied from 0.7 per gill net in 2001 and 2013 to 4.0 per gill net in 2005.  Walleye from 5 different age groups were sampled. Age-0 fish were very abundant with 10 out of 14 caught in gill nets from the newly stocked 2023 year class. Therefore, size structure of Walleyes favored small fish with individuals ranging in length from 6.8 to 26.4 inches in gill nets and trap nets. Health of fish was good indicating Walleye are finding adequate food. Historically, minus the recent several years, stocking strategies for Walleye utilized in Sisseton Lake resulted in gill net catch rates from 1 to a high of 4 per gill net.  So far, recent annual fry stocking appears to be boosting the population. However, the Fairmont chain-of-lakes has limited spawning habitat for Walleye and continued fry stocking will determine the true success of Walleye management in Lake Sisseton. But, so-far-so-good!    <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge have been managed in Sisseton Lake, and the entire Fairmont chain-of-lakes, since 2016.  Muskie fingerling have been stocked in even years with 314 fingerling in each year, except 2020 due to COVID related shutdown of spring egg take operations (2016, 2018, and 2022).  To make up for the missed stocking in 2020, the Fairmont chain-of-lakes was stocked in 2021. One 37 inch Muskie was sampled in a trap net on the south side of Sisseton Lake during the summer of 2023.  Additionally, anglers are reporting catching several larger (near or above 40 inches) muskies over the past several years. A large frame trap net survey is scheduled to be conducted on the Fairmont chain-of-lakes in 2024 with recapture surveys in 2025 and 2026 (if necessary).  Continued Muskie management will help to add a consistent top level predator to the Fairmont chain-of-lakes that was sorely missing. Angling opportunities for trophy Muskie are just starting on the Fairmont chain-of-lakes! <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Bluegill catch rates in Sisseton Lake have been low, not surpassing the upper normal value (23.1 per trap net) in any survey. Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 0.9 per trap net in 1993 to 19.5 per trap net in 1984 and have averaged 6.5 per trap net since 1984. More recently, since 2001, the trap net catch rate has only fluctuated from a low of 2.6 in 2005 to a high of 9.7 in the 2018 sampling. The 2023 catch rate (3 per trap net) is a sign that the Bluegill population may be on a downturn. Bluegill ranged in length from 2.2 to 9.1 inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches in the trap net sample.  Many adult Bluegill were present, but some young fish caught indicate that natural reproduction is occurring, and could be a positive sign for the future.  Body condition of Bluegill was very good indicating that plenty of food is available. While the population metrics do appear encouraging, additional stocking may be warranted to boost the population and add additional spawning stock. The Fairmont Lakes Foundation (lake association) has purchased and stocked Bluegill through a free permit from the Minnesota DNR in 2014 and 2018.  Bluegill typically do well in lakes that are relatively clear and have abundant aquatic vegetation. Sisseton Lake's recent surge in aquatic vegetation due to an increase in curly-leaf pondweed in May and June may actually be a benefit to the Bluegill population by providing potential nursery habitat for young Bluegill.  Stocking of adult Bluegill may continue through a partnership with the Fairmont Lakes Foundation or via DNR stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has steadily declined since surveys began in 1984, going from a high of 79.0 per gill net in 1984 to a low of 3.0 per gill net in 2005 and averaging 21.9 per gill net. In 2023, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 6 per gill net, which is within the normal range (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net) for class 24 lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6.5 to 8.0 inches and averaged 7.2 inches in trap nets.  Condition of Yellow Perch was good, indicating ample food is available. However, there is some concern that the recently established Yellow Bass are competing with Yellow Perch.  A diet determination was made for Yellow Perch, Yellow Bass, and Black Crappie during August 2018 from fish in the trap net and gill net samples. It was determined that Yellow Perch and Yellow Bass have a highly similar diet.  With a similar diet, they will directly compete with one another for food.  More information will be collected with netting surveys in the future to determine if these species will co-exist over the long haul.   <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, catch rates of both Black Crappie and White Crappie were extremely different. Black Crappie catch rate was the greatest ever observed at 16.4 per trap net, although still within the normal range (1.8 to 21.2 per trap net), while White Crappie catch rate of 0.13 per trap net was the lowest ever observed and less than the normal range (0.5 to 6.5 per trap net).  In Sisseton Lake, it appears that the Black Crappie population is dominated by 2 strong year classes, a year class in the 3.5 to 5 inch range and one in the 9 to 11 inch range, with 1 additional year class present from 6 to 8 inches in low numbers (from length frequency estimation). Nothing can be said about White Crappie size structure with only a single fish sampled in gill nets and trap nets. Body condition was high for Black Crappie, indicating that they are feeding successfully. Crappies do well in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes and should be the most abundant sportfish for anglers to target, other than Yellow Bass.  Some large Crappies could be caught, with the ability to catch a limit from time-to-time. <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were first sampled in Sisseton Lake in 1997 and their abundance peaked in 2013 with 6.7 per gill net. The 2023 catch rate of 2 per gill net was the third highest catch rate. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 9 to 28 inches and averaged 13.5 inches in gill nets and 20 inches in trap nets. Body condition of Channel Catfish was average, indicating that Channel Catfish are finding food but may experience some stress. Channel Catfish populations tend to be stable or increasing throughout southwest Minnesota, so it is not surprising to see them doing well in Sisseton Lake. Studies suggest that Channel Catfish may be highly effective at controlling black bullhead populations, which may account for the low catch rates of black bullheads (0 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net) in Sisseton Lake. Channel Catfish are not stocked and will not be stocked in Sisseton Lake so the current and future population will be self-sustaining.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW BASS <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bass were first documented in Hall Lake in February of 2013. It is suspected that they were illegally stocked by a private individual. Since that time they have expanded to all of the Fairmont chain-of-lakes.  The gill net catch rate in Sisseton Lake was 83 per gill net in 2023.  The trap net catch rate was 2.6, indicating Yellow Bass were found mainly offshore in August.  The average length of Yellow Bass caught in gill nets was 7.5 inches and was 8.8 inches in trap nets with fish ranging in length from just under 6 to just over 10 inches.  There appears to be 2 strong year classes of fish with 1 ranging in length from 6 to 7 inches and 1 ranging from 8 to 9.5 inches.  A diet analysis was made for Yellow Bass, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie in 2018 from fish in the trap net and gill net samples and it was determined that Yellow Bass and Yellow Perch have a highly similar diet while Black Crappie are different.  With a similar diet, Yellow Bass will directly compete with Yellow Perch for food.  More samples from additional months need to be collected to further analyze the potential impact of Yellow Bass in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes.  However, at this point, there is some indication that Yellow Perch will be the most vulnerable species.  Regardless, there should be an excellent angling opportunity for Yellow Bass in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes and they are fun to catch and excellent tasting fish.    <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Sisseton Lake during 2023 were 6 Bigmouth Buffalo, 2 Black Bullhead, 7 Common Carp, 161 Freshwater Drum, 23 Golden Shiner, 14 Largemouth Bass, 5 Northern Pike, 1 Quillback, 21 White Sucker, and 15 Yellow Bullhead. Of particular note is the high prevalence of Freshwater Drum in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes. Freshwater Drum gill net catch rates have been above the normal range (4.0 to 32.25 per gill net) since 2018. Additional sampling will continue to track each of the species and determine their relative abundance.         <br> \n</p>",
