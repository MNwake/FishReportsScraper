                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish Lake is located about one mile northeast of Pinewood off County Road 5.  Access is an earthen ramp off an extended forest road.  It is in class 31 which is a group of about 140 lakes with primary distribution in north-central Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes in this class include Black, Julia, Deer, Little Wolf and Upper LaSalle.  These lakes are typically small with regular (few bays) shorelines and very hard water.      Whitefish Lake has a history of very low oxygen levels during winter months and has been opened to unlimited fishing several times though winterkills have not been documented. There is one home on the lake with minimal pollution/erosion within the watershed.  Winter fishing for panfish and crappies plus some   darkhouse spearing for northern pike is dependent on snow and ice conditions.  Because of the potential for winterkill, the lake management plan does not recommend fish stocking except after documented winterkills.    Black and brown bullheads are abundant in Whitefish Lake.  The black bullhead population is 18 times the class average in abundance.  Brown bullheads are near the lake class average in abundance and have an average length of 6.5 inches.  Very few bullheads larger than 7 inches were captured.  The size of either bullhead species is too small to be acceptable to anglers or commercial fish removal.    Bluegill abundance has fallen since the 1982 assessment, but the average length of 8.6 inches is attractive to anglers.  No small panfish were captured indicating poor success with reproduction or survival of young.    Black crappie are near the class median in abundance and weigh about 0.6 pounds.  Average length is 9.9 inches.    Northern pike abundance is well below that of comparable lakes.  Average length is 16.3 inches and the average weight is 0.6 pounds.  About half of the pike captured had a parasite called Neascus.  This parasite is unsightly but not dangerous for human consumption.     Yellow perch abundance has declined since the 1982 assessment though it is still within the normal range for this lake class.  The average length of 7.1 inches is not large enough to make them acceptable to anglers.  Average weight is about 0.2 pounds.    Largemouth bass were stocked in the lake in 1986.  They may be present, but they have not been documented during two assessments.      The Whitefish Lake fishery shows signs of a population recovery from a partial winterkill.   Species such as bass and bluegill are most seriously affected since they show the least tolerance for low winter oxygen levels.  Northern pike are quite active under these conditions and may escape the lake through the outlet when oxygen declines.  Black bullhead are quite tolerant of low oxygen and are capable of responding with a population explosion to fill the void vacated by game fish species.  The resulting abnormally high bullhead population may successfully suppress game fish reproduction for years to come.</p>",

There is a County-owned public water access located on the northeast shore of the lake with an earthen ramp and parking for 3 vehicles/trailers.  Whitefish Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill and Black Crappie, with Walleye managed as a secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.  Whitefish Lake is in lake class 31.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Whitefish Lake and other class 31 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Julia, Little Wolf, and Deer Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhitefish Lake is managed as an occasional winterkill lake, although extensive winterkill of fish has not occurred in some time.  The 2015 survey documented a variety of sizes and ages of many of the gamefish species found in the lake, which indicates that those populations of fish are surviving, reproducing successfully and exhibiting good growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill trap net catch rate of 9.33/trap net was within the normal range of 6.14/trap net to 46.60/trap net for class 31 lakes.  The average size of Bluegill captured was 7.38 inches in length, with fish up to 9.21 inches in length captured in the survey.  A good portion of the trap net catch exceeded 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2015 survey.  The catch rate of 20.92 bass per hour was wasn't the highest measured in the Bemidji area but shows a good population of Largemouth Bass in Whitefish Lake.  Bass captured ranged from 9.61 inches to 18.03 inches in length with an average size of 15.18 inches in length.   <br> \nThe 2015 catch rate for Northern Pike was 10.33/gill net, which was near the top of the range for class 31 lakes (3.5/gill net to 10.5/gill net).  The average size of Pike captured in the survey was 19.81 inches in length and 2.20 lbs/fish with pike up to 36.14 inches in length present. <br> \n <br> \nWhitefish Lake is stocked with Walleye fry on alternate years and has provided some Walleye fishing opportunity at times.  The 2015 survey showed few Walleye in the lake.  The catch rate (0.50/gill net) was below the normal range of 1.33/gill net to 5.0/gill net for class 31 lakes.  Walleye numbers in Whitefish Lake have declined since the most recent assessment in 2007 (2.33/gill net).  Walleye anglers may want to consider one of the many other lakes in the Bemidji area that have more consistent Walleye fishing than Whitefish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were also below the normal range for class 31 lakes and down from historic surveys.  The few Black Crappie captured in the survey (6 total) measured up to 11.97 inches in length.  As with Walleye, anglers seeking Black Crappie may want to give Whitefish Lake a pass and focus their efforts on one of the many other quality crappie lakes in the Bemidji Area. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2015 survey were Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Brown Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish Lake is located one mile northeast of Pinewood in southwestern Beltrami County.  There is a county-owned earthen carry-in access on the northeast corner of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Whitefish Lake is in lake class 31.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, with hard water, and are regular-shaped (few bays). Lakes in this class generally do not winterkill very frequently and have relatively stable fish communities.   <br> \n <br> \nWhitefish Lake is an exception. Oxygen testing has documented periodic winterkill, which has been the limiting factor affecting species composition and abundance of fish in this lake. Lakes that periodically winterkill favor species that are more tolerant of low oxygen levels, such as black bullhead and northern pike. Pike are numerous in Whitefish with fair numbers of fish in the size range (24-30 inch) anglers like to harvest. Black bullhead are very abundant which may at times be a nuisance for live bait anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nSpecies in the centrarchid family, such as largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and rock bass are less tolerant of low oxygen conditions. Many of those species are present in Whitefish Lake with naturally reproducing populations, indicating that it has been many years since a serious winterkill.  Anglers should have success catching sunfish and black crappie. Bluegill up to 9 inches and black crappie up to 11 inches were sampled in 2007.  Largemouth bass were not sampled and though reintroduced a number of years ago it appears they were not able to reestablish a sustainable population.  <br> \n <br> \nIn recent years walleye fry have been stocked to provide an additional angling opportunity. Walleye fry stocking is a relatively inexpensive means of augmenting a fishery where there is a chance of future winterkill.  The effort seems to be working with a variety of sizes and ages ranging from 10-25 inches, and most of the sample was within the prime 15-20 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are common but the dominant sizes (5-7 inch) are most suitable as northern pike and walleye forage.  Few perch are attaining sizes anglers are looking to harvest.  <br> \n</p>",
