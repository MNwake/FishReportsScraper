A few large fish were taken, but most of the fish present appeared to be from a strong 1994 year class, which averaged only 3.5 inches in length by mid-summer.  Bluegill stockings in the early-1990's may have contributed to the number of larger bluegill present in the lake, but some were also produced naturally.  Large numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish were also collected, and a few were large enough to be of interest to anglers.Northern pike were abundant and some large fish had been produced.  Northern pike growth was about average for the area, despite their high numbers.  The walleye catch was about average for lakes of this class, but some large fish were also produced.  Most, if not all, of the walleye collected had been produced naturally.  Yellow perch were abundant, and provided an excellent forage base for northern pike and walleye, as well as providing some fish large enough to interest anglers.</p>",

A naturally produced walleye population of small-to-moderate size was present.  Walleye growth rates were about average, but a few large individuals were present.  Yellow perch were abundant and provided forage for northern pike and walleye.  The perch population exhibited consistent reproduction, a wide range of sizes, and some large individuals.Bluegill abundance was about average for lakes of this class.  Reproduction had been inconsistent, and at the time of the survey most bluegill were young, so average size was small.  A few fish over 6 inches were present.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were abundant, but also exhibited inconsistent reproductive success.  As a result, average size can be expected to vary over the years.  The largest individuals exceeded 6.5 inches.</p>",

YELLOW PERCH ARE ABUNDANT, AND LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE GOOD FISHING OPPORTUNITY. SEVERAL STRONG YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT, AND GROWTH IS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. BLUEGILL, INTRODUCED IN 1978, HAVE SURVIVED AND REPRODUCED. ONLY ONE YEAR CLASS WAS SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT, BUT GROWTH WAS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. PUMPKINSEED ARE ABUNDANT, BUT GENERALLY TOO SMALL TO INTEREST ANGLERS; ONLY 13% OF THE PUMPKINSEED SAMPLED WERE OVER 6 IN. NORTHERN PIKE ARE ABUNDANT, BUT GENERALLY SMALL. FROM THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION IT APPEARS THAT SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT AND REPRO- DUCTION IS GOOD.</p>",
