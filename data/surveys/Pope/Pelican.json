                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a moderately shallow, 519-acre lake located in central Pope County near the towns of Glenwood and Long Beach.  The Lake is within the Chippewa River watershed with water entering Pelican Lake from Trapper's Run creek.  Pelican Lake is connected to Lake Minnewaska via a heavily vegetated channel, which passes under State Highway 29. Maximum depth is 34 feet; 80% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Both water quality and associated clarity are considered poor during summer months. Aquatic vegetation is very dense in the lake's shallow bays, and has potential to limit recreational activity especially during late summer.  Most of the shoreline remains fairly undeveloped and is comprised of woodlands and marsh areas. A public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake.  Pelican Lake is prone to low dissolved oxygen levels during winter months.   Pelican Lake is primarily managed for sunfish and largemouth bass, but walleyes are stocked to maintain a \"bonus\" fishery.  Based on past survey results there is evidence of limited natural reproduction within Lake Pelican, but because of poor water quality and lack of favorable spawning habitat, a viable fishery is only possible through stocking efforts.  Fingerling stocking is accomplished on an alternate year basis, and is credited with providing a quality fishing experience.  At present, the walleye community is comprised of numerous age classes and sizes, with strong numbers of older fish.    Northern pike are also abundant, with numerous sizes present within the lake, and has the potential to provide a very quality fishery to the angler.  Other species in abundance are bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  All three species combine to support a well-balanced, quality fish community.  In particular, largemouth bass should provide a quality fishery based on size of fish sampled in 2005 lake survey results.  </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Pelican Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nEighteen species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Pelican Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a moderately shallow basin which is prone to infrequent low dissolved oxygenconcentrations during winter months.  A pump and baffle aeration system is operated in winter monthswhen oxygen concentrations fall below 3.0 ppm.  Summerkill has also been recorded.  Water quality andclarity are poor during summer months.  Aquatic vegetation is very dense in the shallow bays of thelake.  Poor water clarity and dense vegetation may be limiting the feeding efficiency of northern pike,largemouth bass, and walleye.  This is evidenced by the large numbers of small yellow perch andbluegill.  There are ongoing diagnostic studies funded by the MPCA Clean Water Partnership to identifyand quantify nutrient loading from the Trapper's Run Creek watershed.  Northern pike gillnet catches averaged 3.3 fish/net in 1994 which is within the normal range of meancatch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics. Gillnet catches ranged from7.1 to 13.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The apparent decline in northern pikeabundance is likely due to poor reproduction during the late 1980's and 1990 when low water levelslimited the availability of spawning habitat.  Northern pike abundance is expected to increase toprevious levels with the recent return of normal to high water conditions in the area.  Average weightof fish captured in 1994 was 2.2 pounds.   Walleye gillnet catches averaged 2.2 fish/net.  The normalrange of mean catch rates for similar lake types is 0.8 - 3.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have beenconsistently low, ranging from 1.5 to 2.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Averageweight of fish captured was 1.9 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stockings do not appear to be effective inincreasing walleye abundance.  There is little or no correlation between years of stocking and yearclass strength.  Stocking frequency was reduced to every third year in 1989 because of poor stockingsuccess.  Electrofishing yielded 12.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Electrofishing catch mayhave been limited by low water temperature at time of sampling.  Approximately 50% of the fish capturedwere 15 - 19 inches in length.  Average weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  Bluegill are abundantin Pelican Lake.  Trapnet catches averaged 66.4 fish/net in 1994.  Catches ranged from  13.4 to 54.3fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 3.5 - 57.1 fish/trapnet.  Average weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Forty-five percentof the fish were 6.0 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Yellow perchgillnet catch rate decreased from 141.0 fish/net in 1988 to 80.6 fish/net in 1994, but the currentcatch rate still exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates for this lake classification.  Most ofthe fish are 5 - 8 inches in length.  Black crappie were not adequately sampled to evaluate populationcharacteristics.  Trapnet and gillnet catches averaged 0.1 and 0.2 fish/net, respectively.  Springtrapnetting may provide a better indication of relative abundance and size structure.  Black bullheadcatch rate decreased from 88.8 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 48.6 fish/gillnet in 1994.  The normal range ofmean catch rates for this type of lake is 7.7 - 104.7 fish/gillnet.  Average weight of fish capturedwas 0.7 pounds.             </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a productive, moderately-sized (519-acre) lake located just north of Lake Minnewaska in central Pope County. Maximum depth of the basin is 34 feet. Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Due to a large watershed area and nutrient enrichment, water quality can be seasonally impaired during summer months by algae blooms. A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake just off North Pelican Lake Road.\n\nBluegill have been very abundant in past surveys but are currently more moderate (34.1/trap net) for Pelican Lake, which is still abundant when compared to similar lakes. There is currently a very large year class of young (age 2) fish which account for 58% of the Bluegill sampled. However, seven year classes were sampled, with the oldest being age 8. Growth is fast. There has been an increase in the proportion of larger fish compared to previous surveys. Between both gears (gill and trap nets) there were a good number (14%) of Bluegill over 8 inches. Similar to past surveys, few Black crappie were sampled (1.6/trap net). Of the few fish sampled, most were age 2 and therefore small but the largest fish sampled was almost 12 inches. Average length of crappies was 8 inches.\n \nWalleye abundance (3.3/gill net) was down from the 2016 high (8.7/gill net) but similar to the long term average (3.8/gill net). Walleye ranged from 9 to 23 inches, with a mean of 17 inches. Growth is fast.\n \nLargemouth Bass abundance (90/hour of electrofishing) was the highest observed so far. Most fish were between 13 and 16 inches, and the largest fish sampled was over 19 inches. There appears to be strong reproduction with many 7 to 8 inch fish present.\n \nNorthern Pike density (7.6/gill net) was down and size structure has improved slightly from previous surveys. Forty-four percent of pike were within the protected slot, which should help to improve the size structure in the coming years. In addition, 22% were over 26 inches, with the largest being almost 35 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike. New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase size structure. Pelican Lake is in the North-Central Zone, where all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Anglers can keep 10 pike, but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nYellow Perch remain abundant (25.3/gill net) even though they have been quite variable. Most fish were young and therefore small, so few fish were at sizes that would be of interest to anglers. Contrary to most lakes in our area, Black Bullhead (53.1/gill net) continue to be abundant. Both species should provide adequate forage to predator species. Other species sampled include Bowfin (Dogfish), Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

The 1982 Walleye fingerling stocking appears to be moderately successful. The 1980 fingerling stocking is absent. Prior to 1980, most of the fish stocked were fry and catch increased from 13.7/gill net to 7.13/gill net but the average size is still small. Although Yellow Perch abundance has dropped sharply from the last survey, numbers are still above the local median and should provide excellent forage. Bluegill numbers have also dropped from the last survey with 60% of the Bluegills over 6 inches long. Black Crappie abundance has declined but, again, the fish are now of a quality size. Their average size has doubled from 0.25 lbs to .50 lbs. And the Crappies have an excellent length frequency distribution with some of the crappies over 14' long. The high Carp population probably affects water quality thus altering the Centrarchid population so it favors Crappies over Bluegills. Black Bullheads are abundant but small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fingerling stocking in 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1986 appear to have had little impact on gill net catches. Only 1.50 Walleye/gill net night were sampled in this assessment, a slight decrease from 1984 and 1979 catch rates of 1.88 and 2.67 Walleye gill net night, respectively. Low gill net catch rates may be in response to timing of the assessment (mid-late June). Growth rates of Walleye are excellent. Northern Pike abundance is high (12.25 fish/gill net night). Mean weight of Northern Pike has increased from 1.6 lbs in 1979 to 2.80 lbs in the present survey. Northern Pike have excellent growth rates with good recruitment to larger sizes. Fast growth rates of Northern Pike and Walleye may be attributed to an abundance of Yellow Perch for forage. One-hundred forty-one (141.0) Yellow Perch/gill net night were captured. Yellow Perch relative density increased from the 1984 assessment when 20.5 Yellow Perch/gillnet night were sampled and is similar to the 1979 assessment when 112.0 Yellow Perch/gill net night were sampled and is similar to the 1979 assessment when 112.0 Yellow Perch/gill net night were captured. Black Crappie trap net catch rates continue to decline from the 1979 high of 65.6 Black Crappie/trap net to 4.56 Black Crappie/trap net in the present survey. However, the present trap net index is above the statewide median of 2.67 Black Crappie/trap net. Bluegill numbers remain high (54.3 Bluegill/trap net) and mean size is small (0.13 lb/Bluegill). Twenty-eight percent were quality-size (over 6.0 inches long) and 3.0 percent were preferred-size (8.0 inches and larger the Black and Yellow Bullheads are probably too small to have commercial value).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a moderately shallow, 519 acre lake located in central Pope County near the towns of Glenwood and Long Beach.  Pelican Lake is part of the Chippewa River watershed with water entering Pelican Lake from Trappers Run creek.  Pelican Lake is connected to Lake Minnewaska via a heavily vegetated channel that passes under State Highway 29.  Maximum depth in Pelican Lake is 34 feet, but 80% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Aquatic vegetation is very dense in the lake's shallow bays.  Most of the shoreline remains undeveloped and is comprised of woodlands and marshlands.  A public water access is located in the northeast corner of the lake.  Pelican Lake is prone to infrequent low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months.  A pump and baffle aeration system can be operated if oxygen concentrations fall below critical levels.  Water quality and clarity are poor during summer months.  Ongoing diagnostic studies funded by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Clean Water Partnership helped identify and quantify nutrient loading from the Trappers Run Creek watershed.  Subsequent watershed work now focuses on implementation of measures to reduce pollution and improve water quality.  Work began in 1999, when two sediment retention ponds were excavated in Trappers Run creek.Pelican Lake is primarily managed for sunfishes and largemouth bass, but walleye are stocked to maintain a \"bonus\" fishery.  Northern pike are also managed as a secondary species.  Presently, fishing should be good for northern pike, largemouth bass, walleyes, bluegills, and black bullheads.  Largemouth bass were abundant in the most recent survey in 2000 with sizes of captured bass ranging from 7 to 18 inches.  The sunfish community may be switching dominance from bluegills to pumpkinseeds. Bluegill catches declined between surveys in 1994 and 2000, whereas pumpkinseed numbers have increased.  Although bluegill numbers have decreased, they still remain abundant.  Only 7% of  bluegill exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Eighty percent of pumpkinseeds were between 6 and 8 inches in length.  Anglers targeting northern pike will find an abundant population of mostly smaller individuals.  Most northern pike were between 16 and 25 inches.  However, four pike exceeded 29 inches with the biggest weighing about 10 lbs.  The abundant aquatic vegetation in the lake's shallow bays provides excellent habitat for reproduction of sunfish, bass, and northern pike.  In addition, increasing water levels in the mid-1990s likely increased availability of spawning habitat and contributed to their increased numbers as well.  Walleye were more abundant in Pelican Lake than in other lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  In fact, walleye abundance in 2000 was the highest ever recorded for Pelican Lake.  Almost 70% of the walleye exceeded 15 inches and the average weight of all walleye collected was almost 2 lbs.  Although walleye were only stocked in 1992, 1995, and 1998, walleye from every year class between 1992 and 1999 were collected, indicating some natural reproduction or immigration into this lake.  Yellow perch have declined from previous surveys, possibly in response to increased predation from more numerous pike, walleye, and bass.  Black bullhead were also common in net catches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a moderately shallow, 519-acre lake located in central Pope County near the towns of Glenwood and Long Beach.  Maximum depth is 34 feet.  Eighty percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The basin is fed from the very large Trapper's Run Creek watershed.  Water quality and clarity are poor during summer months due to frequent algae blooms. Aquatic vegetation is very dense in the lake's shallow bays and can interfere with recreational activities during late summer.  Much of the shoreline remains undeveloped due to marshy shoreline.  A single public access is located on the northeast shoreline of the lake.  Pelican Lake is prone to low dissolved oxygen levels during winter months, but frequency and severity of winterkill events have been rare.    <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake is classified as a bass-panfish lake.  Bluegill and black crappie make up most of total annual harvest.  Bluegill are currently very abundant.  Trapnet catches during the 2010 survey averaged 91.9 bluegill/net. Mean size was 5.9 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Largemouth bass are moderately abundant.  Average length of bass captures was 12.9 inches.  The largest caught during the 2010 survey was 16.9 inches in length.  Black crappie catches were comparatively low in 2010.  Most captures were young fish.  Average length of the crappie catch was 7.4 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked at an alternate year frequency to sustain a modest fishery.  Based on past survey records there is evidence that limited natural reproduction and immigration of adult walleye also contribute to walleye population abundance.  Gillnet catches in 2010 averaged 4.6 fish/net.  At present, the walleye population is comprised of a high proportion of older, larger fish. Approximately 29% of all walleye measured in 2010 exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  Northern pike are overly abundant and surplus small and medium size fish should be harvested.  The gillnet catch rate of 11.6 pike/net exceeded expected catches for the lake type.  Mean weight of northern pike captures was 2.0 lbs.  Pelican Lake continues to sustain a strong yellow perch prey base.  Perch catches averaged 31.4 fish/gillnet.  Few perch were large enough to be harvested. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a productive, moderately-sized (519-acre) basin located just north of Lake Minnewaska in central Pope County.  A portion of the east shoreline is delineated as the northwest city limit of Long Beach.  Maximum depth of the basin is 34.0 feet.  Fisheries productivity is enhanced by the expanded littoral area.  Approximately 80% of the lake is less than 15.0 feet deep.  Due to a large watershed area and nutrient enrichment, water quality can be seasonally impaired during summer months by frequent and occasionally severe algae blooms. Aquatic vegetation is common and can become dense in shallow bays.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake just off North Pelican Lake Road.  <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fisheries survey was completed June 20-23, 2016.  A combination of nine gill nets and nine trap nets were used to assess fish community structure and estimate relative abundance of gamefishes.  Due to greater effectiveness of springtime electrofishing sampling of Largemouth Bass, bass were surveyed earlier in the year (May 25).  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill and Largemouth Bass catch rates characterize these gamefishes as moderately abundant.  Bluegill trap net catches averaged 24.7 fish/net.  Those captures averaged 5.2 inches in total length.  The largest Bluegill measured during the survey was 9.4 inches.  Bass captures during the electrofishing survey ranged from 2.4 to 18.5 inches in length.  Black Crappie capture rates were modest in both trap nets and gill nets.  Crappies captured in trap nets averaged 9.3 inches.  The largest crappie captured measured 12.6 inches in length.  Walleye catch rates (8.7 fish/gill net) are moderately high.  Average size was 15.8 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pelican Lake supports good numbers of large Walleyes.  Approximately 24% of Walleyes captured in gill nets exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  Two captures exceeded 25.0 inches.  Biennial fingerling stockings, seasonal fish movements from Lake Minnewaska, and some natural reproduction sustain the Pelican Lake Walleye fishery.  Northern Pike catches were exceptionally high during the 2016 survey (21.1 fish/gill net).  Catches in gill nets averaged 20.2 inches in length.  The largest pike caught measured 33.0 inches.  Due to high numbers of young and small pike (14.0-21.0 inches) anglers are encouraged to harvest this surplus of fish.  Catch of Yellow Perch (12.0 fish/gill net) declined relative to past surveys.  Declines may be related to increases in pike numbers.  Few perch measured during the survey were large enough to be harvested.  Only five perch captured were 8.0 inches or larger.  One Channel Catfish was collected in the 2016 survey.  The individual likely entered Pelican Lake through a stream connection with Lake Minnewaska.    <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake is not currently known to be infested with aquatic invasive species now common to Lake Minnewaska, namely zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
