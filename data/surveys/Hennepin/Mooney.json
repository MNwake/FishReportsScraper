NOP WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS TWICE THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS AND SLIGHTLY GREATER THAN TRAPNET LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS.  AVERAGE WEIGHT FOR NOP WAS 2.9 POUNDS. IN ADDITION, TRAPNETS AND THE GILLNET CAPTURED 6 CARP, 3 GSF, 2 BLG, 2 YEP, AND 2 GOS.  THE SEINE HAULS CAPTURED YOY AND ADULT BLC AND GSF, AS WELL AS ADULT YEP, BLB, AND FHM.</p>",
