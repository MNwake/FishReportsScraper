                "narrative": "<p>Reno is a 175 acre lake located on the southern edge of the City of Deerwood, in Crow Wing County.  There is no designated public access on the lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9 feet and shallow water soils which are predominantly sand and silt.  The lake has soft water and low phosphorus fertility.  Development is low to moderate, with 7.7 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 1998.  Partial winterkills occur in more severe winters.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and submergent plants were found throughout the lake.  Important emergent species like bulrush and cattail were abundant at a variety of sites around the lake.Test netting was conducted in 1998.  Northern pike was the primary gamefish.  It was found in numbers that were \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Several age classes were present in roughly equal proportion.  Average size was 23 inches and 2.9 lbs..  Growth was good.  Black crappie abundance was \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.  A variety of age classes were sampled and growth rate was good.  The 1996 and '97 year classes were most abundant.  The bluegill catch was \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes and compared to past catches in Reno.  Most fish were rather young but growth was generally above average.  Yellow perch is an important food resource for gamefish.  It was present in \"average\" numbers in '98.  An additional forage fish present in '98 was golden shiner.  It was sampled in rather high numbers in shoreline seining stations.  A variety of bullhead species were present in past nettings.  Bullheads were not sampled in the 1998 netting.</p>",
