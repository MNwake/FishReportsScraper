The walleye was high at 7.00 per set with an average weight of 1.21 lbs. The yellow perch was quite high at 52.00 per set. The largemouth bass while low at 0.25 in the trapnet sets, was high at 3.00 in the gillnet and had good numbers in the shoreline seining. The bluegill (37.50) and black crappie (35.25) had high populations of small to fair size fish with an occasional large black crappie. The pumpkinseed was low at 1.00 per set and was of a small size. The black bullhead while very low (0.25) in the trapnet, was quite high at 48.50 in the gillnet. The yellow bullhead (5.75) and the brown bullhead (0.25) had slightly high and quite low median figures respectively. All bullheads were of a fair size.  Carp all had above average population figures. The white sucker and hybrid sunfish were below their respective medians note:  present walleye population is considered to be the result of migration downstream from Blue Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baxter Lake is a 78 acre basin located between Blue and Tenneyson lakes in the Spencer Brook drainage.  Near shore substrates are predominantly sand and development is very light for a lake in Isanti County.  Summer water clarity is low due the lakes fertility.  A lake survey was conducted the week of August 30th to monitor changes in the fishery since the 2000 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the assessment results, anglers should expect better than average fishing with user pressure varying from light to heavy depending on the time of year.   <br> \n      <br> \nBlack crappies were abundant in the gill nets.  The majority of the crappies were less than eight inches in length with an average of 0.2 pounds.  Nonetheless, during the assessment, black crappies received all the observed fishing pressure. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were also abundant.  Bass averaged 13 inches in length and 1.3 pounds in weight.  Thirty one of the forty eight bass sampled (67%) exceeded 12 inches in length.  The largest bass caught was 17.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were normal for the lake type.  Pike averaged 2.9 pounds and 24.1 inches.  With five of twenty-nine fish exceeding 30 inches in length, there is potential for trophy northern pike angling. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are more abundant than in the 2000 assessment and should provide additional opportunity to panfish anglers.  Most of the captured bluegill were 7 inches or longer, a size acceptable to many anglers looking for a meal. <br> \n <br> \nThe county owned access on Baxter Lake is unimproved with parking for approximately 6 boat trailers.</p>",
