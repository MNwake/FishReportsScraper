                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake, located just east of Brandon, is a small, secluded lake with good water quality.  A mid-summer secchi reading reached 14.0 feet.  Water levels have risen considerably and has flooded timber and cabins alike.  The access has a steep approach which can be difficult.  Due to the rising waters, emergent vegetation is limited.  Submergent vegetation, however, is abundant and provides a well defined weed line which can aid in locating fish.Northern pike catch rates averaged 19.0 fish per gillnet which is an increase from the previous survey's rate of 4.3 fish per net. The mean length of sampled fish was 20.2 inches with the largest individual measuring just over 30 inches.  The majority of the sample was comprised of fish ages two through four.  This should provide quick action now and quality fishing in the near future.Bluegill abundance has also increased over previous surveys.  Trapnet catch rates were 55.2 fish per net which is double the two previous survey's results.  These fish averaged 7.1 inches in length with the largest sampled fish measuring over nine inches in length.Largemouth bass remain abundant with a day-time electrofishing survey resulting in a catch of 142 fish per hour.  Fish aged two through ten were represented in the sample.  The mean length of sampled fish was 11.0 inches with the largest individual measuring just over 20 inches.Black crappie and yellow perch are present in fair numbers with quality sized individuals present.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on June 21, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with three sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and conditions prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one tolerant species (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Moon Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 5 was also implemented in the spring of 2022.  The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were moderate, and many large Bluegill were observed.  Fifty eight percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length.  Growth rates of Bluegill in Moon Lake are fast and 6 year old Bluegill averaged almost 9 inches in length.  The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was over 10 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were high and a large variety of sizes were observed in the survey. Approximately 32% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length.  Black Crappie growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was almost 10 inches.  The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 14 inches and the oldest crappie was 11 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Moon Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nMoon Lake is not currently known to have any invasive species.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

A resident of the lake reported his neighbor had stocked the Black Crappie several years before. The resident may have gotten them from the Hermanson pond. The Bluegill population consists of a large population of quality fish. 76% of the Bluegill sampled were over 6.0 long. Northern Pike abundance was high 15.0 Northern Pike/gillnet and mean size was small 1.92lbs/Northern Pike. However, 2 of the 30 Northern Pike sampled by gillnet were over 30 inches. Bullheads had an extremely large mean size of 1.43 pounds in the gillnets and 1.25lbs in the trapnets. They ranged in length from 11.0 to 14.0 plus. Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing. There appears to be a good population with fair recruitment. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The catch rate for Bluegill averaged 21.2 fish/trapnet which is unchanged from the 22.5 fish/trapnet recorded during the 1987 survey.  Bluegill are likely more abundant than catch rates would indicate. The shape of the lake basin and abundance of aquatic vegetation may limit capture efficiency. The gillnet catch rate of 25.5 fish/gillnet is indicative of an over-abundant Bluegill population. The average size of Bluegill has declined significantly since 1987.  Mean weight of Bluegill captured in trapnets fell from 0.21lbs in 1987 to 0.11lb in 1991.  PSD also declined from 76% to 17% during the same time period.  No fish captured exceeded 7.5 inches in total length during the 1991 population assessment.  The downward shift in size structure may be related to angling pressure. The first public access was purchased in 1986 by the Brandon Sportsmen Club.  Angling pressure was reported to be heavy during the 1987 population survey.  Northern Pike abundance has also declined.  Catch rates dropped from 15.0 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 3.0 fish/gillnet in 1991.  The mean weight of fish captured in 1991 was 2.05lbs and PSD was measured at 50%.  PSD was measured at 30% in 1987.  The decline in Northern Pike abundance may be due to water levels receding back to normal levels, increased fishing pressure or a combination of both. Electrofishing yielded 15.4 Largemouth Bass/hour in 1987, but it was not part of the 1991 population assessment. An electrofishing survey is needed to evaluate the abundance, size structure, and growth rate of the Largemouth Bass population.  This data would help identify the balance between Bluegill and predators in Moon Lake. Small yep are abundant and should provide sample forage for Northern Pike.  Catch rates averaged 20.0 fish/ gillnet.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.15 lbs.  Management strategies should focus on identifying the factors limiting Northern Pike abundance and determine the predator/prey relationship between Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake is a small, natural basin located just east of Brandon in western Douglas County.  Surface area is listed at 126 acres, but lake area has expanded in response to wet climatic conditions in the late 80s and mid- to late 90s.  Water level rose to inundate some cabins.  Flooded timber is still evident.  Water quality is good.  Mid-summer clarity measurements typically exceed 9.0 ft.  In response to an extended increase in water level, emergent plants such as cattail and hardstem bulrush were lost.  Submergent vegetation is common in areas less than 15 ft. deep and forms a well-defined edge.  Moon Lake has been assigned as \"bass-panfish\" management classification. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and bluegill are abundant.  Bluegill catches declined in the 2006 survey, but reduced catches were a probable response to high water temperatures and displacement of sunfishes into deeper, cooler water.  This contention is supported with evidence of slower growth of bluegill captured in 2006.  Increased growth would be anticipated with an actual decline in population abundance.  Black crappie catches were similarly low in partial response basin morphology and reduced trapping efficiency during summer months.  Sunfish populations continue to support a very good fishery.  Average sizes of bass, bluegill, and crappie captured tend to be larger than sunfishes in other local lakes.  Mean length of largemouth bass captured in 2006 was 11.6 inches.  Fifteen percent of capture bass exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest measured was 18.3 inches.  Average length of bluegill measured in 2006 was 6.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 9.2 inches in length.  Ten-inch crappie were common.  Sustained presence of a relatively greater proportion of larger sunfishes can be attributed to less fishing pressure, average growth rates, and longevity.  Bluegill up to 10 years old were represented in 2006 netting captures. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are overly abundant.  Population density has increased with higher water and expanded shallow or seasonally flooded spawning habitat.  Gillnet catches averaged 15.2 fish per gillnet.  Pike growth rate has slowed with greater abundance.  In response to more young fish in the lake and slower growth, mean length of pike recorded during the 2006 survey was only 20.3 inches.  The largest individual caught measured 31.2 inches in length. Mean weight of sampled fish was 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch support a modest fishery.  Thirty percent of stock-size perch captured exceeded 10.0 inches in total length.  Fishing sustainability is threatened by increasing predation by northern pike.  Average gillnet catch declined sharply from that of the previous survey.  In response to greater mortality, yellow perch can be expected to reach sexual maturity at a younger age and smaller size.  Average size of perch will likely decline in response to greater energy expended in egg production rather than body growth. <br> \n <br> \nMoon Lake supports a surplus of small northern pike and largemouth bass that should receive greater harvest pressure in order to sustain average growth rates and a balanced predator/prey relationship.  Anglers are also encouraged to harvest medium-size bluegill.  Release larger, older gamefishes to sustain the basin's good fishing quality.  First time boaters are advised that the public access has a steep approach that make launching and loading difficult. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake is a small, natural basin located just east of Brandon in western Douglas County.  Surface area is listed as 126 acres, but lake area has expanded in response to wet climatic conditions in the late 80s and mid-to late 90s.  Water levels rose to inundate some cabins.  Flooded timber is still evident.  Water quality is good.  Mid-summer clarity measurements typically exceed 9.0 feet.  In response to the extended increase in water level, emergent plants such as cattail and hardstem bulrush were lost.  Submergent vegetation is common in areas less than 15.0 feet deep and forms a well-defined edge.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant and average size is good.  Mean length of largemouth bass captured in 2011 was 13.1 inches.  Thirty-two percent of sampled bass exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 18.6 inches.  Largemouth bass up to 14 years old were represented in the 2011 netting captures. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance levels increased since the 2006 survey.  Growth has slowed with increasing population abundance.  Five years of growth are needed to reach 6.0 inches.  Over 50% of the fish captured in trapnets were 6.0 inches or greater.  Seven percent of the sampled fish exceeded 8.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike remain overly abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 11.8 fish/net.  The population is primarily comprised of two- through four-year-old fish.  As such, average size of fish (1.9 pounds and 20.5 inches) was small.  The largest northern pike captured in the 2011 survey was 31.7 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the surplus small northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has increased, but average size has declined.  Few captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length in 2011.  Thirty percent of stock-size perch captured in 2006 exceeded 10.0 inches.  One perch exceeded 10.0 inches in length in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nMoon Lake continues to be among the few basins within the Glenwood Management Area with no common carp.  First time boaters are advised that the public access has a steep approach that makes launching and loading difficult. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake is a 126-acre natural lake located just southeast of Brandon in western Douglas County. Maximum depth is 38.0 feet. Average depth is estimated at 19.0 feet due to steep banks and a rapid drop off along much of the north, west, and south shorelines. Water quality is very good. Summer water clarity measurements have exceeded 15.0 feet over the past four years. Most aquatic plant growth occurs in the shallower northeast and southeast areas of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2023 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations. Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey, completed May 31, to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population. The gill netting component of the standard survey was completed June 26-28. During the spring of 2022 a special regulation was implemented that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 5. As an evaluation requirement of this special regulation, trap netting was conducted during the spring (May 15-17) when panfish are more susceptible to capture. These sampling practices will be standard protocol for future fisheries surveys on Moon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Moon Lake. Electrofishing catch rates of Largemouth Bass were the third highest on record. Largemouth Bass growth is slow and on average it takes seven years for bass to reach 12.0 inches. Bass size structure on Moon Lake is poor. Fifty-nine percent of the bass were under 12.0 inches and the largest bass observed from all sampling types was 17.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates were moderate in 2023. Many large Bluegill were observed during the survey. Sixty nine percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length. Growth rates of Bluegill in Moon Lake are fast and 6 year old fish averaged almost 8.5 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was over 10.5 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were high and a large variety of sizes were observed in the survey. Approximately 64% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was 10 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 14.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAfter a decline from 2006 through 2017, Northern Pike catch rates increased to match the record high 15.2 fish/gill net. Average size of pike captures in 2023 remained modest at 17.7 inches. The largest pike capture measured 25.6 inches. Northern Pike catches have varied greatly over time, likely due to overabundance and competition with Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present at low density after the Brandon Fins and Feathers Club and shoreland property owners stocked Walleyes from 2012 through 2020. Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2020 based on poor returns and concerns that the continued addition of fish not historically present in Moon Lake may degrade the established quality Bluegill fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch captures (21.0/gill net) were the highest ever recorded on Moon Lake. Growth rates are moderate; average length of age-5 fish was over 8.5 inches. The perch population does appear to have the growth potential to support some modest harvest. Seventeen percent of perch captured in gill nets were 10.0 inches and larger. The largest Yellow Perch in the sample was 12.5 inches and 10 years old. <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2023 survey included Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and White Sucker. The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2029. <br> \n <br> \nMoon Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2023. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides ample habitat forcentrarchids and northern pike.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 19 feet and is dense in manyshallow water areas.  Coverage of emergent vegetation is limited and may be the result of extremefluctuations in water levels over the past ten years.  Northern pike catches averaged 4.3 fish/gillnet in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.0 fish/net in 1991and 15.0 fish/net in 1987.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical andphysical characteristics is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds. Largemouth bass are abundant.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 127.8 stock-size largemouth bass perhour.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds.  Approximately 30% of the fish were 12 inches inlength or greater and 10% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 24.7 fish/trapnet which isvirtually unchanged from catches of 21.2 fish/net in 1991 and 22.5 fish/net in 1987.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from similar lakes is 6.1 - 46.6 fish/trapnet.   Approximately 70% of the bluegillcaptured were 6 inches in length or greater, however few exceed 8 inches.  Yellow perch gillnet catchesaveraged 6.2 fish/net.  Gillnet catches averaged 20.0 fish/net in 1991 and 9.0 fish/net in 1987.  Meanweight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.   Walleye catches averaged 0.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 1.5 fish/net in 1991 and 2.0 fish/net in 1987.  Walleye have not been stocked by the DNRSection of Fisheries.  These walleye are likely the result of unauthorized stockings.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moon Lake is a 126-acre, natural lake located just east of Brandon in western Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 38.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 19.0 feet due to steep banks and rapid drop off along much of north, west, and south shorelines.  Water quality is very good.   Summer water clarity measurements have exceeded 15.0 feet over the past four years.  Most aquatic plant growth occurs in shallower, northeast and southeast areas of the lake. <br> \n  <br> \nA standard lake survey was completed in 2017 to gain updated estimates of fish abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey, completed May 25, to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the standard survey was completed June 26-29.  Netting efforts included nine trap net and six gill net sets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass proved to be abundant.  One hundred and sixty-six bass were caught during one lap around the shoreline with the electrofishing boat.  Captures ranged from 5.0 inches to 17.1 inches in length and averaged 10.3 inches.  The relatively small average size was attributable to a high proportion of three-year-old fish making up the population sample.  Bass growth is below average.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the surplus of 12.0 inch and smaller bass. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill catch rates have been highly variable among surveys.  Catches during the 2017 survey were low in possible response to the abundance of their primary predator, Largemouth Bass.  Age distribution of catches extended to age 12.  While not abundant at present, due to the broad age structure of catches, average size captured in trap nets was 6.2 inches.  Thirty-four percent of those captures were 8.0 inches and larger. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black and White Crappie populations occur in Moon Lake.  Black Crappie catches have exceeded that of White Crappies.  Catch rates of both were modest.  Age assignments of Black Crappie captures extended to age 8, thus with advanced age and growth, crappies do contribute to the fishery.  The largest Black Crappie caught measured 11.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have progressively declined from and excessively high catch of 15.2 pike/gill net in 2006 to 6.0 pike/gill net.  Average size of pike captures in 2017 remained modest at 18.6 inches.  The largest pike capture measured 27.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch captures were modest as anticipated given their importance to the diet of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye.  The perch population does appear to have the growth potential to support some modest harvest.  Nineteen percent of perch captured in gill nets were 10.0 inches and larger.  The largest measured 11.8 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleyes are the most recent addition to the fish community.  The Brandon Fins and Feathers Club and shoreland property owners have purchased and stocked approximately 3,600 fingerlings and yearlings since 2012.  Eighteen Walleyes were captured during the 2017 survey.  Average length of Walleye captures was 17.1 inches. <br> \n</p>",
