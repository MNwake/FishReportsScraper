                "narrative": "<p>The populations were difficult to assess with conventional gear because of the way the water dropped off so sharply from shore.  Electrofishing might produce a better sample.  The principal predator species captured were Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.5 per gill net.  This represented only three fish, 14, 15 and 24 inches in length.  One-six inch Northern Pike was gilled in the lead of a trap net.  As mentioned in the field notes Largemouth Bass appeared to be abundant.  Many small specimens were observed in the shallows during the survey.  Anglers reported catching primarily small fish as well.  Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill and hybrid sunfish were all sampled with trap nets.  Bluegill were the most abundant at 16.8 per trap net.  Most of the fish captured were less than four inches long, ages 1-3 and exhibited slow growth.  Bowfin (dogfish), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead were captured in trap nets and all were low in abundance.   Common Carp were reported to be present though none were caught or seen during the survey.</p>",
