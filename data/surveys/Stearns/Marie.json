Black Bullhead showing a slight decrease in size, were taken at a rate of 47.0/trap net, 20% higher than 1984. Common Carp remain high in numbers at 7.2/trap net, but not nearly as high as in 1984 (24.8/trap). This is primarily due to increasing size and trap awareness of older fish. Northern Pike, represented by age classes 2-8, were taken at a rate (4.8/ gill net) higher than that of the 1983 assessment. No yearling fish were taken. White Suckers were taken in relatively high numbers at 3.6/gill net (nearly four times the local median) and 3.2/trap net. Walleye and Largemouth Bass were both taken near the local median level for trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marie Lake is a 141 acre lake located three miles northeast of Annandale.  The lake is part of the Clearwater River system, has 3.8 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  During mid-June 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen for fish present to a depth of 11 feet.  The lakeshore is developed with 118 homes and cabins.  Eighteen aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  There is a county owned access in the park on the northeast end of the lake.Black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, largemouth bass and walleye are all present in Marie Lake.  In a lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997, test netting revealed the following information about the fish population.Northern pike catch rate was 2.8/gill net, which is in the expected range for lakes similar to Marie.  The average northern pike weighed 4.1 pounds and was 25.9 inches long, which was larger than expected for the lake class.  Northern pike growth was average compared to other populations in the state.  Gill net catch of walleye (0.2/ gill net) was below normal for this lake type, as it was in 1991.  Walleye are not stocked into Marie Lake, and the Fairhaven Dam downstream of the lake blocks fish movement.  Yellow perch catch rate was 12.8/gill net, which in the expected range, and the average yellow perch was 6.9 inches long.  White sucker catch rate (6.0/gill net) was high compared to similar lakes, as it has been in previous surveys. Trap net catch of black crappie (26.3/net) was higher than expected for the lake class, as it was in previous surveys.  The average crappie was 7.0 inches long.  Bluegill catch rate (48.0/net) was in the expected range.  The average size of bluegill was 5.5 inches and they ranged from 3.8-8.7 inches long.  Bluegill reproduction is good and growth rates are above average.  A typical bluegill reaches 6 inches by age 3 in Lake Marie.No largemouth bass were caught in trap nets, but they are difficult to sample in trap nets, so this is not unusual.  Largemouth bass are abundant throughout the Clearwater River's lakes.  Marie Lake has good spawning habitat and young bass were abundant in shoreline seine samples.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marie is a 147 acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties, 2 miles northwest of South Haven.  The public access is located on  the northeast side of the lake and is the property of the Stearns County Parks Department. Lake Marie and connecting Lake Louisa are reservoir lakes of the Clearwater River and were formed by a dam on the outlet of Lake Marie.  In 2005, all the lakes along the Clearwater River were sampled including: Louisa, Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes.  Based on the survey anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth bass and above average size sunfish.  Angling for northern pike will produce fair fishing for above average size fish.Largemouth Bass Electrofishing SurveyLargemouth bass electrofishing on Lake Marie was combined with connecting Louisa Lake.  A total of 95 largemouth bass were sampled in 1.05 hours of electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 90.3 fish/hour, over one and a half times the average catch rate for Montrose area lakes (52/hr).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3.5 to 20.5 inches with a mean length of 12.3 inches.  The northern pike gill net catch rate (2.8 fish/net) was the same as that observed in 1997.  Fourteen northern pike were sampled.  Fish ranged in length from 18.6 to 39.4 inches.  Mean length and weight of northern pike were 28.6 inches and 5.8 pounds.  Few lakes in the area have such quality northern pike.Only two walleye were sampled during the gill net survey.  The low catch of walleye is not surprising since Lake Marie is not stocked.  The walleye in the lake have probably migrated from upstream lakes.Four channel catfish were sampled for the first time in Lake Marie.  These fish probably migrated downstream from Betsy Lake which was first stocked with channel catfish in 1983.The bluegill trap net catch rate (23.7 fish/net) appeared lower than that observed in 1997 (48.0 fish/net) but was above the average for lakes similar to Marie.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 inches to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 6.9 inches, considered good.The black crappie trap net catch rate (9.9 fish/net) was lower than that of 1997 (26.3 fish/net) but above the average rate for lakes similar to Marie.  A total of 89 black crappie were sampled by trap net. Fish ranged in length from 3.5 to 10.0 inches with a mean length of 8.2 inches.Other fish species sampled during the survey included black and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner and white sucker.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except one site where dense vegetation prevented seining. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish, including one species that is intolerant of poor water quality or habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter). Data from the nearshore fish survey were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. A FIBI uses fish community data as a measurement of lake health. The FIBI score for Marie Lake was 64 which was well above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 36) using Tool 7. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Marie Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

This was due to the presence of older age fish (ages 4 and 10) and the absence of fish below age 3 in gill nets.  Walleye numbers were low (0.6/ gill net), and size was average (2.5 lbs).  Walleye were not present in 1985 survey gill nets.  Age 3 and 5 were present; the age 5 fish were from the 1986 fingerling stocking.  Yellow Perch were present in average (33.6/gill net, and size was average (0.2 lb).  Yellow Perch were also not present in 1985 survey nets.  Common Carp numbers (0.3/trap net) were low, while White Sucker were high at 9.4/gill net.  Black and Yellow Bullheads both had average catch rates for this lake class.  Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, and Black Crappie all had catch rates above the third quartile for this lake class.  Lengths of Pumpkinseed ranged from 3.0- 6.4 inches.  The length range for Bluegills was 3.0-7.9 inches.  The average size of Black Crappie were small (0.1 lb).  The modal length of Black Crappie was 4.5 inches, with lengths ranging from 3.0-9.4 inches.  Largemouth Bass were caught by electrofishing at a rate of 12.0/ hour.  Ages 2-5 were present.  Lengths ranged from 5-15 inches, and the proportional stock density was 64.  The growth of Largemouth Bass was average.</p>",

Population assessments were conducted in 1981 and 1982 to evaluate the effects of this winterkill event. There currently is a high rough fish population in Marie Lake.  The abundance of Black Bullhead is decreasing in the trap nets but increasing in gill nets compared to the 1981 survey data and is above the range of expected values for lakes with similar characteristics.  The abundance of White Sucker continues to increase as well but remained within the normal range.  No Common Carp were sampled in either gill nets or trap nets in this survey.  Northern Pike catches decreased compared the 1981 survey to about one-tenth the lake class median. The Walleye abundance increased from the 1981 survey but remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Largemouth Bass abundance remained average compared to similar lakes. Green Sunfish were sampled this year but not in 1976 and 1981. Their abundance is normal compared to expected ranges.</p>",

Although down somewhat from 1983, Bluegill at 117.5/trap net and Black Bullheads remain abundant but are becoming smaller in size. Black Bullheads remain abundant in about the same numbers as in previous years. Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye were all taken near the local median level for trap nets. No Yellow Perch were taken.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marie is a 147 acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties, 2 miles northwest of the City of South Haven.  The Stearns County Parks Department owns a public access located on the northeast side of the lake.  Lake Marie and connecting Lake Louisa are reservoir lakes within Clearwater River and were  formed by a dam on the outlet of Lake Marie.  The Marie Lake watershed is 60,025 acres with land use consisting of 51% agriculture, 23% hay/pasture, 7% marsh/open water, 6% residential, and 13% forest.  In 2014,Secchi readings ranged from 1.5 to 6 feet during July and August.  Adequate oxygen was sampled to a depth of 14 feet. It has a moderate diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake and curly-leaf pondweed was abundant in mid-June and covered 8% of lake surface area <br> \n <br> \nBased on survey results, anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and sunfish. <br> \nDue to their immediate connection, results of Largemouth Bass electrofishing on Lake Marie was combined with Lake Louisa.  A total of 122 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.5 hours of day time electrofishing.  This was over twice the daytime average catch rate for Montrose Area lakes (47.6/hr).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.1 to 19.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike increased from the last survey conducted in 2005, but remained within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Lake Marie.  Twenty six Northern Pike were sampled and ranged in length from 20.3 to 31.0 inches and averaged 24.6 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Fifty two percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches.  Few lakes in the area could be considered this good for pike fishing opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Marie is not stocked with Walleye, but several were sampled during the survey.  It is likely that fish migrate from upstream portions of the Clearwater River where they have been stocked before (Clear Lake, Betsy Lake, and Union Lake) and now reproduce naturally.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 17.8 to 28.5 inches and averaged 21.4 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Based on the observed catch rates, anglers have the chance to catch an incidental Walleye in Lake Marie. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was less than that observed in 2005 but was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 1.6 to 9.1 inches and averaged 6.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Anglers can experience good fishing for Bluegill as 36% of the fish sampled were longer than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie trap net catch was lower than previous surveys but was also within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 4.1 to 11.8 inches with an average length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Although trap net catches were lower than in the past large numbers of adult crappie were observed in early May while electrofishing for Largemouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were again sampled in low numbers (2 fish; 19 and 25 inches in length) with little change from 2005 when they were first sampled in Lake Marie.  These fish probably migrated downstream from Betsy Lake which was stocked with Channel Catfish in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marie is a 147-acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties, two miles northwest of the city of South Haven. The Stearns County Parks Department owns a public access on the northeast side of the lake. Lake Marie and connecting Lake Louisa are reservoir lakes within the Clearwater River and were formed by a dam on the outlet of Lake Marie. The Marie Lake watershed is 60,025 acres with land use consisting of 60% agriculture, 13% hay/pasture, 11% forest, 10% marsh/open water, and 6% residential. In 2019, Secchi readings ranged from 1.6 to 6 feet between June and August. Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 14 feet. It has a moderate diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake with floating leaf and emergent vegetation covering about 5 percent of the lakes surface. <br> \n <br> \nBased on survey results, anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 169 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.7 hours of electrofishing. This was over twice the daytime average catch for Sauk Rapids Area lakes and similar to the rate observed in 2014. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5 to 20 inches with an average length of 13 inches, and 34% of the catchable sized bass were greater than15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike increased from the last survey conducted in 2014, but remained within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Lake Marie. Northern Pike ranged in length from 19 to 34 inches and averaged 27 inches and 4.5 pounds.  Fifty seven percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 22% were longer than 30 inches. Few lakes in the area could be considered this good for pike fishing opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was low, which is not surprising since Walleye have not been stocked since 1986. However, in 2019 the Lake Association purchased and stocked 200,000 Walleye fry to supplement the population. It is likely that fish migrate from upstream portions of the Clearwater River where they reproduce naturally. Walleye ranged in length from 19 to 27 inches with an average size of 23 inches and 4 pounds. Based on the observed catch rates, anglers have a chance to catch an incidental Walleye in Lake Marie. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was higher than observed in 2014 and within the expected range for lakes similar to Marie. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. Anglers can experience good fishing for smaller Bluegill in Lake Marie however only 1% of the fish sampled were greater than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie trap net catch was similar to the previous survey in 2014 and was also within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 6 to 10 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches. Although trap net catches were lower than in the past large numbers of adult crappie were observed in early May while electrofishing for Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n  <br> \nChannel Catfish were again sampled in low numbers (3 fish) with little change from the 2014 and 2005 surveys. These fish probably migrated downstream from Betty Lake which was stocked with Channel Catfish in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
