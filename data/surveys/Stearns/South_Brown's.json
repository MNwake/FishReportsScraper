                "narrative": "<p>South Browns Lake is a 65 acre shallow lake located 3 miles north of the City of Eden Lake in Stearns County. The maximum lake depth found during the survey was 5 feet, with an average depth of 3.5 feet. A carry-in access owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is located in the southwest side of the lake and is suitable for portable watercraft like canoes, and kayaks. <br> \n <br> \nVegetation diversity and abundance were both somewhat low across South Browns Lake. Coontail, sago pondweed, and yellow water lily were the dominant plant species found, with northern milfoil, and flat-stem pondweed also sampled during the survey. The fringe of the lake was made up of cattails and bulrushes, with forest coming to the water's edge in several locations. <br> \n <br> \nA single 19.5 inch northern pike was sampled in trap nets along with 11 black bullhead all less than 10 inches and 6 bowfin (dogfish).  The shallowness of South Browns Lake along with the type of species present indicate a tendency to periodically winterkill during moderate to severe winters with above average snowfall.  A connection to North Browns Lake exists and is likely how fish repopulate the lake after such winterkill events.   <br> \n</p>",
