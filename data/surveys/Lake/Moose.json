                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a remote 180 acres lake with a maximum depth of six feet, located approximately 11 miles northeast of Finland, MN.  Moose Lake is accessed by a remote trail (0.6 mile) from old logging roads to the west end of Moose Lake.  The route is not marked and unless familiar with the area could be difficult to follow.  The main tributaries on the northeast end of Moose Lake are Cabin Creek and Moose Creek. The outlet is Moose Creek, exiting the south end of Moose Lake, a tributary of the Manitou River in the Lake Superior North Watershed.  Moose Lake is a moderately soft water lake of low fertility with total alkalinity of 24 and total phosphorous of 0.016.  A Secchi disk was visible to the bottom in six feet of water, the maximum depth found.  Wild rice and floating-leaf burreed are scattered over most of the lake surface with a dense stand of wild rice in the northeast arm of the lake.  The north and south shores had clean gravel substrate out to about fifty feet from shore.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 lake population assessment found Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, White Sucker and Pumpkinseed Sunfish in Moose Lake.  Northern Pike were found in above average numbers for the lake class, the average size was 19.7 inches with 14 percent greater than 24 inches, the largest Northern Pike measured 32.7 inches (7.3 pounds).  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were also present in Moose Lake in the initial 1977 lake survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were found in Moose Lake for the first time in 2014, when a small number were caught in standard sampling gear.  The average size was 20.7 inches (3.8 pounds); however, one individual measuring 25.8 inches (7.3 pounds) greatly influenced the average size.  No fish stocking has been done on Moose Lake, the appearance of Walleye in the lake probably was the result of migration downstream from a nearby managed Walleye lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch sampled in Moose Lake in 2014 averaged 7.5 inches with 38 percent of the sample greater than 8.0 inches the largest Yellow Perch measured was 11.6 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were above average for this lake class, the abundant aquatic vegetation in the lake provides for good Yellow Perch spawning and a refuge from predators. <br> \n</p>",
