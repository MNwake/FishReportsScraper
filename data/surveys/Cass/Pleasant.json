                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pleasant Lake was conducted on June 22-23, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations due to the site conditions (soft sediments and dense vegetation and/or steep drop offs).  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including 8 species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and no species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Pleasant Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1,099 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 10.06 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR)-owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Pleasant Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes. Similar Lake Class 27 lakes in the Walker area include Ada, Portage (south of Bena, MN), Six Mile, and Webb. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch. The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nPleasant Lake has a diverse fishery. Walleye numbers have steadily increased from the historic low in 2014. The Walleye gill net catch rate of over five fish per net in the 2020 survey met the minimum management goal of five fish per net. Nearly 70 percent of the sampled Walleyes were from natural reproduction and only 16 percent were from a stocked year. Additional assessments are needed to fully evaluate the current Walleye fingerling stocking strategy. Walleye averaged 18 inches long and lengths ranged from 8 to 27 inches. Northern Pike numbers in Pleasant Lake continued to be very high and the gill net catch rate exceeded the management goal of 10 to 12 fish per gill net. The Northern Pike population was dominated by fish less than 22 inches long. Northern Pike averaged 17 inches long and lengths ranged from 10 to 28 inches. Bluegill were moderately abundant though the trap net catch rate was below the management goal of 15 to 30 fish per net. Fair numbers of Bluegills over 7 inches long were sampled. The Black Crappie gill net catch was within the management goal of one to four fish per net. Black Crappie over 10 inches were sampled.  Largemouth Bass generally run small and ranged in size from 7 to 16 inches long. Smallmouth Bass have had a significant presence in the fishery since 2014. Smallmouth bass ranged in size from 8 to 17 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were low and below the management goal minimum of 10 fish per gill net. Yellow Perch are the main forage fish for Walleye. Low Yellow Perch numbers may be limiting the success of Walleye stocking. Other fish species that are available for anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Pleasant Lake are rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 22 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 25.9 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 14.1?C (57.4?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 2021, 2002, 2005, 2012, and 2020 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1038-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 6.26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Pleasant Lake, however the population is dominated by small fish.  Walleye are moderately abundant and fish up to 28 inches were sampled; the mean length of walleye was 18 inches.  Northern pike up to 33 inches were sampled and the mean length was 18 inches however 85% of the fish sampled were between 14 to 21 inches.  Bluegill abundance is similar to other lakes in the same lake class and fish up to 7 inches were sampled.  Black crappie are present but they are not sampled very well with the current sampling gears used.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available for anglers to catch are black bullhead, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), yellow bullhead, white sucker and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Pleasant Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE WALLEYE GILLNET CPUE OVER THE LAST FIVE ASSESSMENTS HAS BEEN QUITE CONSISTENT, RANGING FROM 3.8-6.4.  IN 1992, WALLEYE WERE CAPTURED AT 4.1/LIFT, WHICH WAS COMPARABLE TO THE FIRST QUARTILE VALUE FOR LAKE CLASS 27.  THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 12.0-29.9 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 16.0-16.9 INCHES. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION SHOWS A QUALITY WALLEYE POPULATION WITH EXCELLENT PSD (86) AND RSD-P (25) VALUES.  THERE ARE ENOUGH STOCKING BLANKS TO SHOW THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE WALLEYE POPULATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1988, 1985 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE 1992 ASSESSMENT AND ARE YEARS THAT NO WALLEYE WERE STOCKED.  WHEN LOOKING AT PAST ASSESSMENTS, THERE ARE MANY STOCKING BLANK YEARS THAT ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY WALLEYE.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES WHERE AN AGE V FISH WAS 17.4 INCHES LONG.NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE (13.3/GILLNET LIFT) WAS HIGH FOR 1992 AND HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGH, WITH A RANGE OF 5.38-16.43 (MEAN=12.7).  THE THIRD QUARTILE VALUE FOR LAKE CLASS 27 IS 8.43.  THESE NORTHERN PIKE WERE SMALL, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 18.0-18.9 INCHES AND PSD AND RSD-P VALUES OF ONLY 8 AND 0 RESPECTIVELY.  HISTORICALLY, NORTHERN PIKE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY SMALL IN SIZE IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  GROWTH WAS MARGINALLY SLOW AT ALL AGES, WITH AGE V MALE AND FEMALE NORTHERN PIKE BEING 18.1 AND 21.2 INCHES LONG RESPECTIVELY.WHEN LOOKING AT FORAGE FISH, THREE SPECIES WERE EVIDENT IN THE GILLNETS.  CISCO WERE CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBER (0.8), BUT ARE GENERALLY A DIFFICULT SPECIES TO SAMPLE DURING THE SUMMER USING STANDARD GEAR.  WHITE SUCKER GILLNET CPUE (4.1) WAS COMPARABLE TO THE THIRD QUARTILE VALUE FOR LAKE CLASS 27.  YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CPUE WAS COMPARABLE TO THE FIRST QUARTILE VALUE.  YELLOW PERCH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 4.5-11.4 INCHES, SHOWING THAT THERE ARE SOME RECREATIONAL FISHING OPPORTUNITIES.BLUEGILL CPUE FOR 1992 (13.5) WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 1989 (69.4), BUT WAS TYPICAL (MEDIAN=15.88) OF OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES.  IF YOU EXCLUDE THE 1989 ASSESSMENT, CPUE HISTORICAL RANGE WAS MUCH NARROWER (13.5-24.4).  THE 1992 BLUEGILL RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3.0-8.9 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5-6.9 INCHES.  PSD AND RSD VALUES FROM 1992 WERE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 1961 AND 1975 ASSESSMENTS.  GROWTH WAS SLOW WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER AREA LAKES IN THE SAME LAKE CLASS.  AN AGE V BLUEGILL WAS 4.6 INCHES LONG.ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEAD WERE CAUGHT IN NUMBERS THAT WERE BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE VALUE.A TOTAL OF 15 BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED IN TESTNETTING AND NIGHT ELECTROFISHING.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF YEAR CLASSES SHOWING CONSISTENT REPRODUCTION.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND SLOWED DOWN AFTER THAT.  AN AGE V FISH WAS 8.6 INCHES LONG.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1,038 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 10.06 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Pleasant Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco). <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in Pleasant Lake are above average when compared to similar lakes in the Walker Fisheries Area and abundance has remained relatively stable over the survey history, however the population is dominated by small fish.  Walleye populations have been historically sustained by natural reproduction, and recent fingerling stockings have not increased walleye recruitment and abundance. Overall, walleye are moderately abundant with lengths averaging 17 inches and fish up to 25 inches being sampled in 2012.  Largemouth bass grow well in Pleasant Lake, and fish sampled averaged 11 inches. Bluegill abundance is similar to other lakes in the same lake class and fish up to 8 inches were sampled.  Black crappie are present but they were not sampled effectively with the gears used. The black crappie that were sampled in 2012 averaged 9 inches long with the largest fish being over 13 inches long.  Smallmouth bass are also present in Pleasant Lake but more directed sampling is required to determine realistic goals for abundance and size structure.  Yellow perch numbers are at a historic low but fish up to 11 inches were sampled. <br> \nOther fish species that are available for anglers are black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker and yellow bullhead <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Pleasant Lake are rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 77 survey sites evenly spaced every 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 76.2 (+/- 2.1) out of 100 possible. Approximately 66 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 68.1 (+/- 2.5), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.1 (+/- 1.3).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 1,099-acre lake with 10.06 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet located east of Hackensack, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the northwest shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Pleasant Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are characterized as large and deep. Other area lakes in this class include Ada, Crooked, Lower Sucker, Webb, and Six Mile Lake. Pleasant Lake possesses a moderately developed shoreline. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPleasant Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity with the potential to produce large fish. Northern Pike are abundant, exceeding the lake's maximum management goal. Sampled pike ranged from 10 to 29 inches. Black Crappie catch rates met lake management size and catch goals and crappie 4 to 12 inches were sampled. Walleye abundance was lower than the 2 previous surveys at 3 fish per net and lengths ranged from 10 to 28 inches. Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Pleasant during odd years. Bluegill catch rates fell short of the target management range, though exceeded size goals with roughly half of sampled fish measuring 6 inches or longer and Bluegill up to 10 inches sampled. Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch abundance has remained low across historical surveys, though have consistently been present in catch since initial surveying.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter in Pleasant Lake include, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Pleasant Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THE 1989 SAMPLE CONSISTED OF TWO SIZE GROUPS OF FISH: 7 TO 9 INCHES AND 15 TO 20 INCHES.THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE IS HIGH AT 14.2/GN.  HISTORICALLY IT HAS RANGED FROM 6.4 TO 16.4/GN.  SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE COLLECTED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 15 TO 20 INCHES.  GROWTH RATES ARE NEAR AVERAGE.NET CATCHES OF BLUEGILL ARE HIGHER THAN DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS - 69/TN, HISTORICAL 14 TO 24; 33/GN, HISTORICAL 0 TO 16.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL IN PLEASANT LAKE IS NOT FAST (7\" INCHES APPROXIMATELY 7 YEARS OLD), BUT THE QUALITY OF THE SAMPLE COLLECTED IS BETTER THAN FROM MOST AREA LAKES - 18 PERCENT GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 7 INCHES; PSD = 47.  DURING ALL PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS, 20 PERCENT OF THE FISH IN THE SAMPLES COLLECTED WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 7 INCHES IN LENGTH.  BY THIS \"MEASURE OF QUALITY\", THE BLUEGILL POPULATION HAS NOT CHANGED.  PSD VALUES HAVE DECREASED FROM 70 DURING THE 1960'S AND 1970'S TO 40 AND 47 FOR THE SAMPLES COLLECTED DURING 1984 AND 1989 RESPECTIVELY.SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1989.CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF GEAR USED, FAIR NUMBERS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLACK CRAPPIES WERE COLLECTED.  LARGEMOUTH BASS FROM 4 TO 14 INCHES WERE CAPTURED, AND THEY EXHIBITED A GOOD GROWTH RATE.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS EXCELLENT.  TWO SIZE GROUPS OF BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED, 6 TO 8 INCHES AND 10 TO 13 INCHES.THE 1989 GILLNET CATCH OF WALLEYE (3.8) IS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF CATCHES (4.6 TO 6.4).  THOUGH LOWER, IT IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.  MOST ALL YEAR CLASSES ARE WELL REPRESENTED, AS WELL AS IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN WALLEYE STOCKING AND YEAR CLASS STRENGTH.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WALLEYE IS EXCELLENT.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 1038 acre lake located near Hackensack, MN.  Pleasant Lake has 6.3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  Approximately 40% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Pleasant Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large (> 1,000 acres) and very deep (> 75 feet).  This lake is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  Fish population surveys have been conducted by the MNDNR in 1961, 1975, 1984, 1989, 1992, 1995 and 1998; the current survey was done in 2001.  During the 2001 survey walleye sampled by the DNR ranged from 9.4 to 27.2 inches.  The average length of these fish was 18.9 inches and average weight was 2.3 pounds.  The 2001 gill net catch rate was within a typical range for lakes in this lake class.  Growth rates for walleye in Pleasant Lake are comparable to other lakes in this lake class.  Pleasant Lake has not been stocked since 1989 and natural reproduction is sustaining this population.    The catch rate for northern pike in 2001 was high.  The average size of northern pike was larger in 2001 than in previous Pleasant Lake surveys; however, the population is dominated by small individuals (< 20 inches).  Northern pike ranging in size from 10.1 to 31.9 inches were collected during the 2001 survey.  Northern pike growth rates were similar to other lakes in this lake class.    Bluegills in Pleasant Lake continue to do well.  The average size of bluegill was similar to previous years and some individuals in the 7 and 8-inch categories were sampled.  The bluegill collected in DNR trap nets were plump, indicating a good food supply.    Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Long Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.    Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.  Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1038-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 6.26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore.  The MNDNR has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pleasant Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in the class are very large, deep, and regularly shaped lakes.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and tullibee.Both walleye and northern pike were abundant in Pleasant Lake.  Walleye up to 28 inches were sampled and the mean length was 17 inches.  More smaller fish were sampled during this assessment when compared to previous surveys, which will provide opportunities for anglers in the future.  Northern pike up to 29 inches were sampled and the mean length was 19 inches.  Seventy-two percent of the fish sampled were between 14 to 21 inches.  Other fish species that are available for anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Pleasant Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant is a 1038-acre lake located in northern Cass County.  Pleasant has a maximum depth of 72 feet with 39 percent of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Pleasant is 2.5 miles east of Hackensack, Minnesota.  A state-owned public access is located at the north end of the lake.Based on physical, chemical and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types.  Pleasant is in Lake Class 27.  Other area lakes in this classification include Ada (eight miles east of Backus), Portage (six miles north of Hackensack), and Webb (six miles east of Hackensack).The walleye catch during the 1995 survey was 4.9 fish per experimental gill net. This catch was similar to other surveys of Pleasant and was average for lakes of this type.  The average size of walleye checked in the 1995 assessment was 1.6 lbs. (16.6 inches) and ranged in length from 8.0 to 30.0 inches. The growth rate was similar to lakes of this type. The average length of walleye at  age 4 was 16.2 inches. Ageing results indicated Pleasant Lake has good natural reproduction for walleye.  The lake has not been stocked since 1989, yet the walleye catch rate changed little from previous surveys. Northern pike were abundant in Pleasant; the gill net catch rate of NOP in 1995 (20.4 fish/net) was higher than in any previous survey. During 1995 and most previous surveys, the catch rate of northern pike was well above average for lakes of this type.  Most Pleasant Lake northern pike were small.  The mean weight of sampled northern pike was 1.4 lbs (17.7 inches). Of the northern pike 14 inches and longer, about 15 percent were 21 inches or greater.  Growth of Pleasant Lake northern pike was similar to other lakes of this type; average length at age 4 was 20.8 inches.Bluegill were abundant in the 1995 trap net sample (30.2 fish/net).  This was the second-highest bluegill catch rate of any Pleasant Lake survey.  Bluegill catches in 1995 and previous surveys were at or above the average for this lake type. About 38 percent of the sampled bluegill were 6 inches or longer.  The growth rate of bluegill in this lake was slow compared to other lakes of this type; the average bluegill was just 4.3 inches when it reached age 5.The trap net catch rate of pumpkinseed (3.2 fish/net) was average compared to other Class 27 lakes.  Of the pumpkinseed collected in 1995 by both types of nets, 22 percent were in the 6-inch category, and none exceeded 6.9 inches.The trap net catch of largemouth bass in 1995 (1.0 fish/net) was near average for this lake type.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.9 inches and was similar to previous surveys.  In 1995, largemouth bass up to 21.9 inches were sampled by electrofishing. An average largemouth in Pleasant was 11.7 inches when it reached 4 years of age, which is similar to growth in other Class 27 lakes.Just seven black crappie were sampled in Pleasant in 1995 by netting and electrofishing combined. Black crappie sampled by gill nets and trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 10.9 inches.Gill net catch of yellow perch in 1995 (18.5 fish/net) was similar to earlier surveys and was near average for this lake type. Most sampled yellow perch were small, but about 13 percent were 9 inches or longer.Cisco (tullibee) were common in the 1995 sample, and were more abundant than in previous Pleasant Lake surveys.  Catches of white sucker, rock bass and yellow bullhead were at or above average compared to other class 27 lakes.  Other species sampled by trap net and/or gill net include bowfin, black bullhead, and brown bullhead.To help maintain quality fish populations in Pleasant Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Pleasant Lake watershed is also  needed for maintaining  water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Pleasant Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is a 1038-acre lake with a maximum depth of 72 feet.  The lake is located 1.5 miles east of Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Pleasant Lake is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Ada, Webb, Portage (north of Leech Lake), and Crooked (north of Leech Lake) Lakes.  Approximately 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR public access on the northwest corner of the lake.  Pleasant Lake is a good fishing lake for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.Northern pike will give the angler plenty of action especially for 15 to 21 inch fish.  There is the opportunity to catch a northern pike over 28 inches.  Northern pike abundance is above what you would expect to find in other lake class 27 lakes.  Pleasant Lake northern pike have always been abundant.   In order for anglers to catch more large northern pike, selective harvest needs to be practiced; release all fish over 22 inches long.       Walleye were caught at a rate that was the highest recorded of any survey conducted on Pleasant Lake.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye that are 12 to 20 inches with the opportunity for larger fish.  There has been no stocking since 1989.  All fish are the result of natural reproduction.  Pleasant Lake has abundant rock rubble areas around the entire lake that need to be protected if walleye abundance is to continue.  Pleasant Lake has a good reputation for panfish such as bluegill and black crappie.  The number of bluegill seven inches or larger has not changed since the earliest surveys.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate higher than that usually found in lake class 27 lakes.  Bass ranged  from 4 to 19 inches in length with numerous fish at 10 - 11 inches.  There appears to be abundant food fish for northern pike and walleye.  Yellow perch is the primary food fish and were sampled at rates that are typical of other lake class 27 lakes.  The size of perch has not changed since earlier surveys.  Other food fish that were sampled are white sucker and cisco.Rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish were abundant compared to other lake class 27 lakes.  Anglers fishing for these species can expect to find quality size fish.  All three species of bullheads were sampled.There has been much development on Pleasant Lake.  The number of  lake homes has increased from 73 in 1961 to 144 in 1998. This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  An inventory in 1998 shows that Pleasant Lake has few stands of emergent vegetation such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice. Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  Lakeshore that is not      currently developed is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  These shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lakeshore from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Pleasant Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Pleasant Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Pleasant Lake and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Large fish can help maintain balance in the fish community.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1,099 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 10.06 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Pleasant Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR)-owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Pleasant Lake are above average when compared to similar lakes in the Walker Fisheries Area and abundance has remained relatively stable over the survey history, however the population is dominated by small fish.  Northern Pike averaged 17.6 inches in length with fish up to 31 inches collected. Although the 2014 catch rate of 3.3 Walleye per net was near the historical low, fish averaged 17.6 inches and Walleye up to 29 inches were sampled. Largemouth Bass abundance was similar to previous surveys, and fish up to 17 inches were sampled. The number of Bluegill found was similar to other lakes in the same lake class and fish up to 9 inches were sampled. Black Crappie are present but they were not sampled effectively with the gears used. The Black Crappie sampled in 2014 averaged 10 inches, with the largest fish being close to 14 inches. More Smallmouth Bass were found in the 2014 sampling than in previous years, and fish from 7 to 17 inches were present. Yellow Perch numbers were greater than in the previous survey, but this species was not as abundant as in other lakes in this class.  In 2014 Yellow Perch from 5 to 11 inches were sampled. Other fish species that are available for anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Pleasant Lake are rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pleasant Lake is 1,099 acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 10.06 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 72 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Pleasant Lake is in lake class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR)-owned concrete boat ramp on the northwest shore. Similar Lake Class 27 lakes in the Walker area include Ada, Portage (south of Bena, MN), Six Mile, and Webb. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch. This survey was a standard fisheries population assessment conducted during the summer of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Pleasant Lake are above average when compared to similar lakes in the Walker Fisheries Area and abundance has remained relatively stable over the survey history. The population is dominated by small fish, and Northern Pike sampled in 2017 averaged 17.6 inches in length with fish up to 30 inches observed. The Walleye gill net catch rate increased to 4.9 fish per net from the 2014 catch rate of 3.3 fish per net. Walleye averaged 16.5 inches long and Walleye up to 25 inches were sampled. Largemouth Bass abundance increased compared to previous surveys, and fish up to 17 inches were sampled. The number of Bluegill found was similar to other lakes in the same lake class and fish up to 9 inches were sampled. Black Crappie are present but they were not sampled effectively with the gears used. Black Crappie sampled in 2017 averaged 9 inches long, with the largest fish being close to 13 inches. Smallmouth Bass numbers in 2017 were similar to the 2014 survey and fish from 10 to 18 inches were present. Yellow Perch numbers were down slightly from the previous survey, but this species was not as abundant as in other lakes in this class.  In 2017 Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches. Other fish species that are available for anglers are Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Pleasant Lake are rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
