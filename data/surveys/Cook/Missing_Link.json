It is currently managed for brook trout, with a long range goal of maintaining a population that provides two catchable-sized year classes (fish 10 inches or larger), with some fish up to 16 inches.  This was the third of three assessments scheduled in the 2001 lake management plan to determine whether the long range goal could be met with a reduced stocking rate (reduced from 3,000 fgl annually to 2,000 fgl annually, beginning in 2003).  The current management plan will be reviewed and revised in January 2014. <br> \n <br> \nGoals for brook trout in this lake were barely met in the 2012 assessment.  The brook trout catch was the lowest seen in this lake since 1986, due largely to the near-failure of the 2010 stocking.  Although two catchable-sized year classes were present (2009 and 2010), neither seemed to have been present in very high numbers.   Most of the brook trout collected were one-year-old fish from the 2011 fingerling stocking.  Growth for the three three-year-old fish taken had been average; they reached at mean length of 12.5 inches at the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker gill net catch was the lowest seen to date in this lake, and was below the normal range for spring assessments of stream trout lakes in this area (2.83-14.33 fish/set).  White sucker compete with brook trout for invertebrate forage, but their abundance in Missing Link Lake may have been low enough in 2012 to minimize their effect on brook trout performance.  No other undesirable fish species were taken in this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Brook trout survival appeared to have been good, and growth rates had been somewhat faster than average for the area.  One and three-year-old fish averaged 8.3 and 17.2 inches in length when they were collected in early June.The white sucker catch, although close to the average for the lake class, was actually relatively low for lakes managed for stream trout in this area.  The 2000 catch of 3.33 fish/gill net was below the normal range of 4.0 to 23.0 fish/gill net in spring assessments of Grand Marais-area stream trout lakes.  The 2000 catch was similar to catches seen in this lake historically.

                "narrative": "<p>Missing Link is a designated stream trout lake that has been stocked with Rainbow or Brook Trout on a regular basis since at least 1933.  Since 2003 Brook Trout fingerlings have been stocked annually.  The current goal for Brook Trout in this lake is to maintain a population consisting of at least two year classes of fish 10-inches or larger, with some fish over 16 inches present.  This survey was the first of two scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to complete an evaluation of the shift to annual stocking that began in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nGiven the low number of net sets typically used in surveys of this small lake, the gill net catch in a single survey may not be a good indicator of fish abundance, or of changes in abundance.  The Brook Trout gill net catch in 2016 fell within the normal range (2.7-13.8 fish/net) seen in spring surveys of stream trout lakes in this area (data through 2014), and was similar other catches seen in this lake since 1991.  Management goals for the lake were met in 2016; three year classes contributed fish larger than 10 inches, and one fish over 16 inches in length was taken.  Long-term survival seemed to have been good, with fish as old as four years present, and no recently stocked year classes were missing.  Brook Trout growth appeared to have been fairly good; fish reached a mean length of 9.7 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout in this lake must compete with White Sucker for invertebrate forage; however, White Sucker abundance has not been excessive.  The 2016 White Sucker gill net catch was close to the average (6.5 fish/set) seen in spring surveys of stream trout lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-oxygen profile measured on September 6 2016, by a crew on their way into Mavis Lake, found optimal conditions for Brook Trout (water temperature < 68 F, dissolved oxygen > 5.0 ppm) at depths of 10-17 feet.  Since lakes in this area have typically started to cool by early September, and water temperatures were barely within the optimal range at that time, it is likely that more stressful conditions would have prevailed in this lake in August.</p>",
