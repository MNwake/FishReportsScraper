Mean weight of individual northern pike was 2.10 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=45) is also indicative of a small-sized northern pike population.  Only two northern pike sampled in both the gill and trapnets were >23 inches.  The small size structure is related to growth rates.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, although growth rates are variable among year classes.  Mean length at age 5 is 20.94 inches.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggest low and inconsistent recruitment.  1988 is the only strong year class and accounts for almost half (47%) of the sampled northern pike.Number of pumpkinseed sampled was within the normal range, wheras pounds per trapnet was below the first quartile for lakes in Class 33.  Yellow perch also have a small-sized population (PSD=7).  Gillnet catch rates of yellow perch were within the normal ranges; however, trapnet catches were above the third quartile.White sucker and black bullhead were the only fish species sampled in 2nd Gulch Lake in 1992.  Both species have low density populations with net catches just reaching into the normal ranges.</p>",

There is a DNR Forestry campground on the north shore of the lake that provides carry-in access.  With the exception of the east bay, Second Gulch has limited shallow water habitat, dropping off quickly into deep water from the shoreline.  This limited amount of shallow water habitat along with stratification of the water column limits the productivity of this lake.  While second Gulch is 41 feet deep, the lake stratifies during the summer months and low oxygen levels are found below 18 feet.  Due to its small size, Second Gulch is susceptible to over-harvest.  Anlgers must practice selective harvest of catch and release if they want to improve the fishery in Second Gulch.Second Gulch provides fishing opportunities for northern pike and  black crappie.  Moderate numbers of northern pike and black crappie were sampled.  Northern pike up to 39.7 inches and black crappie up to 10.9 inches were measured.  Yellow perch, pumpkinseed, and black bullhead are also present in Second Gulch, but are generally small in size and not an acceptable size for angling.</p>",
