Benson Lake is located 8.5 miles northeast of Finland, MN off of Lake County Road #7.  The lake is found within the boundary of George Crosby Manitou State Park, thus a vehicle permit is required.   There is a carry-in access on the northwest side of the lake via the State Park access road and the lake is non-motorized.  The lake is suitable for angling from a small boat, canoe, or float tube.  There are several spots for shore fishing.  A hiking trail with boardwalk goes around the entire lake.  Benson Lake has been managed for stream trout since the early 1930s.  It is stocked annually with Splake fingerlings.  As Benson Lake is a designated trout lake, it is important to check the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations to follow all rules applicable to designated trout lakes.  Also, all Minnesota State Park rules must be followed. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 investigation sampled Splake, Brook Stickleback, Creek Chub, Fathead Minnow, Finescale Dace, Northern Redbelly Dace, and Pearl Dace.  The 2014 Splake catch with standard trap nets was 2.56/lift below average for similar lakes in the Finland Fisheries Area.  Despite being below average the catch was higher than the past two investigations.  Six Splake were also sampled in the small mesh trap nets.   The average size of the Splake sampled was 12.63 inches and weighed 0.90 pounds.  The largest fish collected was 19.09 inches and 2.87 pounds.  Fish up to four years old were represented in the sample as determined from scale aging.  Growth of Splake was average when compared to other Splake lakes in the Finland Area.  <br> \n</p>",

The lake is within the boundaries of Crosby-Manitou State Park; a vehicle permit is required.  There is a carry-down access on the northwest side of the lake, suitable for small boats and canoes.  No outboard motors, snowmobiles or power ice-augers are allowed on the lake, and fish houses cannot be left on the lake overnight.  Splake abundance in 2004 was within the normal range for stream trout lakes in this area.  The average size of splake taken in this assessment was larger than usual.  Splake growth rates had been fast, probably due to an excellent minnow forage base. </p>",
