NET CATCH ABUNDANCES HAVE NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR MOST SPECIES SINCE 1986.  THERE ARE HOWEVER, TWO GLARING EXCEPTIONS; NOP NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND YEP NUMBERS HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  PIKE ABUNDANCE IS CURRENTLY WELL ABOVE THE INTER-QUARTILE RANGE WHILE PERCH ABUNDANCE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS #33.  THE BEST REPRESENTED AGE CLASSES FOR WAE (III AND V) WERE FROM YEARS DURING WHICH THERE WAS NO FINGERLING STOCKING.  BESEAU LAKE HABITAT DOES NOT APPEAR CONDUCTIVE TO A GOOD WAE HATCH AND UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS TO WHETHER THE MAJOR COHORTS ARE RECRUITS, IMMIGRANTS FROM UPPER CORMORANT LAKE OR WHETHER AGEING WAS INACCURATE, ALTHOUGH ANNULI APPEAR QUITE CLEAR ON DORSAL SPINES AS WELL AS OTALITHS.  BLGS ARE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT TYPICAL FOR LAKES OF ITS ECOLOGICAL CLASS.  THE YOUNG (ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY (=AGE CLASS IV) BLG POPULATION EXPERIENCES GOOD INDIVIDUAL GROWTH RATES AND IS PROBABLY HEAVILY CROPPED BY ANGLERS.  BLC FROM THE '88 YEAR CLASS WERE MOST NUMEROUS IN TRAPNET CATCHES.  LMB ARE PRESENT AND NET CATCHES HAVE NOT CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SINCE '86. BLH, ESPECIALLY THE YELLOW SPECIES, ARE VERY ABUNDANT AND PROBABLY COMMERCIALLY MARKETABLE WHEN NOT GRUBBY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beseau Lake has a history of providing fair to good fishing for panfish, bass, northern pike, and walleye between winterkills.  Severe winterkills have not been frequent in this lake.  However, it did experience heavy fish mortality in 1994, moderate mortality in 2001, and very light mortality in 2004.  The 2001 kill occurred despite the operation of an aeration system by the lake association in cooperation with the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleyes have been stocked regularly for over two decades, and sporadically since 1916, test net catches have consistently remained quite low in this lake.  The gill net catch rate in 2006 was 1.2 walleyes per set.  Although walleyes were not abundant, they were relatively large with an average length of 21.8 inches and average weight of 3.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and black crappie have survived in this lake without stocking.  Catch rates for both were slightly above the lake's historical averages in 2006.  Pike averaged about 2.5 pounds in weight and 22.9 inches in length, though fish over 30 inches were sampled.  Crappies were generally young and small, but a few larger individuals were found and there is a strong 2003 year class that should provide good fishing in coming years if no winterkill occurs. <br> \n <br> \nIncreasing numbers of black bullheads may be an indicator of declining water qauality in Beseau Lake.  One data point is not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions, but does illustrate the need to be vigilant.  In six lake studies from 1964 through 2001, black bullhead catches had never risen higher than 18.4 per trap net.  In 2006, catch rates rose to 166.9 black bullheads per trap net.  It behooves lakeshore owners and all watershed dwellers to be good land stewards in order to slow the aging process in this lake that is already marginal for supporting a fish community.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bijou Lake was conducted on August 1, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bijou Lake has a history of providing fair to good fishing for panfish, bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye between winterkills. It is a relatively shallow and eutrophic lake, though severe winterkills have been rare. However, heavy winterkill mortality did occur in 1994, moderate mortality in 2001, and light mortality in 2004. Historical net catches also suggest that winterkill occurred sometime between 1964 and 1978. Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill have survived without stocking after winterkills.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, catch rate for Northern Pike was 8.5 fish per gill net which is within what is expected for similar lakes. Northern Pike size was good with fish averaging 4.1 pounds and 26.0 inches, and fourteen sampled fish were over 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rate for Black Crappie was 1.2 fish per trap net, and fish were moderate in size with an average length of 8.5 inches.  Six years is required before Black Crappie reached 10 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch was greatly reduced by winterkill in the 2001 survey. Though by the time of the 2006 survey Bluegill catch had rebounded to within what is expected for similar lakes, and it has remained there since. In 2016, sampled Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 8.8 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  Bluegill that were 8 inches long were around 7 to 8 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually. Despite over three decades of stocking, Walleye gill net catch rates have remained consistently low in Bijou Lake compared to similar lakes around the state. However, gill net catch rate in 2016 reached a historical high of 2.0 Walleyes per net. Although Walleyes were not abundant, those sampled averaged 20.1 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bijou Lake has a history of providing fair to good fishing for panfish, bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye between winterkills.  It is a relatively shallow and eutrophic lake, though severe winterkills have been rare.  However, heavy winterkill mortality did occur in 1994, moderate mortality in 2001, and light mortality in 2004.  A standard survey was completed in June 2022 to evaluate the current status of the fish populations in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye abundance continues to be low in Bijou Lake, Northern Pike abundance increased slightly compared to the last survey in 2016.  Pike size is respectable, with an average fish measuring 24 inches long.  Black Crappie abundance was not high, but fish up to 10 inches long were found.  Bluegill abundance was much higher than the 2016 survey, but most were six to seven inches long.  Only four Largemouth Bass were captured, with the largest fish measuring 14 inches long.  Despite high catches in the past, no Black Bullheads were captured in trap nets in 2016 or 2022.  Other sampled species included Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bijou (Beseau) Lake is a 210-acre lake located in western Becker County.  The agricultural watershed, marginal water quality, and continuing shoreline development make it susceptible to winterkill.  Bijou Lake has experienced a light winterkill in 2004, a moderate winterkill in 2001, and a severe winterkill in 1994.  Property owners reported abundant dead fish in the spring of 2023, which prompted a fisheries survey to be conducted in May 2023 to assess the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Trap nets captured Northern Pike, White Sucker, Black Crappie, Black Bullhead, and Yellow Bullhead.  These are all species which are more tolerant to low oxygen conditions, but no species were abundant.  Northern Pike had an average length of 21 inches.  Bijou Lake appears to have experienced a significant winterkill for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass during the 2022-2023 winter.  This would be the first major winterkill in Bijou Lake since 1994.  As a result, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie were reintroduced in spring 2023.  Angling opportunities for Northern Pike are still available, but it will take several years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beseau Lake has a history of providing good fishing for panfish, bass, northern pike, and walleye in between winterkills.  Severe winterkills have not been frequent in Beseau Lake, occurring about every twenty years or so.  Most recently, the lake experienced heavy fish mortality in 1994.  With natural reproduction from both restocked and surviving fish species, the lake's fish community is now rebounding quickly.  Rapid growth in fish size and abundance is typical of winterkill prone lakes since there is very little competition or predation from other fishes following severe winterkill.  Barring another winterkill, good panfish and pike angling should be available in 1997 or 1998 while largemouth bass and walleye may take slightly longer to reach harvestable size.The lake association, with help from the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club, has installed and operated an aeration system in the lake since 1995.  Aeration may help prevent some winterkill in severe winters, although it is never a panacea.  In addition to being marginal as a permanent fish lake, Beseau Lake is relatively small in size (226 acres).  Consequently, increasing shoreline development and resulting loss of fish habitat is a concern.  Commonly, one of the first things a shoreline owner wants to do is create a swimming beach.  Bulrushes, cattails, and other beneficial plants are often illegally removed, tree snags and shoreline vegetation removed and sand frequently dumped in shoal waters.  While this \"cleaning up\" may look like an improvement to the landowner, it degrades fish populations and water quality, two of the things most important to lakeshore owners.Nest building fish species like bluegill, largemouth bass and black crappie depend upon the spawning and nesting cover afforded by bulrush stands.  Other fish and wildlife species use those same stands for feeding and cover.  Bulrushes and cattails are both effective in preventing shoreline erosion and in removing nutrients and some pollutants from the water.  Nutrients (especially phosphorus) that are not \"tied up\" in fish or plants will probably be utilized in algal blooms.  Blue-green algal blooms are the ones that result in the slimy, smelly, paint-like coatings on the water surface during periods of hot weather.  Most lake users would much prefer a lake rimmed with bulrushes and cattails to one that is frequently covered with blue-green slime.The point is that the more riparian owners can do to slow nutrient input into the lake, the better it will be for their property values, water quality and fish populations.  Rather than minimally following zoning rules and regulations, owners would be wise to regulate themselves even more stringently.  Some examples include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergent plants like bulrush and cattail) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations and asking advice about how to achieve water use goals without sacrificing water quality, fish communities and, eventually, property values.In summary, Beseau Lake's fish community is rapidly recovering from the severe winterkill of 1994.  It is imperative that the lake's users and watershed dwellers use the best management and landscaping practices available to ensure that water quality and winterkill conditions are not worsened.  No amount of aeration can make up for increased nutrient input, shoreline erosion, and lost fish habitat in this lake that already provides only marginal fish habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beseau Lake has a history of providing good fishing for panfish, bass, northern pike, and walleye between winter kills.  Severe winter kills have not been frequent.  However, the lake experienced heavy fish mortality in 1994 and moderate mortality in 2001.  The 2001 kill occurred despite the operation of an aeration system by the lake association in cooperation with the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club.During times of low dissolved oxygen, walleye, bluegill, and largemouth bass are generally the first to die.  Net catches of largemouth bass and bluegill dropped markedly following the 2001 winter kill.  However, panfish populations should recover quickly if dissolved oxygen remains above critical levels for the next few winters.Although catches of northern pike and black crappie were down from those of 1996, these species were not impacted by the 2001 winter kill nearly as severely as bluegills and bass.  In fact, crappie catches remained above the lake's historical average.  Crappies averaged just under nine inches long and just under a half pound each.  Northern pike averaged 19.6 inches but a couple over 30 inches were present.As a small, fertile, marginal fish lake, Beseau is vulnerable to declines in water quality related to shoreline development.  Development of the shoreline and surrounding watershed could cause declines in water quality that could increase smelly algal blooms and create a fish community dominated by black bullheads.  Loss of fish habitat that often results from shoreline development is a concern.  Commonly, shoreline owners attempt to create a swimming beach.  Bulrushes, cattails, and other beneficial plants are often illegally removed, tree snags and shoreline vegetation removed, and sand frequently dumped in shoal waters.  While this may seem like an improvement to the landowner, it degrades fish populations and water quality, two of the things most important to lakeshore owners.Landowners are encouraged to apply \"best management practices\" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  For those who want to improve their shoreline property, two excellent resources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in the least damaging, most beneficial way.  \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.The benefits of being a good lakeshore or watershed steward are many.  Good stewardship includes not destroying, or even promoting, bulrush stands in Beseau Lake.  Nest building fish species like bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie depend upon the spawning and nesting cover afforded by bulrush stands.  Other fish and wildlife species use those same stands for feeding and cover.  Bulrushes and cattails are both effective in preventing shoreline erosion and in removing nutrients and pollutants from the water.  Nutrients (especially phosphorus) that are not \"tied up\" in fish or plants often result in algal blooms.  Blue-green algal blooms are slimy, smelly, paint-like coatings on the water surface during periods of hot weather.  Shoreline owners can help prevent algae blooms and promote water quality by preserving emergent stands of cattail and bulrush.</p>",

Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-5 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 38.  Other scores have been 4 (June 2011), 9 (August 2011), and 31 (2017).  The two oldest scores are below the impairment threshold (24) whereas the most recent score is above the impairment threshold for this tool.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. </p>",

Submerged aquatic vegetation ranged from dense in the bays and around the islands to moderate along the remaining shoreline.  Bulrush was the most abundant emergent plant present and was common along the south and west shorelines.Test netting indicated the presence of good panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike populations.  Spawning areas were evaluated as good for these species.Local residents reported that angling for these species has been very good.</p>",

Severe winterkills have not been frequent in this lake.  However, it did experience heavy fish mortality in 1994, moderate mortality in 2001, and very light mortality in 2004.  The 2001 kill occurred despite the operation of an aeration system by the lake association in cooperation with the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleyes have been stocked regularly for over three decades, and sporadically since 1916, test net catches have consistently remained quite low in this lake.  The gill net catch rate in 2011 was 1.3 walleyes per set.  Although walleyes were not abundant, they were relatively large with an average length of 20.2 inches and average weight of 3.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and black crappie have survived in this lake without stocking.  Catch rates for pike were near the lake's historical average in 2011 while those for crappie declined to a historic low.  Pike averaged about 3.9 pounds in weight and 25.9 inches in length and a few fish over 30 inches were sampled.  Crappies were generally young and small with an average length of 8.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of black bullheads may be an indicator of declining water qauality in Bijou Lake.  Two data points (from 2006 and 2011) are not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions, but do illustrate the need to be vigilant.  In six lake studies from 1964 through 2001, black bullhead catches had never risen higher than 18.4 per trap net.  In 2006 and 2011, catch rates rose to 166.9 black bullheads per trap net and 50.9 per trap net, respectively.  It behooves lakeshore owners and all watershed dwellers to be good land stewards in order to slow the aging process in this lake that is already marginal for supporting a fish community.</p>",
