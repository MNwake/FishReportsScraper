                "narrative": "<p>First Lake is a small (80 acre), bog-stained, softwater lake without a public access.  It has a relatively small northern population in comparison to similar lakes, but the northerns are large.  Thirty percent of those taken in gillnets in this survey were 26\" or larger. Largemouth bass were not taken in trapnets or gillnets in this survey, but are reported to range up to seven pounds.  Time constraints prevented night electofishing for bass, which is the preferred method for sampling this species.  Bluegills are normal for the lake type, with over half of those taken in trapnets 6\" or larger.  Black crappies were normal in both size and weight in comparison to similar lakes, but have been more abundant in some previous assessments.  Walleyes were not taken in this or previous assessments.  Shoreline seining provided evidence of successful reproduction of yellow perch, northerns, largemouth bass, and bluegills in 1995.  In general, First Lake appears to have excellent gamefish populations, relatively lightly impacted by fishing pressure.     -Steve Morse</p>",
