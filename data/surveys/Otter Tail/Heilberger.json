                "narrative": "<p>     Heilberger Lake is a 224-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately ten miles southeast of Erhard, MN.  Heilberger Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Heilberger Lake is connected to Little Heilberger Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 47 feet; however, 43% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 11.5 feet, indicating good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Heilberger Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cottages.  The 1996 lake survey reported 60 homes and cottages along the shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 22 along the south shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail stands are scattered around the entire lake but are most prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Heilberger Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Heilberger Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available for these species. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Heilberger Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.8 to 19.1 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 14.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was the highest recorded for Heilberger Lake.  Northern pike also exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 15.6 to 34.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 18.7 inches at four years of age.  Poor growth rates may be attributed to an extremely low abundance of yellow perch, the preferred forage of northern pike.  <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Forty-four percent of the black crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent. Bluegill size structure has improved in recent surveys.  Sixty-nine percent of the bluegills in this survey were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth is moderate with an average length of 6.8 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is low.  Walleye survival is likely poor due to predation by very abundant northern pike and largemouth bass populations.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.0 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleye reach an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",

The average weight has decreased from 2.0 pounds in 1985 to 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike reproduction appears excellent as the sample consisted of fish aged I+ through VII+.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 39.0 per trap net lift in 1985 to 27.0 per net, which is similar to the area median.  The size structure of the bluegill population appears to have improved since the 1985 survey.  No bluegills greater than 7.0 inches were sampled in the 1985 survey compared to 24% in this survey.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass and black crappie reproduction appears good as several age- classes for each species were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 11.3 per gill net lift in 1985 to 0.3 per net, which is the lowest level recorded for this lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has increased from 1.3 per gill net lift in 1985 to 3.8 per net.

Walleye catches are below both state and local medians. Yellow perch numbers are above state medians, but below local medians.  <br> \n     Heilberger Lake has a history of having a high-density bluegill population with a small average size. Netting data supports this as a stable average weight of bluegill has been maintained for the past 18 years.  <br> \n     Test net catches of walleyes declined since the 1967 survey even with a maintenance stocking program. During spring electrofishing, 14 age-I+ walleyes were sampled; however, they were not sampled during the netting period. No age-II+ or III+ walleyes were sampled by either technique.  Management plans should de-emphasize walleye stocking and try to enhance the bass-panfish populations which are maintaining themselves.  <br> \n     Northern pike numbers have remained stable since the 1967 survey.  Year class strength has also remained stable.  <br> \n     An electrofishing survey conducted in May, 1985 indicated that the largemouth bass population has a stable age structure with age-IV+ being a strong year class. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Heilberger Lake is a 224-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately ten miles southeast of Erhard, MN.  Heilberger Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Heilberger Lake is connected to Little Heilberger Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 47 feet; however, 43% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 12.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.0 to 15.0 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Heilberger Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 22 along the south shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail stands are scattered around the entire lake but are most prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Heilberger Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant fish species in Heilberger Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available for these species. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 13.3 to 26.4 inches with an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Northern Pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.4 inches at four years of age.  Poor growth rates may be attributed to an extremely low abundance of Yellow Perch, the preferred forage of Northern Pike.  <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is very abundant.  Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Fifty-two percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegills are also very abundant.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is inconsistent.  Thirty-six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Heilberger Lake is a 224-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately ten miles southeast of Erhard, MN.  Heilberger Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Heilberger Lake is connected to Little Heilberger Lake via an unnavigable culvert along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 47 feet; however, 43% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2002 lake survey was 12.6 feet, indicating good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.0 to 15.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Heilberger Lake is included in lake class 33 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The shoreline of Heilberger Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cottages.  The 1996 lake survey reported 60 homes and cottages along the shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 22 along the south shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail stands are scattered around the entire lake but are most prevalent in the west bay.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Heilberger Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Heilberger Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available for these species.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Heilberger Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 18.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.7 inches and 1.0 pound.  Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at five years of age.       The northern pike test-net catch rate was the highest recorded for Heilberger Lake and was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Northern pike also exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike ranged in length from 12.9 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 18.4 inches at five years of age.  Poor growth rates may be attributed to an extremely low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage of northern pike.      The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 33 lakes.  The long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill abundance.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable in recent surveys.  Twenty-five percent of the bluegill in this survey were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth is moderate with an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.     Walleye fingerlings have been stocked on a triennial basis; however, walleye abundance is low.  Walleye fingerling survival is likely poor due to predation by very abundant northern pike and largemouth bass populations.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.0 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.9 pounds. Walleye reach an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",
