                "narrative": "<p>South Wigwam Lake is located 11 miles northwest of Schroeder in the Superior National Forest. There is a short carry in access to the outlet channel off of the Wigwam Lake Road (USFS Rd. #1226).  Contact the USFS Tofte district or check the Superior NF website https://www.fs.usda.gov/superior for information on camping in the area and activities in the Superior NF.  The lake has an area of 63 acres and a maximum depth of 6 feet.  Due to a beaver dam on the outlet, the observed depth in 2018 was 8 feet.  Northern Pike are the primary management species with Walleye and Yellow Perch considered secondary management species.  The fish community is sustained by natural reproduction as no stocking is done on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2018 to update the status of the fish community, evaluate current management goals, and provide information to direct future management activities.  In order to gain a better evaluation of the newly established Black Crappie population, the number of trap nets was doubled to 18 in this investigation, and timing was changed to early June instead of mid-summer.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch in three sets of 7.3/net was slightly higher than average when compared to other similar lakes.  Average weight and length was 1.3 pounds was 18.4 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 27.8 inches long and weighed 4.6 pounds.  Northern Pike recruitment was consistent with 2014 and 2015 having strong year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleye were sampled in gill nets, and one in a trap net. Both would be considered well below average.  The largest fish sampled was 24.3 inches long and weighed just shy of 6 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch of 1.1/net was about average for the lake class.  The average length and weight was 11.1 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 15.1 inches long and weighed 1.9 pounds.  Growth rate of Black Crappie is fast for the Finland Area, and like most of the lakes in the Finland Area, recruitment is very sporadic as just five year classes were sampled and the 2013 and 2015 year classes represented 74% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch of 3.4/net was slightly low and the average size was on the small end too.  The largest fish sampled was 8.7 inches long with the majority of the catch around 6 inches long.  Recruitment was consistent up to age-5 with 2015 and 2016 representing 71% of the catch.  Growth rate of Yellow Perch is average for the Finland Area.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch of 6/net and trap net catch of 0.9/net were both slightly below average for the lake class.  The average weight of about 2.7 pounds was above average.  The largest fish sampled was 22.5 inches long.  Other species sampled in the survey were Blacknose Shiner, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nMost fishermen on South Wigwam Lake target Northern Pike, but it is also locally known as a good duck hunting lake.  Some shore angling is done along the road just down the ridge to the lake where it drops off to 5 or 6 feet rather quickly.  With this year's results showing fair numbers of very nice sized Black Crappies it will likely increase pressure on them.  Fishermen in this area need to show some restraint in harvesting Crappie when the bite is good, as their recruitment is very sporadic and the population is maintained by only occasional strong year classes. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye averaged 14.2 inches; no fish larger than 17 inches were sampled. The walleye population is self-sustaining, although some migration may occur via Cross River from Finger Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were near average for the lake class; the average length was 17.6 inches and the largest sampled was 23.5 inches. While large numbers of big northern pike is unlikely, these small lake with low fishing pressure sometimes produce a trophy. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were well above average for the lake class with an average length of 7.5 inches and 21% of the catch was nine inches or larger.  Yellow perch numbers have varied widely in previous assessments, but recent sampling included some quality size fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled for the first time in South Wigwam and likely migrated from Cross River Lake where they are well established. Two crappies were sampled, the largest 11.3 inches and 0.9 pounds. <br> \n  <br> \n South Wigwam is shallow and heavily vegetated, most of the open water fishing is done early in the season before the lake gets too warm and the vegetation gets too thick.  The carry-in access from USFS Road # 1226 limits watercraft to canoes or small boats.  A parking area, serving both South Wigwam and Cross River Lakes, has space for four vehicles.  Winter access is typically with snowmobiles as roads in the South Wigwam Lake area are not plowed. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike are present in average numbers compared to similar class lakes in this area. Most of the northern pike sampled in the survey were smaller than 20 inches (1.5 pounds) however the lake does produce some larger fish as individuals up to 39.4 inches (17.4 pounds) were observed in the survey.     Test nets in 1995 indicates South Wigwam Lake presently contains a below average number of walleye however some seasonal movement of walleye may occur between the adjoining water bodies of the Cross River and Cross River Lake.     Yellow perch are present in above average numbers and of sufficient size to interest anglers as over 40% of the yellow perch sampled were in the 8 inch to 10.5 inch range.</p>",
