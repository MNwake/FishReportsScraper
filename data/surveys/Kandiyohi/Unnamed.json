                "narrative": "<p>Tadd & Upper consists of two shallow, productive and connected basins located in the city of Atwater, MN. Both basins have been aerated in the past. The aeration system was not run in 2012-13 winter due to the high numbers of carp and bullhead in Tadd & Upper. The 2012-13 winter was uncharacteristically cold, long and high in snowfall accumulation. A significant winterkill occurred during January/February of 2013. Numerous dead fish (carp, perch, walleye, northern pike, black bullhead, black crappie, etc.) were observed in the water and on shore. The water was brown-gray stained with a temperature of 56 F during the netting. We did not capture any fish in the 1/2 inch mesh trapnets except for turtles (painted and snapping) during the spring of 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (249,544 fish) were stocked in May of 2013. Tadd & Upper was successfully used as a walleye fingerling rearing pond in 2013. DNR Fisheries Personnel harvested 1,279 pounds (31,975 fish) of walleye fingerlings from Tadd & Upper. Recent planned fish stockings included yellow perch (1,400 fish, 300 pounds), bluegill (700 fish, 100 pounds), walleye (85 fish, 50 pounds) and fathead minnows (43 pounds) during 2014. It was also stocked with small numbers of other gamefish (sauger, walleye, bass, and northern pike) and panfish (bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch) from the Kandiyohi County Fair Display in 2014. It is currently used as a Kid's Fishing Pond in the Spicer Area. A fishing pier is located on the Tadd basin. The city of Atwater aerated Tadd & Upper to prevent winterkill of the remaining walleye during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 winters. <br> \n <br> \nA special assessment was conducted with 1/4 inch mesh trapnets on September 9, 2014 to assess the recent fish stockings and natural reproduction. Moderate numbers of small walleye from the 2013 stocking were present; however growth rates were poor due to a lack of forage. Fathead minnows were stocked in the fall of 2014 to provide an additional forage base for walleye in Tadd & Upper. Yellow perch were present in low numbers, but the sizes ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 inches. Only one young of year \"YOY\" bluegill was captured in the trapnets. No adult bluegill were captured. Unfortunately, small numbers of both black bullhead (adults and YOY) and carp (YOY) were captured in the trapnets. These fish may have resulted from survivors of the previous winterkill event, but more likely of movement into Tadd & Upper from other tile connections during the high water conditions of June-July of 2014. Other fish captured included adult hybrid sunfish and one sauger (fair display fish). Tadd & Upper will be stocked with adult bluegill and yellow perch in 2015 if available. If carp and black bullhead numbers overtake the lake in the future, then an induced winterkill by not operating the aerators may be necessary. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tadd & Upper is a small (39 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum), aerated (bottom bubbler on Tadd, surface Aeromix type on Upper), productive and multi basin lake located in Kandiyohi County. Tadd & Upper is currently managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond in the Spicer Area. A fishing pier is located on the Tadd basin. Presently, various submergent vegetation species, water moss and filamentous algae are abundant within Tadd & Upper. A targeted survey was conducted with standard lake survey trapnets at historical stations during mid-June of 2016 to assess fish abundance in order to make stocking decisions and monitor over winter survival as a Kid's Fishing Pond. Tadd & Upper will be surveyed every five years with standard lake survey nets at the same historical time and stations to allow comparisons to previous surveys. Spring trap netting (1/4\" mesh) may also occur if winterkill is suspected. <br> \n <br> \nThe bottom bubbler aeration system has struggled to maintain winter oxygen levels greater than 2 ppm in the Tadd basin during harsh winters. The aeration system was not run in 2012-13 winter due to the high numbers of Common Carp and Black Bullhead in Tadd & Upper. The 2012-13 winter was uncharacteristically cold, long and high in snowfall accumulation. A significant winterkill occurred during January/February of 2013. Numerous dead fish (Common Carp, Yellow Perch, Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, etc.) were observed in the water and on shore. The water was brown-gray stained with a temperature of 56 F during the netting. We did not capture any fish in the 1/2 inch mesh trapnets except for turtles (Painted and Snapping) during the 2013 spring. Walleye fry (249,544 fish) were stocked in May of 2013. Tadd & Upper was successfully used as a Walleye fingerling rearing pond in 2013. DNR Fisheries Personnel harvested 1,279 pounds (31,975 fish) of Walleye fingerlings from Tadd & Upper. The city of Atwater aerated Tadd & Upper to prevent winterkill of the remaining Walleye during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 winters. Walleye growth appeared stunted for the remaining Walleye present during this time period. Fish stocked during 2014 included Yellow Perch (1,400 fish, 300 pounds), Bluegill (700 fish, 100 pounds), Walleye (85 adult/yearling fish, 50 pounds) and Fathead Minnows (43 pounds). It was also stocked with small numbers of other gamefish (sauger, walleye, bass, and Northern Pike) and panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch) from the Kandiyohi County Fair Display in 2014. Fish stockings in 2015 included adult Bluegill (700 fish, 100 pounds), Yellow Perch (480 fish, 120 pounds) and Walleye (31 fish, 24 pounds). In 2016, adult Bluegill (150 fish, 43 pounds) and Walleye (27 fish, 33 pounds) were stocked in Tadd & Upper. <br> \n <br> \nLow dissolved oxygen levels occurred in both the aerated and non-aerated basins during early January of 2017. Numerous Common Carp and Black Bullhead were observed in the aerator open water area in 2017. A joint decision by the city and DNR to cease aeration operations was made in January to facilitate a kill of undesirable fish in the basins. <br> \nA fish kill did not occur even though oxygen levels were low (<1.0 ppm) during a portion of 2016-17 winter. It appears that adequate fish survival occurred for all species except possibly sunfish during the 2016-17 winter based on ice out test netting in 2017. Presently a different type of aeration system (surface bubblers) is being considered for these basins. The 2016 targeted survey fish catch rates below are generally still valid for Tadd & Upper following the 2016-2017 winter. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers (50.83 fish/trapnet) were moderately abundant in the 2016 trapnets The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was small (0.20 pounds and 6.7 inches). The historical average weight is 0.26 pounds. Abundant numbers of Black Bullhead were also captured in ice out trapnets in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (44.17 fish/trapnet, but the average size was small (0.25 pounds and 9.2 inches). Walleye growth rates were stunted. The 2013 Walleye year class comprised 99% of the 2016 Walleye trapnet catch. Moderate Walleye numbers and similar size were captured in ice out trapnets in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2016 (32.67 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Yellow Perch average size was small to moderate (0.10 pounds and 5.9 inches). Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent. The 2015 Yellow Perch year class comprised 93% of the 2016 Yellow Perch catch. Abundant number of Yellow Perch were captured in ice out trapnets in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (21.33 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.1 inches). Bluegill growth rates were excellent. The 2014 and 2013 comprised 39% and 29% respectively of the 2016 Bluegill catch. Other sunfish species captured during 2016 included low to moderate numbers of Green, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. Low numbers of sunfish were captured in ice out trapnets in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were not captured in Tadd & Upper survey trapnets during 2016. Unfortunately, small numbers of both Black Bullhead (adults and YOY) and Common Carp (YOY) were captured in a 2014 special fall trapnet (1/4 inch mesh) assessment. These fish may have resulted from survivors of the previous winterkill event, but more likely due to movement into Tadd & Upper via tiles connecting to other water bodies during the high water conditions of June-July of 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tadd & Upper include managing it as a Kid's Fishing Pond, periodic winter oxygen testing, proposing and budgeting for aeration equipment changes, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Ice out trapnet assessments will be conducted if winterkill is suspected. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. If Common Carp and Black Bullhead numbers overtake the lake in the future, then an induced winterkill by not operating the aerators may be again necessary. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Tadd & Upper Lake was conducted during mid June of 2011. Tadd & Upper Lake consists of two small (24 acres) connected basins, which is considered one lake for management purposes. Tadd & Upper Lake is a shallow (8 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The aeration system consists of two subsurface bubblers with one bubbler located in each basin. In recent years, only the Upper basin aerator has been used. The bubbler aerations systems generally have not been successful in maintaining oxygen above 2.00 ppm during harsh winters. Nutrient runoff flows into the basins from city, residential, agricultural, and golf course sources during rain events. High levels of total phosphorus (0.230 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (132 ppb) were measured in June of 2006. The basins were chemically reclaimed with rotenone in 1989 to remove carp and bullheads. A partial summerkill of bluegill and walleye (low numbers) occurred due to a disease outbreak of columnaris in May of 1995. Recent partial winterkills (bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and walleye) have occurred during the January-February of 2004 and 2010 winters. Black bullhead and black crappie were the two most abundant species present after the winterkill in the 2004 ice-out netting. Carp were recently documented in the basin during 2006 and 2011. Carp were either stocked illegally or entered the lake via marginal tile/storm sewer connections to ditches during high water. <br> \n <br> \nShoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, silt, and muck. Aquatic vegetation (various pondweeds, coontail, water moss, cattails, reed canary grass, duckweeds) densities were abundant in past years; however densities were light to moderate during 2006, but generally absent in 2011. Water clarity was poor (secchi disc=0.8 - 1.2 feet) during the 2006 resurvey and 2011 assessment. The over abundance of carp and black bullhead in the basins have been detrimental to water clarity and submergent vegetation densities. Tadd & Upper Lake was recently stocked with bluegill in the 2001 spring (1,168 fish), 2004 (889 adults), 2006 (1,238 adults) and 2009 (588 adults); walleye in 2002 (130 yearlings), 2004 (960 yearlings) and 2010 (462 fingerlings); northern pike in 2004 (48 adults); largemouth bass in the 2006 spring (180 adults). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in 2011 (7.00 fish/trapnet) was within the normal ranges for Tadd & Upper and similar lakes. Black crappie numbers were more abundant in previous 2002 (48.89 fish/trapnet) and 2006 (64.43 fish/trapnet) surveys. The 2011 black crappie average size was large (0.90 pounds and 11.28 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical weight is 0.40 pounds from trapnets. The 2011 catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (6.50 fish/trapnet). Black crappie growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and above the normal ranges for ages 5-6. The 2005 (55%) and 2006 (28%) black crappie year classes dominated the 2011 black crappie catch in Tadd & Upper. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not present in the 2011 trapnets. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 16.31 fish/trapnet for Tadd & Upper. The previous survey catch rate was 10.14 fish/trapnet in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were absent in 2011 trapnets. Largemouth bass were also absent in a previous 2006 spring electrofishing survey (0.00 fish/hour). Other spring electrofishing survey results included high catch rates in 2002 (187.20 fish/hour, 0.55 pounds average size) and 1996 (311.35 fish/hour). The Spicer Area largemouth bass average catch rate is 46.09 fish/hour (1.25 pounds average weight) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth bass were captured in the 2006 trapnets (1.43 fish/trapnet). The 2006 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.01 pounds and 11.76 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were absent in 2011 trapnets. Walleye abundance in 2006 (2.00 fish/gillnet) was low. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.74 pounds and 16.83 inches) from gillnets. Walleye natural reproduction in Tadd & Upper is generally absent or rare based on previous summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in 2011 (2.50 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 2.15 fish/trapnet for Tadd & Upper. The previous 2006 yellow perch trapnet catch rate was 3.57 fish/trapnet. The 2011 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.20 pounds and 7.42 inches) from trapnets. Yellow perch growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2009 year class comprised 80% of the yellow perch captured in the 2011 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2011 (1.00 fish/trapnet) was near the Tadd & Upper historical average (0.82 fish/trapnet). Northern pike abundance in 2006 (4.00 fish/gillnet) was above the median catch rate (3.00 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. Northern pike were caught in large numbers in only one other survey (1987 survey, 15.00 fish/gillnet). The 2011 northern pike average size was moderate (3.13 pounds and 21.98 inches) from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. There were no dominant northern pike year classes present in the 2011 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance in 2011 (109.00 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (25th=2.50, 50th=8.30, 75th=70.20 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes. The black bullhead numbers were also abundant in the previous 2006 resurvey. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 95.20 fish/trapnet for Tadd & Upper. The 2011 black bullhead average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.84 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average length is 7.27 inches from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp abundance in 2011 (45.25 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (25th=0.43, 50th=1.38, 75th=2.90 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 7.95 fish/trapnet for Tadd & Upper. Carp were only documented in Tadd & Upper during 1987 (0.33 fish/trapnet) prior to the 1989 reclamation and recently in 2006 (2.14 fish/trapnet). The 2011 carp average size was small (1.07 pounds and 11.56 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tadd & Upper include monitoring the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking various fish species as needed. The Tadd & Upper fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tadd & Upper was conducted during early-June of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nTadd & Upper is a small (39 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum), aerated (surface bubbler \"Ice Eater\" on both Tadd and Upper basins), productive and multi basin lake located in Kandiyohi County. Tadd & Upper was chemically reclaimed with rotenone in 1989 fall. Tadd & Upper was stocked with gamefish and panfish the following years and aeration systems were operated. A partial summerkill of Bluegill and Walleye occurred during the 1995 summer. Partial winterkills also have periodically occurred even with the operation of the aeration systems. Tadd & Upper may rarely connect to other upstream ditches and shallow lakes during high water events via tiles and storm sewer connections. Water levels were low in 2020 and 2021. Submergent vegetation densities can vary from sparce to dense depending upon winterkill and fish species composition. Curly-leaf pondweed densities were high in Tadd & Upper basins during 2021. Aquatic vegetation species such as water moss and filamentous algae were abundant within Tadd & Upper during 2016. A previous targeted survey was conducted with lake survey trapnets during mid-June of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nTadd & Upper is currently managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond in the Spicer Area. A fishing pier is located on the Tadd basin. Fish stocked during 2014 included Yellow Perch (1,400 fish, 300 pounds), Bluegill (700 fish, 100 pounds), Walleye (85 adult/yearling fish, 50 pounds) and Fathead Minnows (43 pounds). It was also stocked with small numbers of other gamefish (sauger, walleye, bass, and Northern Pike) and panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch) from the Kandiyohi County Fair Display in 2014. Fish stockings in 2015 included adult Bluegill (700 fish, 100 pounds), Yellow Perch (480 fish, 120 pounds) and Walleye (31 fish, 24 pounds). In 2016, adult Bluegill (150 fish, 43 pounds) and Walleye (27 fish, 33 pounds) were stocked in Tadd & Upper. Yellow Perch adults were stocked in 2018 (360 fish, 90 pounds). Walleye yearlings (117 fish, 39 pounds) and adults (324 fish, 261 pounds) were stocked in 2019. In addition, various display fish species from educational events and the county fair have been stocked into Tadd & Upper basins on occasion during recent years.  <br> \n  <br> \nA bottom bubbler was the primary aerator type for Tadd & Upper basins from the early 1990's through the 2017-18 winter. The Upper basin typically maintained higher winter dissolved oxygen levels than the Tadd basin. The bottom bubbler aeration system has struggled to maintain winter oxygen levels greater than 2 ppm especially in the Tadd basin during harsh winters. The aeration system was not run in 2012-13 winter due to the high numbers of Common Carp and Black Bullhead in Tadd & Upper. The 2012-13 winter was uncharacteristically cold, long and high in snowfall accumulation. A significant winterkill occurred during January/February of 2013. Numerous dead fish (Common Carp, Yellow Perch, Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, etc.) were observed in the water and on shore. The water was brown/gray stained with a temperature of 56 F during the netting. We did not capture any fish in the 1/2-inch mesh trapnets except for turtles (Painted and Snapping) during the 2013 spring. Walleye fry (249,544 fish) were stocked in May of 2013. Tadd & Upper was successfully used as a Walleye fingerling rearing pond in 2013. DNR Fisheries Personnel harvested 1,279 pounds (31,975 fish) of Walleye fingerlings from Tadd & Upper. The city of Atwater aerated Tadd & Upper to prevent winterkill of the remaining Walleye during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 winters. <br> \n <br> \nLow dissolved oxygen levels occurred in both the aerated and non-aerated basins during early January of 2017. Numerous Common Carp and Black Bullhead were observed in the aerator open water area in 2017. A joint decision by the city and DNR to cease aeration operations was made in January to facilitate a kill of undesirable fish in the basins. <br> \nUnfortunately, abundant numbers of Black Bullhead survived the 2016-17 winter in Tadd & Upper basins.  <br> \n <br> \nReverse aeration was attempted during late February on both basins during the 2018-19 winter to facilitate the winterkill of less desirable fish species (Common Carp and Black Bullhead). The bubbler aeration systems were not turned on for 2018-19 winter. Oxygen levels were initially high during mid-December of 2018 (9.0-12.7 ppm), low during mid-January of 2019 (0.5-0.75 ppm) and early February of 2019 (0.5-2.4 ppm), and near zero (0.32 ppm) during mid-February of 2019. Aeromix aerators were started and pointed into the mud to mix non oxygenated water throughout the water column and facilitate winterkill on February 19, 2019 and continued until ice out in mid-March. Reverse aeration was only partly successful. Ice out trapnetting yielded abundant numbers of Fathead Minnows and small sized Black Bullhead, low numbers of small sized Yellow Perch and adult Black Bullhead. We observed dead Common Carp along the shorelines in the 2019 spring.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Tadd basin aeration system was changed to an Ice Eater surface bubbler in 2020-21 winter to the present. The bottom bubbler aerator was used on Upper basin during the 2020-21 winter. The Upper basin system was changed to an Ice Eater surface bubbler in 2021-2022 winter. Winter oxygen levels were adequate on Tadd (3.0-4.0 ppm) and excellent on Upper (11.0-13.0 ppm) basins during the 2020-21 winter. Aeromix surface aerators had also been used during past years on Upper basin with the bottom bubbler aerators were under repair. The Ice eater systems are currently run year-round to provide better oxygen and less stagnant conditions throughout the summer months. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers (21.00 fish/trapnet) were moderate in the 2021 trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 80.38 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.29 pounds and 7.65 inches). The historical average weight is 0.27 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not captured in the 2021 trapnets. Walleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (44.17 fish/trapnet, but the average size was small (0.25 pounds and 9.20 inches). Walleye growth rates were stunted even though adequate numbers of small sized forage species such as Yellow Perch and sunfish were present in Tadd & Upper.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low (3.75 fish/trapnet) in 2021. Yellow Perch were abundant in 2016 (32.67 fish/trapnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 6.17 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Yellow Perch average size was large (0.33 pounds and 8.36 inches). The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.24 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant both in 2021 (21.50 fish/trapnet) and 2016 (21.33 fish/trapnet). The 2021 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.01 inches). The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.27 pounds. Bluegill growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6 and above the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2018 year class comprised 85% of the 2021 Bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and Green Sunfish were also moderately abundant (21.00 fish/trapnet and 7.75 fish/trapnet respectively) in the 2021 trapnets. Hybrid Sunfish numbers were low (2.75 fish/trapnet) in 2021. Sunfish species captured during 2016 included low to moderate numbers of Green, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were not captured in Tadd & Upper survey trapnets during 2021 or 2016. Low numbers of both Black Bullhead (adults and YOY) and Common Carp (YOY) were captured in a 2014 special fall trapnet (1/4-inch mesh) assessment. These fish may have resulted from survivors of the previous winterkill event, but more likely due to movement into Tadd & Upper via storm water sewer tiles connecting to other water bodies during the high-water conditions of June-July of 2014. Numerous dead Common Carp were observed following a 2019 partial winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tadd & Upper include managing it as a Kid's Fishing Pond, periodic winter oxygen testing, proposing and budgeting for aeration equipment changes, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Ice out trapnet assessments will be conducted if winterkill is suspected. All fish species will be sampled in 2026. If Common Carp and Black Bullhead numbers overtake the lake in the future, an induced winterkill by not operating the aerators may be again necessary. <br> \n</p>",

BLG GROWTH RATES WILL PROBABLY STABILIZE AND MAY DECLINE IN THE FUTURE IF THE HIGH SUBMERGENT VEGETATION DENSITIES PERSIST IN TADD AND UPPER.  STUNTING OF BLG MAY OCCUR BECAUSE THE HIGH DENSITES OF SUBMERGENT VEGETATION WILL PROTECT YOUNG BLG THUS REDUCING PREDATION BY LMB AND ENSUING INCREASED INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR FOOD.  IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN BALANCED BLG AND LMB POPULATIONS FOR THE FUTURE, ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING MEASURES MAY HAVE TO BE TAKEN: MAINTAIN SUBMERGENT VEGETATION DENSITIES AT MODERATE LEVELS, STOCK OTHER PREDATORS SUCH AS FCF, OR ALLOW THE LAKES TO WINTERKILL EVERY 5 TO 7 YEARS TO PROMOTE GROWTH. BLB, BLC, AND NOP WERE THE PRIMARY FISH SPECIES IN TADD AND UPPER PRIOR TO THE RECLAMATION IN THE FALL OF 1989.  THE WATER QUALITY IMPROVED AND THE SUBMERGENT VEGETATION DENSITY INCREASED AFTER THE RECLAMATION.  BLG, LMB, FCF, AND WAE STOCKED IN THE SPRING OF 1990.  THE 1992 BLG GILLNET CATCH INDEX (9.50 PER GN, 2.11 LBS PER GN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 42 INDEX.  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (25.00 PER TN, 9.86 LBS PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 42 INDEX.  THE 1992 BLG PSD (95) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION AND THE RSD-P WAS 2.  GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES OF BLG.  THE 1990 BLG YEAR CLASS IS STRONG.  THE BLG MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.22 LBS FROM GILLNETS AND 0.39 LBS FROM TRAPNETS. THE LMB SPRING ELECTROFISHING CATCH INDEX (161.00 PER HOUR, 82.21 LBS PER HOUR) APPEARS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO LOCAL AREA LAKES. THE 1992 LMB LAKE SURVEY CATCH INDEX (17.00 PER GN, 8.60 LBS PER GN; 14.44 PER TN, 7.14 LBS PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 42 INDEX.  THE LMB SPRING ELECTROFISHING PSD (1) WAS BELOW THE RECOMMENDED RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF LMB CAPTURED WAS 0.50 LBS FOR ALL GEARS.  ALL FISH CAPTURED WERE FROM THE 1990 YEAR CLASS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO BROOD STOCK FISH CAUGHT ELECTROFISHING.  THE MAJORITY OF THE 1990 YEAR CLASS RANGED IN SIZE FROM 8-11 INCHES.  THE 1992 WAE GILLNET CATCH INDEX (15.50 PER GN, 8.80 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 42 INDEX.  THE WAE TRAP NET INDEX (5.56 PER TN, 3.01 LBS PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 42 INDEX.  THE 1992 WAE PSD (5) WAS BELOW THE RANGE (30-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  FOUR WAE CAPTURED WERE AGE V+ AND WERE PROBABLY STOCKED ILLEGALLY.  THE MAJORITY OF WAE CAUGHT WERE FROM THE 1990 YEAR CLASS RANGING IN SIZE FROM 9-13 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF WAE CAUGHT WAS 0.57 LBS FROM GILLNETS AND 0.54 LBS FROM TRAPNETS. GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE OF AGES 1-2.  FCF YEARLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1990, BUT NONE WERE CAUGHT IN THE 1992 SURVEY.  OTHER SPECIES SUCH AS BLB, BLC, NOP, CARP, AND WTS WERE ABUNDANT PRIOR TO THE RECLAMATION, HOWEVER, THESE SPECIES WERE NOT CAUGHT IN THE 1992 SURVEY.  GROWTH RATES FOR BLG AND LMB WERE ABOVE AVERAGE AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING THE RECLAMATION OF TADD AND UPPER BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANT FORAGE (INVERTEBRATES), DECREASED COMPETITION, IMPROVED</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Tadd & Upper Lake was conducted during June of 2002. Tadd & Upper are two small (24 acres) connected basins considered one lake for management purposes. Tadd & Upper Lake is shallow (8 feet maximum depth), aerated, productive, and located in Kandiyohi County. Tadd & Upper Lake was chemically reclaimed with rotenone during the 1989 fall in order to reduce bullhead numbers. Various fish species (bluegill, largemouth bass, flathead catfish, walleye) were stocked into the lake following the reclamation. Other fish species (yellow perch, black crappie, black bullhead) may have entered the lake via inlets or stocking by local residents. The present aeration system consists of two subsurface bubblers with one bubbler located in each basin. Nutrient runoff inflows are from the city, residential, agricultural, and golf course sources during rain events. A partial summerkill of bluegill and walleye (low numbers) occurred due to a disease outbreak of columnaris in May of 1995. Aquatic vegetation (pondweeds, cattails, reed canary grass, duckweeds) densities were abundant within the lake and along the edges. Water clarity was poor (secchi disc=1.5 feet) during the 2002 population assessment. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2002 (25.0 fish/gillnet) and the highest recorded value for Tadd & Upper. The 2002 black crappie average size was moderate (0.39 lbs. and 8.8 inches) from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger black crappie was high (24.0 fish/gillnet) in 2002. The largest black crappie captured was 10.4 inches in the 2002 assessment. Black crappie growth rates were generally below the normal range in Tadd & Upper compared to area lakes. Approximately 69% of the black crappie captured in the 2002 assessment were hatched in 2001.Bluegill numbers were moderate (15.9 fish/trapnet) in 2002 for Tadd & Upper. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 17.9 fish/trapnet. The 2002 bluegill average size was moderate (0.30 lbs. and 6.2 inches) from trapnets. The catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches) and larger bluegill was high (6.2 fish/trapnet) in 2002. The largest bluegill captured was 9.0 inches in the 2002 assessment. Bluegill growth rates in Tadd & Upper were above the normal range compared to area lakes. Tadd & Upper Lake was stocked with bluegill (1,161 fish) in the 2001 spring.Largemouth bass numbers were abundant (187.2 fish/hour) in 2002, but below the previous 1996 spring electrofishing survey (311.4 fish/hour) for Tadd & Upper. The Spicer Area spring electrofishing historical average catch rate is 47.8 fish/hour for largemouth bass. The 2002 largemouth bass average size was small (0.55 lbs. and 8.4 inches) from spring electrofishing. The catch rate of quality size (12.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass was high (44.4 fish/hour) in the 2002 spring electrofishing survey. The largest largemouth bass captured was 18.9 inches in the 2002 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates were below the normal range in Tadd & Upper compared to area lakes. Approximately 59% of the largemouth bass captured in the 2002 spring electrofishing survey were hatched in 2000.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2002 (5.0 fish/gillnet), but slightly below the historical average catch rate (7.0 fish/gillnet). The 2002 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.42 lbs. and 19.2 inches) from the gillnets. Walleye growth rates were below the normal range in Tadd & Upper compared to area lakes. Approximately 71% of the walleye captured in the 2002 population assessment were hatched in 1990. These fish were from an initial 1990 walleye fry stocking into Tadd & Upper. The catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches) and larger walleye was moderate to high (4.0 fish/gillnet) in 2002. The largest walleye captured was 22.2 inches in the 2002 population assessment. Walleye natural reproduction in Tadd & Upper is generally absent or rare based on previous summer surveys. Walleye yearlings (130 fish) were stocked in Tadd & Upper during the 2002 fall.Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2002 (44.0 fish/gillnet) was the highest historical recorded value for Tadd & Upper. The historical average catch rate for yellow perch is 20.5 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch size was moderate to large (0.36 lbs. and 8.9 inches) from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger yellow perch was high (36.0 fish/gillnet) in 2002. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.7 inches in the 2002 assessment. Yellow perch growth rates were within or above the normal range in Tadd & Upper compared to area lakes. About 93% of the yellow perch captured in the 2002 population assessment were hatched in 1998. Black bullhead numbers were moderate to abundant in 2002 (29.0 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historical average catch rate (31.0 fish/gillnet) for Tadd & Upper. The 2002 black bullhead average length was moderate (7.5 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. The largest black bullhead captured was 13.0 inches in the 2002 population assessment.Current fish management activities on Tadd & Upper include monitoring the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking various fish species as needed. The Tadd & Upper fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tadd & Upper Lakes (24 acres total) were once separate basins, but are now joined by ainlet channel. These two basins are now considered one lake for management purposes. Tadd &Upper basins are located within the city of Atwater. The maximum depth is 8 feet. Tadd &Upper basins have been aerated since 1979. The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1989.Presently, there are two aeration units (diffusers) within Tadd and two units within Upper.Gamefish have survived within Tadd & Upper even though winter dissolved oxygen readings arefrequently below 1.0 ppm during the late winter at the aeration sites. Submergent vegetationis dense within both basins. The most frequently occurring submergents include water moss,coontail, sago pondweed, flatstem pondweed. Emergent vegetation is generally restricted tothe Upper basin. The most frequently occurring emergents include hardstem bulrush, commoncattail, and arrowhead. Most of the emergents are found within Upper. The most frequentlyoccurring shoalwater substrates include detritus, muck, and silt. Nutrient inputs are fromthe city of Atwater (storm sewers, lawn fertilizer runoff, etc.), agricultural runoff via aninlet, and a recently (1994) constructed golf course adjacent to the northwest shore ofUpper. The outlet is located in the northeast corner of Tadd. There is field drainage inletthat enters the southwest portion of Upper. A city park is located between Tadd and Upperbasins. There is no designated boat access on either basin, however it may be possible tolaunch a boat off the south shore gravel road of the Upper basin. Tadd & Upper basins arepopular shore fishing spots for bluegill, yellow perch, and largemouth bass by seniorcitizens and children. A fishing pier is proposed to be installed into Upper during the nextfew years to increase shore fishing opportunities for anglers. Presently, Tadd & Upper ismanaged for bluegill and largemouth bass as the primary species with yellow perch, northernpike, and walleye as secondary species.     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted on 5/21/96 for largemouth bass in Tadd &Upper. The 1996 spring electrofishing catch rate (311.4 largemouth bass/hour) was the highestrecorded value for all area lakes. The spring electrofishing area median catch rate is 25.9fish/hour. Largemouth bass were also abundant within the summer trapnets (5.7 fish/trapnet),however the average size was small (7.5 inches). The 1996 average size from electrofishingwas also small (0.2 lbs or 7.0 inches). The 1996 spring PSD and RSD-P was 11.5 and 7.7respectively. About 86% of largemouth bass captured electrofishing were between 4 - 8 incheslong. About 85% of the largemouth captured electrofishing belonged to the 1994 year class.Growth rate appeared below average for ages II-V.     Bluegill abundance in the 1996 summer survey (29.5 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (2.8 - 43.3 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 40, but above thehistorical average (18.5 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (0.1 lbs from trapnets, 4.9inches) was below previous surveys (0.4 lbs in 1992, 0.6 lbs in 1987). The largest bluegillcaptured from the 1996 summer survey was 8.0 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 2.2 and 0respectively. Growth rates appear average. The majority of the bluegill captured belonged tothe 1994 (50%) and 1993 (47%) year classes. There was a kill (due to columnaris) of fish onMay 25, 1995. About 100 adult bluegill (5-8 inches) and 2 adult walleye (1 lb.) were observedalong a 125 foot section of shoreline on the east side of Tadd in May of 1995, in additionto many stressed bluegill swimming within the shallows. On Upper, we observed only 5 deadbluegill in a 125 foot section of shoreline in May of 1995. Largemouth bass fingerlingsappeared unaffected and swimming in the shallows adjacent to the dying bluegills in 1995.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (37.5 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.5 - 25.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 40, and above previous surveys(0.5 fish/gillnet in 1992, 0.0 fish/gillnet in 1987). Yellow perch was initially stockedafter reclamation in 1989, but there is no record of the numbers or rate of fish stocked. The1996 average size was excellent (8.0 inches from gillnets). The largest yellow perch capturedwas 10.3 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 45.3 and 1.3 respectively. Growth rates appeargood compared to other area lakes. About 62% of the fish captured belonged to the 1993 yearclass.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.5 - 70.2 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 40 and below the 1987 survey(248.0 fish/trapnet) which was prior to chemical reclamation. The 1996 average size was 9.4inches from the trapnets.     Winter dissolved oxygen readings were below 1.0 ppm by mid February of 1997. Aboveaverage snowfall and longer duration of winter conditions occurred during the 1996-97 winterwhich resulted in partial winterkill of several shallow lakes within the area. However, itappears that gamefish survived the 1996-97 winter within Tadd & Upper Lakes. Tadd & Upperwill be restocked with adult bluegill, winter rescue northern pike, largemouth bass, andyellow perch if a severe winterkill occurs in the future. Walleye fingerlings will be stockedonly if the black bullhead population substantially increases in the future. Managementoptions include upgrading the aeration system to more efficient and effective type (Aire-O2unit), and working with area landowners and the city to reduce nutrient inputs into Tadd &Upper through the implementation of best management practices within the watershed. Bestmanagement practices include: planting buffer strips around the lake to reduce lawnfertilizer runoff from residential homes, city park, and the golf course; encouragingconservation tillage of farm fields which drain into the nearby inlet that enters the Upperbasin; encourage local residents to reduce to fertilizer usage (residential property, citypark, golf course property) on lawns adjacent to the lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Tadd & Upper Lake was conducted during early July of 2006. Tadd & Upper Lake consists of two small (24 acres) connected basins, which is considered one lake for management purposes. Tadd & Upper Lake is shallow (8 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The present aeration system consists of two subsurface bubblers with one bubbler located in each basin. Nutrient runoff flows from the city, residential, agricultural, and golf course sources during rain events. High levels of total phosphorus (0.230 ppm) and chlorophyll-a (132 ppb) were measured in 2006. A partial summerkill of bluegill and walleye (low numbers) occurred due to a disease outbreak of columnaris in May of 1995. A partial winterkill (bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and walleye) occurred during the 2003-2004 winter. Black bullhead and black crappie were two most abundant species present after the winterkill in the 2004 ice-out netting. Shoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, silt, and muck. Aquatic vegetation (various pondweeds, cattails, reed canary grass, duckweeds) densities were abundant in past years, however densities were light to moderate during 2006. Water clarity was poor (secchi disc=0.8  1.0 feet) during the 2006 resurvey. Tadd & Upper Lake was recently stocked with bluegill in the 2001 spring (1,168 fish), 2004 (889 adults), 2006 (1,238 adults). Walleye yearlings in 2002 (130 yearlings), 2004 (960 yearlings); northern pike in 2004 (48 adults); largemouth bass in the 2006 spring (180 adults). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2006 (221.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 black crappie average size was small (0.19 pounds and 7.14 inches from gillnets). The black crappie historical weight is 0.19 pounds from gillnets. The 2006 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (76.00 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2 and between the normal ranges for ages 3-5. Dominant black crappie year classes included 2005, 2004, and 2001 in the 2006 resurvey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2006 (10.14 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 16.31 fish/trapnet. The 2006 bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.95 inches from trapnets). The bluegill historical average length is 6.09 inches from trapnets. The 2006 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (4.57 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates in Tadd & Upper were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were absent in 2006 spring electrofishing survey (0.00 fish/hour). Previous spring electrofishing survey results included high catch rates in 2002 (187.20 fish/hour, 0.55 pounds average size) and 1996 (311.35 fish/hour). The Spicer Area largemouth bass average catch rate is 46.60 fish/hour (1.23 pounds average size) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth bass were captured in the 2006 trapnets (1.43 fish/trapnet). The 2006 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.01 pounds and 11.76 inches from trapnets). Largemouth bass growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2003 year class comprised the majority of largemouth bass captured in the 2006 resurvey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2006 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 6.00 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.74 pounds and 16.83 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates were generally between the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. All of the walleye captured in the 2006 resurvey were from the 2003 year class. Walleye natural reproduction in Tadd & Upper is generally absent or rare based on previous summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2006 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 16.80 fish/gillnet. The 2006 yellow perch trapnet catch rate was moderate to high (3.57 fish/trapnet). The 2006 yellow perch average size was moderate to small (0.17 pounds and 6.80 inches from trapnets). Yellow perch growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2005 year class comprised the majority of the yellow perch captured in the 2006 resurvey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2006 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. Northern pike were caught in large numbers in only one other survey (1987 survey, 15.00 fish/gillnet). The 2006 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.63 pounds 21.90 inches from gillnets). The 2005 year class (natural reproduction) comprised the majority of northern pike captured in the 2006 resurvey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2006 (145.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 53.80 fish/gillnet. The 2006 black bullhead average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.23 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average length is 8.94 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2006 (2.14 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 0.50 fish/trapnet. The 2006 carp average size was moderate to large (4.99 pounds and 20.36 inches from trapnets). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Tadd & Upper include monitoring the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking various fish species to maintain an urban type fishery as needed. The Tadd & Upper fishery will be surveyed in the 2011 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",
