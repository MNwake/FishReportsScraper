Yellow perch population is slightly below local median. Bowfin is major predator as no northern pike were found in survey. Survey notes that good spawning areas are available for northern pike if they were present. There is good spawning habitat for panfish. Growth rates for panfish are good. Aging data shows that there is a good distribution of age classes for panfish, although older ages were not taken in the survey.</p>",
