                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pelican Lake is a 345-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately six miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Little Pelican Lake is part of the Pelican River watershed.  The Pelican River inlet is located along the northeast shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The Pelican River outlet is navigable to Pelican Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 25 feet; however, 74% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Little Pelican Lake is developed with homes and cabins.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.   The east end of the lake is composed of a large marshland area with an abundance of emergent vegetation.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice, cattail, and hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch and length data indicate that a moderately abundant Black Crappie population with a high quality size structure exists in Little Pelican Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 7.6 to 14.4 inches with an average length of 11.4 inches.  Seventy-nine percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length and 39% were 12.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappie growth rates are fast with an average length of 10.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Little Pelican Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2009.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pelican Lake is a 345 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County, approximately ten miles northeast of the city of Pelican Rapids.  It has a maximum depth of 25 feet and 74% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Secchi disk readings, a measure of water clarity, have been taken during fish assessments since 1967.  The reading in 1999 was 11.0 feet.  Past readings have ranged from 3.0 to 9.2 feet.  Access is gained through a navigable channel from Big Pelican Lake.       Development is located on the north and south shorelines.  The east end of the lake contains marshy areas.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, wild rice) is located in areas throughout the basin.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and break down pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Little Pelican Lake contains good populations of  bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike and black crappie.  The bluegill size structure is good with 42% of the bluegill sampled in 1999 over 7.0 inches in length.  Largemouth bass and black crappie are likely present in good numbers.  Spring assessments in the future will provide better information on these species. Spawning habitat exists throughout the basin for these species to thrive on their own.  Walleye are not stocked in Little Pelican Lake.  The walleye population is likely maintained by immigrants entering from Big Pelican Lake.  The population is currently good and well balanced with fish ranging in length from 10.0 to 24.5 inches.  </p>",

Average weight of northern pike increased from 1.1 lbs. in 1981 to 1.7 lbs.  Pike ages ranged from II+ through VI+.  <br> \n     Abundance of all three species of bullheads remains above their respective area medians. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 17.4 per trap net lift in 1981 to 46.8 per net, similar to 50.5 per net in 1967.  The increase in abundance does not appear to have significantly changed the size structure as 37% of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Black crappie reproduction appears to be good as eleven were sampled representing five different age-classes.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance decreased from 13.3 per gill net lift in 1981 to 2.0 per net, similar to 1.5 per net in 1967.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 2.0 per gill net lift in 1981 to 5.3 per net, similar to 6.0 per net in 1967. Average weight of walleye decreased from 3.2 lbs. in 1981 to 1.2 lbs.  Twenty-four of the walleyes sampled correlated to the 1985 year class, a year in which Big Pelican Lake was not stocked. <br> \n</p>",
