                "narrative": "<p>Lake Moses has an excellent Walleye population. There were 10 Walleye/gillnet with a mean weight of 1.68 lbs. The two strongest year-classes of Walleye are the 1982 and 1984. These correspond with fingerling stockings. The 1981 and 1985 year-classes were fry stockings. They also appear to be relatively strong but are on the edges of net-ability. There appears to be very limited natural reproduction. Over 12 Northern Pike/gillnet were sampled. Growth rates on Northern Pike appear to be slow. Growth rates seem to improve for Northern Pike once they reach a certain size. There may be bottleneck in forage system. Northern Pike may have limited natural reproduction suggested by the lack of 3 and 4 year old fish. Mean size of the Northern Pike is small (1.38 lb.). Bluegill are very abundant (59.7/trapnet) and are small (x = 0.15 lb.). Age and growth information indices Bluegill are stunted. Lake Moses has an excellent Largemouth Bass population. Results from electrofishing indicate high numbers of 12 rates for bass are good. Although very few Black Crappie were sampled spring-time fishing reports indicated a good population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moses Lake is an 822-acre mesoeutrophic lake located in northwest Douglas County east of Millerville.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Total phosphorus and secchi disk transparency measurements are typical for lakes that are minimally impacted by point and non-point sources of pollution.  Moses Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 21 feet.  Emergent vegetation such as bulrush and cattail is common in undeveloped shoreline areas.  These aquatic plants provide essential fish habitat and keep lakes clean and healthy by filtering out incoming sediment and nutrients.  Unrestricted residential development of shoreline areas can destroy this important part of the lake ecosystem. Moses Lake is likely to see heavy residential development in the near future.  DNR staff and Douglas County Land and Resource Management have been working with potential developers early in the platting process to ensure that aquatic habitat is protected and the integrity of the lake is maintained.Moses Lake is a quality all-around fishing lake and a good place to take the entire family fishing.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are all abundant and should provide steady action.  Average size of the fish should appeal to most anglers.  Many of the largemouth bass are 15 inches in length or greater and most of the bluegill are over 6 inches.  Large beds of bulrush and cattail are present along the western half of the lake and provide an ideal place to fish, even on windy days.  Moses Lake can also provide quality walleye angling opportunities.  Gill net catch of 4.6 fish/net is within the normal range for lakes of similar size, depth, and fertility.  Fry and fingerling stocking have both been effective in supplementing the walleye population.  Natural reproduction also produced a relatively strong year class in 1993, one of the few years when stocking did not occur.  The Millerville Sportsmens Club has placed rock spawning reefs in Moses Lake and in the channel between lakes Aaron and Moses to enhance walleye spawning.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet indices declined from 10.00 Walleye/gillnet in 1987 to 2.7 Walleye/gillnet. This drop may correspond to a change in survey chronology from July, 1987 to June, 1990.  The 1987 year class (age 3 fish) was the result of natural reproduction.  The 1988 year class (age 2 fish) was established by the 1988 fry stocking or natural reproduction.  Cohorts of 1984, 1986, and 1989 fingerling stockings were not well represented in the capture sample. Walleye growth rates are good with age 3 fish averaging 14.0 inches. Despite low water and associated loss of spawning habitat, Northern Pike continue to be prolific.  The catch of 11.0 Northern Pike/gillnet is similar to previous surveys.  Growth rates seem to be slow (age 2 Northern Pike average 14.8 inches) even though Yellow Perch are abundant growth rates appear to increase once Northern Pike reach 22.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight of captured Northern Pike was 1.8lbs. The largest sampled was over 36.0 inches long. Yellow Perch abundance remained high (28.8 Yellow Perch/gillnet).  PSD of the Yellow Perch was 10%.  Only 5 of the 173 Yellow Perch measured exceeded quality-size (8.0 inches, and larger). Bluegill CPUE declined from 57.4 Bluegill/trapnet in 1983 and 59.7 Bluegill/trapnet in 1987 to 24.0 fish/trapnet in 1990.  In an apparent correlated response, PSD increased from 60.0% in 1983 and 53.0% in 1987 to 92.0%.  Mean weight of Bluegill was 0.29 lbs. Capture efficiency of crappie typically poor or inconsistent.  The small sample size in the 1990 survey was comprised of large individuals.  PSD was calculated at 96.8%. Due to workload constraints, an electro- fishing survey was not conducted in 1990. Electrofishing efforts in 1987 indicated an excellent Largemouth Bass population. Lake Moses has a sizeable population of Rock Bass (7.17 Rock Bass/gillnet).  PSD was calculated at 86.0%.  This population offers good opportunities to catch a memorable-size (11.0 inches or larger).  Sixteen percent of rock bass captured were 11.0 inches in total length.  This population should greatly contribute to sportfishing opportunities. Bullhead and other rough fish species were present in the survey, but low catch rates would indicate these populations are not significantly displacing sportfishes.  The Yellow Bullhead population may have angling value.  The Yellow Bullhead netted averaged 1.05lbs each.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Moses is an 822-acre lake located approximately one mile west of Millerville in northwest Douglas County.  The basin has a simple, round shape with sandy shores, abundant emergent vegetation and a well defined weedline near the 23-foot contour.  Water quality is excellent with clarity in excess of 15 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Lake Moses supports diverse fishing opportunities and comparatively high catch rates of northern pike, largemouth bass, rockbass, and bluegill.  Less abundant gamefishes include walleye, black crappie, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, largemouth bass, and rockbass population are currently abundant.  The lake is top heavy with predators.  With inadequate prey, these predator species grow too slow to optimize size distribution and fishing quality.  There is real need to harvest surplus small- and medium-size pike and bass to improve predator/prey balance and increase contributions of walleye stocking.  Black crappie numbers fluctuate among years due to natural reproduction and recruitment irregularity, but fishing quality in terms of average size caught, remains good.  Thirty-eight percent of crappie captured in trapnets during the 2010 survey exceeded 10.0 inches in length.   Bluegill fishing is currently very good.  The population is largely comprised of old fish ranging from seven to 13-years old.  Average size captured in trapnets was 7.3 inches.  Fourteen percent of bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nIn contrast to bluegill and crappie populations, most northern pike are young fish.  The largest pike captured measured 34.7 inches, but average length of the population sample was only 16.9-inches.  The largemouth bass population is largely comprised of four- and five-year-old individuals.  Largemouth bass are very slow growing.  Average length of captures was 11.8-inches.  Rock bass averaged 7.3 inches.  The few smallmouth bass captured averaged 14.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked every year since 2000 in an intensive effort to increase abundance and fishing success.  Contributions of stocking have been minimal.  Due to excessive predation and limited yellow perch numbers, young walleye are a good substitute in the diet of pike and bass.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.3 walleye/net.  Average length of captures was 17.3 inches in total length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An assessment of the fish population was conducted on Moses Lake in June of 2002.  Moses Lake is a moderately-sized lake located in northwest Douglas County just west of Millerville.  Water quality is good with an early summer secchi reading of 12.5 feet.  Moses Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community which includes large expanses of emergent vegetation.  The lake is moderately developed and has one resort.  Moses Lake has a quality fishery present which includes northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and walleye.Northern pike were very abundant in 2002 (18.8 fish/gillnet).  The average size of northern pike was small (1.2 pounds and 16.9 inches).   The largest fish sampled measured 34.3 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2002 spring electrofishing survey (76.0 fish/hour).  The 2002 largemouth bass catch rate exceeded the two previous survey catch rates of 41.0 and 50.0 fish/hour in 1994 and 1998, respectively.  The average size of largemouth bass was 12.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  The largest fish captured measured just shy of 19.0 inches.  Approximately 44% of the sample were from the 1999 year class (age 3).  Growth rates were comparable to similar area lakes.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2002 (51.6 fish/trapnet) which is above the historical average catch rate of 48.3 fish/trapnet.  The averaged size of bluegill was good (0.3 pounds and 7.2 inches).  The largest bluegill captured during the survey was 9.1 inches.Black crappie numbers were high in 2002 (5.3 fish/trapnet) compared to the two previous surveys (1.8 fish/trapnet in 2001 and 0.2 fish/trapnet in 1998).  The average size was good (0.5 pounds and 9.3 inches).  The largest black crappie sampled measured 11.5 inches.Walleye numbers were fair in 2002 (4.3 fish/gillnet) and remained similar to the historical average catch rate of 6.2 fish/gillnet.  The 2002 walleye average size (1.7 pounds and 16.2 inches) was good.  Approximately 43% of the sample were age-3 fish from the 1999 year class.  No fish were stocked in Moses Lake in 1999 indicating a strong contribution to the walleye fishery from natural reproduction.  Growth was good with age-4 fish averaging 16.1 inches.In an effort to increase walleye natural reproduction in Moses Lake, an artificial walleye spawning reef was constructed in the mid 1990's.  Placement of small-sized rock (1-2 inch diameter) on the ice was done in cooperation with the Millerville Sportsmen.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Moses Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 15, 2019. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with two sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moses Lake supports an abundant aquatic plant community. Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 21feet and is common in littoral areas.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail surround the entireshoreline.  Firm substrate and aquatic vegetation provide ample spawning habitat and cover forcentrarchids.  This is evidenced by high numbers of bluegill and largemouth bass in Moses Lake.  Northern pike abundance has decreased since 1990.  Gillnet catches averaged 11.0 fish/net in 1990compared to 3.7 fish/net in 1994.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 6.7 - 19.2 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1978.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical andchemical characteristics is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.  Size structure of the northern pike populationhas improved with the decrease in abundance.  Approximately 60% of the fish captured were 21.0 inchesin length or greater, however none exceeded 28.0 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.9 pounds. The decline in northern pike abundance is likely due to poor reproductive success during years of lowwater levels.  Water levels dropped approximately 5.0 feet between 1987 and 1993.  Water levelsreturned to near normal levels in 1994.  Largemouth bass should provide quality angling opportunities. Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 50.0 largemouth bass per hour in 1994.  Most of the fish capturedwere between 12 and 15 inches in length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.2 pounds.  Bluegilltrapnet catches increased from 24.0 fish\\net in 1990 to 62.8 fish\\net in 1994.  Trapnet catchesaveraged 59.7, 57.4, and 43.9 fish\\net in 1987, 1983, and 1978, respectively.  Approximately 40% of thefish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, but few exceeded 8 inches.  Gillnet catches averaged19.3 yellow perch\\net which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes.  Gillnetcatches ranged from 10.7 - 39.8 fish/net in previous surveys.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2pounds.  Walleye gillnet catches increased from 2.7 fish/net in 1990 to 7.6 fish\\net in 1994.  Gillnetcatches averaged 10.0, 6.5, and 9.3 fish\\net in 1987, 1983, and 1978, respectively.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 70% of the fishcaptured were 15 inches in length or greater and 20 % exceeded 20 inches.  Mean weight of fish capturedwas 1.7 pounds.  The age class distribution of fish captured in gillnets indicates that fry stockingshave been more effective than fingerling stockings in producing strong year classes.  Naturalreproduction is also evident from the age class distribution.  A rock spawning reef was placed near theinlet of Moses Lake to enhance walleye spawning success.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Moses is an 822-acre basin located approximately one mile west of Millerville in northwest Douglas County.  Average depth is approximately 16.0 feet.  Water quality is very good.  Water transparency exceeded 10.0 feet at time of the June 2016 fisheries survey.  Aquatic vegetation is abundant.  A public DNR access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 16 NW.   <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fisheries survey was completed on June 13-16, 2016.  A combination of 12 gill nets and 11 trap nets were used to sample the fish community.  Due to increased effectiveness of electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass, the lake's bass population was surveyed in advance (May 26) of the netting assessment. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing catch statistics indicate Largemouth Bass remain abundant.  Largemouth Bass captured during the May electrofishing survey ranged from 7.7 to 15.3 inches in length.  The average length of captures was 11.2 inches.  Due to elevated population density, bass growth is slow.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches revealed a very abundant Rock Bass population, a welcome decrease in Northern Pike densities, and lower than desired abundance estimates for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  A single Smallmouth Bass was recorded in the gill net catch.  Northern Pike catch rates in gill nets have declined from an excessive high of 22.4 pike/net during the 2001 survey to a more normal catch rate of 6.2 fish/net.  Pike catches ranged from 9.6 inches to 33.5 inches in length and averaged 19.8 inches.  Rock Bass captures averaged 7.5 inches.  The largest capture measured 11.6 inches.  The limited Walleye catch rate of 1.8 fish/gill net was disappointing given the combined fingerling stocking investments of the DNR and Millerville Sportsmen's Club.  The 22 Walleyes captured ranged from 13.3 to 27.3 inches in length.  An average length of 18.3 inches would indicate relatively poor survival of young Walleyes from stockings and natural reproduction.  Total Yellow Perch catches in gill nets remained very low in probable response to predation by Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleyes.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches described an abundant Bluegill population and moderately elevated numbers of Black Crappies.  Length distribution of the Bluegill catch indicates good fishing opportunities.  The 2016 Bluegill population sample continued to include good numbers of eight- and nine-year-old individuals from reproductive successes in 2007 and 2008.  Ninety-eight percent of Bluegills captured in trap nets exceeded 6.0 inches in length.  Thirteen percent of those captures were 8.0 inches and larger.  The largest Bluegill captured in 2016 measured 9.1 inches.  Black Crappie population density was elevated in response to a population comprised of cohorts of six consecutive age groups (ages 3-8) and strong recruitment in 2011.  Five-year-old crappies comprised 61% of the total catch of crappies in trap nets.  Average length of crappie captures was 9.7 inches, but older individuals exceeded 12.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nEven with an apparent net reduction in Northern Pike abundance, Moses Lake remains top heavy with predators.  Greater harvest of small Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and utilization of Rock Bass is desirable to reduce densities, improve growth, and enhance recruitment of young Walleyes and Yellow Perch.  Growth of Bluegills is slow and harvest of large individuals will likely decrease the size structure of the population.  Conservation of large individuals is encouraged to maintain the current fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Moses is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Moses is an 822-acre basin located just west of Millerville in Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 32.0 feet.  Mean depth is 16.0 feet.  Water clarity is exceptional given surrounding agricultural land uses and relative shallowness of the basin.  MPCA Citizens Monitoring Program information from 1998 to present, documents improving water clarity.  Transparency can exceed 15.0 ft. during summer months.  Lake Moses supports a diverse aquatic plant community that includes large expanses of emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush and cattail).   Basin morphometry is bowl-shaped with limited bottom relief or defined structure. Moses Lake offers diverse, quality fishing opportunities. <br> \n  <br> \nMost angling interest is directed at walleye.  Lake Moses supports a naturally recruiting walleye population.  Natural recruitment has been too inconsistent among years to sustain desired population objectives, so supplemental stockings occur on an alternate year basis.  Survey catches have been within the range of normal for similar lakes, yet remain below management objectives.  Mortality of young walleye appears high in probable response to northern pike predation.  Walleye growth can be qualified as \"near-average\".   Adult walleye captured in the survey averaged 15.1 inches in length at age-4.  Even though survival of young fish is less than optimal, the lake supports a very good fishery.  Annual contributions from natural reproduction and stocking are fairly consistent.  Nine consecutive age groups were represented in the 2006 population sample.  In response to their longevity and near-average growth, size structure of the walleye population is near optimal to support a consumptive yet high quality recreational fishery.  The majority of walleye captured in 2006 were between 15.0 and 19.0 inches in total length.  Individuals exceeding 25.0 inches have been measured in each of the five recent surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nSunfishes, specifically largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are presently abundant.  These species are also live to be old in Moses Lake.  Bluegill exceeding ten-years-old were common in 2006 catches.  Age distribution of the black crappie catch included some nine-year-old individuals.  Bass and bluegill numbers may push Lake Moses carrying capacity.  Growth rates are slow.  Those 10-year-old bluegill captured had not yet grown to exceed 8.0 inches in length.  Only seven percent of 8.0-inch or larger largemouth bass captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  Catch statistics for black crappie deviated from that of other sunfish species in probable response to greater variability in the annual influx of young fish into the population.  Average crappie catches in 2002 and 2006 have exceeded the range of normal.  As stated, crappie live to be very old in Lake Moses.  In contrast to other sunfishes, growth rate is average rather than slow.  The end result is a healthy population with good numbers of large crappie.  Thirty-three percent of all black crappie captured in 2006 exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Average weight of crappie caught was 0.5 lbs.  All in all, bass and panfish fishing experiences should be very good. <br> \n <br> \nAll is not well within the fish community.  Northern pike continue to be excessively abundant.  Gillnet catches during the 2006 survey averaged 22.2 pike/net.  The upper range of normal for similar lakes is 9.0 pike/gillnet.  Correspondingly, growth is slow.  Larger pike did not attain 28.0 inches in length until late into nine growing seasons.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size caught, is marginal.  Mean weight of pike captured in the 2006 survey was 1.5 lbs.  Only nine pike measured exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  Catch rates of walleye and yellow perch are inversely related to northern pike abundance. <br> \n <br> \nPerhaps anglers have become too specialized and focused on fishing for walleye.  There is strong justification to redirect fishing pressure and harvest onto small northern pike, eight- to 12.0-inch largemouth bass, and five- to seven-inch bluegill.  Reducing numbers of small northern pike and releasing larger pike may even improve survival of young walleye and walleye fishing.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 8 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including 5 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and 1 that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Lake Moses is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Lake Moses is located in the Chippewa River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Moses is an 822-acre basin located approximately one mile west of Millerville in northwest Douglas County. Average depth is approximately 16 feet. Lake Moses was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020. Water clarity typically increases rapidly in the years following zebra mussel infestation. Water transparency was 24 feet at time of the June 2022 fisheries survey, which leads to abundant aquatic vegetation. A public DNR access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 16 NW.\n\nA standardized fisheries survey was completed June 13-16, 2022. A combination of 12 gill nets and 10 trap nets were used to sample the fish community. Due to increased effectiveness of electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass, the lake's bass population was surveyed in advance (June 1) of the netting assessment.\n\nSpring electrofishing catch statistics indicate Largemouth Bass remain abundant. Largemouth Bass captured during the June electrofishing survey ranged from 8 to 17 inches in length. The average length of captures was 12 inches. Due to elevated population density, bass growth rates are slow.  Several Smallmouth Bass were observed in recent surveys, but none were observed in the 2022 survey.\n\nNorthern Pike catch rates in the 2022 survey were near the long term average for Lake Moses, though abundance is still considered high.  Northern Pike size structure has improved drastically over the last several decades, and now represents one of the higher quality pike fisheries in the area. Many pike over 30 inches were observed in the survey, the largest being 37 inches.  Sustaining the larger pike in this population could be beneficial.  Northern Pike populations with large fish tend to be self-limiting, leading to lower abundance of smaller pike and decreasing predation pressure on Yellow Perch and small Walleye.\n\nWalleye abundance decreased to a record-low of 1.5 fish/gill net.  Poor returns of previous Walleye stockings resulted in a modification of the stocking proposal in 2015. Stocking plans were modified from an annual stocking of 1 pound/littoral acre of fingerlings to a biennial stocking of 2 pounds/littoral acre of large fingerlings or yearlings. In addition to State stocking efforts, the Millerville Sportsmen's Club has purchased and stocked Walleye fingerlings at a nearly annual frequency. Despite various stocking efforts of advanced life stages (fingerlings, yearlings, and adults), Walleye CPE remains low.  Though fry stocking has not been attempted in almost 20 years, historical fry stockings were more successful than current fingerling stockings.  In an attempt to boost or at least maintain current Walleye abundance, fry stocking resumed in 2021.  Lengths of Walleye caught in the 2022 survey ranged from 11 to 24 inches. Average length of gill net captures was 17 inches.\n\nPanfishing opportunities are excellent in Lake Moses.  Bluegill abundance is high.  Growth rates are below average, but Bluegill are long lived in Lake Moses likely because of low harvest levels.  Larger, older Bluegill can be easily over-exploited.  Anglers can help maintain this high quality Bluegill fishery by limiting harvest of large Bluegill.  Nearly 34% of the Bluegill caught in trap nets were over 8 inches, and several 10 inch Bluegill were observed.  It takes Bluegill almost 9 years to reach 8 inches, and many older Bluegill up to age 12 were sampled.  Black Crappie catch rates are moderate and were near the long term average for Lake Moses.  Similar to Bluegill, growth rates of Black Crappie are below average, but some individuals live long enough to reach larger sizes.  Twenty six percent of the crappie were over 10 inches and the largest observed was 13 inches and was estimated to be 16 years old.\n\nOther prominent species in Lake Moses include Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Lake Moses supports elevated numbers of Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass, likely in response to good water quality.  Yellow Perch abundance has been low for several decades, but catch rates increased slightly in the 2022 survey.  Yellow Perch are often an important prey fish for predator species.\n \nHigh quality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Moses.  Many species in Lake Moses grow slowly, but harvest levels appear to be low, which allows for fish to live longer and reach larger sizes.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Moses was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2020. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",
