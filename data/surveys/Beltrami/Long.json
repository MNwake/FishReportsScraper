Northern Pike were found in good numbers and generally larger than many area lakes. The average length of pike was more than 25 inches. No small pike were captured so there may be some concern if reproduction does not appear during the next few years.Walleye were sampled in fair numbers and it appears that natural reproduction is adequate to maintain a fishery. The largest Walleye captured was 23 inches and the average was about 17 inches. Largemouth Bass are found in good numbers with the largest fish at 18 inches and an average of 10.5 inches.Black Crappie were sampled in good numbers, with all fish sampled being greater than 8 inches in length. Yellow Perch, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish are abundant but generally too small to be attractive to anglers, though a few fair sized Bluegill were sampled.</p>",
