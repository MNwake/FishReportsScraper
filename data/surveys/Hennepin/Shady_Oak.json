NOP WERE CAPTURED IN ALL THREE BASINS.  ONLY IN THE SOUTH BASIN (WHERE JUST ONE FISH WAS CAPTURED) SAMPLING DID NOT EXCEED MEDIANS.  GROWTH OF NOP APPEARS TO BE AVERAGE AND VERY SIMILAR IN ALL THREE BASINS WITH AGE III+ FISH BEING THE DOMINANT AGE CLASS IN THE PRESENT POPULATION.  AS A RESULT, THE CALCULATED RSD =20.4% FOR THE THREE BASINS COMBINED.  LMB WERE SAMPLED SLIGHTLY ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS AND AT MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS USING COMBINED DATA.  BASS YOY WERE OBSERVED IN ALL THREE BASINS BUT WERE SAMPLED BY SEINING ONLY IN THE MIDDLE BASIN.  ADULT LMB WERE CAPTURED IN ALL THREE BASINS.  GROWTH APPEARS TO BE SLOWEST IN THE MIDDLE BASIN AND SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE FOR ALL THREE BASINS.  IN GENERAL, BLGS WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  BLGS AVERAGED SMALL IN SIZE AND COMBINED SAMPLING GEAR ANALYSIS RESULTS IN AN TRAPNET CALCULATED PSD= 6.55%.  THE PSD FOR THE NORTH AND SOUTH BASINS WERE SIMILAR (4.67 AND 4.85% RESPECTIVELY) AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE MIDDLE BASIN (9.19%). HOWEVER, THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL FISH OVERALL WERE SAMPLED IN THE SOUTH BASIN.  THE MOST COMMON SIZE OF BLG SAMPLED WAS BETWEEN 4.0 AND 4.9 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  PMKS AND HSF WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAPNETS AND NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  THESE SPECIES ALSO AVERAGE SMALL IN SIZE AND WERE PRESENT IN ALL THREE BASINS.  YEB WERE PRESENT IN THE NORTHERN TWO BASINS, BUT ABSENT IN THE SOUTH.  BLBS WERE ABUNDANT IN THE SOUTH BASIN, BUT WERE ABSENT INTHE NORTHERN TWO BASINS.  BRBS AND CARP WERE SAMPLED ONLY IN THE NORTH BASIN.  BLC WERE SAMPLED IN ALL THREE BASINS AND OVERALL WERE BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS AND NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  THE MAJORITY OF BLC SAMPLED WERE IN THE NORTH BASIN. THE AVERAGE RATE FOR THE CRAPPIES SAMPLED WAS ONLY 6.45 FISH PER POUND.</p>",
