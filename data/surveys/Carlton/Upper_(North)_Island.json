                "narrative": "<p>Upper Island is located adjacent the town of Cromwell, MN and is connected to Lower Island Lake by a shallow-unobstructed channel.  Upper Island was sampled in conjunction with Lower Island and results are very similar between lakes.  Upper Island has a priority rating of 5 due to it's proximity to Cromwell, Minnesota Highway #210 and presence of a public water access.  Sampling of Upper Island has indicated that it is most suited to northern pike and panfish, with a supplemental walleye fishery provided through stocking.  it is speculated that largemouth bass are also an important component of the fishery.     Results of the 1994 assessment ducument abundant bluegill and black crappie populations with good size structure.  Future angler catch rates for these species will undoubtedly reflect this strong panfish population.  Although not abundant, walleye size structure and growth rates are good.  Stocking appears successful in producing an incidental walleye fishery on Upper Island Lake.  Despite their absence in summer assessment gear, largemouth bass were frequently sighted by the survey crew.  Spring electrofishing will be used to assess bass populations in Upper and Lower Island Lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Island is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet. The lake is located just north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered earthen, back-in access.  The public access is located off the County Road #120 right-of-way and has very limited parking.  The fish community of Upper Island was last assessed in 2010.  The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Upper Island was surveyed during the summer of 2019 to update information about fish populations.  Walleye fry were stocked in even years from 2000 through 2018.  Due to poor survival, Walleye stocking every even year was discontinued after 2018.  A recent Walleye stocking evaluation showed that many Walleye captured in Upper Island originate from fry stocking events in Lower Island, which flows into Upper Island via a free-flowing inlet along the southern shoreline.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 17.9 fish per hour, which was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average length of sampled Largemouth Bass was 14.0 inches, but larger fish were sampled and should provide quality angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth Bluegill and Black Crappie population densities were above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 6.4 inches, while Bluegill average length was 5.7 inches.  Two strong year-classes of Black Crappie were present and should provide quality angling opportunities in the future as these year-classes mature.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gillnet abundance of 1.7 per lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average size was large at 21.1 inches.  The 2012 and 2014 year-classes were represented and may provide notable incidental catches for anglers.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Island is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located just north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered, earthen, back-in access.  The designated access is off the County Road #120 right-of-way and has very limited parking.  Walleye fry have been stocked in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002.  Primary management species are walleye and largemouth bass and secondary management species are bluegill and black crappie.     Walleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Lakeshore property owners reported good success in angling for walleye earlier in 2002.  Of the 5 aged walleye from the 2002 investigation, 4 were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  Mean length of 17.3 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 16.4 inches.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2002.  Largemouth bass abundance was 11.5 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length was 12.4 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 13.8 inches.     Black crappie abundance of 3.8 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 8.4 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 8.6 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year class and no fish older than five years.     Bluegill abundance of 3.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.2 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 5.9 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1997 year class and no fish older than age six.     Northern pike abundance of 7.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 18.8 inches was small.  Growth was average with length at age four of 20.7 inches.     Other fish species sampled in Upper Island Lake include bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and brown and yellow bullhead.  Bowfin are native to only a small number of lakes within the Duluth fisheries management area.     Management of walleye in Upper Island Lake has resulted in only limited return to DNR test netting samples.  However, lakeshore property owners reported that angling for walleye has been good.  The current stocking strategy will be continued through the next investigation and management plan cycle.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Island is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet. The lake is located just north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered earthen, back-in access.  The designated access is off the County Road #120 right-of-way and has very limited parking.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 2000 through 2010. Upper Island was last assessed in 2002.  Upper Island was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (0.5) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 19.8 inches but only 2 individuals were captured.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Both fish were from the 2002 year-class.  Both walleyes aged corresponded to a stocked year-class. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 19 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 35.8 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 15.0 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2009 were represented in the sample except 2007 and 2008.  Shoreline seining captured 2 young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass with an average length of 2.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 2.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (7.3) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The northern pike CPUE of 2010 is the lowest on record of seven investigations dating back to 1977.  Average length was 22.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented except 2004. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2002 (3.8) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (3.1) and above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.8 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2002 (0.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Only one perch was captured and it was 6.5 inches in length.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  The one perch captured was from the 2007 year-class.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black, brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, central mudminnow, mottled sculpin, tadpole madtom, common shiner, golden shiner, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Thirty-three aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Yellow water lily, coontail and flat-stem pondweed were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by northern milfoil (80% of transects).  The most common substrate types were sand and detritus which were identified along 70% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Upper Island is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with low fertility. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Island Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Island is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet. The lake is located just north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered earthen, back-in access.  The public access is located off the County Road #120 right-of-way and has very limited parking.  The fish community of Upper Island was last assessed in 2019, and the lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Upper Island was surveyed during the summer of 2021 to update information about fish populations following a winterkill event which occurred during the spring of 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of four Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 4.2 fish per hour, which was below average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Average length of sampled Largemouth Bass was 15.5 inches.  Three year-classes were present and good connectivity to adjacent waterbodies (Lower Island and the Tamarack River) will allow Largemouth Bass populations in Upper Island to recover quickly if they were impacted by the winterkill event.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill population densities were average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Bluegill average length was 6.1 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 64%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 26%.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie population densities were above average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 7.3 inches.  All year-classes from 2015 to 2019 were represented indicating consistent natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gillnet abundance of 0.8 per lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average size was large at 21.9 inches.  The 2012 and 2014 year-classes were represented and may provide notable incidental catches for anglers.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet abundance of 9.8 per lift was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average size was 20.6 inches but some preferred size fish were captured over 28 inches long.</p>",
