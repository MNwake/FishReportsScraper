Gill net catch rates were 1.0 rainbow trout per gill net while trap net catch rates were 0.2 trout per trap net.  Low catch rates are probably an indication that considerable harvest of yearling rainbow trout occurs after stocking (Doran and Hauff 1985).  High fishing pressure and harvest coupled with hatchery reared fish stocked into a sterile mine pit make these rainbow trout susceptible to anglers.  It appears as though this system is operating as a \"put grow-and-take fishery\".  Age classes making up the current population structure consist of age 1 (14%), 2 (43%), 3 (29%), and 4 (14%) year old trout.  No mean back-calculated length-at-age data was determined due to the difficulty of determining annuli of hatchery-reared fish (lack of annulus formation at age 1).Other species noted in the survey included white sucker, fathead minnows, and painted turtles.  One white sucker was captured during sampling.  Fathead minnows were observed in the littoral areas of the pit although none were caught during the assessment period.  Six painted turtles were also caught and released from the trap nets.References - Doran, P. D. and K. Huff.  1985.
