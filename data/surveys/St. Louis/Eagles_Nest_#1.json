                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest 1 is a 324 acre lake located eight miles east of Tower.  It is accessed by a water access channel that connects with Eagles Nest 2.  The lake has a maximum depth of 76 feet and at the time of this survey light green colored water due to a slight algae bloom.  On August 3, 2020 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 44 feet where the temperature was 45 degrees.  Compared to other lakes in the area, Eagles Nest 1 is relatively developed with year round and seasonal homes.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, gravel, and sand with some muck in the bays.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse due to a rusty crayfish infestation. \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 22.2 fish/net which was just below the average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 34.6 lbs/net which was right around the historic average.  Fish species sampled were walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, white sucker, rock bass, northern pike, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 21.3 fish/net which was the lowest catch rate since 1980.  Yield was 5.0 lbs/net which was below the lakes historic average.  Black crappie was the only additional species sampled in trap nets that weren't also caught in gill nets.  Small mesh gill nets sampled rainbow smelt and yellow perch.  \n\nSeventy walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 14.0 fish/net, which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the second highest catch rate on record for Eagles Nest 1.  This catch rate also ranked 14th out of 198 surveys of walleye population in the Tower area.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 22.5 inches with an average of nearly 16 inches.  The average weight was 1.6 pounds which was better than average compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye growth was excellent with the average walleye growing just over 16 inches at four years old.  Ages ranged from 1 to 18 years with a very good looking 2017 year class.  Eagles Nest 1 is currently being stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year.  When stocked years were compared against non-stocked years, 71 percent of the catch came from a year when fingerling stocking occurred, however the proportion of stocked versus wild fish within these years is unknown.\n\nOn the night of June 11th, spring electrofishing occurred to assess the largemouth and smallmouth bass populations. Sixteen smallmouth were captured in the 1.0 hour of fishing for a catch rate of 16.0 fish/hour.  This was right at the Tower area average compared to other smallmouth lakes.  Lengths ranged from 7 to over 18 with an average of nearly 15 inches.  Thirteen additional smallmouth were sampled in gill nets and four more were caught in trap nets.  Those sizes ranged from 7 to 19 inches.  The smallmouth population's growth rate was good.  The average fish was just over 10 inches at four years old, compared to the Tower smallmouth average of 9 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 17 years old. \n \nSix largemouth bass were also captured in electrofishing for a catch rate of 6.0 fish/hour.  This was below average compared to other largemouth lakes in the area.  Lengths ranged from 14 to over 18 inches. \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate was 1.0 fish/net which was below the historic average for the lake and slightly lower than normal compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 20 to just over 38 inches with an average of 27 inches.  Both the average and maximum lengths were quite good compared to previous surveys on Eagles Nest 1, with a 38 inch pike being the largest ever surveyed on the lake.  \n\nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 12.2 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes but well below average compared to past surveys on Eagles Nest 1.  Sizes were somewhat small with lengths ranging from 4 to 7 inches with an average of 5 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 7 years old with strong representation from the 2016 and 2018 year classes.  Even though sizes were relatively small, growth rates were quite good compared to other area bluegill lakes.    \n\nRainbow smelt are a non-native invasive fish that were first caught in DNR nets in 1980.  In the 2020 survey, 138 smelt were caught for a catch rate of 69.0 fish/small mesh gill net.  Previous surveys of smelt catches were highly variable.  Sizes have remained relatively constant through time with a 2020 average length of just over 5 inches. The presence of smelt is likely a contributing factor to fast walleye growth in the lake. However, their presence makes it difficult for walleye to produce wild year classes. Smelt are thought to prey on the walleye eggs and compete with very young walleye for food resources. \n\nRusty crayfish have been in Eagles Nest 1 since at least 1987.  Catch rates appear to have declined from an average of 101.8 crayfish/net from 1990 to 2010 to a catch rate of 13.2 in 2015 and 27.2 in 2020.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest #1 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which is comprised of 64 medium sized, deep, and clear lakes in northeast Minnesota.  Eagles Nest #1 is deeper than most of these lakes, and is clearer, has less shallow area, and is more chemically productive.  Eagles Nest #1 stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 5 ppm oxygen below about 35', at which depth the water temperature is about 47 F.  There is a broad connection between Eagles Nest #1 and Eagles Nest #2 which is about 75' wide and 10' deep.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1995 (all fish species combined) was average for this lake class in terms of the number of fish caught, but was above average in terms of the weight of fish caught, due to the abundant population of large walleye.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets was above average in terms of the number of fish, but was average in terms of the weight of the fish caught, due to the very abundant population of small bluegill sunfish.  Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, walleye, northern pike, and rainbow smelt.Bluegill numbers in 1995 were far above average for this lake class, and have increased in each of the four trapnettings since the initial survey in 1955.  The reason for this increase is not known.  The average bluegill in 1995 was small, at 5\"; only one bluegill was over 8\".  Bluegill growth was very slow: 3\" at age five and 4\" at age 6.  All bluegill captured in 1995 were age five or older; younger bluegill may have been too small to be caught in the trapnets we used.  Almost all bluegill were infested with Neascus, also known as \"black spot\".  Neascus is a parasite in or beneath the skin of fish which is usually removed by filleting, is killed by cooking, and is harmless to humans.Walleye numbers in 1995 were above average for this lake class and were higher than the long term average of 6.1/gillnet for this lake.  Most walleye were from years which had been stocked with walleye fingerlings.  The average size of walleye (17\") was quite large; the largest was 28\" (8.5 lb).  Walleye were eating smelt, were very fat, and were growing very fast: 11\" at age two, 17\" at age four. Northern pike numbers were above average for this lake class and were higher than in previous surveys and assessments.  Pike sizes averaged 21\"; the largest was 30\".  Most pike were young.  Growth was average for the area.Rainbow smelt were first observed in 1980.  Smelt numbers in 1995 were typical of lakes where smelt have been present for some time.  Smelt were small, averaging 5\"; the largest was 7\".  Smallmouth bass numbers were above average for this lake class. Smallmouth sizes averaged 13\", the largest was 15\".  Smallmouth growth was slow: 8\" at age five.Black crappie, white sucker, and yellow perch numbers in 1995 were below average.  Many perch were infested with Neascus.  Rock bass numbers were average.  A few largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and sculpin were also captured.  Rusty crayfish, a large \"exotic\" crayfish from the Ohio River Valley, were first observed in 1987 and are now abundant.SMELT NETS:Smelt were first observed in this lake in 1980.  This special assessment consisted of two sets with standardized smelt gillnets.  A total of 196 smelt (98/net) were caught in this assessment which is typical of oligotrophic lakes that have harbored smelt for some time.  Smelt sizes ranged from 4.6\" - 7.1\", but most were 4.6\" - 5.5\".</p>",

EN1 is one of four lakes that comprise the Eagles Nest chain of lakes.  Based on physical and chemical characteristics, EN1, along with the other three Eagles Nest lakes, is categorized in lake class 5.  Lakes in this class are typically deep, with soft clear water.  There is a public access on the north side of Eagles Nest Two off of Co. Rd. 599.  Boaters can then travel through the channel to EN1.  EN1 is managed primarily for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, bluegill, black crappie, and smallmouth bass are all abundant in EN1.  In 2010, walleye abundance was well above average for class 5 lakes and exceeded past estimates for EN1.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.7 inches to 26.4 inches with an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Seven different year classes were identified in 2010.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd-numbered years.  Eighty-three percent of walleye sampled in 2010 were from stocked years.  Rainbow smelt are abundant in the lake and an important forage species for walleye.  As a result, walleye growth is above average. <br> \n   <br> \nBluegill were abundant in EN1.  In 2010 bluegill were sampled at a rate that was four times higher than typically found in a class 5 lake.  Anglers can expect to catch bluegill up to nine inches long.  Bluegill anglers should practice selective harvest.  Keep more abundant small bluegill, and release the bigger less abundant fish.  This will help improve the size structure. <br> \nBlack crappie is another abundant panfish present in EN1.  Crappie up to 13 inches long were sampled in 2010.  <br> \n  <br> \nIn 2010, smallmouth bass up to 16 inches in length were sampled.  Largemouth bass also are present in EN1 but in lower numbers than smallmouth bass.  There is a low density population of northern pike in EN1 that are of quality size.  Pike up to 37 inches were sampled in 2010.  Along with rainbow smelt, another invasive species that exist in EN1 is rusty crayfish.  Their introduction into Eagles Nest chain of lakes was probably accidental by anglers using them as bait.  It is unlawful to harvest and transport crayfish. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a fish consumption advisory for walleye and northern pike due to mercury levels.

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 1 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft (unmineralized) and clear water.  Eagles Nest Lake 1 is deeper and has clearer water than many of the lakes in this lake class.  According to Carlson's Trophic State Index, Eagles Nest Lake 1 ranks as oligotrophic using a water clarity of 5.8 m, mesotrophic using a chlorophyll-a of 2.9 ppb, and eutrophic using a total phosphorus of 30 ppb.  Since the watershed for Eagles Nest Lake 1 is fairly small, it is likely that much of the phosphorus present is from lawn runoff and septic system leaching.Eagles Nest Lake 1 was thermally stratified on 08/14/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 44 ft, where the temperature was 43 F.  There is one small inlet.  The outlet to Eagles Nest Lake 2 is a navigable channel 75 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Shoal substrates are mostly rubble and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 17 ft and are mostly found in a narrow fringe along the rocky shore and in a few small bays; sedges and sweetgale are the most common aquatic plants.Riparian development on Eagles Nest Lake 1 increased from two resorts and 24 homes and cottages in 1955 to 72 homes and cottages in 1980, and to 88 homes and cottages in 2000.  A public access is on Eagles Nest Lake 2, from which boats may access Eagles Nest Lake 1.Fish sampling in the 2000 fisheries lake survey consisted of six gillnet sets, six trapnet sets, night electrofishing for bass in late summer, two small mesh smelt gillnets, and three small mesh trapnets.  Eight previous investigations, dating back to 1955, consisted of 2-6 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (5-6 sets) were used during four of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seining was done in 1955 and 1980.  Electrofishing was done in 1994.  Smelt gillnets (1-2 sets) were used in 1980, 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1995.  A deep gillnet was set in 1990.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, walleye, northern pike, and rainbow smelt.  Fair numbers of largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were also present.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 25 fish/net was in the second quartile for this lake class and was at the median value for all investigations on this lake.  The total catch by weight in 2000 of 44 lb/net was in the third quartile for this lake class and was also at the median value for all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 87 fish/net (15 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 104 fish/net (15 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill numbers have increased over time in the trapnet catches and have been quite high since 1990.  In contrast, catches of other fish species in the trapnets has remained stable and low over time.Bluegill numbers in 2000 (74.7/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Previous bluegill catches were 2.5/trapnet (1955), 13.4/trapnet (1980), 93.8/trapnet (1990), and 143.2/trapnet (1995).  Bluegill sizes in 2000 averaged 5.3\" (0.12 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class; the largest bluegill was 10.8\".  Many of the bluegill were age five, from a strong 1995 year class.  Bluegill growth was in the first quartile for  area lakes.Walleye numbers in 2000 (9.2/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 18.4\" (2.4 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class; the largest walleye was 26.8\".  Most of the walleye captured in 2000 (87 percent) were age three, from the 1997 year class.  All of the walleye age 9 and under captured in gillnets in 2000 were from fingerling stocked year classes.  Walleye growth was in the fourth quartile for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (5.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 21.8\" (2.7 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class; the largest pike was 33.9\".  Pike growth was in the normal range for this lake class.Rainbow smelt numbers in 2000 (245/smelt net) were higher than the range of 1-209/smelt net in five investigations from 1980 through 1995.  Smelt sizes in 2000 ranged from 4.6-6.9\".  Most of the smelt (88 percent) were captured in the 3/8\" bar mesh.Largemouth bass numbers in the gillnets in 2000 (0.2/net) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Largemouth numbers in the trapnets (1.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than previous trapnet catches in this lake.  Largemouth numbers in the electrofishing (17.6/hour on-time) were higher than the catch of 12.4/hour on-time in 1994.  Largemouth sizes in 2000 averaged 16.3\" in the gillnets, 7.0\" in the trapnets, and 9.0\" in the electrofishing catch.  The largest (caught in a gillnet) was 16.3\".  Most of the largemouth were ages two and three, from the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  Largemouth growth was in the first and second quartiles, depending on the age, for area lakes.Smallmouth bass numbers in the gillnets in 2000 (2.5/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth numbers in the trapnets (0.3/net) were at the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 0.4/net in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth numbers in the electrofishing (23.7/hour on-time) were higher than the catch of 19.3/hour on-time in 1994.  Smallmouth sizes in 2000 averaged 13.9\" in the gillnets, 11.7\" in the trapnets, and 6.0\" in the electrofishing.  The largest smallmouth (caught in a gillnet) was 19.2\".  Smallmouth growth was in the first or second quartiles, depending on the age, for area lakes.Neascus was present in many of the bluegill examined in 2000.  Some of the bass had bass tapeworm, and a few of the yellow perch had yellow grub.  These are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first observed in 1987 in Eagles Nest Lake 1.  Subsequently, their numbers in the gillnet catch were: 125/net (1990), 96/net (1995), and 94/net (2000).  These crayfish are native to the Ohio River valley and were probably introduced by anglers using them for bait.  They usually displace native crayfish and can decimate rooted aquatic plants.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 are in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 are broadly connected by a navigable channel 75 ft wide and 10 ft deep.  Since fish populations are similar and fish may move freely between the two lakes, they are managed as a single body of water.Eagles Nest Lake 1, with a surface area of 322 acres, total alkalinity of 50 ppm, and Secchi water clarity of 11 ft, is typical of lakes in Lake Class 5.  Eagles Nest Lake 1 is deeper (76 ft) than the lake class average of 44 ft, and has a smaller proportion littoral area (27 percent) than the lake class average of 38 percent.  Eagles Nest Lake 1 ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with chlorophyll-a of 2.9 ppb and total phosphorus of 30 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 1 was thermally stratified on 08/15/2005 with a surface temperature of 70 F and bottom temperature of 45 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 40 ft, where the temperature was 48 F.  Eagles Nest Lake 2, with a surface area of 408 acres, maximum depth of 39 ft, total alkalinity of 52 ppm, and Secchi water clarity of 11 ft, is typical of lakes in Lake Class 5.  Eagles Nest Lake 2 has a larger proportion of littoral area (56 percent) than the lake class average of 38 percent, and has a higher Shoreline Development Factor (2.76) than the lake class average of 1.87.  Eagles Nest Lake 2 ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index with chlorophyll-a of 5.0 ppb and total phosphorus of 28 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 2 was thermally stratified on 08/15/2005 with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 25 ft, where the temperature was 64 F.The major inlet to these lakes, from Eagles Nest Lake 3, enters Eagles Nest Lake 2 on the south shore.  The outlet, the East Two River to Lake Vermilion, exits Eagles Nest Lake 2 in the northwest bay.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of both lakes are mostly rubble and gravel.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of about 15 ft, and are moderately abundant in the shallows, especially in Eagles Nest Lake 2, which has more shallow water.  Aquatic plants have not been affected by rusty crayfish in these lakes as much as in some other lakes (Eagles Nest Lake 3, for example) where they are abundant.Fish populations in 2005 were sampled with nine standard survey gillnets, twelve standard survey trapnets, three small mesh smelt gillnets set in deep water, and six electrofishing runs along the shoreline that were done at night in the fall.  Nine previous investigations dating back to 1955 used 4-12 standard gillnets.  Trapnets (6-12 nets) were used during five of these previous investigations.  Shoreline seining or small mesh trapnetting for young-of-year fish was done in three of these investigations.  Fall night electrofishing was done in the three most recent investigations.  Smelt gillnetting was done in seven years from 1980 through 2005.Fish populations in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 2005 were dominated by walleye, bluegill sunfish, smallmouth bass, and rainbow smelt.  Fair numbers of northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie were also present.Walleye numbers in 2005 (13.6/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median walleye catch of 6.6/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year (in odd-numbered years), and 102 of 122 (84 percent) of walleye captured in 2005 were from years stocked with fingerlings.  Many of these walleye (48 percent) were from a strong 2001 year class.  Walleye sizes in 2005 averaged 19.3\" (3.0 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the median size of 18.3\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest walleye was 29.7\" (10.6 lb).  Growth of walleye captured in 2005 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Bluegill numbers were fairly low in the first two investigations on these lakes: 2.2/trapnet in 1955 and 10.5/trapnet in 1980.  Bluegill numbers then exploded, with catches of 106/trapnet in 1990, 130/trapnet in 1995, 54/trapnet in 2000, and 68/trapnet in 2005.  Bluegill are more vulnerable to trapnetting early in the summer, and trapnetting dates in these lakes was switched from mid August in early investigations through 1990, to mid July in 1995 and later investigations.  The fact that high numbers of bluegill were captured in 1990, prior to switching the trapnetting date, means that the increase in bluegill catches represents a real increase in the bluegill population.Bluegill sizes in 2005 averaged 6.1\" (0.19 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.6\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest bluegill captured in 2005 was 9.3\".  Bluegill year classes from 1998 through 2002 were all well represented.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2005 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2005 (3.8/gillnet, 1.3/trapnet) were in the fourth quartiles for this lake class and were higher than the median smallmouth catches of 3.2/gillnet and 0.6/trapnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Bass are \"net shy\" and difficult to sample well in standard gillnets and trapnets.  Good numbers of smallmouth (39.1/hour of on-time) were caught during electrofishing in 2005.   Smallmouth sizes in 2005 averaged 14.9\" in the gillnets, 9.2\" in the trapnets, and 7.7\" in the electrofishing.  The largest smallmouth (caught in a gillnet) was 18.4\".  Growth of smallmouth captured in 2005 was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.  Largemouth bass are also present in these lakes, but in lower numbers than smallmouth.  Largemouth up to 18\" have been caught during electrofishing.Smelt were first observed in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 1980.  Smelt numbers in Eagles Nest Lake 1 in 2005 (98/smelt net) were higher than in Eagles Nest Lake 2 (3/smelt net).  This is similar to previous smelt investigations in these lakes since smelt were introduced.  Smelt are a cold-water species and Eagles Nest Lake 1 is deeper and has more cold water with adequate oxygen in the summer.  Many of the walleye examined in these lakes in previous investigations had smelt in their stomachs.  Smelt are a rich, oily food source, and are largely responsible for the fast growth of walleye in these lakes.  Smelt are native to the Atlantic Ocean and made their way through the Great Lakes.  They were likely introduced to Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 intentionally, or by smelt netters from Lake Superior releasing fertilized eggs into the lakes while cleaning their gear.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.6/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Pike sizes in 2005 averaged 24.1\" (3.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.0\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest pike caught in 2005 was 39.6\".  Pike scales were moderately difficult to read and growth was too inconsistent to draw conclusions about growth rates. Black crappie numbers in 2005 (3.3/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.2/trapnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Crappie sizes in 2005 averaged 8.3\" (0.35 lb), which was at the median for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 8.9\" in all investigations on these lakes.  The largest crappie was 13.1\".  Most of the crappie captured in 2005 (23 of 30) were age three. Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2005 (6.2/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.3/gillnet in all investigations on these lakes.  Perch sizes in 2005 averaged 7.1\" (0.16 lb), which was at the median for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 7.7\" in all investigations on these lakes.  Perch growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Many of the game fish examined in 2005 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Many of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera.  Some of the yellow perch had yellow grub cysts.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first observed in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in 1987.  They get entangled in the gillnets and have been counted in all four investigations from 1990 to 2005.  Their numbers in 2005 (97/gillnet) were similar to previous counts (range: 93-116/gillnet).   Rusty crayfish are native to the Ohio River valley and were likely introduced to this area by anglers using them for bait.  They out compete and displace native crayfish.  They are very aggressive and have been associated with the destruction of rooted aquatic vegetation in lakes and the subsequent decline of bluegill populations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake One (EN1) is located approximately 9 miles NE of Tower. This clear water lake is highly developed by area standards with homes and cabins frequently appearing near the shorelines. There is a public access with a concrete planked boat ramp located on Eagles Nest Lake Two off CR 599. A navigable channel connects the two lakes and boaters should be cautious on both lakes since rock piles are common, most of which are unmarked. \n\nIn terms of total numbers of fish per net, the 2015 catch on EN1 was the lowest on record for both gill nets and trap nets. Smallmouth bass and rock bass were however sampled in above average numbers. Bluegill made up 77 percent of the trap net catch and relatively low numbers of black crappie were also observed. Walleye numbers and average size were the lowest since fingerling stocking began in 1991. \n\nNo smelt were sampled which is the first time since smelt netting began in 1980 that this has occurred. Rusty crayfish abundance appeared to decline in 2015. Both rusty crayfish and smelt are non-native species that were likely unintentionally introduced as bait.\n\nSmallmouth bass in 2015 were sampled by electrofishing, gill nets and trap nets. Smallmouth numbers in the gill nets were higher than the historic average of 3.6/gill net and higher than in other similar area lakes. The average smallmouth sampled from the gill nets was a respectable 15.8 inches or about 8 years old and the largest smallmouth was 20 inches long. Smallmouth made up 75% of the electrofishing catch and the remainder were largemouth. The average smallmouth sampled by electrofishing was 13 inches long with the largest almost 19 inches long. The average largemouth was also 13 inches long up to a maximum size of 18 inches.\n\nWalleye numbers in 2015 were below the historic average of 6.3/gill net and below average compared to other similar area lakes. The average walleye sampled was 15.9 inches long (4 years old) which is smaller than the historic average of 18 inches long. The largest walleye was 22.1 inches long. Seventy-four percent of the walleye aged were from stocked year classes.\n\nBluegill numbers in 2015 were well below the historic average of 69.6/trap net but above average 7.9/trap net compared to other similar area lakes. The average bluegill sampled was 4.9 inches long which is smaller than the historic average length of 5.5 inches. Few bluegill from the trap nets were more than 8 inches long. Rusty crayfish have removed much aquatic vegetation and this may be negatively effecting bluegill since this vegetation provides a preferred habitat.\n\nBlack crappie numbers in 2015 were low but typically these fish do not get sampled very well with trap nets and gill nets. The few crapppie sampled were of good size.\n</p>",
