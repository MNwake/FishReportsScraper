                "narrative": "<p>Upper and Lower Ojibway (also known as Upper and Lower Dead or East and West Dead) Lakes are located in south-central Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  The two lake basins are connected by a small channel that can be navigated with a small boat.  Upper and Lower Ojibway are managed and surveyed as one lake.  Upper and Lower Ojibway have a combined area of 292 acres and a maximum depth of 34 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of Lower Ojibway.  Ojibway has excellent water quality and clarity, and supports good populations of largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ojibway is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Big and Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nOjibway supports a healthy largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing catch rates (89 bass/hour) were high when compared to other area lakes.  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was higher than past surveys.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Ojibway. <br> \n <br> \nOjibway has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  The panfish population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range and bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Bluegill and black crappie growth rates were slow when compared to other class 25 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Ojibway.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 15.8 pike/gillnet was well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.5 inches.  The northern pike population in Ojibway is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of yellow perch.  White sucker, black bullhead, and golden shiner were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper and Lower Ojibway Lakes are located in south-central Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  The two lake basins are connected by a small channel that can be navigated with a small boat.  Upper and Lower Ojibway are managed and surveyed as one lake.  Upper and Lower Ojibway have a combined area of 292 acres and a maximum depth of 34 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of Lower Ojibway.  Ojibway has excellent water quality and clarity, and supports good populations of bass, panfish, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ojibway is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Big and Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets.Ojibway supports a healthy largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the second time and moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled when compared to other area lakes (59.6 bass/hour).  The number of bass sampled over 16.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Ojibway. Ojibway has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  The panfish population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size.  Good numbers of bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range and crappie in the 8-9 inch size range were sampled.  Bluegill and black crappie growth rates were slow when compared to other class 25 lakes.Northern pike are abundant in Ojibway.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 19.1 pike/gillnet was well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  The northern pike population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size, dominated by \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.0 inches and 2.4 pounds, with pike measured up to 33.9 inches.  The northern pike population in Ojibway is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of yellow perch, black bullhead, and golden shiners.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake (also known as Upper and Lower Dead Lake) is composed of two basins connected by a narrow channel, with a total acreage of 292 acres.  Ojibway Lake is located five miles north of Dorset in Hubbard County.Ojibway Lake has been known for having an abundant northern pike population, and the 1995 survey showed no difference, with a gillnet catch of 9.7/net.  The two previous surveys had higher gillnet catches: 17.3/net in 1990 and 18.0/net in 1987, while the catch was lower in 1962 (4.5/net).  Average size of northern pike was 21.2 inches and 2.2 lbs.  Larger northern pike were present, with 5% of the sample greater than 30.0 inches, and with fish up to 33.3 inches measured.  Ojibway Lake has excellent northern pike spawning areas as reflected by the abundant northern pike population.Walleye were sampled in low numbers (0.5/gillnet).  Walleye were sampled three times in previous surveys: 0.3/gillnet in 1990, 0.1/trapnet in 1984, 0.2/gillnet and 0.2/trapnet in 1962.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.8 to 22.3 inches.  Walleye have not been stocked into Ojibway Lake since 1955.  The small walleye population in Ojibway Lake could be coming from two possible sources: unauthorized stockings from private citizens, or natural reproduction of a remnant population.Bluegill were abundant with a catch of 48.2/trapnet, similar to past surveys.  Size of bluegill was small, with an average length of 6.0 inches and with only 3.5% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill up to 7.3 inches were measured.Standard survey sampling gear (gillnets and trapnets) are usually not effective in evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass populations, but some general inferences can be made.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers (5.1/trapnet) and average size was small (7.6 inches).  Black crappie up to 9.9 inches were sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (1.3/trapnet) with fish measured up to 15.0 inches.  Previous surveys have had similar catches for both species.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (11.8/gillnet).  Previous gillnet catches of yellow perch have been higher, ranging from 41.3/net in 1987 to 113.0/net in 1962.  Yellow perch were small in size, with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Yellow perch are too small in size to be acceptable to anglers.Pumpkinseed were sampled in high numbers with a catch of 11.4/trapnet, similar to previous surveys.  Pumpkinseed were small in size, with an average length of 5.6 inches, and with fish sampled up to 7.8 inches.Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers with a catch of 1.7/gillnet.  Previous surveys have had higher catches: 7.3/gillnet in 1987 and 8.3/gillnet in 1984.White sucker, and golden shiner were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

During very dry seasons this channel is dry and these bays become separate lakes.  The upper or east bay has a maximum depth of 34 feet while the lower bay has a depth of 22 feet.  The shoreline soils are mainly rock, sand, and silt.Species of fish taken in test nets in numbers exceeding the statewide median catch per set were - white sucker, golden shiner, northern pike, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie.Development on the lake at this time includes one resort with three cabins and three boats, four private cabins, and eight boats.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Lake is located in south-central Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  Dead has a surface area of 130 acres and a maximum depth of 34.0 feet.  There is no public access on Dead.  Dead is connected to Ojibway Lake, which lies to the south, by a small channel.  Boating between the two lakes is dependent upon water levels in the lakes.  During the high water period of the late 1990s boating between the two lakes was easy, however during the summer of 2017 the channel was very shallow and boating was limited to small craft, with dragging and push poling in several spots.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of Ojibway.  Dead has excellent water quality and clarity, and supports good populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Dead is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes have the characteristics of hard water, good water clarity, and an irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the area include Bad Axe, West Crooked, Spider, and Third Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Dead to support a healthy Largemouth Bass population in both numbers and size of Bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of Largemouth Bass in the 12 to 16 inch size range and Bass up to 20.4 inches were sampled in the survey.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Dead.  Dead supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  The panfish population in Dead is probably known more for numbers than size of fish.  Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range, and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Northern Pike are abundant in Dead, with the population dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled Northern Pike were an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ojibway.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper and Lower Ojibway Lakes are located in south-central Hubbard County, five miles north of Dorset.  The two lake basins are connected by a small channel that can be navigated with a small boat.  Upper and Lower Ojibway are managed and surveyed as one lake.  Upper and Lower Ojibway have a combined area of 292 acres and a maximum depth of 34 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southwest shore of Lower Ojibway.  Ojibway has excellent water quality and supports good populations of bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ojibway is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Belle Taine, West Crooked, and Spider.Ojibway has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for both black crappie and bluegill.  Good numbers of black crappie were sampled in all types of sampling gear, similar to past surveys.  Sampled black crappie had an average length of 9.0 inches.  Bluegill abundance was down compared to past surveys, however, the numbers sampled are still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The bluegill population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size.  The average length of bluegill was only 6.1 inches, however, enough larger fish are present that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  The bluegill in Ojibway have slow growth rates. Ojibway supports a good largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and catch rates for largemouth bass were high when compared to other area lakes (83 bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 0.9 pounds, with bass measured up to 19.4 inches.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Ojibway.Northern pike are abundant in Ojibway.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 15.6 pike/gillnet is well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  The northern pike population in Ojibway is known more for numbers than size, dominated by \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 33.8 inches.  The northern pike population in Ojibway is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates. Other species sampled included high numbers of  yellow bullhead, moderate numbers of pumpkinseed and yellow perch, and low numbers of white sucker, black bullhead, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
