The 1994 survey sampled walleye in below average numbers, however the low catch may have been influenced by other factors such as weather. The small sample of walleye averaged 15.5 inches, which is comparable with previous surveys.       Northern pike abundance continues to be below average compared to similar lakes. Average size of northern pike in the 1994 survey was 20.7 inches, which is typical of northern pike in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wilson, located approximately 10 miles northeast of Tofte, MN in Lake County, is a 54 acre lake with a maximum depth of 22.0 feet.  The lake is located off of Wilson Lake Road and has a gravel back-down access suitable for small boats and canoes; parking is available for about four vehicles.  Near the access, the lake bottom is covered by boulders, some of which could present a hazard to boat motors.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wilson is surrounded by federal public lands and the undeveloped shoreline is comprised of mixed evergreen and deciduous forest.  A US Forest Service campground nearby at Wilson Lake provides primitive facilities.  Little Wilson is a clear-water lake, with a Secchi disc visible to 8 feet.  This clear water makes angling a challenge during the day; anglers may be more successful by fishing the lake during twilight or at night. <br> \n <br> \nThe game fish population of Little Wilson includes walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.  White suckers and several minnow species are also present.  The majority of the lake substrate is sand, gravel and boulders; aquatic vegetation is fairly rare throughout the lake.  The low productivity of the water, coupled with a lack of soft substrates, probably limit the amount of aquatic vegetation in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wilson is has a decent walleye population with a high abundance of 15 inch fish.  The largest walleye sampled in the 2012 assessment was 22.4 inches (3.4 pounds).  A high portion (nearly 60%) of walleye sampled were from the stocked 2009 year class, and above average growth of these fish suggests they may provide good fishing for the next few years.  Naturally reproduced year classes of walleye are infrequent; therefore fry are stocked into the lake two consecutive years of every four.  The most recent stocking took place in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Little Wilson is low; the past two assessments have caught very few pike.  In 2012, the largest northern pike sampled was 23 inches (3 pounds); the average size was 14 inches (1 pound).  Northern pike spawn over submerged vegetation in boggy or marshy areas of lakes.  However, Little Wilson has very little habitat of that type, and this lack of suitable spawning habitat may be the reason northern pike numbers are so low. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough their populations do not attract much fishing pressure, yellow perch and white sucker abundances are high in Little Wilson.  Small yellow perch are fairly abundant in the lake, their average size is 6 inches (0.1 pounds) and no fish over 8 inches were sampled in 2012.  Even though these small yellow perch are probably not attractive anglers they provide a good prey base for the walleye.  White suckers are very abundant in the lake and can reach up to 20 inches (3 pounds).  Past efforts to reduce white sucker abundance in the 1980's and earlier were unsuccessful, possibly due to the large amount of near-shore, rocky habitat that white suckers thrive  in. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the clear water, quiet isolation, and the abundance of 15 inch walleye in Little Wilson make the lake a good destination for recreational users, especially as a side-stop for those visiting Wilson Lake. <br> \n</p>",

The lake lies in the Superior National Forest and is surrouded by forest land. A public access is maintained by the U.S. Foreset Service. The maximum depth of Little Wilson Lake is 16 feet. There are no inlets and one outlet. Lake shoal soils are mostly gravel and rubble.     At the time of the survey one campsite was present on the lake. Dissolved oxygen was sufficient for fish life at all depths as indicated by gillnet catches. Aquatic vegetation is sparse.     Walleye were the only gamefish taken in nets. Most Walleye were in the 15 inch length frequency interval. Walleye catches were above the local average, in number, but anglers found them small in size. Spawning facilities are rated as \"excellent\" for Walleye and \"fair\" for most other gamefish.     Angling in Little Wilson Lake has been reported as \"good\" for Walleye. The lake is known, however, for its small Walleye.     Note: \"Approximately 75% of the White Sucker population was removed in the spring of 1967.\"           </p>",

The lake is surrounded by federal public lands and the undeveloped shoreline is comprised of mixed forest.  Amenities at the lake include a gravel back-in access for small watercraft with limited parking.   <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the August Special Assessment of Little Wilson Lake was to determine abundance and composition of near-shore species prior to the proposed addition of coarse woody debris by the US Forest Service.  The assessment used trap nets, backpack electrofishing, and seining at four stations throughout the lake as per the protocols outlined in the MN DNR Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) Manual.  Specimens were not vouchered and an IBI score was not calculated, as scoring parameters do not exist for this Lake Class.   <br> \n <br> \nFish species that were sampled have been historically sampled in Little Wilson Lake, Bluntnose Minnow and Walleye were the only fish species known to reside in Little Wilson Lake that were not sampled in this assessment.  However, the gear types used would not usually sample adult Walleye.  Walleye fry (45,000) are stocked into Little Wilson on a schedule of two consecutive years out of every four.  In the most recent Population Assessment of Little Wilson Lake, small yellow perch numbers were higher than usual, but near the median catch for the lake class, the walleye catch was above average with most fish correlating the stocked year classes while the northern pike catch was below average for the lake class, but not an uncommon for Little Wilson Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe specifics of the USFS large woody habitat addition are not known at this time as the project is still in a preliminary phase; therefore it is difficult to speculate what effects additional woody habitat will have the fish community of Little Wilson Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Fingerling stocking may be largely responsible for this as Age III Walleye represented 63% of the catch. This strong year class corresponds with a 1987 stocking. Northern Pike densities continue to remain low as the gillnet catch of 1.0/lift is consistant with previous catches. White Sucker removal during 1986-1988 has reduced the population to very low numbers. It appears the Yellow Perch may have responded to this void as the gillnet catch of 24.0/lift is the highest ever recorded.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wilson Lake is located 11 miles northwest of Schroeder off of United States Forest Service Road 355.  There is a public access with a gravel ramp suitable for small boats on the northeast side of the lake and a parking area large enough to fit a couple vehicles.  The lake has an area of 54 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake is managed primarily as a Walleye fishery with fry stocking occurring two consecutive years out of every four.  A lake survey was conducted the week of July 29th 2019 to assess the effectiveness of Walleye stocking and to provide data to guide future management.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was similar to previous surveys and within the normal range for the lake.  Size structure was good as Walleye averaged 15 inches long and 1.3 pounds with the largest fish weighing about four pounds and measuring nearly 22 inches long.  Fish ranged from age-1 to age-7 with age-3 (average length of 14 inches) and age-6 (average length of 17.5 inches) year classes being the most common.  Most of the Walleye sampled came from years when fry stocking occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was low with only three fish sampled.  These fish ranged in length from 16 to 22.5 inches with the largest fish weighing three pounds.  The Northern Pike population has historically remained low with inconsistent reproduction due to limited spawning habitat.  <br> \n <br> \nAverage numbers of Yellow Perch were sampled in trap nets.  These fish had an average length of 6.5 inches with the largest fish measuring just short of 9 inches.  White Sucker, Blacknose Shiner, Common Shiner, Creek Chub, Golden Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom were also sampled during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wilson Lake supports a good Walleye fishery supplemented by regular fry stocking.  Its small size offers anglers the opportunity to take out small boats on windy days when larger bodies of water like Wilson Lake may be too rough.  The clear water of Little Wilson Lake means that anglers may have better luck under low light conditions.   <br> \n</p>",
