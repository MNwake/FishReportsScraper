                "narrative": "<p>Lower Pauness Lake is a 156 acre, class-10 lake, located approximately 12 miles SE of Crane Lake, MN.  The lake is in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and access is limited to portages from other lakes.  Northern pike gill-net abundance in 2005 was 2.00 fish/lift, which was below the level found in most class-10 lakes.  Number of northern pike per set was similar to what was observed during the previous survey (1983).  Four year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 2-5 years.  Total length ranged from 10.6-23.4 inches and the mean was 18.9.  Growth was slow; total length at age-4 was 19.6 inches, which was well below the area average of 23.7.  The mean weight of northern pike captured was below average for class-10 lakes.    Walleye gill-net abundance was 1.17 fish/lift, which was below most class-10 lakes.  However, abundance in 2005 was higher than observed in 1983 (0.83 fish/lift).  Five year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Total length ranged from 6.9-17.5 inches and the mean was 12.9.  Growth for walleye was below average; total length at age-4 was 11.9 inches, compared to an area mean of of 14.4.  The mean weight of walleye captured was below most class-10 lakes.    Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 3.00 fish/lift, which was slightly above most class-10 lakes.  Abundance has decreased since 1983, when 8.83 fish/lift were captured.  Eight year-classes were present in 2005 and age ranged from 2-9 years.  Total length ranged from 5.0-10.8 inches and the mean was 8.1.  Growth was slightly below the area mean.  The mean weight captured was 0.29 pounds, which was well above what is found in most class-10 lakes.     </p>",
