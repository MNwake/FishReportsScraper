                "narrative": "<p>Shoe Pack Lake is located about 5 miles south east of Side Lake, MN, within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The 41 acre lake has 23 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 22 feet, and almost a mile and half of shoreline.  There is an outlet to Shannon Lake where a beaver dam is frequently present, backing water across the road on the west side of lake.  The water was bog-stained with a Secchi disk transparency of 5.0 feet in 2015.  There is a federally owned access on the north end of the lake.  Northern Pike are the primary management while Bluegill and Black Crappie are secondary management species with maintaining angling opportunities as goals.  The initial management plan was written in 2014 though limited surveys had been conducted with the last being in 1982. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 4.0/gill net, within the expected range, and above the 1982 catch rate (2.7/net).  Lengths ranged from 14.7 to 24.9 inches with an average length of 19.1 inches.  Despite a poor size structure observed in the gill net sample, a 34\" and 37\" pike were sampled in trap nets.  Scale and cleithera analysis identified ages 1-3 and 5 in the sample with growth similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 20.2 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.8/trap net within the expected range and the previous assessment (3.5/trap net).  Lengths ranged from 6.5 to 15.1 inches with an average length of 9.7 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2-7 and 10 present, with growth similar to the statewide average.  Black Crappie averaged 9.7 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 1.8/trap net, below the expected range and the previous assessment (6.2/trap net).  Bluegill ranged in length from 4.9 to 10.4 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches.  Though scale samples were collected, the sample size was too small to draw any meaningful conclusions. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were the only other species sampled. <br> \n</p>",
