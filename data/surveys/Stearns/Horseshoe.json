The average weight of pike (3.2 pounds) increased from the previous survey and exceeded the normal range.  The catch rate of Walleye (2.3/gill net) was identical to the 1985 survey and was within the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch were sampled within the expected range for similar lakes and were similar to previous surveys. Bluegill were sampled in numbers and weight above the expected range and increased from the 1985 survey. The Black Crappie population decreased from the previous survey catch but remained above the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead and Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, and White Sucker.  All of these species with the exception of Black Bullhead and Shorthead Redhorse were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The fishery of the SRCL Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Channel Catfish, although it is also a popular destination for panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike anglers. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the two largest basins in the SRCL comprising 50% of the total acreage of the Chain. The lakes are managed for Walleye and prior to 2001 were sustained by fingerling stocking. <br> \nSince 2001 the lakes have been stocked with Walleye fry every other year. Following each stocking, fingerlings are recovered during fall electrofishing to get an idea of fry survival. In 2015, a high catch rate of age-1 Walleyes was observed. Considering there is no record of either state or private stocking in 2014 these yearling Walleye are apparently from natural reproduction which has not been found in significant numbers since bi-annual fall electrofishing began in 2001. <br> \nStarting in 2015, Annual fall electrofishing will be conducted to try and determine the extent of natural reproduction in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes during both stocked and non-stocked years. In 2016, a fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction during a non-stocked year. <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye after fry stocking on Horseshoe Lake from 2001-2015 was 143.8/hour. In 2016, the catch rate of YOY Walleye (95.4/hour) indicated good natural reproduction and fry survival. Fingerlings ranged in length from 5.8 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye after fry stocking on Cedar Island Lake from 2001-2015 was 108/hour. In 2016, the catch rate of YOY Walleye (127.3/hour) indicated good natural reproduction and fry survival. Fingerlings ranged in length from 6.2 to 9.0 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Horseshoe (69.6/hour) and Cedar Island (71.3/hour) Lakes were higher than previous surveys. Age-1 and greater Walleye in Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 8.8 to 20.4 with an average length of 13.1 inches and in Cedar Island Lake ranged in length from 9.6 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 12.1 inches. <br> \n</p>",

The chain is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery has been managed by stocking fry biennially at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre. This has been augmented by hatchery surplus fry and fry bought by the lake association. Strong natural reproduction has been documented for year classes from 2014, 2016, and 2018 in both Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lake. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess fry survival from both stocked and non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye fry were stocked in 2018; however a young-of-the-year (YOY) assessment was conducted on October 17, 2018. YOY catch rates were 76.9/hr (on time) for Cedar Island and 202.8/hr for Horseshoe Lake. YOY Walleye ranged in length from 5.1 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. The YOY catches in 2018 (non-stocked year) were higher than in 2017 (stocked year). The average YOY catch for stocked years is 106/hr for Cedar Island and 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake. A lake survey conducted in 2018 found good numbers of Walleye in Cedar Island (5.1/gill net) and Horseshoe Lake (4.4/gill net). Ageing data showed that the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes represented 52% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBecause natural reproduction is occurring in the SRCL, the contribution of stocked fry is unknown. This could be assessed by marking all stocked fry, although annual fall electrofishing should provide a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye as well. Stocking could be reduced or modified if natural reproduction is consistently strong. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins in the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre, supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Annual fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye was initiated in 2015 and documented strong natural reproduction in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 7, 2021. YOY catch rates were 44.4/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 26.6/hr for Cedar Island Lake. YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 6.2 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. YOY catches in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (all non stocked years) were higher than in 2021. However, YOY catches in 2021 were similar to 2017 (the last stocked year). The average YOY catch during stocked years was 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake and 106/hr for Cedar Island Lake. The average fingerling catch rate for non-stocked years was 109/hr for Horseshoe and 84/hr for Cedar Island.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Cedar Island (64.1/hour) and Horseshoe (166.0/hour) lakes were higher than previous surveys. Age-1 and greater Walleye in Cedar Island Lake ranged in length from 9.5 to 28.4 inches with an average length of 14.6 inches while in Horseshoe Lake they ranged in length from 8.4 to 24.3 with an average length of 13.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA gill net survey conducted in 2021 found all time record numbers of Walleye in Horseshoe (4.7/gill net) and Cedar Island (6.3/gill net) lakes. Ageing data showed that the naturally produced year classes represented 89% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall electrofishing since 2015 has provided a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye in the SRCL. Record high gill net catches in 2021 combined with the fact that 89% of the sampled Walleye were from non-stocked years, presents a strong case that Walleye stocking is not necessary in the SRCL. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake supports a diverse fishery that is very popular with anglers.   Overall, since the last netting it appears that channel catfish and smallmouth bass increased in abundance and bullheads have decreased.  The catch of bluegill was down and that of northern pike was up but this may be weather related.Important species caught in gill nets were northern pike, walleye, channel catfish and yellow perch.  The catch of northern pike and walleye was within the range of expected values for lake class 25; and the catch of yellow perch was above the third quartile value. Northern pike were captured at a rate of 6.4/gill net which was similar to the last three nettings (since 1980).  Northerns ranged in size from 9-35 inches.  The fish averaged 22.6 inches and 2.8 pounds, a size which should be very acceptable to anglers.  Channel catfish were abundant and taken at a rate of 16.0/gill net, a significant increase since 1990 (0.6/lift).  Channel catfish ranged in size from 11-27 inches and averaged 15 inches and 1.2 pounds.The catch of walleye was 4.9/gill net which was a significant increase since 1990 (2.29/lift).  Walleye ranged in size from 11.4 to 29.1 inches and averaged 16.6 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleye have been stocked every other in Horseshoe Lake though the catch includes walleyes for years in which there was no stocking.A total of 16 species were captured in trap nets.  Important sportfish species taken were bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill were captured at a rate of 2.2/trap net which was below the first quartile value.  This was an apparent decline since 1990 when the catch was 44.4/lift.Black crappie have been abundant historically and the catch of 16.5/trap net was five times the third quartile value.  Black crappie averaged 7.1 inches and 0.2 lbs.Black bullheads were not taken during this survey.  The catch of bullheads has been declining and the commercial fishermen has noted this also.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is located near Richmond, in south-central Stearns County.  This 550-acre lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, which was formed by the construction of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring.  The chain is very popular for angling and other forms of recreation.The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point sources (agricultural run-off) continue to be a concern, some major contributors or nutrients (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced by 1991.  Efforts are being made to address existing sources, but water quality in most of the lakes remains in the hypereutrophic range.The fishery of Horseshoe Lake is managed for walleye and northern pike, although panfish, bass, and channel catfish are also popular with many anglers.  Walleye management relied on fingerling stocking in the 1980's and 1990's.  In 2001, walleye fry were stocked in an attempt to increase the population, with very positive results.  Netting in 2003 produced catch rates that were near the median for lakes similar to Horseshoe, but lower than the management goal. It is expected that with continued success of fry stocking, this goal can be reached.  The 2001 year class was well represented in the catch, especially from fall electrofishing.  Many age 5-8 individuals were also sampled.  Mean weight (1.3 pounds) was lower than the previous survey, and reflects the large number of walleye from 2001.  Some natural reproduction may occur within the chain or in the Sauk River, but it does not appear to be a significant contribution to the walleye population.The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was low compared to lakes similar to Horseshoe, but average size was relatively high (3.0 pounds).  Lower densities of northern pike typically allow for faster growth rates, and higher survival of walleye.Yellow perch abundance appeared low in 2003 for Horseshoe Lake as well as the other lakes in the Sauk River chain.Bass were sampled by electrofishing in mid-May.  Taken together, the catches of smallmouth and largemouth bass were slightly less than the average for lakes in this part of the state.  Previous surveys did not include electrofishing, but angling tournament data has shown the presence of trophy-size fish.Black crappie catch rates have declined in each survey since 1980, although the crappie fishery remains very popular.  By weight, black crappie accounted for more of the fish harvested on the chain in 1999 (open water season) than any other species.  Mean weight of crappie sampled in 2003 (0.37 pounds) was above the average for lakes similar to Horseshoe, and higher than in recent surveys.  The catch rate of bluegill in 2003 low, but average size (0.30 pounds) was high.  Mean weight was higher than reported in previous surveys, and most of the individuals sampled in 2003 were 7-8 inches in length.  Channel catfish were introduced to Horseshoe Lake in the 1980's, and first sampled by survey nets in 1985.  Catch rates and average weight has been variable since then.  The catfish sampled in 2003 were mostly 18-21 inches.Other species sampled included white sucker, redhorse, and bullhead.</p>",

A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water. The fishery of the SRCL Lake is managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and channel catfish, although it is also a popular destination for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike anglers.  Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the two largest basins in the SRCL comprising 50% of the total acreage of the Chain.  The lakes are managed for Walleye and prior to 2001 were sustained by fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2001 the lakes have been stocked with Walleye fry every other year.  Following each stocking, fingerlings are recovered during fall electrofishing to get an idea of fry survival. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye on Horseshoe Lake from 2001 2015 was 143.8/hour.  In 2015, the catch was 54.7/hour, the lowest recorded since 2003.  Walleye fingerlings in Horseshoe ranged in length from 5.8 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch of YOY Walleye on Cedar Island Lake from 2001 2015 was 108/hour.  In 2015, the catch was 82.2/hour, the lowest recorded on Cedar Island since 2007.  Walleye fingerlings in Cedar Island ranged in length from 5.6 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough fingerling catch rates were down in both lakes from previous years, yearling (age 1) Walleye catch rates were significant on Cedar Island (57.4/hour) and Horseshoe (116.7/hour) Lakes.  Yearling Walleyes on Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 8.1 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Considering there is no record of either state or private stocking in 2014 these yearling Walleye are apparently from natural reproduction which has not been found in significant numbers since bi annual fall electrofishing began in 2001.   <br> \n <br> \nNative strains have the potential to survive better in a given watershed or region than non-native strains.  In an attempt to determine if these naturally reproduced Walleye are a separate genetic strain from the Mississippi River strain which have been stocked by the DNR in the past, scale samples from these yearlings were sent to the University of Minnesota for genetic analysis.  Annual fall electrofishing will be conducted for the next five years to try and determine the extent of natural reproduction in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes during both stocked and non stocked years. <br> \n</p>",

In order to collect additional pre regulation data, a targeted panfish assessment was conducted on Horseshoe Lake from May 19-21, 2021. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 276 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from four to 10 inches with an average length of eight inches. Ninety-eight percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six inches and 42% were longer than eight inches. These results are excellent for both fish greater than six inches and eight inches. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found these values to have ranged from 26 to 98 percent over six inches and from 0 to 54 percent over eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred twenty-eight Black Crappie were also caught in the survey; lengths ranged from six to 12 inches with an average length of nine inches. For Horseshoe Lake, all crappies sampled were eight inches or longer while 26% were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to 8 years to reach 8 inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",

Growth rates were generally good with fast growth the second and third year. Northern Pike numbers remained above the state median and natural reproduction was evident. Bluegill numbers were over three times the state median and growth rates were good. One third of the Bluegill sampled were 7 inches or longer. Black Crappie numbers were almost 22 times the statewide median and growth rates were still good. One third of the Black Crappies sampled were 8.5 inches or longer. Young of the year Bluegill and crappie numbers were very high in natural reproduction seining checks. Largemouth Bass reproduction was evident in 7 of 8 seine hauls.\n\nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Golden Shiner hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  All of these species with the exception of Shorthead Redhorse were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes. \n</p>",

Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except for one site where downed trees and heavy vegetation prevented seining. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish, including three species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Logperch, Smallmouth Bass and Iowa Darter).  Nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from the 2018 summer survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score for Horseshoe Lake was 48.2 which is above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 45) for aquatic life using Tool 2 (deep). <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Horseshoe Lake is located in the Sauk River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The SRCL is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery has been managed by stocking fry biennially at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre. This has been augmented by hatchery surplus fry and fry bought by the lake association. Strong natural reproduction has been documented for year classes from 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2019 in both Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lake. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess fry survival during both stocked and non stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye fry were stocked in 2019; and a young of the year (YOY) assessment was conducted on October 17, 2019. YOY catch rates were 104.2/hr (on time) for Cedar Island and 125.2/hr for Horseshoe Lake. YOY Walleye across survey ranged in length from 4.6 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches. The YOY catches in 2019 and 2018 (both non stocked years) were higher than in 2017 (stocked year). The average YOY catch for stocked years is 106/hr for Cedar Island and 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake. A lake survey conducted in 2018 found good numbers of Walleye in Cedar Island (5.1/gill net) and Horseshoe Lake (4.4/gill net). Ageing data showed that the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes represented 52% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBecause natural reproduction is occurring in the SRCL, the contribution of stocked fry is unknown. This could be assessed by marking all stocked fry, although annual fall electrofishing should provide a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye as well. Stocking could be reduced or modified if natural reproduction is consistently strong. <br> \n</p>",

The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins within the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre, supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Annual fall electrofishing for young of year (YOY) Walleye was initiated in 2015 and documented adequate natural reproduction to sustain the fishery in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes since then. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 10, 2022. YOY catch rates were 68.9/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 33.8/hr for Cedar Island Lake which is an increase from 2021 (44.4/hr and 26.6/hr, respectively). YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 4.7 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Horseshoe (33.3/hr) and Cedar Island (31.8/hr) lakes were lower than 2021 (166.0/hr and 64.1/hr, respectively). Age-1 and greater Walleye in Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 9.3 to 20.7 with an average length of 14.9 inches while in Cedar Island Lake they ranged in length from 12.1 to 28.5 inches with an average length of 16.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall electrofishing since 2015 has provided a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye in the SRCL. Record high gill net catches in 2021 combined with the fact that 89% of the sampled Walleye were from non-stocked years, presents a strong case that Walleye stocking is not necessary in the SRCL at this time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in Stearns County near the city of Richmond. The chain is the result of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring, which created numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins, totaling over 1,500 acres. The Walleye fishery was sustained by fingerling stocking prior to 2001. Since then, Walleye fry have been stocked biennially at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre, supplemented by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Fry survival has been assessed by fall night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nSubstantial natural reproduction was documented in 2014 and 2016. Fall electrofishing is now being conducted annually to assess the frequency and magnitude of natural reproduction in the chain of lakes. It is unknown whether reproduction is occurring in the lakes or in the Sauk River upstream. <br> \n <br> \nThe current assessment was conducted on the night of October 3, 2017 following fry stocking in May. The Young of the Year (YOY) catch rates were 24.5/hour (on time) for Cedar Island and 30.0/hour for Horseshoe Lake. Combined lengths ranged from 5.6 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 6.8 inches. YOY Catches in 2016 without stocking were much higher (Cedar Island 127/hr, Horseshoe 95/hr). The average catch of YOY Walleye from 2001 to 2015 after fry stocking was 108/hr for Cedar Island and 144/hr for Horseshoe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in the most recent lake survey (2011) were 4.1/gill net for Cedar Island and 3.3/gill net for Horseshoe Lake, near the management goal of 4 6/gill net. A creel survey in 2015 showed that Walleye harvest and angler pressure were modest. Relatively high fry survival has so far not resulted in corresponding net catches. A standard lake survey is scheduled for the summer of 2018. This will provide a current assessment of Walleye recruitment to the fishery, particularly whether high catches of fall fingerlings translates into fish available to anglers. The current fry stocking regime has been successful in producing fall fingerlings and will be continued for now, but stocking could be reduced if natural reproduction is found to be sufficiently robust. <br> \n <br> \n\tCedar Island\tHorseshoe <br> \nYear\tN fry stocked\tN YOY/hr\tN fry stocked\tN YOY/hr <br> \n2001\t755,000\t\t  170\t\t 280,000\t  282 <br> \n2003\t755,000\t\t    39\t\t 275,000\t      7  <br> \n2005\t758,000\t\t  102\t\t 275,000\t  138 <br> \n2007\t755,000\t\t    28\t\t 275,000\t    85 <br> \n2009\t755,000\t\t  134\t\t 275,000\t  189 <br> \n2011\t755,000\t\t  201\t\t 275,000\t   NA <br> \n2013\t1,355,000\t  170\t\t 675,000\t  258 <br> \n2015\t1,175,000\t    82\t\t 425,000\t    55 <br> \n2016\t\t0\t  128\t\t\t0\t    97 <br> \n2017\t1,505,000\t    25\t\t 275,000\t    30 <br> \n</p>",

It is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL), formed by a dam in Cold Spring. The watershed is large and the primary land uses are cultivated crops and pasture. The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the Sauk River Chain of Lakes. The resulting nutrient load continues to be a concern within the watershed; however, strides have been made to greatly reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous entering the system. Even with the improvements most of the lakes within the SRCL still experience low water clarity and nuisance algal blooms. A public access is located on the Sauk River one-half mile upstream from the lake. A targeted survey using only gill nets was conducted in 2021 to update fisheries data last collected in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are plentiful throughout the chain and can provide an excellent fishing opportunity. Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2017 as it was discovered that the Walleye population could be sustained through natural reproduction. The Walleye sampled ranged in length from 9 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.5 pounds. Fifty-six percent of the Walleye sampled were longer than 15 inches and 15% were longer than 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake supports a quality Bluegill fishery and starting in 2021 in an effort to protect this quality fishery a reduced daily bag limit on sunfish was put in place. The bag limit reduction was part of a larger statewide effort known as the Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI) which serves to protect and enhance quality sunfish fisheries throughout the state. As part of this initiative the daily bag limit for sunfish was reduced from 20 to 10. Trap net sampling was not conducted during this survey, but a targeted Bluegill survey conducted during the spring collected 276 Bluegills that ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches with an average length of 8 inches. Forty-seven percent of the sample were longer than 8 inches and 3% were longer than 9 inches. Black Crappie numbers are also good and crappie sampled ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches. Twenty percent of the crappie sampled were longer than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake was designated for Muskellunge management in 2011 and is stocked with 515 fingerlings every other year. Sampling gear used in this survey is not very effective at capturing Muskellunge, and none have been sampled to date in Horseshoe Lake. However, anecdotal conversations with anglers indicate that a few have been caught. The first Muskellunge population assessment is tentatively scheduled for 2025. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of Northern Pike has decreased since the last survey and the lower numbers could allow them to achieve a larger size over time. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help produce a larger size structure. Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 17 to 35 inches and averaged 23 inches and 3 pounds. Nineteen percent of pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 6% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were stocked into the SRCL from 1976 to 1988 to help control abundant bullhead and crappie populations and has since turned into another angling opportunity. Many large catfish are present in Horseshoe Lake as well as in the rest of the chain of lakes. Catfish sampled ranged in length from 10 to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 21 inches and 3 pounds. <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been low since the early 2000's. Only nine perch were sampled and ranged in length from 6 to 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Golden Redhorse, River Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. In 2018, zebra mussels were identified in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes and in 2021 Eurasian watermilfoil was identified in Horseshoe Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Sauk Rapids Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 550 acre lake located near Richmond, in south-central Stearns County.  Horseshoe Lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL), which was formed by the dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring.  The fishery of Horseshoe Lake is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish, although it is also a popular destination for largemouth bass, northern pike and panfish anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the SRCL.  The Sauk River watershed including the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south encompasses nearly 700,000 acres.  Non-point source pollution continues to be a concern within the watershed; however, strides have been made to greatly reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous entering the system.  Even with these improvements most of the lakes within the SRCL are still classified as hyper-eutrophic. <br> \n  <br> \nIn 2010, as part of the Long Range Muskie and Northern Pike Management Plan the MNDNR proposed stocking five new lakes with muskellunge.  There was concern about the proposed muskellunge stocking in the SRCL (Cedar Island and Horseshoe lakes) by local residents and lakeshore owners.  Their primary concerns were increased boat traffic, lack of public access facilities, and predation by muskies on other sportfish.  However, the SRCL was one of two proposals that were approved for muskellunge management.  The 2011 assessment was conducted to update data on the fishery before muskellunge stocking.  One thousand-forty-two muskellunge fingerlings were stocked into Cedar Island and Horseshoe lakes (521 fingerlings each) in October 2011. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 1980s and 90s walleye management consisted of walleye fingerling stocking every other year.  Since 2001, walleye fry have been stocked every other spring in an attempt to increase the walleye population with very good success (average: 128 young-of-the-year (yoy)/hr during fall electrofishing from 2001 - 2009).  Some natural reproduction may occur within the SRCL, but does not contribute significantly to the walleye population.  In 2011, the walleye catch (3.3/net) was above average for class 25 lakes and the second highest since 1980.  Walleye ranged in length from 10 \u0013 21 inches and averaged 14.3 inches and one pound, similar to 2003 (14.7 inches and 1.3 pounds).  Thirty-seven percent of the walleye sampled were larger than 15 inches and 3% were larger than 20 inches.  The largest walleye sampled was 21 inches and three pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance remains low (1.4/net), but above average in size.  Forty-six percent of the northern pike sampled were longer than 24 inches, but none were longer than 30 inches.  Northern pike sampled ranged in length from 20 \u0013 29 inches and averaged 24 inches and 2.8 pounds.  The largest northern pike was 29.1 inches and 5.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were stocked into Horseshoe Lake from 1976 \u0013 1988 and have become abundant.  Channel catfish were originally stocked to provide anglers with another angling opportunity as well as to control the bullhead population.  By 1990, they had become plentiful and appeared to have displaced the bullhead species within the system.  Angler complaints about the catfish abundance still persist today, although many anglers travel to the SRCL to fish for catfish.  In 2011, the channel catfish catch (26.2/net) was the highest on record.  Channel catfish sampled ranged from 11 \u0013 28 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The largest catfish sampled was 27.8 inches and 7.7 pounds.  Anglers will find many catfish in the 14 \u0013 17 inch size range as these fish made up 70% of the total catfish catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance (0.9/net) was below expected values for the second consecutive survey and lowest on record.  Yellow perch abundance had been near or above expected values for all previous surveys except the last two (2003 and 2011).  Yellow perch sampled ranged from 5 \u0013 8 inches and averaged about 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth black crappie (2.4/net) and bluegill (6.3/net) net catches have been decreasing over time, but the average size has increased.  Forty-seven percent of the black crappies sampled were longer than nine inches and 43% of the bluegills sampled were longer than seven inches.  The largest black crappie was 12 inches and one pound and the largest bluegill was 9.3 inches and 0.6 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: black bullhead, common carp, greater redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 550 acre lake located near Richmond, in south central Stearns County. The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL). The Sauk River watershed encompasses nearly 600,000 acres. The resulting nutrient load continues to be a concern within the watershed. Most of the lakes within the SRCL are still classified as hyper eutrophic and experience low water clarity and nuisance algal blooms. In 2018, all of the lakes within the SRCL were surveyed with netting on Horseshoe Lake occurring in early August. In addition to the standard survey, a targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted in Late May and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in early July. Those results will be summarized in different reports. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation was mapped in August and covered 2.5% of the lake and 14% of the shoreline. The primary species found were cattail and white waterlily.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Horseshoe Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge. During the 1980s and 90s walleye management consisted of fingerling stocking every other year. Since 2001, Walleye fry have been stocked in the spring every other year with very good success. In 2015, fall electrofishing observed yearling Walleye that were produced during a non-stocked year. While it was always thought that natural reproduction occurred in the SRCL this was the first real strong year class documented. Starting in 2015, annual fall electrofishing was implemented to try and determine the extent of natural reproduction in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes. In 2016 and 2018, fall electrofishing was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction during these non stocked years. Excellent catch rates were observed in both 2016 and 2018 indicating good natural reproduction and fry survival in those years. In 2018, the Walleye catch rate was 4.4/gill net, above average and second highest since 1980. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 9 to 23 inches and averaged 16 inches and 1.5 pounds. Fifty-two percent of the Walleye sampled in the Sauk River chain were from the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake was designated for Muskellunge management in 2011 and is stocked with 515 fingerling Muskellunge every other year. While no Muskellunge have been sampled to date in Horseshoe Lake anecdotal conversations with anglers indicate that anglers have caught a few. The first Muskellunge population assessment is tentatively scheduled for 2025. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2018 was average for lakes similar to Horseshoe and the highest ever recorded. Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 17 to 35 inches and averaged 23 inches and 2.8 pounds. Thirty-four percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass were sampled during night electrofishing on May 22, 2018. A total of 69 Largemouth Bass and 65 Smallmouth Bass were captured for a catch rate that was less than the area average. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7 to 21 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 7 to 20 inches with an average length of 14 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were stocked into the SRCL from 1976   1988 to provide anglers with another angling opportunity as well as to help control abundant bullhead and crappie populations. In 2018, the Channel Catfish catch was similar to the previous survey and the highest recorded. Channel Catfish sampled ranged from 11 to 30 inches and averaged 21 inches and 2.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, Yellow perch abundance was below the expected range for the third consecutive survey. Yellow perch sampled ranged in length from 6 to 10 inches and averaged 8 inches. The trap net catch of Black crappie in 2018 was within the expected range for lakes similar to Horseshoe. Black crappie sampled ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged 9 inches. Forty percent of the crappie sampled were longer than ten inches. The Bluegill catch in 2018 was the highest since 1990 and within the expected range. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches and averaged 6 inches. A targeted Bluegill survey conducted in late May collected 396 Bluegill that ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches with an average length of 7 inches. Eighty-eight percent of the Bluegill sampled during this survey were longer than six inches and 10% were longer than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, River Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins within the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years , supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association. Annual fall electrofishing for young of year (YOY) Walleye was initiated in 2015 and documented adequate natural reproduction to sustain the fishery in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 10, 2023. YOY catch rates were 30.1/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 43.2/hr for Cedar Island Lake which is a decrease from 2022 (68.9/hr) in Horseshoe but an increase from 2022 (33.8/hr.) in Cedar Island. YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 4.5 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rates of Walleye greater than age-1 on Horseshoe (88.7/hr) and Cedar Island (38.7/hr) lakes were higher than 2022 (33.3/hr and 31.8/hr, respectively). Age-1 and older Walleye in Horseshoe Lake ranged in length from 8.1 to 24.9 with an average length of 13.3 inches while in Cedar Island Lake they ranged in length from 9.2 to 27.6 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall electrofishing since 2015 has provided a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye in the SRCL. Record high gill net catches in 2021 combined with the fact that 89% of the sampled Walleye were from non-stocked years, presents a strong case that Walleye stocking is not necessary in the SRCL at this time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Horseshoe Lake during the week of August 26, 2019 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) program staff. Sampling methods targeted nearshore, small-bodied fish and included seining and backpack electrofishing. Fourteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations and soft substrates and dense emergent vegetation prevented the use of seines at two sites. Nearshore sampling captured 27 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish).  The high species diversity is likely driven by the riverine nature of portions of Horseshoe Lake and the connection to a chain of lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill net and trap net survey from August 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Horseshoe Lake is in good health as indicated by a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL) is located in Stearns County near the city of Richmond. The chain is comprised of numerous, connected waterbodies totaling over 3,200 acres. Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes are the largest basins in the chain and total over 1,500 acres. Prior to 2001, the Walleye fishery had been sustained through fingerling stocking. Since then, the Walleye population has been sustained through natural reproduction and fry stocking during odd numbered years at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral acre, supplemented along the way by surplus hatchery fry and fry stocked by the lake association.  Annual fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye was started in 2015 and documented strong natural reproduction in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 in both Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes. Due to the strong natural reproduction, no Walleye stocking has occurred since 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY electrofishing was conducted on October 5, 2020. YOY catch rates were 76.2/hr (on time) for Horseshoe and 82.0/hr for Cedar Island Lake. YOY Walleye across surveys ranged in length from 5.8 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches. YOY catches in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (all non stocked years) were higher than in 2017 (stocked year). The average YOY catch during stocked years was 131/hr for Horseshoe Lake and 106/hr for Cedar Island Lake. The average fingerling catch rate for non-stocked years was 128/hr for Horseshoe and 88/hr for Cedar Island.  <br> \n <br> \nA lake survey conducted in 2018 found good numbers of Walleye in Horseshoe (4.4/gill net) and Cedar Island (5.1/gill net) lakes. Ageing data showed that the naturally produced 2014 and 2016 year classes represented 52% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBecause natural reproduction is occurring in the SRCL, the contribution of stocked fry is unknown. This could be assessed by marking all stocked fry, although annual fall electrofishing should provide a measure of year class strength for naturally reproduced Walleye as well. Stocking could be reduced or modified if natural reproduction is consistently strong. <br> \n</p>",
