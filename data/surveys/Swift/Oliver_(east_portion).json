                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into an east basin (455 acres) and west basin (212 acres) by Swift County Highway 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.  This survey was conducted in East Oliver Lake to collect routine fish data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from East Oliver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were first caught in gill nets in 2013 and they likely resulted from an unauthorized stocking around 2010.  Smallmouth Bass have since established a large population.  Excellent habitat is present for Smallmouth Bass and their numbers are expected to remain high.  Bass fishing has been very good with some fish exceeding 20 inches.  Smallmouth Bass lakes are rare in southwest Minnesota and East Oliver Lake provides a unique angling opportunity.   <br> \n <br> \nEast Oliver Lake has been a moderately good Walleye fishery for the last several years.  In 2022, Walleye ranged from 8 to 27 inches, averaging 20 inches.  The Walleye population has primarily resulted from fry stocking and natural reproduction, with smaller contributions from stocked fingerlings, yearlings and adults.  East Oliver Lake warms slowly during spring because it is 30 feet deep, and the Walleye bite usually doesn't occur until June. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, Black Crappies and Bluegills were present in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is split into an east basin (455 acres) and west basin (212 acres) by Swift County Highway 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.  This 2019 survey was conducted in East Oliver Lake to collect routine fish data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from East Oliver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nEast Oliver Lake has been a good Walleye fishery for many years.  Walleye from a wide range of sizes were present during 2019.  The Walleye population has primarily resulted from fry stocking and natural reproduction, with lesser contributions by fingerling, yearling and adult stockings.  East Oliver Lake warms slowly during spring due to its depth, and the Walleye bite usually doesn't occur until June. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were first caught in gill nets in 2013 and they likely resulted from an unauthorized stocking around 2010.  Smallmouth Bass have flourished and anglers have reported catching fish over 20 inches.  Some anglers have appreciated the additional angling opportunity provided by the bass, however other anglers have expressed concerns that the bass have negatively impacted Walleye fishing.  Excellent habitat is present for Smallmouth Bass and their numbers are expected to remain high. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were present in moderate numbers with fish measuring up to 10 inches.  Low numbers of Bluegills and crappies were present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into east and west basins by Swift County Highway 5.  Connectivity is limited to one 36-inch culvert that is completely submersed under the highway.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction has generally been poor in both basins and stocking has been necessary to maintain the populations.  The walleye stocking plan for West Oliver is 100,000 fry three of four years.  Walleye fry stocked in 2021 and 2022 were from the Southern Minnesota strain.  This strain is showing some potential to provide self-sustaining populations in many southern Minnesota lakes.  No walleyes were stocked in 2023.    <br> \n <br> \nThis night electrofishing targeted survey was conducted on 8/29 to evaluate the abundance of young-of-year walleyes (YWAE) in the east basin.  In three stations, 72 YWAE/hr were caught, which was the highest rate found in a non-stocked year in East Oliver.  The 2023 walleyes averaged 6.2 inches and were in good condition.  Yearling walleyes were also abundant (104/hr) and they were approximately 10 inches. </p>",
