The average size of brook trout caught ranked in the middle of the historical range for this lake, but exceeded the average size observed in most assessments of area stream trout lakes.  The relatively large average size occurred because most brook trout were three years old, and few were two years old.  Normally a population includes more younger fish than older fish, but, apparently, and for some unknown reason, brook trout stocked in 2002 survived in greater numbers than did those stocked in 2003.  The growth rate of brook trout roughly equaled the average for the area.The golden shiner catch was the highest observed from the lake, and was unusually high for the lake class.  Most of those caught were too large to serve as prey for the brook trout.</p>",
