                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is a 1775-acre lake with a maximum depth of 93 feet, and is located 8 miles south of the city of Cass Lake along State Highway 371. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Steamboat Lake is in lake class 22.  Lakes in this class are generally very large, clear, and very deep.  About 30 percent of the lake is 15 feet or less deep.  The water clarity in Steamboat Lake was 11 feet in July 2000, which is similar to other lakes in this part of Minnesota.  An earthen MN DNR-administered public access is present on the east shore of the lake, and a new MN DNR access is being developed on the east shore.  Steamboat Lake is also accessible by boat from Leech Lake.  Steamboat Lake is partly within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.Steamboat Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Walleye abundance measured by MN DNR test nets during 1997 and 2000 sampling was less than earlier surveys, and slightly lower than other lakes in this class.  Most of the walleye found in the 2000 survey were from natural reproduction, however marked walleye fingerlings stocked by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Department of Resource Management (LLBO-DRM) have also contributed to the walleye population.  Due to the recent apparent decline in walleye abundance, MN DNR Fisheries plans to resume stocking of walleye fry (newly-hatched fish).  Walleye as long as 30 inches were sampled in MN DNR test nets, though the average size walleye was about 13 inches.      Northern pike abundance is similar to that found in other lake class 22 waters, and is similar to previous surveys. Though fish up to 38 inches were found, most of the northern pike sampled were 21 to 24 inches long.  The number of bluegill sampled in MN DNR test nets has been increasing since 1990, though bluegill are less abundant than in most lakes in this class. Bluegill in Steamboat Lake have a good average size and tend to grow faster than in most other lakes of this type.  Pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass in Steamboat Lake can also provide action for panfish anglers.  Yellow perch are abundant in Steamboat Lake.  Yellow perch up to 10 inches were sampled, though the average length was 6 inches.  Perch and cisco (tullibee) provide good food sources for walleye and northern pike in Steamboat Lake.  Numbers of black crappie and largemouth bass captured in MN DNR test nets were low, however these species are not readily caught during summer sampling.    Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Steamboat Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.The number of homes on Steamboat Lake increased from 29 in 1971 to 100 in 1997.  Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through MN DNR Fisheries offices.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is a 1775-acre lake located near Cass Lake, MN that has 8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 93 feet.  There is a DNR owned public access on the northeast shore just off of Highway 371.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Steamboat Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye and secondarily for tullibee (cisco), muskellunge, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.Northern pike numbers have been consistent with previous surveys and other Lake Class 22 lakes.  Fish up to 37 inches were sampled with an average length of 23 inches.  The possibility is high to catch some trophy northern pike in Steamboat Lake.  Walleyes have increased from the previous survey.  The 2001 year-class was dominant in DNR test nets, which will provide some fishing opportunities in the future.  The mean length for walleye was 14 inches and fish up to 26 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch were abundant in 2003 sampling.  Though most were small (mean length 6 inches) a small percentage of 8- to 12-inch yellow perch were found.  Bluegill sampled in the 2003 assessment were numerous but small (mean length of 4 inches).  A small number of bluegill from 6 to 8 inches were present.  Most pumpkinseed sunfish were small; however, fish in the 6 to 7 inch range are available to anglers.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, lake whitefish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Steamboat Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is a 1775-acre lake located near Cass Lake, MN that has 8.24 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 93 feet.  There is a DNR-owned public access on the northeast shore just off Highway 371.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Steamboat Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 gill net catch rate of northern pike in Steamboat Lake was near the median for lakes of similar qualities and consistent with the past three surveys.  The mean length of fish sampled was 24 inches, and fish up to 33 inches were sampled and the size structure has been consistent.  Walleye are present in Steamboat Lake and their numbers have been increasing during the last three surveys.  The mean length of fish sampled was 15 inches, and fish up to 25 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch, preferred forage for northern pike and walleye, are abundant in Steamboat Lake.  Most yellow perch are on the small side; 89% of the fish were less than 8 inches.  However, fish up to 13 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, cisco, largemouth bass, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Steamboat Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is a 1,755-acre with 8.24 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 93 feet located 11 miles north of Walker, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Steamboat Lake is in lake class 22; lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped. Other area lakes in this class include Little Boy, Ten Mile, Wabedo, and Woman. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Walleye and secondarily for Tullibee (Cisco), Muskellunge, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. Steamboat Lake is designated infested with Zebra Mussels and Rusty Crayfish. <br> \n <br> \nSteamboat lake has an abundant population of Northern Pike (7.9 fish per net) with an average length of 21.5 inches and 2.4 pounds. Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 31 inches. Walleye abundance was below goal at 2.4 fish per net with an average length and weight of 17.55 inches and 1.71 pounds. Walleyes ranged in lengths from 9 to 27 inches, with 39% of Walleyes sampled exceeding 20 inches long. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegills up to 9 inches and Black Crappie over 14 inches were sampled. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. To date, Zebra Mussels and Rusty Crayfish have been identified in Steamboat Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake. The Fish IBI score (FIBI) uses fish community data to measure a lake's health. The types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the http://www.dnr.state.mn.us website.  <br> \n <br> \nAn FIBI score was calculated for Steamboat Lake of 67, which is both above the impairment threshold (45) and the exceptional threshold (64). Data from this survey indicates Steamboat Lake is exceptionally healthy. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is 1775-acre lake with a maximum depth of 93 feet.  It is located seven miles south of Cass Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Steamboat Lake is lake class 22.  Approximately 30% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  There is an earthen public access on the northeast corner of the lake.Steamboat Lake is known for good northern pike and walleye angling.  Largemouth bass are not abundant but can be of quality size.  Panfish, other than yellow perch, are also not abundant but can be of quality size.Walleye abundance was slightly below what was found in the past.  Fish ranged in length from 7 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 14 inches and 1.3 pounds.  There is much evidence that natural reproduction is contributing significantly to the walleye population in Steamboat Lake.  Growth was good with a four-year-old walleye averaging 15 inches long.Northern pike abundance was typical of previous surveys on Steamboat Lake and of other lake class 22 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from nine to 36 inches with an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.7 pounds. There is good natural reproduction with eight different ages present in the sampled fish.  There is ample spawning habitat in both the Necktie and Steamboat Rivers.  Growth was typical of other lake class 22 lakes.  Northern pike were 23 inches at age four.Muskellunge have never been sampled in any survey, however, there have been reliable reports from anglers of sightings of muskellunge in the lake.Yellow perch and cisco are both used as food fish in Steamboat Lake.  Both had abundances that were typical of other class 22 lakes.Bluegill abundance was slightly more than in previous surveys and typical of other lake class 22 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 3.2 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 5.8 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Growth was good compared to other lake class 22 lakes.  At age five, a bluegill averaged 6.9 inches long.Other fish sampled were pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, black crappie, largemouth bass, bowfin, white sucker, burbot, and all three species of bullhead.There has been much development on Steamboat Lake during past 26 years.  The 1971 survey reported 29 lake homes present compared to 100 lake homes in 1997.  There has been much bulrush removal around the lake by lakeshore owners which has impacted habitats for several species of fish at different stages of their life cycles.  A large percentage of Steamboat Lake shoreline is privately owned.  As demand increases for lakeshore lots in the Walker area,increased development of Steamboat Lake shoreline appears very likely.To help maintain quality fish populations in Steamboat Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Steamboat Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fishpopulation and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake is a 1,756-acre lake with 8.24 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 93 feet located northwest of Walker, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the east shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Steamboat Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other area lakes in this class include Little Boy, Ten Mile, and Wabedo. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch. Steamboat Lake is designated infested with Zebra Mussels and Rusty Crayfish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been declining since the 2014 survey and were within management goals in 2021. Lengths ranged from 15 to 34 inches with an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.2 pounds however, length based goals were not met. Walleye abundance has increased from the previous survey in 2018 but is below management goals despite fry stocking during even years and fingerling stocking during odd years from 2009 to 2019. The stocking strategy was recently changed to fry in an attempt to increase recruitment as non-stocked or fry-stocked year classes have generally been stronger than fingerling-stocked year classes. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 28 inches, with an average length and weight of 15 inches and 1.3 pounds. Yellow Perch abundance was below management goals but perch measuring up to 12 inches were sampled. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegills up to 9 inches and Black Crappie over 14 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. To date, Zebra Mussels and Rusty Crayfish have been identified in Steamboat Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THE NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CTACH OF 5.2 IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 1.5 TO 6.8.  SEVERAL FISH OVER 30 INCHES LONG WERE COLLECTED.  THE GROWTH OF NORTHERN PIKE IS FASTER THAN WHAT IS FOUND IN MANY AREA LAKES.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS ADEQUATE. ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEAD WERE COLLECTED FROM STEAMBOAT LAKE.  THEIR CATCH INDICES ARE NO HIGHER THAN MOST AREA LAKES. VERY FEW PUMPKINSEED (1.2/TN) OR BLUEGILL (1.0/TN WERE SMAPLED.  THEIR POPULATIONS DO NOT APPEAR DO BE ABUNDANT.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL IS VERY FAST. FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS OR BLACK CRAPPIE HAVE BEEN COLLECTED DURING THE VARIOUS ASSESSMENTS ON STEAMBOAT LAKE.  DIRECTED SAMPLING EFFORT NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED TO BETTER ASSESS THESE POPULATIONS THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH OF 38.1  IS WITHIN THE HISTROCIAL RANGE OF 29.1 TO 53.4.  FISH UP TO 11.0 WERE SAMPLED. THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH OF 7.5 INDICATES AN ABUNDANT, HEALTHY WALLEYE POPULATION.  THOUGH SOME YEAR CLASSES APPEAR TO BE STRONGER, ALL WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE OF FISH COLLECTED. WALLEYE STOCKING CONDUCTED BY THE DNR AND LEECH LAKE RESERVATION HAS TAKEN PLACE EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS.  THE MOST NUMEROUS YEAR CLASS, 1988, SAMPLED CORRESPONDS WITH FRY STOCKING.  THIS YEAR CLASS IS A VERY STRONG NATURAL YEAR CLASS IN LEECH LAKE.  ALL PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WALLEYE IN STEAMBOAT LAKE.</p>",

Steamboat Lake belongs to Lake Class 27.  Other area lakes in the same lake class are:  Crooked (2miles southeast), Woman (25 miles southeast), and Pike Bay (3.5 miles north) Lakes.Game fish species sampled include walleye, northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass and yellow perch. Walleye were sampled at a rate typical of lake class 27 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 9.0 - 28.3inches with numerous age classes present. Strongest year classes were 1988 and 1991. Both of these year classeshave been identified as strong on Leech Lake. Walleye from the 1988 year class averaged 18 inches long.  Northernpike were sampled at a rate similar to previous assessments.  They had a wide range of lengths with many yearclasses indicating good natural reproduction.  Bluegill were caught in low numbers but were of quality size.Other species captured include cisco, white sucker, burbot, bullheads and bowfin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steamboat Lake (DOW# 11-0504; Lake Class 22) is a 1,755-acre lake located north of Walker, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the northeast shore. Steamboat Lake has 8.24 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 93 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Steamboat Lake is in lake class 22; lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear, and irregularly shaped.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Steamboat Lake and catch rates are above average compared to other Walker Fisheries Management Class 22 lakes. In addition to good numbers of Northern Pike, there are many larger fish present. The mean length for Northern Pike was 22 inches and fish up to 35 inches were sampled. While Walleye gill net catch rates were lower compared to the past few years, Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 30 inches, with 40% of Walleyes sampled exceeding 20 inches long. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegills over 9 inches and Black Crappie over 14 inches were sampled. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass,  Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Rusty Crayfish have been identified in Steamboat Lake. AIS (aquatic invasive species) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
