                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800 acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake in northeastern Becker County.  It has experienced dramatic changes in its fish habitat and fish community in the last 35 years.  Regarded as a bass/panfish lake in the 1950's and 1960's, the lake is now managed primarily for rainbow trout and walleye.Changes to the lake have come about primarily as a result of two natural events along with fish stocking and shoreline development.  First, in the late 1960's, the lake's aquatic vegetation was virtually eliminated by a population explosion of native crayfish.  Without nesting and cover habitat, bass and sunfish populations were not able to sustain their abundances.  Rainbow trout were introduced in 1977 in an attempted crayfish control measure.  Then, during the 1990's, increased precipitation led to rising water levels in this groundwater influenced lake.  Rising water not only flooded some lakeshore homes, it made additional areas available for northern pike spawning.Even though northern pike are not considered abundant in Bad Medicine, net catches have increased since water levels have risen.  Pike not only grow relatively fast but also have the potential to grow large in the cool, well-oxygenated waters of this lake.  The presence of nutritious forage fishes like cisco and rainbow trout add to that potential.Rainbow trout are stocked annually as yearlings.  Trout angling has become extremely popular on this lake since they were introduced.  A study in the 1980's showed that, due to heavy angling pressure, very few trout survived to a second year in the lake and that stocked fish less than eight inches long were particularly vulnerable to natural mortality (probably pike predation).  Consquently, stocking size was increased to larger yearlings.  Also, in 1998, in attempt to provide some larger trout to anglers, one fourth of the annual trout stocking complement of 16,000 rainbow trout was switched from spring stocked Madison strain yearlings to late fall stocked Kamloops strain yearlings.  With the closed winter season, fall stocked fish have time to put on some spring growth before angling seasons opens.  No creel survey has been done since 1998, but, several anglers have reported catching more trout over two pounds since the change.Walleyes have also become a popular angling target in Bad Medicine.  There is little natural reproduction of walleyes in the lake and the population is generally maintained by stocking.  As one of several area lakes in the Accelerated Walleye Program, Bad Medicine's fingerling stocking rate was increased to approximately 1.6 pounds per littoral acre in 2000.  Walleye are known to grow large in this lake.  A 17 lb. 3 oz. fish was caught during the summer of 1993.This scenic lake is still going through a major transitional period.  The loss of vegetation, large swings in the abundances of various fishes, initiation of trout stocking, expansion of walleye stocking, increased shoreline development, and fluctuating water levels will continue to affect the evolution of the lake and its fish community for some time to come.  Following shoreline best management practices is particularly important in groundwater controlled lakes like Bad Medicine.  Nutrients that enter the lake essentially stay in the lake, adding to the lake's fertility and the aging process.  Buffer zones of natural vegetation, well maintained septic systems, and other good stewarship methods can help to sustain the lake's water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800 acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake in northeastern Becker County.  The lake has steep slopes near shore and 36% littoral area.  The surrounding watershed (1,185 acres) is almost entirely covered by mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Although the lake lies within the Mississippi River drainage, it has no outlet and is primarily groundwater fed.  Historical water clarity records from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) show a mean secchi disk reading just over 23 ft for Bad Medicine.  This oligotrophic lake has a trophic state index in the lower thirties.  Dissolved oxygen levels and cool-water areas within and below the thermocline are sufficient to support a two-story fishery of primarily percids, esocids, and salmonids.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore off MN 113.  This scenic lake has experienced increasing shoreline development and 162 homes or cabins were counted around the shoreline in 2006, compared to 126 in 1996 and 16 in 1950.  A few of those present in the late 1990's were flooded by high water and abandoned or removed.  \n\nThis lake has experienced dramatic changes in its fish habitat and fish community in the last 35 years.  Regarded as a bass/panfish lake in the 1950's and 1960's, the lake is now managed primarily for rainbow trout and walleye.\n\nChanges to the lake have come about primarily as a result of two natural events along with fish stocking and shoreline development.  First, in the late 1960's, the lake's aquatic vegetation was virtually eliminated by a population explosion of native crayfish.  Without nesting and cover habitat, bass and sunfish populations were not able to sustain their abundances.  Rainbow trout were introduced in 1977 in an attempt to control crayfish.  Then, during the 1990's, increased precipitation led to rising water levels in this groundwater influenced lake.  Rising water not only flooded some lakeshore homes, it made additional areas available for northern pike spawning.\n\nEven though northern pike are not considered abundant in Bad Medicine, net catches have increased since water levels have risen.  Pike not only grow relatively fast but also have the potential to grow large in the cool, well-oxygenated waters of this lake.  The presence of nutritious forage fishes like cisco and rainbow trout add to that potential.\n\nRainbow trout are stocked annually as yearlings.  Trout angling has become extremely popular on this lake since they were introduced.  A study in the 1980's showed that, due to heavy angling pressure, very few trout survived to a second year in the lake and that stocked fish less than eight inches long were particularly vulnerable to natural mortality (probably pike predation).  Consquently, stocking size was increased to larger yearlings.  Also in 1998, in attempt to provide some larger trout to anglers, one fourth of the annual trout stocking complement of 16,000 rainbow trout was switched from spring stocked Madison strain yearlings to late fall stocked Kamloops strain yearlings.  With the closed winter season, fall stocked fish have time to put on some spring growth before angling seasons opens.  No creel survey has been done since 1998, but, several anglers have reported catching more trout over two pounds since the change.\n\nWalleyes are also a popular angling target in Bad Medicine.  There is little natural reproduction of walleyes in the lake and the population is generally maintained by stocking.  Bad Medicine's fingerling stocking rate was increased to approximately 1.6 pounds per littoral acre in 2000.  Good survival of walleye fingerlings stocked in 2002, 2003, and 2004 resulted in the historic high test net catches in 2006.  Due to the large proportion of young fish, the average walleye length in 2006 was 13.5 inches.  These fish should provide good angling opportunities in the near future.  Walleyes are known to grow large in this lake.  A 17 lb. 3 oz. fish was caught during the summer of 1993.\n\nThe abundant walleye population may be impacting the yellow perch forage base.  Perch catches in Bad Medicine were at the lake's historic low in 2006.  Walleye growth rates for age two through four were slower than in the past.  \n\nAlthough DNR scuba divers reported seeing all sizes of smallmouth bass in 2005, smallmouth bass were caught in test nets for the first time since 1961.  The average length of those sampled in gill nets was 13.3 inches.\n\nThis scenic lake is still going through a major transitional period.  The loss of vegetation, large swings in the abundances of various fishes, initiation of trout stocking, expansion of walleye stocking, increased shoreline development, and fluctuating water levels will continue to affect the evolution of the lake and its fish community for some time to come.  Following shoreline best management practices is particularly important in groundwater controlled lakes like Bad Medicine.  Nutrients that enter the lake essentially stay in the lake, adding to the lake's fertility and the aging process.  Buffer zones of natural vegetation, well maintained septic systems, and other good stewarship methods can help to sustain the lake's water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800-acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake located in northeastern Becker County and within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake has steep, primarily rocky, slopes near shore.  Although the lake lies within the Mississippi River drainage, it has no outlet and is primarily groundwater fed.  Historical water clarity records from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency indicate the average water clarity is 25 feet at Bad Medicine Lake.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore off MN 113.  Approximately 16,000 Rainbow Trout are stocked annually and Walleye fingerlings are stocked biennially in even years.  A standard survey was done on Bad Medicine Lake in mid-July 2022 to assess the fish community.  <br> \n    <br> \nWalleyes sampled during the 2022 survey ranged from 8.0 to 24.5 inches, with an average size 15.5 inches.  Walleye gill net catch rates were above average for this lake and also higher than lakes of similar biological conditions.  Fish over 15 inches represented 51% of the fish sampled.  There is some natural reproduction of Walleye, but stronger year classes are presented in years of fingerling stockings.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remains low in Bad Medicine Lake.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled during the 2022 survey was 22.6 inches, while Northern Pike up to 35.5 inches were sampled.  Gill nets sampled 31 Rainbow Trout during the 2022 survey, which was close to the lake's historical average.  Lengths ranged from 11.7 to 15.5 inches, with an average length of 13.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass remain abundant in Bad Medicine Lake, as the 2022 assessment documented the highest catch rate (3.7 per gill net) on record for this species.  Average length of Smallmouth Bass sampled was 14.1 inches and fish up to 19.1 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass also are abundant, with an average length of 7.8 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers continue to be low with their average length being 6.8 inches.  Bluegill catches remain very low in surveys as Bad Medicine Lake lacks spawning habitat for Bluegill.  Other species sampled in this assessment include Burbot, Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker.  Although sampled in low numbers in previous surveys, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were not found in 2022 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine Lake has experienced dramatic changes in the last 30 years.  It was a well known bass/panfish lake in the 1950's and 1960's.  Today it is recognized for its trout fishery and production of trophy-sized northern pike and walleye.  A 17 lb. 3 oz. walleye was caught in the summer of 1993.  Northern pike in excess of 20 lbs. were reported in the winter of 1995.  Angling for large yellow perch has also become popular in recent years.  As with most lakes, shoreline development is also changing the nature of the lake.  A \"backwoods\" lake with 26 homes/cottages in 1961 now has 126 dwellings and more planned.Changes to Bad Medicine Lake's fishery stem from a population explosion of native crayfish in the late 1960's.   By the early 1970's, crayfish had virtually stripped the lake of aquatic vegetation.  Bass, sunfish, and crappie disappeared along with the vegetation.  Northern pike also declined while yellow perch became abundant.  Efforts to rebuild fish populations through stocking in the 1970's were unsuccessful, and crayfish continued to be a problem.  Walleye stocking during the same period was very successful however.  Unfortunately, an over-abundant walleye population soon consumed nearly all the perch.  Walleye stocking was reduced and the perch started to recover.  The current walleye population is very good with a 17.4 inch average length and an occasional \"lunker.\"  Efforts to control crayfish abundance by stocking rainbow trout started in 1977.  It was hoped the trout would eat large numbers of small crayfish. How much crayfish control was obtained is unknown but a sensational trout fishery was created.  In the early 1980's, four pound trout were not uncommon with some as large as eight pounds.  Today's trout fishery is mostly one and two year old fish as angling for trout has become so popular that few of the annually stocked rainbows survive more than a couple of years.  Only occasionally is a large trout now taken.  Indications are that crayfish abundance has moderated in recent years.  Some vegetation is showing up in the bays and the bass, crappie, and sunfish appear to be making a small comeback.  They were all sampled in the current survey either with standard nets or 1/4 inch trapnets.  A significant increase in numbers of small northern pike has also occurred.  The small amount of vegetation now showing up in some bays appears to be a critical habitat requirement for young northern pike.  Test nets do not sample the very large northern pike but there have been several reports recently of pike over 20 lbs. being taken.  Bad Medicine Lake is still going through a major transitional period.  The loss of vegetation, large swings in the abundance of various fishes, initiation of trout stocking, increased shoreline development, fluctuating water levels; these factors and more will continue to affect the evolution of the lake and its fishery for some time to come.  Indications are that crayfish abundance may be moderating and this could possibly trigger another round of dramatic changes in the fish community.  Bad Medicine Lake has a very small watershed and no outlet.  It is primarily a groundwater lake.  Nutrient input is limited but what does enter the lake stays in the lake.  Therefore, it is imperative that lakeshore residents follow shoreline best management practices to minimize impacting the lake.  This would include leaving a buffer zone of native vegetation along the shoreline and maintaining septic systems.  Bad Medicine Lake is still one of the most beautiful lakes in the area with excellent water quality and a diverse fish community that can provide exciting angling experiences.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bad Medicine Lake, which is located within the White Earth Indian Reservation, was conducted on July 11-12, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Mimic Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nA vertical gill net (VGN) survey was also conducted concurrently by IBI program staff. A VGN gang consists of seven different sized meshes set side-by-side that extend from the water surface to the bottom over the deepest areas of the lake. A VGN gang is set overnight and is designed to sample pelagic (i.e., open water) species such as Cisco, also known as Tullibee. This sampling was conducted on Bad Medicine Lake to evaluate the status of the Cisco population, since the species had only been sampled infrequently in seven of ten standard gill net (GN) surveys conducted between 1961 and 2022 despite temperature oxygen profiles indicating suitable habitat for the species over that period. Additionally, the morphology of Bad Medicine Lake (e.g., maximum depth) may not be conducive to sampling Cisco in GNs but is favorable for VGN sampling. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2022 VGN survey, 3 Cisco were captured in one VGN gang set in 82 feet of water. Cisco total length varied from 10.3-11.1 inches. Cisco were sampled in waters from 23.0-36.1 feet deep. These waters varied in temperature from 10.9-20.6?C (51.6-69.1?F) and dissolved oxygen concentration from 11.7-12.4 mg/L. <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish species that were sampled in the VGN gang included Walleye (n=2), Rainbow Trout (n=2), and Burbot (n=1). Walleye were sampled in 6.5-19.7 feet of water, Rainbow Trout were sampled in 23.0-26.2 feet of water, and the Burbot was sampled in 36.1 feet of water. <br> \n <br> \nThe top of the thermocline in Bad Medicine Lake was set up at approximately 20 feet, and dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 71.2 feet at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 7.7?C (45.9?F). Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at most depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \nThe Secchi transparency measurement at the time of sampling was 19.7 feet whereas total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a have averaged approximately 6 and 2 parts per billion, respectively. These water quality parameters correspond with the sufficient oxythermal habitat observed during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nFactors that can influence oxythermal habitat include eutrophication (i.e., excess nutrients) and climate change. Eutrophication can lead to depletion of dissolved oxygen in the deeper, colder waters as a result of increased rates of organic material decomposition and decay. Climate change can lead to extended periods of summer stratification and warming of surface waters. The combination of these factors can contribute to a habitat squeeze that leads to physiological stress and summer kill events for Cisco and other coldwater species such as Rainbow Trout and Burbot. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey were considered when the biological health of Bad Medicine Lake was assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which was completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Steep shorelines, abundant boulders, and coarse woody habitat may have limited sampling effectiveness during the nearshore survey, and thereby reduced certainty associated with interpretation of nearshore survey results. Despite this, the high diversity of intolerant and coldwater species present in Bad Medicine Lake, as also confirmed by the concurrent VGN survey, indicates that water quality and cold, oxygenated water are sufficient to support sensitive fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>BAD MEDICINE WAS A WELL KNOWN BASS-PANFISH LAKE IN THE 50'S AND 60'S.  A CRAY FISH POPULATION THAT EXPLODED IN THE LATE 60'S HAS LEFT THE LAKE NEARLY DEVOID OF VEGETATION, AND CENS HAVE VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED AS A RESULT.  A REMNANT LMB POPULATION AND SOME ROCK BASS ARE ALL THAT REMAIN.  A SUCCESSFUL RAINBOW TROUT STOCKING PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN THE LAKE 70'S AND IS NOW THE PRIMARY FISHERY.  THE GILLNET CATCH OF RBT IN THE CURRENT SURVEY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT OF THE 1986 SURVEY.  SEVERAL FACTORS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT DECLINE.  RBT ARE GENERALLY STOCKED AS YEARLINGS IN THE SPRING, THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO VERY HEAVY FISHING PRESSURE IN EARLY SUMMER AND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE SURVIVE TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR.  SURVEYS, CONDUCTED IN MID-JULY, ARE PRIMARILY A REFLECTION OF SPRING STOCKING RATE AND EARLY SEASON ANGLER HARVEST.  AS THE POPULARITY OF THE FISHERY HAS INCREASED, SO HAS FISHING PRESSURE ANGLER PROFICIENCY, AND , CONSEQUENTLY, ANGLER HARVEST.  THE LOWER GILLNET CATCH IN THE 1991 SURVEY IS, WE SPECULATE, AN INDICATION OF THAT INCREASED ANGLER HARVEST.  ALSO, A FACTOR THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER GILLNET CATCHES IS THE RBT'S PREFERRED TEMPERATURE RANGE IN RELATION TO THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IN THE LAKE.  AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO SET GILLNETS IN THE SAME LOCATION AND DEPTH FOR EACH SURVEY, IF TEMPERATURE PROFILES ARE DIFFERENT, IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER RBT'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE GEAR.  SUBTLE DIFFERENCES DID EXIST BETWEEN THE 1986 AND 1991 TEMPERATURE PROFILES, HOW MUCH THIS AFFECTED CATCH RATES IS NOT KNOWN.  NOP ABUNDANCE, SIMILAR TO THE CENS, DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FOLLOWING THE CRAYFISH EXPLOSION.  THEY HAVE, HOWEVER, MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A SMALL POPULATION DESPITE THE LACK OF VEGETATION AND POOR SPAWNING HABITAT.  YEP HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, FROM 5.00/GILLNET IN 1986 TO 34.37/GILLNET IN 1991.  THE YEP LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR ANGLING, 25% OF THE FISH ARE OVER EIGHT INCHES WITH SOME UP TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH.  THE WAE POPULATION, AT 7.00/GILLNET, IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS SURVEY.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION HAS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TOWARDS LARGER FISH, 1986 MEAN LENGTH WAS 12.3 INCHES, 1991 MEAN LENGTH IS 14.1 INCHES.  WAE AGES INDICATE THAT FINGERLING STOCKING IS SUPPLEMENTING INTERMITTENTLY SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION, AND THE CURRENT POPULATION IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH.  WAE GROWTH RATES ARE SOMEWHAT BELOW AVERAGE, RATHER SURPRISING IN VIEW OF THE ABUNDANCE OF YEP, AND ALSO CRAYFISH, AVAILABLE FOR FORAGE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800-acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake located in northeastern Becker County and within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake has steep, primarily rocky, slopes near shore and 36% littoral area.  The surrounding watershed (1,185 acres) is almost entirely covered by mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Although the lake lies within the Mississippi River drainage, it has no outlet and is primarily groundwater fed.  Historical water clarity records from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) show a mean secchi disk reading near 25 feet for Bad Medicine.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore off MN 113.  Several Aquatic Management Areas have been acquired along the shoreline. <br> \n    <br> \nA standard survey was done on Bad Medicine Lake on 06/25/2017 to assess the fish community.  This survey was conducted using nine gill nets and 12 trap nets.  Baited minnow traps were also set to assess the crayfish population.  Also during 2017, the near shore fish community was sampled by seining and electrofishing,  and emergent vegetation was mapped.  The detailed results of those surveys are provided in separate reports.  <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the 2017 standard survey were quite similar to those seen in 2012, indicating that no significant changes in the fish population have occurred during the last five years.  Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, and Rainbow Trout are commonly sought after by anglers, and anglers report catching some large Northern Pike on occasion.  The Burbot fishery is also seeing increasing pressure during late winter months.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled during the 2017 assessment ranged from 8 to nearly 25 inches, with an average size of just over 16 inches and an average weight of 1.5 pounds.  Walleye gill net catch rates are slightly below average for this lake, yet higher than catch rates in lakes of similar biological conditions.  Most Walleye appear to be the result of the fingerling stockings that occurred in 2014 and 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 18 Rainbow Trout during the 2017 assessment, which was below the lake's historical average.  Lengths ranged from 13.2 to 21.6 inches, with an average length of 14.8 inches and an average weight of 2.8 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remains low in Bad Medicine Lake.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled during the 2017 assessment was just under 24 inches, while Pike up to 38.8 inches were sampled.    <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass remain abundant in Bad Medicine Lake, as the 2017 assessment documented the highest catch rate (3.1 per gill net) on record for this species.  Average length of Smallmouth sampled was 14.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not caught during this survey.  Very few Bluegills were sampled, with an average length of just over six inches.  Rock Bass appear to be abundant, with sizes ranging from 4.5 to 8.8 inches.  Perch numbers were extremely low, with only 8 perch sampled during this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR EWR Lake Habitat program staff delineated the floating leaf and emergent aquatic vegetation of Bad Medicine lake on 08/01/2017, following the protocols listed in the MN DNR Lake Plant Mapping Manual. There were a total of 7.1 acres of floating and emergent plants mapped. This consisted of 5.9 acres of emergent dominated plant communities and 1.2 acres of floating leaf plant communities.  Habitat preservation remains a critical concern for Bad Medicine Lake, as several species within the lake are sensitive to habitat degradation.  Aquatic Management Areas on Bad Medicine Lake preserve valuable shoreline habitat, and provide recreational opportunities.    </p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the standard survey completed in 2017 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to assess the biological condition of Bad Medicine Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed. <br> \nShoreline seining and backpack-electrofishing were used to sample fish species at fourteen sights around Bad Medicine Lake.  Species sampled with these gear types are not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets, which are used during standard assessments.  A good mix of species that require different habitat conditions were sampled in during this survey.  Species sampled that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions include Banded Killifish, Burbot, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass.  Other species sampled during this survey included Bluntnose Minnow, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  The results of this survey suggest that Bad Medicine has a healthy fish community, and the lake is not impaired by biological standards.   <br> \nPreservation of aquatic habitat and the use of best management practices for any future development may help maintain the natural habitat that is currently present in Bad Medicine Lake.   </p>",

Shoal water areas are mainly rubble and sand.  The water in this lake is quite clear and Secchi disc readings have been as follows:  July 22, 1936 - 15 feet, 5 inches; August 17, 1936 - 11 feet; July 17, 1950 - 25 feet; and July 22, 1961 - 18 feet.Because of favorable water temperatures and available oxygen in sufficient quantities to about 65 feet, this lake is a possible choice for an experimental two-story fish population.At the present time this fishery maintains a fishing pressure of about 22,000 man-hours per summer fishing season.  Fish harvested are bluegill, northern pike, largemouth bass, crappie, and walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800-acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake located in northeastern Becker County and within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake has steep slopes near shore and 36% littoral area.  The surrounding watershed (1,185 acres) is almost entirely covered by mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Although the lake lies within the Mississippi River drainage, it has no outlet and is primarily groundwater fed.  Historical water clarity records from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) show a mean secchi disk reading just over 23 ft for Bad Medicine.  This oligotrophic lake has a trophic state index in the lower thirties.  Dissolved oxygen levels and cool-water areas within and below the thermocline are sufficient to support a two-story fishery.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore off MN 113.  This scenic lake has experienced increasing shoreline development and 162 homes or cabins were counted around the shoreline in 2006, compared to 126 in 1996 and 16 in 1950.  A few of those present in the late 1990's were flooded by high water and abandoned or removed.   <br> \n <br> \nThis lake has experienced dramatic changes in its fish habitat and fish community in the last 35 years.  Regarded as a bass/panfish lake in the 1950's and 1960's, the lake is now managed primarily for rainbow trout and walleye, although smallmouth bass have made a strong comeback in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nChanges to the lake have come about primarily as a result of two natural events along with fish stocking and shoreline development.  First, in the late 1960's, the lake's aquatic vegetation was virtually eliminated by a population explosion of native crayfish.  Without nesting and cover habitat, bass and sunfish populations were not able to sustain their abundances.  Rainbow trout were introduced in 1977 in an attempt to control crayfish.  During the 1990's, increased precipitation led to rising water levels in this groundwater influenced lake.  Rising water not only flooded some lakeshore homes, it made additional areas available for northern pike spawning. <br> \n <br> \nEven though northern pike are not considered abundant in Bad Medicine, net catches have increased since water levels have risen.  Pike not only grow relatively fast but also have the potential to grow large in the cool, well-oxygenated waters of this lake.  The presence of nutritious forage fishes like cisco and rainbow trout add to that potential.  Young pike (age two) dominated the population in 2012.  This accounts for the mean pike length of 21.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout are stocked annually as yearlings.  Trout angling has become extremely popular on this lake since they were introduced.  A study in the 1980's showed that, due to heavy angling pressure, very few trout survived to a second year in the lake and that stocked fish less than eight inches long were particularly vulnerable to natural mortality (probably pike predation).  Consequently, trout stocking size was increased to larger yearlings.  Also in 1998, in attempt to provide some larger trout to anglers, one fourth of the annual trout stocking complement of 16,000 rainbow trout was switched from spring stocked Madison strain yearlings to late fall stocked Kamloops strain yearlings.  With the closed winter season, fall stocked fish have time to grow before the angling season opens.  No creel survey has been done since 1998, but, several anglers have reported catching more trout weighing over two pounds since the change.  However, trout sampled in June 2012 were all yearlings averaging 13.4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are also a popular angling target in Bad Medicine.  There is little natural reproduction of walleyes in the lake and the population is generally maintained by stocking.  Bad Medicine's fingerling stocking rate was increased to approximately 1.6 pounds per littoral acre in 2000 and to 2.0 pounds in 2006.  Fingerling stocking occurs biennially.  Walleye fry have not been stocked since the mid 1970's.  No evaluation of fry stocking success was made at that time.  Good survival of walleye fingerlings stocked in 2002, 2003, and 2004 resulted in the historic high test net catches in 2006.  Due to the large proportion of young fish, the average walleye length in 2006 was 13.5 inches. Walleyes sampled in 2012 averaged 15.3 inches and 1.2 pounds, but were less abundant at 3.8 fish per net.  Walleyes are known to grow large in this lake.  A 17 lb. 3 oz. fish was caught during the summer of 1993. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch forage base has declined markedly since 2001.  Perch catches in Bad Medicine dropped to a new historic low of 0.7 per net in 2012.  Walleye growth rates appear to have slowed as a result.  The increasing smallmouth bass population may be impacting perch numbers and possibly walleye numbers and growth, as well.  There is a chance that smallmouth bass may be impacting crayfish abundance, too, as crayfish catch rates were down about 65% in 2012 compared to 2006. <br> \n <br> \nDNR scuba divers reported seeing all sizes of smallmouth bass in 2005 and in 2006 smallmouth bass were caught in test nets for the first time since 1961.  Gill net catches increased from 0.7 smallmouth bass per set in 2006 to 1.89 per set in 2012.  An additional 17 smallmouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing.  The average overall length of those sampled in 2012 was 13.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThis scenic lake is still going through a major transitional period.  The loss of vegetation, large swings in the abundances of various fishes, initiation of trout stocking, expansion of walleye stocking, increasing smallmouth bass population, increased shoreline development, and fluctuating water levels will continue to affect the evolution of the lake and its fish community for some time to come.  Following shoreline best management practices is particularly important in groundwater controlled lakes like Bad Medicine.  Nutrients that enter the lake essentially stay in the lake, adding to the lake's fertility and the aging process.  Buffer zones of natural vegetation, well maintained septic systems, and other good stewarship methods can help to sustain the lake's water quality, fish populations, and property values.  The Bad Medicine Lake Association and Bad Medicine Lake Foundation have proposed research grants via the MPCA to study various relationships of water quality indicators and subsequent protection of water quality in this land-locked, oligotrophic lake.</p>",

The fish community sampled during this assessment was not diverse.  Catches were dominated by young White Suckers and Smallmouth Bass.  Two young Burbot were sampled.  Other species sampled included Johnny Darter, Spottail Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Northern Pike, and Rock Bass.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
