The CPUE of the pumpkinseed population is very high, yet show fair growth.  77% of the sample were age IV and V.  Bluegill first showed up in the 1973 survey.  Since that time, they have continued to expand in numbers, with average growth.  The CPUE is one of the highest encountered in the Duluth Area.  Black crappie are above lake class medians and show good growth.  Smallmouth and largemouth bass are present in the lake;  however, the sample was too small to comment.  The yellow perch population is very high at the present.  Two very strong age classes, III and IV, made up 94% of this sample.  The population may level off once these fish move through the population.  Yellow perch numbers are well above the 3rd quartile for this lake class, though growth rates are near normal for the Duluth Area.  The CPUE of walleye has declined over the years to a low in 1992 of 0.8 per lift, which is below the first quartile for this lake class.  Little natural recruitment seems to be occurring as most age groups sampled coincide with years of stocking.  The small sample taken was not enough for growth analysis.</p>",

The 1995 population assessment found good populations of black crappie, bluegill and northern pike with respectable sizes of these species.  Limited numbers of walleye were seen, however, the average size was 17.0 inches with an occasional fish over 23.0 inches.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass and yellow perch are also present in Cameron Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cameron Lake is a 162 acre lake located near Cotton, Minnesota with 50% (81 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 27 feet.  A carry down access with no parking is located off of County Road 224.  Walleye, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass are the primary management species according to the 2000 management plan.  Over 18,000 walleye fingerlings were stocked since 1991.     Walleye abundance of 1.3 fish/gillnet was average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of walleyes was 19.7 inches, with individuals reaching as large as 28.1 inches.  Walleyes growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  There is some evidence of walleye natural reproduction as only 25% of the fish aged correlated to stocked years.     Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates in 2004 (7.5 per hour) were below average when compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Mean length was 11.1 inches and largemouth bass growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.     Smallmouth bass electrofishing catch rates in 2004 were low, with only 2.5 fish per hour netted.  Mean length was 11.7 inches.     Black crappie abundance was 9.6 fish/trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of black crappies was 8.2 inches, with 57% of the catch 8 inches or greater.  Growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.  Most (65%) black crappie were age 3 and 5.     Northern pike abundance was 8.7 fish/gillnet and was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 21.9 inches, with 50% of the fish sampled measuring 21 inches or more.  Growth was considered average for Duluth Area lakes.  Northern pike successfully reproduced in all years between 1998 and 2002.     Bluegill abundance was 12.6 fish/trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 6.1 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.      Yellow perch abundance was 6.8 fish/gillnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 5.8 inches, with a maximum length of 6.4 inches.        Other fish species sampled included pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.            Cameron Lake is managed primarily as a bass-panfish and walleye lake.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass numbers have declined since the first sample in 1996; however, black crappie catch rates increased considerably.  Walleye abundance has remained within a normal range for Cameron Lake.</p>",
