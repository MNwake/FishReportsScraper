                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is located in northeastern Sherburne County, 4 miles northeast of Zimmerman. The lake has a surface area of 62 acres, a maximum depth of 41 feet, and  small public accesses are located on both the north and south shore. A lake survey was conducted in the summer of 2002 to assess changes to the lake and the fishery since the previous survey in 1991. The lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and northern pike.Largemouth bass were relatively abundant during spring electrofishing; 53 bass were caught in 40 minutes of effort, which is above average for the Montrose management area. Their size was also good; average length was 12.5 inches, 13 bass were 15 inches or longer, and the largest individual was 19.4 inches.Northern pike seem to have decreased in numbers and increased in size since 1991. The catch rate for pike was below the expected level for lakes similar to Sandy, but average size (1.95 lbs, 18.9 inches) was typical. The largest individual captured was 34 inches and pike growth was average for younger fish, but older fish grew more slowly.Bluegill were small, growing slowly, and their numbers appear to have declined since 1991. Their average catch rate and size (5 inches) were below statewide averages from similar lakes. The largest bluegill captured was only 6.3 inches in length.Few black crappie were caught in 2002 and they have been rare in previous surveys as well. Average length was 8.1 inches and the largest individual was 11.6 inches. Crappie growth was average. No yellow perch were found in the survey, but other species caught included yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and white sucker.Sandy Lake has a diverse, abundant aquatic plant community and a small watershed, which contributes to good water quality. Landowners can help by protecting or planting native vegetation on the lakeshore.</p>",

Northern pike were small in size and ranged in length from 13.2 to 20.4 inches for males and 14.5 to 22.8 inches for females and averaged 1.1 pounds, collectively. Age groups 2 to 5 were present with a modal age group of age-3. Growth was slow for all ages. Northern Pike age-5 were less than 20 inches in length. \nSpecies that were caught in the trap nets included: Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. \nYellow Bullhead were abundant with a catch rate of 16.3/trap net and was above the range of expected values for the lake class. The modal length group was 7.0 to 7.4 inches and averaged .3 pounds. Brown Bullhead had average abundance with a catch rate of 2.3/trap net and had a modal length group of 12.0 to 12.9 inches.\nBluegill and Black Crappie were sampled in high numbers, but were small in size and had slow growth. Bluegill had a modal length of 4.5 to 4.9 inches. Black Crappie had a modal length of 6.5 to 6.9 inches.\nSpring electrofishing samples and angler reports indicated an abundant population of Largemouth Bass. Fifty-eight Largemouth Bass were sampled in 75 minutes of electrofishing with a catch rate of 46.4 bass/hour. Thirteen percent of the Largemouth Bass sampled were 15 inches or longer and two 20 inch bass were sampled. Largemouth Bass growth rates were average.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is located in northeastern Sherburne County, 4 miles northeast of Zimmerman. The lake has a surface area of 62 acres, maximum depth of 41 feet, and two small public accesses are located on both the north and south shore. The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and northern pike. A population assessment was conducted in 2012 to assess fish populations, and included spring electrofishing and summer test netting (gill nets, and trap nets). Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Sandy Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were relatively abundant during spring electrofishing; 27 bass were caught in 47 minutes of effort, which is near the daytime average for the Montrose management area. Their size was also good; average length was 13.6 inches, 37 percent of largemouth bass sampled were 15 inches or longer, and the largest individual was 20 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike have increased in numbers and decreased in size since 2002. The catch rate for pike was within the expected range for similar lakes, and average size was 20 inches and 1.6 lbs. The largest individual captured was only 25 inches and less than four percent of the pike sampled were greater than 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were small, and their numbers were lower than 2002. Their average catch rate and size (5 inches) were below statewide averages for similar lakes. The largest bluegill captured was 7.6 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nFew black crappie were caught in 2012 and they have been rare in previous surveys as well. The average length was six inches and the largest individual was eight inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSandy Lake has a diverse, abundant aquatic plant community and a small watershed, which contributes to good water quality. Landowners can help by protecting or planting native vegetation along the lakeshore. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gamefish species present in Sandy Lake were Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Walleye. Forage species present were Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Yellow Perch. Other fish species present in Sandy Lake were Black and Brown Bullheads, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Banded Killifish. White Sucker and White Crappie have been sampled in past surveys, but did not appear in this survey.\nThe Northern Pike catch has declined from 1980 (12.5/gill net) to the normal range for this area. Northern Pike sampled were in age classes young of the year to age-7 with age-3 predominant. Growth was average at all ages with a size range similar to that of the 1980 survey. Northern Pike were primarily between 12-21 inches in length, however a few larger individuals were sampled. \nThe Bluegill population has declined from the 1980 survey (60.0/trap net) to 1986 (22.0/trap net) and was near the local median. Bluegill ages 2-7 were sampled in the trap nets and young of the year were sampled in the seine. Bluegill year classes five (5) and six (6) were the strongest accounting for 54% and 28% of the sample, respectively. First year growth was average, but declined to a slow rate thereafter. Bluegill ranged in length from 4.0 to 6.5 inches and was similar to the 1980 survey, however the median length has decreased from the 5.5-5.9 inch interval to the 5.0-5.4 inch interval. \nOnly three (3) Walleye were sampled. Individual Walleye were assessed to be age-1 at 12.9 inches, age-4 at 17.7 inches, and age-7 at 21.0 inches in length, respectively. The Walleye ages reflected past stocking records.  Growth rates were not determined due to the small sample size. The catch rate of 1/gill net was within the range of the local median and was similar to the 1980 survey. \nBlack Crappie numbers remain below the local lower quartile. Only three (3) fish were sampled representing age classes two (2), three (3), and five (5). Growth rates were not determined.\nOnly one (1) Largemouth Bass was sampled representing age class 7 and was 13.8 inches in length. \nYellow Perch are rare. Only one (1) adult was sampled and was captured during shoreline seining. \nBlack Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch populations were basically unchanged since the 1980 survey.  Yellow Bullhead were dominate of the bullhead species and were sampled at a rate of 15.8/trap net which is greater than the local upper quartile. Yellow Bullhead ranged in length from five (5) to 12 inches, however 90% were less than eight (8) inches in length.  \n</p>",
