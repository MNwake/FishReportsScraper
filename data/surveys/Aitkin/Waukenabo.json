                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is located approximately 14 miles northeast of Aitkin, less than a mile off Highway 169.  The lake is 644 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake on South Waukenabo Lake Road.  Habitat ranges from rocky shorelines and steep contours to islands of emergent vegetation.  The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and yellow perch.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n  <br> \nWaukenabo Lake has a long history of walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1947.  The frequency varied over the years with the current strategy being 2 pounds per littoral acre stocked in alternate years.  The walleye catch of 2.75/gill net was slightly higher than the 2010 catch of 2.5/gill net.  Past catches have averaged 3.5/gill net.  Average length and weight were 13.3\" and 1.4 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike abundance was less than average when compared to similar lakes at 2.6/gill net in 2015; although a lower abundance of pike often results in better survival of stocked walleye and a better pike size distribution.  Past catch rates have ranged from 2.0 to 10.5/gill net with an average of 5.6/gill net.  Average length and weight were 22.1\" and 2.3 lbs with 26% measuring at least 24\", which the best size structure that has been previously observed.  Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they generally have beneficial effects on fish communities. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 21.3/hr, which is higher than previously measured in 1992 and 2000, but less than measured in 2010 (30.5/hr).  Average length of these fish was 15.1\" with fish up to 18\" sampled.  Additional fish up to 19.7 inches were observed in the standard net assessment samples. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and they increased to 7.8/gill net in 2015.  Past catch rates ranged up to 18.3/gill net and have averaged 6/gill net since 1949.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish size structure is generally good with several year classes present.  Bluegill numbers decreased slightly with a catch rate of 4.6/trap net in 2015.  Past catch rates ranged from 0.8 to 13.7/trap net.  Black crappie catch rates in the gill nets increased to 9.5/gillnet with an average historic catch of 7.2/gillnet.  The black crappie catch in the trap nets dropped to 3.6/trap net with past catches of 0.3 to 5.2/trap net, and an average of 2.5/trap net.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is located approximately 14 miles northeast of Aitkin, less than a mile off Highway 169.  The lake is 644 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake on South Waukenabo Lake Road.  Habitat ranges from rocky shorelines and steep contours to islands of emergent vegetation.  The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nWaukenabo Lake has a long history of walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1947.  The frequency varied over the years with the current strategy being 2 pounds per littoral acre stocked in alternate years.  The walleye catch of 2.5/gill net was double the 2005 catch.  Past catches have averaged 3.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were 17.9\" and 2.1 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was average when compared to similar lakes at 7.3/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 2.0 to 10.5/gill net with an average of 5.7/gill net.  Average length and weight were 19.5\" and 1.7 lbs with only 3% measuring at least 24\".  Age 3 fish (2007 year class) were most abundant, accounting for 56% of all northern pike sampled.  These fish measure approximately 16-22\".   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 30.5/hr, which is higher than previously measured in 1992 and 2000.  Average length of these fish was 12.1\" with fish up to 17\" sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and they continued to decline in 2010 at 1.1/gill net.  Past catches ranged up to 18.3/gill net and average 6.3/gill net.   In contrast, bluegill numbers tend to be increasing with a catch of 8.3/trap net in 2010.  Past catches range from 0.8 to 13.7/trap net.  Black crappie catches have also been increasing with past catches of 0.3 to 3.2/trap net and a 2010 catch of 5.2/trap net in 2010.  Panfish size structure is generally good with several year classes present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is located approximately 14 miles northeast of Aitkin, less than a mile off Highway 169.  The lake is 644 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake on South Waukenabo Lake Road.  Habitat ranges from rocky shorelines and steep contours to islands of emergent vegetation.  The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and Yellow Perch.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n  <br> \nA gill net only targeted assessment of the Walleye fishery was conducted on Waukenabo Lake during the week of 8/27/18.  Waukenabo Lake has a long history of Walleye fingerling stocking, dating back to 1947.  Walleye gill net catches during the 10 previous nettings have ranged from 0.3 to 10.3/net with an average of 3.4/net.  Walleye catches in 2018 (2.6/gill net) were similar to the previous nettings yet still failed to meet the management goal of 3-5/gill net.  Mean length and weight were a respectable 17.6\" and 2.0 lbs in 2018.  Walleyes continued to grow well and averaged 16.8 inches by age 4.  Seven year classes were present, which met the management goal of 4 year classes.  The 2014 year class (age 4) was most common, accounting for 36% of the Walleyes sampled.  The 2012 year class (age 6) was also abundant accounting for 26% of the sampled Walleyes.  These 2 year classes were the most common three years ago as 1 yr. olds and 3 yr. olds, respectively.  All Walleyes were from fingerling or yearling stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish including Walleye.  Past catch rates have bounced around ranging from 1.0 up to 18.3/gill net and have averaged 5.7 gill net since 1949.  The current catch of 1.0/gill net is the lowest on record and overall there has been a downward trend overtime.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike abundance was less than average when compared to similar lakes at 4.2/gill net in 2018.  A lower abundance of pike often results in better survival of stocked Walleye and a better pike size distribution.  Past catch rates have ranged from 2.0 to 10.5/gill net with an average of 5.6/gill net.  Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they generally have beneficial effects on fish communities. <br> \n</p>",

This data is pre-regulation and will help provide a baseline to determine if a 10 fish bag limit (implementation 2021) is having any effect on the fishery. Five daytime electrofishing runs were completed for a total of 0.9 hours of sampling effort. The catch rate for Bluegill was 82.5 per hour with 1 netter. Bluegill sampled ranged from 3.5 inches to 9.4 inches with an average size of 6.5 inches. Eight Bluegill larger than 8 inches were sampled, two of which exceeded 9 inches. Future spring surveys and standard survey data will be used to evaluate the regulation. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is located approximately 14 miles northeast of Aitkin, less than a mile off Highway 169. The lake is 644 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 38 feet. There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake on South Waukenabo Lake Road.  Habitat ranges from rocky shorelines and steep contours to islands of emergent vegetation. The aquatic plant community is integral to maintaining good water clarity and quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and Yellow Perch. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n  <br> \nA gill net only survey targeting Walleye to analyze stocking strategies was completed the week of August 10, 2020. Waukenabo Lake has a long history of Walleye stocking, dating back to 1947. Natural reproduction of Walleyes has been sporadic, with the last strong natural reproduced year class occurring in 1998. The size and frequency of stocking has varied over the years with alternate year fingerling stocking being most common.  In order to improve abundance, the current strategy is to annually stock 0.75 pounds per littoral acre.  In 2019, surplus fry were available so we chose to try an experimental fry stocking as well since it had not yet been tried in the lake's stocking history. Walleye stocking will continue to be evaluated with standard surveys and with gillnet only surveys targeting Walleye in the coming years.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches during the 14 previous surveys have ranged from 0.3 to 10.3/net, with an average of 3.3/net. The 2020 Walleye catch of 1.75/gill net was lower than the three previous nettings and below the long-term average. Mean length and weight were a respectable and similar to previous surveys at 17.5 inches and 1.9 lbs in 2020. Walleyes continued to grow well and averaged 16.5 inches by age 4, with growth slowing slight after age 6. Five year classes were present, which met the management goal of 4 year classes.  The 2014 year class (age 6) and 2016 year class (age 4) were most common, accounting for 71% of the Walleyes sampled. The 2018 year class (age 2), though not abundant in the gill net, was represented in the sample, indicating some survival of young fish. All Walleyes appeared to be from stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nA lower abundance of Northern Pike often results in better survival of stocked Walleye and a better pike size distribution. The Northern Pike abundance was the lowest since 1980 and the second lowest of all time at 2.4/gill net. While overall Northern Pike abundance has been declining in Waukenabo Lake, there has also been a subsequent improvement in size distribution with over 25% of the catch measuring 24 inches or larger in each of the last three surveys; all higher than previous surveys from 1970 to 2010. Historically, total catches have ranged from 2.0 to 10.5/gill net, with an average of 5.2/gill net. Interestingly, other nearby lakes have also shown declining trends in abundance for Northern Pike in the last 25 years. Mean length and weight were respectable at 22.1 inches and 2.7 lbs, with 20 percent of these fish measuring 26 inches or longer in length. Also, the number of fish larger than 24 inches has increased over time. Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they generally have beneficial effects on fish communities. <br> \n <br> \nHistorical abundance of Black Crappies in gill nets has ranged from 1.0 to 17.0/gill net, with a 2020 catch rate of 7.0/gill net. This is similar to the 2018 catch rate of 7.4/gill net. Black Crappie averaged 7.5 inches with individuals sampled up to 12.2 inches. Ages ranged from 1-10 years suggesting consistent crappie recruitment, which appears to be more consistent than in other area lakes. The age 2 (2018 year class) was abundant and made up nearly 60 percent of the sample. Growth rates were at or above normal compared to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish including Walleye. Past catch rates have been variable, ranging from 1.0 to 18.3/gill net and have averaged 5.4 gill net since 1949. The lowest catch of 1.0/gill net occurred in 2018, although it increased slightly to 1.7/gill net in 2020, there has been a downward trend overtime. <br> \n <br> \nThere are Largemouth Bass present in the lake as they have been sampled in each survey going back to 1995. Based on gill net and past electrofishing catches their numbers appear to have increased over time, similar to other lakes in the area. Anecdotal information suggests anglers are having some success fishing for them. <br> \n</p>",

The growth rates for the third through the eighth increments were slow. Bluegill sampled ranged from two to five years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988. Slow growth was indicated for the second increment, the fourth increment showed fast growth length at formation of the fifth annulus was normal. Black crappie sampled ranged from one to four years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1989. The growth rate for the third increment was faster than normal. Yellow perch sampled ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class in 1987 and no fish sampled from the 1985 age class. The growth rates for the first and second increments were slow. Walleye sampled ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1986 which corresponds to a fingerling stocking. The growth rate for the first increment was slow. The growth rates for the second and third increments were faster than normal. The gill net index for northern pike indicates a significant increase in abundance since the 1985 assessment. The gill net index for walleye indicates a significant decrease in abundance since the 1985 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Waukenabo Lake is diverse and consists of both small and large fishes. This survey revealed that the fish community in the lake is relatively stable. The abundance of most species are within the range of what is normal for lakes of this type. Black crappies, however, were caught at above average rates in this survey. This represents a large increase from 1990.  Most of the crappies came from the 1990 and 1991 year classes. These year classes averaged between seven and eight inches long. The large abundance of crappies will provide higher catch rates for crappie anglers in the next few years and eventually produce a few bigger fish. The number of big crappies will be limited by slow growth caused by overabundance.  Northern pike up to 28.2 inches were captured in the gill nets and the mean length was a respectable 19.3 inches. The net catch rate was close to the average for lakes of this type and northern pike should continue to provide adequate fishing. Bluegills were caught at slightly low levels for this type of lake. Bluegills ranged up to 9.2 inches in the trap nets and 48% of the fish were at least 7.0 inches long. The abundance of bluegills larger than seven inches has increased since the 1990 assessment, indicating an improving bluegill fishery. Recruitment is somewhat variable yet consistent enough to provide adequate fishing into the near future.  Walleyes were caught at normal rates for this type of lake.  Walleyes in the gill nets ranged from 11.3 up to 27.1 inches long and averaged a respectable 17.5 inches long. Most of the walleyes came from the 1992 year class and averaged about 12.9 inches long.  Natural reproduction of walleyes is very limited in Waukenabo Lake and the population may have to be maintained through stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is a 644 acre lake less than a mile off of Highway 169 about 14 miles north northeast of Aitkin.  There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake, which can be reached by South Waukenabo Lake Road.  The lake is moderately shallow having a maximum depth of 38 feet.  Nearly half of the lake is less than fifteen feet deep.  The diverse habitats from rocky shoreline and deeply sloping contours to islands of emergent vegetation support a varied fish community with many desirable qualities.  The abundances of most species have been stable and within the range of what are normal for this lake class over the assessment history.  Black crappie, however, has shown a marked increase in abundance since 1995.  Black crappies were caught in gill nets in both 1995 and 2000 assessment work at levels far above normal for this lake type.  With an average size of close to 8 inches and four strong year-classes, 1994 to 1998, the crappie population should present anglers with some nice opportunities in the near future.  Beginning in 1990 bluegill abundance increased, although the abundance remains at a level that is within expectation for this lake class.  The average size of bluegills netted in the trap nets decreased from 6.7 in 1995 to 5.2 inches in 2000.  A healthy population of largemouth bass exist in Waukenabo Lake with fish over eighteen inches available.  The northern pike population appears to go through cycles of high and low abundance.  The abundance of northern pike during the 2000 survey work was toward the lower end of the normal range with 4.9 fish per gill net lift.  This represents a decrease from the level observed in 1990.  The average size northern pike caught in this survey was nearly 20 inches.  Only two northern pike longer than 26 inches were observed in this survey.  The walleye population, which is partially sustained through fingerling stocking, remained stable within a normal range for this lake type.  There is also evidence that natural reproduction plays a role in building this population.  The abundance indexed in 2000 actually represents a 30-year high, which anglers may notice.  The size structure of the walleye population is very good with a 19-inch average for fish sampled in this survey.  The yellow perch population abundance is the lowest that it has been since the beginning of assessment work in 1949.  The index of 1.2 fish per gill net is below normal for this lake type, which explains poor growth of older northern pike and walleye.  Releasing northern pike above 22 inches is a beneficial practice that will help improve the quality of many of the fish populations in this lake including yellow perch.  An increased presence of large northern pike helps maintain a normal abundance of small pike, thereby easing predation pressure on forage fish such as yellow perch.  A healthy perch population is also thought to promote desirable sized bluegills.  Everything is related. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waukenabo Lake is a 644 acre lake less than a mile off of Highway 169 and about 14 miles north northeast of Aitkin. There is a designated public access on the south side of the lake, on South Waukenabo Lake Road. The lake is moderately shallow having a maximum depth of 38 feet. Nearly half of the lake is less than fifteen feet deep. The diverse habitats range from rocky shoreline and steep contours to islands of emergent vegetation that support a varied fish community with many desirable qualities. Waukenabo has a history of lake surveys dating back to 1949 and the earliest record of fish stocking activity dates back to the 1920's. Some decent angling opportunities exist for a number of species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass. The relative abundance of most species has fluctuated some over the years, but has remained within the range of what is considered normal for this lake class over the assessment history.  Black crappie abundance seems to have peaked in the late 1990's with an all time high documented in the 2000 survey at 17 fish per gillnet. The 2005 gill net catch rates declined to 2.25 per net, which is near the historical average and still above the 50% quartile for this lake class.  The 2001 year class of crappies is strong and currently ranges from 7 to 8 inches in length. Northern pike catch rates varied from 3 to 10 fish per gill net lift since 1949 and are at 4.3 per net, which is near the lower end of their normal range. The largest pike sampled was 30.5 inches long and 14% were 24 inches and larger.  The walleye population was down from a 30 year high of 3.8 per net in 2000 to 1.25 per net in 2005.  Fifteen walleye from seven different age classes were represented in the survey and one fish was 22.5 inches long and 21 years old.  All but one of the walleyes were from years where stocking had occurred, indicating poor natural reproduction. The size structure of the walleye population is very good with a 20-inch average for fish sampled in this survey.  Yellow perch abundance is below the normal range for this lake class at 2.8 per gill net.  Yellow perch catches have been dropping since the beginning of assessment work when there were 18.3 per net in the 1949 survey. Releasing northern pike above 22 inches is a beneficial practice that will help improve the quality of many of the fish populations in this lake including yellow perch. An increased presence of large northern pike helps maintain a normal abundance of small pike, thereby easing predation pressure on forage fish such as yellow perch.  A healthy perch population is also thought to promote desirable sized bluegills by foraging on young bluegill and keeping abundance in balance with the food supply. The bluegill population increased in the late 1980's and has remained between 9 and 13 per trap net since 1986.  Largemouth bass up to 18 inches were also sampled in the survey.  Responsible shoreline management practices are encouraged to protect habitat and enhance fish populations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on August 10-11, 2015. This survey was completed in addition to the standard survey conducted the week of August 17, 2015. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but two sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 7 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, banded killifish, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nWaukenabo lake falls within lake class 27 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 2 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 45 (90% CI 36-54) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 64. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 resurvey, calculated from this survey was 50.3. While this score was above the threshold level and was an improvement over the IBI score observed in 2010 (43.7), it did fall within the confidence limits for the impairment threshold, suggesting that the fish community health could be improved.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
