Northern pike average 18.9\" long with the largest being 25.8\".  Yellow perch may be the more appealing species to anglers in this lake.  The perch average 8.3\" long with the largest being 12.4\".  This may also offer anglers a good shore fishing opportunity.  The predator/prey relationship between pike and perch and the overall lack of fishing pressure on this lake make for fairly stable populations and no changes are expected. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
