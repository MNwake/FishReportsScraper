                "narrative": "<p>Located just north of Alexandria, Lake Ida offers a wide variety of quality recreational opportunities.  This heavily developed lake has maintained good water quality as well as excellent fishing opportunities.  Midsummer secchi disk transparency was 9.5 feet.  Sand beaches dominate the residentially developed shoreline.  Lake Ida also supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Cattail is abundant on the southwest shore and also fringes the bays on the west side.  Hardstem bulrush is plentiful along the east-central shore and north of Betsy Ross Resort on the northwest corner.  Submergent vegetation is also abundant around the lake,  especially in the western bays.  This vegetation is vital to the preservation of the good water quality.  It competes with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake and also provides nesting and spawning habitat for fish.Quality fishing for numerous species is common on Lake Ida.  The lake is well known for its productive walleye fishing.  Consistent catches have been reported all season.  Fishing techniques may need to be altered due to the water clarity.  If the fish aren?t in shallow water, you may need to look for them as deep as 40 feet.  Early season anglers target fish in 19 feet along Pilgrim?s Point.   Midsummer anglers have been experimenting with down riggers and planing boards with excellent success.  By running their lures just above the thermocline, they target larger fish feeding on tullibee.  Fall anglers may want to fish the shallows at night with Rapalas.  Black crappie are heavily fished in the spring.  Although test-net numbers are low, local reports of good catches would suggest great opportunities for success.  Look for these fish in the bays on the west side and in the hardstem bulrush on the east-central side.  Be aware that two bays along the western shore are Posted Spawning Areas.  Boating and fishing are prohibited in these areas  until June 30.  Nice catches of quality bluegill can also be found in the shallows during the spring and early summer. Largemouth bass are very abundant and size structure of the population should provide quality angling opportunities.  Fish up to 19 inches were sampled.  The best bets during the early season would be in the emergent vegetation around the lake.  Summer anglers have the best luck using deep water techniques due to the clear water.  Deep weedlines are a favorite with plastic worms or jigs.  Smallmouth bass are also present.  Although few fish were sampled, anglers often pick them up when walleye fishing.  Stoney Point has good potential for these fish with boulders on the north side and a ledge on the south side.  A cooperative project between the DNR and the Lake Ida Association built and placed 10 smallmouth bass spawning structures in the lake to enhance natural reproduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is a 4,427-acre, moderately fertile basin located northwest of Alexandria.  Maximum depth exceeds 100 feet.  Mean depth is approximately 28 feet.  Lake Ida lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and is connected to Lake Miltona to the north and Lake Charley to the south via non-navigable channels.  Water quality and clarity are very good.  Average water clarity measurements have increased to exceed 15 feet during summer months following infestation of zebra mussels in 2013.  Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, and vast areas of emergent and submergent vegetation.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressure can be heavy, especially on weekend days during summer months.\n  \nThree lake access sites are available for public use. Two on the east side and one on the north.  The north access has limited parking space. This access can also be relatively shallow during low water periods.  Launching of large boats at this site can be challenging.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off of the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of this basin) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay). These areas are typically posted with caution signs. \n \nPrimary fish management is directed at Walleye and Lake Ida has long supported a robust fishery.  Annual fry and periodic fingerling stockings are programmed in efforts to supplement natural reproduction.  The Lake Ida Association also stocks Walleye fingerlings by permit.  Walleye abundance has declined in recent years due to poor survival of young fish.  Fall electrofishing surveys and age structure of Walleye captured during the 2019 survey provide evidence of little survival and recruitment of young fish into the population from 2015-2018.  Mean length and weight of 2019 captures was 18.5 inches and 2.4 pounds.\n\nLake Ida supports both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are abundant and anglers can expect good fishing success.  Largemouth Bass in spring electrofishing catches averaged 12.9 inches and fish up to 19.5 inches were measured.  Smallmouth Bass numbers have increased in recent years. This population has typically been less abundant than Largemouth Bass, but average size of Smallmouth Bass is larger than that of Largemouth Bass.  Mean length of Smallmouth Bass caught during the 2015 survey was 14.3 inches.  Multiple fish measuring over 19 inches were captured.\n\nNorthern Pike catches have moderated from that of past surveys.  Currently, catch rates are typical of what is expected for this type of lake.  Pike exceeding 30.0 inches are present but smaller, slow growing \"hammer-handle\" pike dominated the pike captures in 2019.  An occasional Muskellunge has been captured during previous surveys.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is likely a result of downstream emigration from Lake Miltona.\n\nPanfish anglers will encounter an abundant population of Bluegill.  Fishing quality for this species is considered fair to good. Mean length of Bluegill captured in 2019 was 5.8 inches and fish up to 9 inches were observed.  Angler catches of larger sunfish are common.  Black Crappie are also abundant.  Mean and maximum lengths of Black Crappie captured in 2019 were 9.7 and 12.4 inches.  Rock Bass sustain an abundant population and contribute to fishing, but relatively few are harvested.  Yellow Perch abundance is low and harvestable-size perch are rare.\n\nLake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest Tullibee, also referred to as Cisco.  Lake Ida is one of only two lakes in the Glenwood Management Area where sport gill netting for this species is allowed.\n\nOther species captured during the 2019 survey included Bullheads (Brown and Yellow), Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2023.\n\nFishing pressure can be seasonally heavy, particularly for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Walleye, while other gamefish populations are under-utilized. To help maintain fish community balance and quality fishing experiences, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest strategies. Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and increased harvest of more abundant smaller or under-exploited fishes such as Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  Harvest of smaller pike from Lake Ida is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Lower numbers of hammer-handle Northern Pike should also improve survival of young Walleye.\n\nWalleye anglers should exercise restraint while fishing in deep water. Walleyes occupy depths at or in excess of 60 feet in fall, winter, and spring months.  Walleyes caught at depths in excess of 30 feet, or one atmosphere, are subject to water pressure changes that result in over-inflation of their swim bladder which can force their stomach to protrude outside the mouth. The extended gas bladder prevents captured fish from leaving the water surface and moving into deeper water for some time. Delayed mortality of these fish is often high. It is wasteful and counterproductive to management efforts to practice catch and release of Walleyes from deep water.\n\nLake Ida is designated as an infested waterbody due to presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2013.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is a 4,432-acre, moderately fertile basin located northwest of Alexandria.  Maximum depth exceeds 100 feet.  Mean depth is approximately 28 feet.  Lake Ida lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and is connected to Lake Miltona to the north and Lake Charley to the south via non-navigable channels.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Water clarity has increased since establishment of zebra mussels and often exceeds 15 feet during summer months.  Residential development surrounds much of the lake.  Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, and vast areas of emergent and submergent vegetation.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressure can be heavy, especially on weekend days during summer months.  Three access sites are available for public use. Two on the east shore and one on the north.  The north access has limited parking and is relatively shallow.  Launching of large boats at this site can be challenging, especially during low water periods.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of the lake) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay). These areas are typically posted with caution signs.  Primary fish management efforts are focused on Walleye with bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  <br> \n  <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2023 to assess the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Lake Ida is well known as a quality Walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance (7.3 fish/gill net) has increased since the record-low level that was documented in 2019.  Higher abundance can be attributed to increased survival and recruitment of young fish in recent years.  Approximately 84% of the gill net sample was comprised of Walleye age 4 or younger.  The dominant 2019 year class accounted for almost 60% of gill net captures.  Mean size of Walleye captured in 2023 was 17.2 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Lake Ida supports both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are more abundant but average size of Smallmouth Bass tends to be larger.  Maximum lengths of bass sampled in 2023 were 17.7 inches for Largemouth and 18.5 inches for Smallmouth.  Panfish populations, particularly Bluegill and Black Crappie, are abundant.  Current size structure for Bluegill is considered fair to good.  Mean length of Bluegill captured in 2023 was 5.3 inches for trap nets and 6.6 inches for gill nets.  Angler catches of larger sunfish are common.  Current size structure of crappie is considered good.  Mean and maximum lengths of Black Crappie captured in 2023 were 10.1 and 12.2 inches.  Rock Bass sustain an abundant population and contribute to fishing, but relatively few are harvested.  Yellow Perch abundance is low and harvestable-size perch are rare.  Northern Pike are not abundant (4.5 fish/gill net) but size structure of this population has improved in recent years.  Average size in 2023 was 24.2 inches and 3.3 pounds.  The largest pike measured was just over 36 inches.  Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018 to help improve pike size structure.  Lake Ida is located in the North-Central Zone.  Anglers can keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  One Muskellunge, a 45-inch individual, was captured during the 2023 survey.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is from downstream emigration from Lake Miltona.  Lake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest Tullibee, also referred to as Cisco or Lake Herring, and is one of only two lakes in the Glenwood Management Area where sport gill netting for this species is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2023 survey included Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2027. <br> \n <br> \nLake Ida is designated as an infested waterbody due to presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2013.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is a large (4,427 acres), moderately fertile basin located northwest of Alexandria.  Maximum depth exceeds 100 feet.  Mean depth is approximately 28 feet.  Lake Ida is connected to Lake Miltona to the north and Lake Charley to the south via non-navigable channels.  Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate to heavy.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Average water clarity measurements typically exceed 10 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressures can be high, especially on weekend days during summer months.  Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, emergent and submergent vegetation, etc.  <br> \n <br> \nFish management investments are focused on sustaining a consumptive walleye fishery.  Annual fry and periodic fingerling stockings are programmed in efforts to supplement natural reproduction and sustain high walleye numbers and catch rates.  The 2011 catch rate was the highest it has been since the mid-1990s.  Current walleye size structure meets management objectives.  Mean length and weight of 2011 captures was 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Recent fall electofishing surveys and current age structure data suggest moderate to strong year classes have been produced in recent years.  Walleye abundance and fishing success are projected to remain strong in coming years as these younger, smaller fish recruit to the sport fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and smallmouth bass are relatively abundant and anglers can expect good fishing success.  Smallmouth numbers have increased in recent years.  This population typically exhibits lower abundance but larger average size when compared to the largemouth population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance increased in response to above-average precipitation and high water through the mid- and late-1990s.  Currently, catch rates are higher than what is expected for this type of lake.  Pike exceeding 30 inches are present but smaller, slow growing \"hammer-handle\" pike dominate the population.  An occasional muskellunge has been captured during lake surveys.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is extremely low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is likely a result of downstream emigration from Lake Miltona. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers will encounter an abundant population of bluegill.  Fishing quality for this species is considered fair to good.  Mean length of bluegill captured in 2011 was 5.4 inches.  Angler catches of larger sunfish are common during summer months.  Black crappie are present at low to moderate densities.  Mean and maximum lengths of black crappie captured in 2011 were 8.6 and 12.9 inches.  Rock bass sustain an abundant population and contribute to fishing, but relatively few are harvested.  Yellow perch abundance is low and harvestable-size perch are rare.  Lake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest tullibee (cisco).  <br> \n <br> \nThree lake access sites are available for public use.  The north access has limited parking space.  This access can also be relatively shallow during low water periods. Launching larger boats can be problematic.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off of the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of this basin) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay).  These areas are posted with caution signs.  There is also a posted fish spawning area, located at the entrance of a bay near Betsy Ross Resort on the northwest shoreline.  Fishing is prohibited within the posted area during the spring spawning season. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure can be seasonally heavy, particularly for black crappie and walleye, while other gamefish populations are under-utilized.  To help maintain fish community balance and quality fishing experiences, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest strategies.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and increased harvest of more abundant smaller or under-exploited fishes.  Harvest of smaller pike from Lake Ida is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Lower numbers of hammer-handle northern pike should also improve survival of young walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye anglers should exercise constraint while fishing in deep water.  Walleye occupy depths at or in excess of 60 feet in fall, winter, and spring months.  Walleye caught at depths in excess of 30 feet, or one atmosphere, are subject to water pressure changes that result in over-inflation of their swim bladder which can force their stomach to protrude outside the mouth.  The extended gas bladder prevents captured fish from leaving the water surface and moving into deeper water for some time.  Delayed mortality of these fish is often high.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2011 survey included bigmouth buffalo, bullheads (black, brown, and yellow), bowfin (dogfish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2015.   <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

There are also numerous areas of rubble substrate that providessuitable spawning habitat for walleye.Walleye gillnet catches averaged 10.9 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (4.0 -9.6 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catchesranged from 4.8 to 19.0 fish/net in previous lake surveys dating back to 1979.  Mean weight of fishcaptured in 1995 was 1.4 pounds.  Approximately one-half of the fish captured were 15.0 inches in totallength or greater.  Northern pike catches averaged 8.9 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches ranged from 4.9to 14.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes is 3.0 - 7.9 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 1.9 pounds. Approximately one-third of the fish captured were 21 inches in total length or greater.  Largemouthbass are abundant.  Electrofishing yielded 100.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight offish captured was 1.0 pounds.  About 60% of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greater and5% exceeded 15 inches in length.  Bluegill catches averaged 28.2 fish/trapnet and 24.2 fish/gillnet.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ida Lake was conducted the week of July 25, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing  was completed at all 24 sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 18 stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 28 species of fish including eleven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was nearly equal to the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 22 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Ida Lake is in very good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Lake Ida lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and is connected to Lake Miltona to the north and Lake Charley to the south via non- navigable channels. Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate to heavy. Water quality and clarity are good. Average water clarity measurements typically exceed 10 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressure can be high, especially on weekend days during summer months. Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, and vast areas of emergent and submergent vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nLake Ida is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2013. Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following:  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> \n <br> \nPrimary fish management is directed at Walleyes.  Annual fry and periodic fingerling stockings are programmed in efforts to supplement natural reproduction.  The Lake Ida Association also stocks Walleye fingerlings by permit.  High Walleye abundance is difficult to sustain in large lakes through supplemental stocking. Successful natural reproduction is key to sustaining quality Walleye fisheries in these waters. Current Walleye abundance is considered high.  In fact, the 2015 catch rate was the highest it has been since the mid-1990s. Mean length and weight of 2015 captures was 16.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Recent fall electrofishing surveys and current age structure data suggest moderate to strong year classes have been produced in recent years. Walleye abundance and fishing success are projected to remain strong in coming years as these younger, smaller fish grow into the sport fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLake Ida supports both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are abundant and anglers can expect good fishing success.  Spring electrofishing catches averaged 11.5 inches.  The largest Largemouth Bass captured measured 18.9 inches.  Smallmouth Bass numbers have increased in recent years. This population typically exhibits lower abundance but larger average size when compared to the largemouth population.  Mean length of Smallmouth Bass captured during the 2015 survey was 16.9 inches.  The largest measured 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased in response to above-average precipitation and high water through the mid- and late-1990s.  Currently, catch rates are higher than what is expected for this type of lake.  Pike exceeding 30.0 inches are present but smaller, slow growing \"hammer-handle\" pike dominate the population.  An occasional Muskellunge has been captured during lake surveys.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is extremely low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is likely a result of downstream emigration from Lake Miltona. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers will encounter an abundant population of Bluegill. Fishing quality for this species is considered fair to good. Mean length of Bluegills captured in 2015 was 5.7 inches.  Angler catches of larger sunfish are common during summer months.  Black Crappie are also abundant.  In fact, record-high crappie abundance was documented in 2015.  Mean and maximum lengths of Black Crappie captured in 2015 were 8.9 and 13.7 inches.  Rock Bass sustain an abundant population and contribute to fishing, but relatively few are harvested. Yellow Perch abundance is low and harvestable-size perch are rare.  Lake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest Tullibee, also referred to as Cisco, and is one of only two lakes in the Glenwood Management Area where sport gill netting for this species is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nThree lake access sites are available for public use. The north access has limited parking space. This access can also be relatively shallow during low water periods.  Launching of large boats at this site can be challenging.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off of the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of this basin) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay). These areas are posted with caution signs.  There is also a posted fish spawning area, located at the entrance of a bay near Betsy Ross Resort on the northwest  shoreline.  Fishing is prohibited within the posted area during the spring spawning season. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure can be seasonally heavy, particularly for Black Crappie and Walleye, while other gamefish populations are under-utilized. To help maintain fish community balance and quality fishing experiences, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest strategies. Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and increased harvest of more abundant smaller or under-exploited fishes.  Harvest of smaller pike from Lake Ida is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Lower numbers of hammer-handle Northern Pike should also improve survival of young Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye anglers should exercise restraint while fishing in deep water. Walleyes occupy depths at or in excess of 60 feet in fall, winter, and spring months.  Walleyes caught at depths in excess of 30 feet, or one atmosphere, are subject to water pressure changes that result in over-inflation of their swim bladder which can force their stomach to protrude outside the mouth. The extended gas bladder prevents captured fish from leaving the water surface and moving into deeper water for some time. Delayed mortality of these fish is often high. It is wasteful and counterproductive to management efforts to practice catch and release of Walleyes from deep water. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2015 survey included Bullheads (Brown and Yellow), Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2019. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is primarily managed for walleye with bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  Gill netting data indicated that walleye abundance was relatively low in 2003; only 3.9 walleye per net were captured in 2003.  Despite one of the lowest walleye gill net catches ever documented on Lake Ida, angler reports for larger walleye were encouraging during fall 2003.  Size structure of the 2003 capture sample was good with over 55% of the sample exceeding 15 inches in length.  Sixteen percent of the sample exceeded 20 inches.  Mean weight of walleyes was 1.7 pounds.  Fall electrofishing efforts indicated that a strong year class was produced in 2001 and moderate year classes were produced in 2002 and 2003.  Thus, walleye abundance will likely improve as these year classes grow and become available to anglers.  Because of the continued decline in walleye abundance over the past decade an aggressive stocking program has been initiated on Lake Ida.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2000 and 2003.  Success of these stocking efforts has been highly variable and it's difficult to sustain high walleye abundance in a lake the size of Lake Ida with supplemental stocking.  Successful natural reproduction and recruitment are the keys to improving and maintaining walleye abundance.Anglers targeting northern pike and largemouth bass can expect moderate to high numbers of medium-sized fish.  Smallmouth bass are present in Lake Ida but little is known about this population because this species is difficult to sample.  However, angler reports suggest that smallmouth bass fishing can be exceptional at times.  The bluegill population exhibited moderate to high abundance and was dominated by fish between 6 and 8 inches in length.  In fact, size structure of the population in 2003 was the highest documented in recent years.  Yellow perch abundance was extremely low in 2003 and most fish sampled were smaller individuals.  Hopefully, this species will rebound in the near future because of its importance as a prey item for many predatory fishes.  Black crappie numbers have increased in recent years but this population is still characterized as relatively low density.  Size structure of the population was low due to the strong 2001 year class.  Crappie size should improve in the future as this year class moves through the fishery.Other species with high abundance in 2003 were rock bass and brown and yellow bullheads.  At times, these species might be a nuisance to anglers that are targeting other game fishes.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 15, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 23 stations, with three sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 16 stations and a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, site conditions prevented seining at 3 stations. The nearshore sampling captured 29 native fish species including ten species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake Ida based on this survey is exceptionally high, and well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

The two strongest year classes of Walleyes correspond with fry stockings. Northern Pike numbers are high and very similar to 1984. There were 12.53 northern pike/gillnet in 1984 and 12.20 Northern Pike/gillnet in 1985. Yellow Perch have decreased in abundance from 26.07/gillnet in 1984 to 1984 to 20.60/gillnet in 1985. This decrease isn't significant and still should provide adequate forage. Although Bluegill numbers have decreased they are still abundant. With the decrease comes an increase in size with 42% of the Bluegills being over 6 inches. Bass and Northern Cisco also contribute to the sport fishery. The Smallmouth Bass population in Lake Ida is probably one of the best in the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance increased dramatically since the 1985 survey, from 5.5 Walleye/gillnet to 19.0 Walleyes/gillnet. This increase may be due to a change in assessment times. The 1984, 1985 and the present 1986 assessments all show the 1982 year class to be very strong. The 1982 year class is probably the result of a fry stocking. The 1984 year class also appears to be strong and is probably the result of a fingerling stocking. The growth of age 3 to 5 year old walleyes seems to be slow (This may be due to the strong 1982 year class). Yellow Perch gillnet indices have dropped from 20.6 in 1985 to 8.7 in 1986. Bluegill abundance has decreased since the last survey (69.3/ net in 1985 to 37.2/net in 1986) but in both cases this may be due to when the assessments, while the mean size has increased to 2.04lbs/Northern Pike. Smallmouth Bass are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ida is a large (4,289 acres), moderately fertile basin located northwest of Alexandria.  Mean depth is approximately 28.0 feet.  Maximum depth exceeds 100.0 feet.  Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate to heavy.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Average water clarity measurements typically exceed 10.0 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressure can be high, especially on weekend days during summer months.  Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, emergent and submergent vegetation, etc.  <br> \n <br> \nFish management investments are focused on sustaining a consumptive walleye fishery.  Annual fry and periodic fingerling stockings are programmed in efforts to supplement natural reproduction and sustain high walleye numbers and catch rates.  DNR stockings are augmented with fingerlings purchased and stocked by the Lake Ida Association. The intense stocking program has resulted in elevated survey catches in some years, but has yet to sustain desired population objectives.  Catches during the 2007 survey exceeded that of the prior two surveys, but walleye abundance can be described as average when compared to similar lakes across Minnesota.  Size structure of 2007 population sample meets management objectives.  Mean length and weight of 2007 captures was 16.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Walleye abundance and fishing success are projected to increase in coming years in response to above average catches of young fish observed in 2006 and 2007 fall electrofishing surveys.  Successful natural reproduction and subsequent recruitment are necessary to sustaining a quality walleye fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and smallmouth bass are abundant and anglers can expect good fishing success.  Smallmouth are not as common as largemouth, but abundance has increased in recent years.   Size distribution of largemouth and smallmouth bass population samples were remarkably similar in 2007.  Smallmouth bass averaged 13.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass averaged 12.8 inches and 1.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance increased in response to above-average precipitation and high water through the mid- and late-1990's.  Currently, catch rates are higher than what is expected for this type of lake.  Pike exceeding 30.0 inches are present but smaller, slow growing \"hammer-handle\" pike dominate the population.  Harvest of these smaller pike is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Lower numbers of hammer-handle northern pike should also improve survival of young walleye.  An occasional muskellunge has been captured during lake surveys.  One 52-inch muskie was collected during the 2007 survey.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is extremely low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is likely a result of downstream emigration from Lake Miltona. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers will encounter an abundant population of bluegill.  Fishing quality afforded by bluegill is fair to good.  Mean length of those captured during the 2007 survey was 6.0 inches. Angler catches of eight-inch and larger sunfish are common during summer months.  Black crappie are present at low to moderate density.  Size structure of this population is considered moderate.  Mean length during the 2007 survey was 8.0 inches.  Most harvest occurs in advance of and during the spring spawning period.  Rock bass sustain a moderately abundant population and contribute to fishing.  Relatively few are harvested.  Eight-inch or larger yellow perch are rare.  Few escape predation to grow to a harvestable size.  Lake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest tullibee and large yellow bullheads.   <br> \n <br> \nThree lake access sites are available for public use.  The north access has limited parking space.  This access can also be relatively shallow during low water periods.  Launching larger boats can be problematic.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off of the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of this basin) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay).  These areas are posted with caution signs.  There is also a posted fish spawning area, located at the entrance of a bay near Betsy Ross Resort on the northwest shoreline.  Fishing is prohibited within the posted area during the spring spawning season. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure can be seasonally heavy, particularly for black crappie and walleye, while other gamefish populations are under-utilized.  To help maintain fish community balance and quality fishing experiences, anglers are encouraged to adopt selective or smart harvest strategies.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and increased harvest of more abundant smaller or under-exploited fishes.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye anglers should exercise constraint while fishing in deep water.  Walleye occupy depths in excess of 60 feet in fall, winter, and spring months.  Walleye caught at depths in excess of 30 feet or one atmosphere are subject to water pressure changes that result in over-inflation of their swim bladder which can force their stomach to protrude outside the mouth.  The extended gas bladder prevents captured fish from leaving the water surface and moving into deeper water for some time.  Such captures can be seen floating on the surface where they are subjected to predation from birds, gill desiccation, or even sunburn, which can lead to secondary infections and eventual mortality.  It is wasteful and counterproductive to management efforts to practice catch and release of walleye from deep water.  Many released fish will die from stress of the capture.  Catch and harvest what you need for a meal and move on.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
