Most of the brook trout taken in this assessment were age-3 fish from the 1995 stocking.

Turnip lake supported an estimated population of just 42 brook trout in late September 2005 (19 to 105 fish, at a 95% confidence level).  That estimate was low compared to other lakes in the area, and compared to past estimates made on Turnip Lake.No undesirable fish species were collected in Turnip lake in 2005, as has been the case in all other past assessments. Other than brook trout, the lake is known to support a small number of minnow species.The special regulations covering Turnip lake were changed in 2005 to make this a catch-and-release only lake.

In recent years, there has been considerable evidence of illegal fishing with live bait, harvest of fish under 18 inches, and harvest of excessive numbers of fish.Brook trout over 18 inches have not been caught by assessment netting in Turnip Lake.  The largest have been 16 or 17 inches long.  There are a large number of fish 12, 13, and 14 inches long present.  This provides a catch-and-release fishery, and the opportunity to catch more brook trout during a trip than would normally be caught under standard regulations.</p>",

Violations have been common, however, including use of live bait, harvesting fish under     18 inches, and exceeding the daily limit.          Brook trout over 18 inches long have not been caught by assessment netting in Turnip Lake.  The largest have been 16 or 17 inches long.  There     are a large number of fish 12, 13, and 14 inches long, however.  This provides a catch-and-release fishery, and the opportunity to catch more     brook trout during a trip than would normally be caught under standard regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turnip Lake is a designated stream trout lake that has been managed as a trophy trout fishery for the last 30 years.  Currently it is covered under a special regulation closing the lake to winter angling, and allowing only catch-and-release fishing, with artificial lures and flies only (no live bait) during the open-water stream trout season.  Goals for the lake, from the 2018 lake management plan, are to maintain a Brook Trout population with a minimum of two catchable-sized (over 10-inch) year classes, with 10 percent of fish over 12 inches also exceeding 16 inches in length.  The 2018 plan reduced the stocking frequency in this lake from annual to every even-numbered year, beginning in 2020.  This was the first of three targeted, non-lethal, surveys scheduled in the plan to evaluate the change in stocking.  The survey used small (80-ft-long) graduated-mesh monofilament gill nets that were fished for about 30 minutes, then lifted and reset elsewhere.  A total of 24 such sets were made in 2018, and most of the fish taken survived their capture and were released alive. <br> \n <br> \nBecause of a temporary closure of the state's Crystal Springs hatchery, no Brook Trout were available for stocking this lake in 2016 and 2017.  As a result, only three-year-old (or older) fish were present in 2018, so we could not expect to see a high catch (gill net catches have usually been dominated by younger fish).  We do not know how indicative catches in short-term gill nets are of true trout abundance, and we do not have a local history with this type of netting to give us anything to compare to.  We don't know whether two or more year classes were included in the catch because most of the scales collected during the survey were unreadable.  The one fish we could age was four years old at a length of 17.2 inches.  The size goal from the 2018 plan was met, since all of the fish taken were over 16 inches in length.  A 19.2-inch fish taken in this survey was among the largest ever sampled in this lake.  Clearly Turnip Lake continues to provide trophy trout fishing potential. <br> \n <br> \nNo Rainbow Trout were taken in this survey, but that does not mean there was no survival of those fish.  We do not know how vulnerable Rainbow Trout will be to short-term gill net sets; but experience gained on Trout Lake suggests they may be as difficult to sample with that gear as they have been with standard nets.  Rainbow Trout catches in stream trout lakes in this area have tended to be low, and a catch of zero is not surprising in a lake where only a single year class could be present.  Brook Trout stocking resumed in 2018, after this survey was completed. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
