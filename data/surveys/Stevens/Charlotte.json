Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were possible.  Trap netting results and abundance of dead fish along the shoreline suggested that winterkill was moderate to severe.  The only gamefishes captured were one Black Crappie, one Northern Pike, four Walleye, and 30 Yellow Perch.  Restorative stockings of Black Crappie (140 adults) and Walleye (692,000 fry) were completed during spring 2019.  In absence of future winterkill events, fishable populations for these species likely won't become established until 2021 or later.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Very little community diversity was observed.  Black bullhead were the dominant fish species represented.  Over 400.0 bullhead were captured in each gillnet set.  Black bullhead had a mean weight of 0.26 lbs.  The largest measured were 10.0-10.4 inches long.  Most were too small to have any commercial or sport value.  In 1987-88, 1200 pounds of bullhead were removed from Olson Lake by commercial harvesters. A large number of white suckers were captured in gillnets.  Catch rates averaged 16.7 fish/gillnet. Although they were not aged, they were likely cohorts of the same year class.  They may have come from a bait pond or the Chippewa river during the high water in 1986-87. Yellow perch are very abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 65.3 fish/net.  PSD was 14.0%.  Length frequency data would indicate yellow perch can attain a quality size.  A limited number exceeded 11.0 inches in length.  Winter angling for yellow perch has been substantial in recent years. Six walleye were captured in three gillnet sets.  Mean weight of captured walleye was 3.33 lbs. A few larger fish were observed in trapnet catches .  Walleye growth is extremely fast with age 3 fish averaging 19.0 inches.  Age analyses would suggest natural reproduction may occur or a limited number are being illegally stocked regularly.  Five year classes were represented by the nine fish captured, as age 2 and 3 fish were found.  Walleye may have entered the lake from the Chippewa river during the highwater in 1986 and 1987. One nine-inch carp was observed.  No other species of fish were sampled in the assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Charlotte is a 468-acre, shallow lake located one mile west of Cyrus in Stevens County.  The basin has a mean depth of 13.3 feet and maximum depth of approximately 20.0 feet.  During periods of elevated water levels, the lake is connected to Moore Lake by a small channel on the north shoreline.\n  \nWater clarity and quality are poor due to nutrient enrichment.  Algal blooms are common and can be severe during summer months.  Due to limited water transparency and sunlight penetration to the lake bottom, aquatic vegetation is sparse.  Periodic winterkill events have been documented.  Lake Charlotte was well known for its Yellow Perch fishery and ability to produce \"jumbo\" perch in the late-1980s and early-1990s.  This fishery was eventually depleted or lost to winterkill.\n  \nFish management programming was limited to occasional fish community assessments prior to acquisition and development of a public access in 2008.  Reports from surveys completed in 1990 and 2007 detailed a fish community dominated by roughfishes, namely Black Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and White Sucker.  Low-density populations of Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike offered only fair fishing opportunities.  Walleye fry stockings were initiated in 2008 with public access development and have been sustained in even-numbered years to increase population abundance and enhance fishing potential.  Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 to re-establish that population and expand fish community diversity.\n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2016 to re-assess fish community composition and determine successes of Walleye stockings initiated in 2008.  Survey results described substantial changes to fish community structure.  Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp remained very abundant.  Black Bullhead and White Sucker catch rates were greatly reduced.  Gamefish angling opportunities have improved.  Walleyes are now much more abundant, largely due to contributions of the 2014 fry stocking.  Two-year-old Walleyes made up much of gill net catches.  Mean size of Walleye captures was 12.9 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The largest Walleye captured measured 25.4 inches in length.  Black Crappie abundance increased greatly.  Trap net catches averaged 45.8 crappies/net.  Ages of captures extended from age 1 through age 6.  Reproductive success was particularly good in 2011, 2012, and 2014.  Crappies captured in trap nets averaged 8.7 inches.  An estimated 17% of Crappie captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.\n \nHabitat conditions remain harsh and limiting for sight-feeding and vegetation-dependent gamefishes such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  A low-density Northern Pike population continued to persist in the lake.  Ten were captured in gill nets.  These captures averaged 24.8 inches.  The largest pike captured measured 32.8 inches in length.   No Largemouth Bass or Bluegills were captured during the 2016 survey.  Only 15 Yellow Perch were captured.  These fish were too small to add to the fishery.  The largest perch measured was just 7.2 inches in length.\n\nOther species that have been sampled in Lake Charlotte include Orangespotted Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.       \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Olson Lake (Charlotte) is a 397-acre basin located one mile west of Cyrus.  Rising water levels since the early 1990s has created a navigable connection with Moore Lake on the north side of Olson Lake.  Maximum depth of Olson Lake is 22.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThere is no public access, however, negotiations are ongoing for a parcel located on the northeast side of Olson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality is poor.  Water clarity at time of the survey was only 1.5 feet.  Frequent and severe algae blooms are common during the summer months.  Due to poor water quality, aquatic vegetation is sparse.  Winterkill has been documented in the past and likely continues to influence the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 survey revealed a very low-density northern pike population with a few large individuals.  Mean length of captured pike was 25.8 inches.  The largest fish caught measured 36.6 inches in total length.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 4.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOlson Lake supported an exceptional and very popular yellow perch fishery in 1989 and 1990.  Yellow perch continue to exist at a lower density and could only support a modest fishery.  Perch captures averaged 6.8 inches in total length.  The largest fish measured 11.8 inches in length.  Seven percent of the sample exceeded 10.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nA few black crappie were caught.  Average size of sampled fish was 4.1 inches in length.  One walleye was sampled.  No largemouth bass of bluegill sunfish were observed.  An uncommon member of the sunfish family, orange spotted sunfish, has proliferated in probable absence of predators. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the carrying capacity is comprised of underutilized or undesired fishes.  Bigmouth buffalo has established a population.  Black bullhead are abundant.  Common carp and white sucker made up most of the total number and weight of all fish caught. <br> \n</p>",

Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were possible.  However, trap netting results suggested that winterkill severity was low and restorative stockings were not warranted.  Gamefish species present in early spring included Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. </p>",
