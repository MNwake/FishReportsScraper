                "narrative": "<p>A lake reclamation was carried out on Beetle Lake in the fall of 2016 using rotenone (a plant based fish poison) to eliminate White Suckers from the lake with the hope of improving stream trout fishing opportunities.  This survey was conducted at ice out in 2017 to assess whether or not Brook Trout or White Suckers remained in the lake following the reclamation.  At the same time, a test was carried out to ensure the rotenone had degraded prior to restocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey consisted of one gillnet set in each of the two basins of Beetle Lake and a mini trap net (27 x 39 inch trap net with 4 hoops, 2 frames, 1 throat, and a 25 foot lead made from 1/8 inch netting) set in the northwest basin.  No fish were sampled in either of the gill nets, and one Golden Shiner was sampled in the mini trap net.  These results suggest it is unlikely that Brook Trout or White Sucker survived the reclamation, but that some minnow species survived in small numbers.  These minnows may have either been able to find a small area of refuge or may have been more resistant to the rotenone than Brook Trout and White Sucker were. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were used to test if the rotenone had degraded sufficiently to resume trout stocking.  Rainbow Trout were placed in a trap net with the throat sewn shut and checked after 48 hours.  After 48 hours all of the trout in the net were still alive.  Based on this test, the rotenone had degraded to a level that was suitable for trout survival. <br> \n <br> \nBeetle Lake was stocked in the late spring of 2017 with 1,000 catchable sized Rainbow Trout to provide a fishery for the summer of 2017 because no catchable sized Brook Trout were available.  During fall of 2017, 1,000 small Brook Trout were stocked into Beetle Lake and moving forward Brook Trout will be stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBeetle Lake is located in Northwestern Lake County approximately 15 miles northwest of Isabella.  The lake has a surface area of 30 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  To access the lake from Isabella, travel north on Hwy 1 approximately 10.5 miles, then north on the Bandana Lake Road (USFS Road 383) 5 miles to the northwest end of the lake.  Off of the Bandana Lake Road there is a signed carry-down access (10-15 yards) with parking for 2-3 vehicles.  This access is into a small, shallow bay off of the main lake; it is approximately 600 feet from this access to the main lake.  During the summer of 2017, another access to Beetle Lake was developed by the USFS utilizing a previously gated road and existing campsite on the lake.  To get to this access continue up the Bandana Lake Road another 0.4 miles to an unnumbered USFS road (should be the first right).  Proceed southeast on this road to a gravel parking area (0.4 miles), from this parking area there is a 100 yard foot trail with bollards to prevent direct ATV access to the lake.  There is a USFS campsite on this trail overlooking the lake and stairs from the campsite down to the lake. <br> \n</p>",

Brook Trout yearlings are stocked annually in Beetle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, seven automatic temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 feet from June 1 to October 23, 2017.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location.   <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that in during the summer of 2017, Beetle Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.

A survey was completed in 2019 to monitor the amount of cool, well oxygenated habitat (oxythermal habitat) available for trout during the summer.  Automated temperature loggers were suspended at three foot intervals below the surface to a depth of 21 feet over the deepest spot in the lake to record hourly water temperatures throughout the summer.  In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well-oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicate summer dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures were not limiting factors in Beetle Lake in 2019.  Similar surveys completed in recent years suggest the lake currently maintains good habitat for stream trout throughout the open water season compared to other area lakes.  Oxythermal habitat conditions will continue to be monitored to evaluate the suitability of Beetle Lake for Brook Trout management. <br> \n</p>",

Brook trout, creek chub and various minnow species were the only fish sampled in DNR test nets in the 1999 survey.  Beetle Lake is stocked each spring with 2000 brook trout yearlings.     The brook trout population is about average compared to similar lakes in the Finland Area.  The fish that were collected ranged in size from 10.3 inches to 16.0 inches (1.6 pounds) and averaged 12.0 inches (0.7 pound).  The lake is not normally known for producing large brook trout, however a 3.5 pound individual was caught during the 2000 winter trout season.</p>",

The lake is stocked with 2000 brook trout yearlings each spring.  Access for a small boat or canoe is down a short hill off of U.S. Forest Service Road 383; then through a shallow channel to the west end of the lake.  The shoreline is undeveloped federal land.Brook trout were sampled in average numbers in the 2003 assessment.  The size was excellent, averaging 2.2 pounds.  Fish ranged from 13.9 to 18.3 inches (1.3 to 3.0 pounds).  Although some quality size brook trout have been sampled in Beetle Lake in past assessments, the average size in this assessment was much larger than usual.  White sucker and northern pike were also collected in 2003, both for the first time in this lake.  White sucker were abundant, but small.</p>",

Results indicate White Sucker have yet to recolonize the lake and conditions are still favorable for trout management. Brook Trout catch was higher than previous surveys and a total of 40 Brook Trout were sampled during the survey. Size ranged from 8.7 to 15.3 inches and averaged 11.7 inches and about 0.6 pounds. Two year classes were identified in the sample and growth of Brook Trout appeared to be good. We would expect good growth and survival of stocked fish as long as suckers do not recolonize of the lake.  </p>",

Beetle Lake is located within the Superior National Forest approximately 10 miles northwest of Isabella, MN off the Bandana Lake Road.  The small carry-down access leads to a shallow channel which leads to the northwest corner of the western basin.  The secondary access is a hike-in to a shore fishing area located on the northern shore of the eastern basin.  As Beetle Lake is a designated trout lake it is important to check the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations to follow all rules applicable to designated trout lakes. <br> \n <br> \nStream trout management began in 1949.  Beginning in 2010 Brook Trout yearlings (650) are stocked annually into Beetle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 investigation documented lower numbers of Brook Trout but with above average growth rates compared to other similar Brook Trout lakes in the Finland area.  Brook Trout sampled in the 2014 population assessment averaged 12.7 inches the largest Brook Trout was 16.6 inches (1.9 pounds).  Three year classes were also identified.   <br> \n <br> \nA significant population of small White Suckers was also present in Beetle Lake.  These fish compete with Brook Trout for the forage available in Beetle Lake and may be a nuisance for anglers targeting trout. <br> \n</p>",

A survey was completed in 2024 to monitor the amount of cool, well oxygenated habitat available for trout during the summer. Automated temperature loggers were suspended at depths of three, six, nine, and twelve feet below the surface over the deepest spot in the lake to record water temperatures hourly throughout the summer. In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicated Beetle Lake had preferred Brook Trout temperature and dissolved oxygen levels throughout the summer of 2024. The lake is considered to have good habitat for trout compared to other area lakes managed for Brook Trout.</p>",
