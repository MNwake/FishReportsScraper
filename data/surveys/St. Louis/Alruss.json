Alruss Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller (29 acres) than the lake class average of 100 acres.Alruss Lake was thermally stratified in the spring of 1998 and retained very good oxygen (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 29 ft, where the temperature was 43 F.  Alruss lake has no inlets; the outlet to Sandpit Lake has beaver dams and a waterfall which prevent fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are boulder, sand, ledgerock, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies and three way sedge.The initial biological lake survey in 1965 captured no fish, although minnows were observed in the shallows.  Stream trout have been stocked annually since 1966, except for 1968 and 1976.  Alternate year stockings of rainbow trout and brook trout began in 1989 and continued through 1998.  The 1998 assessment caught five brook trout in two gillnets.  All of the brook trout were age two or older.  One of the four brook trout stomachs examined contained minnows, one contained unidentified fish and a crayfish, and two were empty.None of the rainbow trout fingerlings stocked the previous fall were caught, nor were any rainbows from prior stockings.The catch by weight of 5.5 lb of trout per gillnet in 1998 was lower than the average catch of 10.2 lb per gillnet in seven previous trout assessments in Alruss Lake, but was near the median catch of 6.0 lb per gillnet for recent assessments on 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.</p>",

Alruss Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller (29 acres) than the lake class average of 100 acres.Alruss Lake was thermally stratified on 06/05/2002 and retained good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 42 ft, where the temperature was 42 F. Previous investigations showed that in midsummer, 5 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of about 25 ft, where the temperature was about 60 F. Alruss Lake has no inlets; the outlet to Sandpit Lake has beaver dams and a waterfall which prevent fish movement. Shoal substrates are 44% boulder, 26% sand, 19% ledgerock, and 11% rubble. Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies and three way sedge.This special early summer gillnet assessment for stream trout consisted of one gillnet sets. A second gillnet set was not done due to the high catch of trout in the first set. Two lake surveys and seven special stream trout assessments were previously conducted on Alruss Lake, dating back to 1965. Most of these investigations were done in late May or early June and consisted of 1-2 gillnet sets.The initial lake survey in 1965 caught no fish, although minnows were observed near shore. Stream trout have been stocked annually beginning in 1966, except for 1968 and 1976. Only brook trout have been stocked since 1998.The 2002 assessment caught 12 brook trout in one gillnet. Four of these brook trout, averaging 7.0\" had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings. Seven trout, averaging 13.4\", were age two. One 20\" trout was age three or older. Six of the trout stomachs were empty, while four contained minnows and two contained insect parts.The 2002 trout catch in Alruss Lake of 13.2 lbs/gillnet was higher than the median catch of 9.0 lbs/gillnet for all nine investigations on this lake since trout stocking began, and was higher than the median catch of 5.0 lbs/gillnet in recent investigations on 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Also caught in 2002 were six small white sucker. Low numbers of sucker, generally small, have been captured in every investigation since trout stocking began.  Minnows were also observed in shallow waters by the survey crew in 2002.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Alruss Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Alruss Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nAlruss Lake was thermally stratified on 05/24/2006 with a surface temperature of 62 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F.  Adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 32 feet, where the temperature was 42 F.  Previous investigations showed that in midsummer, 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 25 feet, where the temperature was about 60 F.  Alruss Lake has no inlets.  The outlet to Sandpit Lake has beaver dams and a waterfall that prevent fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 44% boulder, 26% sand, 19% ledgerock, and 11% rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet. The most common plants are yellow waterlilies and three-way sedge.  <br> \n <br> \nThis early summer gillnet assessment for stream trout consisted of two gillnet sets.  Two fisheries lake surveys and eight gillnet assessments were previously conducted on Alruss Lake, dating back to 1965.  Most of these previous investigations were done in late May or early June and consisted of 1-2 gillnet sets. <br> \n <br> \nThe initial fisheries lake survey in 1965 caught no fish, although minnows were observed near the shore.  Rainbow trout, splake, or brook trout have been stocked annually since 1966, except for 1968 and 1976.  Only brook trout have been stocked since 2000. <br> \n <br> \nSeven brook trout (3.5/gillnet) were caught in 2006.  One of these brook trout had been stocked as a fingerling the previous fall and had grown to a length of 6.7 inches when recaptured eight months later.  Six brook trout had been stocked as fingerlings in the fall of 2004 and averaged 13.7 inches (range: 12.6 inches to 14.9 inches) when recaptured 20 months later.  Five of the trout stomachs contained chironomid midge larvae or adults, while one contained a fathead minnow and one was empty. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 trout catch of 3.7 lb/gillnet was lower than the median trout catch of 8.5 lb/gillnet in all investigations on this lake, but was similar to the median trout catch of 4.2 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nAlruss Lake has had a low population of small white sucker since 1978.  The 2006 sucker catch of 2.0/gillnet with an average length of 10.6 inches was similar to previous sucker catches.</p>",

The lake is surrounded by a rolling landscape of pines and mixed hardwoods, had light green tinted water with a secchi depth visibility of 13 feet, and has a maximum depth of 48 feet. Access is by a 90 rod portage from the east side of the pond between Mudro and Fourtown Lakes. The portage from Sandpit Lake (100 rods) was in poor condition at the time of the survey. There are no designated USFS campsites present. Brook trout fingerlings are annually stocked by plane.  <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout numbers were 11/net which is lower than in the previous survey, but higher than the long term average of 6/net for the lake. Fish sizes were similar to past surveys. The average brook trout sampled in 2019 was 12.6 inches long and weighed 1 pound, slightly larger than the long term average of 12 inches. The largest two fish were a respectable 17 inches long. Trout from four year classes appeared to be present, with the smallest fish coming from the previous fall's stocking. Total yield was 11 pounds/net, which ranks in the top ten of Tower area stream trout lakes. Stomach contents indicated that trout were feeding upon a variety of aquatic invertebrates. White sucker numbers and size structure remained low and were also similar to previous surveys. <br> \n</p>",

Minnows are commonly observed near shore. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by a 90 rod, user maintained portage from the east side of the pond between Mudro and Fourtown Lakes. There is another more discrete portage from Sandpit Lake (100 rods) that is poorly maintained. There are no designated USFS campsites present. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout numbers in 2014 (13.0/gill net) were much higher than the long term average of 3.3/gill net from the previous 10 assessments since brook trout stocking began. The average brook trout sampled was 13.6 inches long which is slightly larger than the average length of 12.0 inches for the previous assessments. The largest brookie sampled in 2014 was a very respectable 19.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 brook trout catch of 14.2 lbs/gill net was considerably higher than the long term average of 5.2 lbs/gill net. The previous 10 assessments with brook trout sampled ranged from 0.2 lbs/gill net to 14.4 lbs/gill net. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
