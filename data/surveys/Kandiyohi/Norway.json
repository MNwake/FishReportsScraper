PER GN) WAS HIGHER THAN MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THERE APPEARED TO BE A MODERATE- AT-BEST 1989 YEAR-CLASS, HOWEVER, OVERALL RECRUITMENT APPEARS LOW (POOR EARLY SPRING WATER CONDITIONS RECENTLY).  GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE.  THE BLC 1991 CATCH INDICES (6.47 PER TN, 6.50 PER GN) WERE SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OT OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES, BUT IS CONSIDERED LOW-MODERATE FOR LAKE NORWAY (HISTORICAL MEANS 11.6 PER TN, 16.00 PER GN).  THE POUNDS PER SET INDICES (1.25 LBS. PER TN, 0.59 LBS. PER GN) WERE THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR NORWAY.  THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED FISH WERE FROM THE 1989 AND 1990 YEAR-CLASSES.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE.  MOST FISH CAUGHT ANGLING WERE 6-8 INCHES WITH ONLY AN OCCASIONAL 10-12 INCH FISH.  THE BLG 1991 CATCH INDEX (29.53 PER TN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL MEAN FOR NORWAY LAKE (26.1 PER TN).  THERE WERE NO BLG OVER 7.0 INCHES IN THE SAMPLE WHICH COINCIDES WITH WHAT THE ANGLERS ARE CATCHING.  BLG GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-2 AND AVERAGE FOR AGE 3. THE SPRING ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE FOR LMB YIELDED A CATCH INDEX OF 39.5 PER HOUR (LOCAL AVERAGE IS 20.40 PER HOUR).  GROWTH RATES WERE EITHER AVERAGE (AGES 1-3.6) OR ABOVE AVERAGE (AGES 4-5) AND THE SIZE/AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS WERE WELL SPREAD OUT.  THE 1991 LMB TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (1.07 PER TN) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR NORWAY LAKE AND WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (3.83 PER GN) WAS SIMILAR TO OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES AND TO THE HISTORICAL MEAN FOR NORWAY (4.26 PER GN).  THE 1988 INDEX (9.40 PER GN) WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR NORWAY AND THE WAE FISHING WAS VERY GOOD FROM 1988-1990 BEFORE DROPPING OFF IN 1991. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND THE 1989 YEAR-CLASS APPEARED LOW- MODERATE IN ABUNDANCE.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE TO ABOVE AVERAGE.  THE 1991 YEP INDEX (23.17 PER GN) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR NORWAY AND WAS SIMILAR TO OTHER CLASS 41 LAKES.  THE 1989 YEAR CLASS APPEARS DOMINATE AND GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE (AGES 2-3) TO BELOW AVERAGE (AGE 1).  THE FRD CATCH INDEX (1988 AND 1991 IN CONJUNCTION) APPEARS TO BE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH (1988 - 22.90 PER GN, 1991 - 19.17 PER GN) AND THE POUNDS/SET IN 1991 (18.63) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR NORWAY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Norway Lake is a large (2,344 acres) and productive lake with a variety of habitat.Norway has three distinct basins: West Norway (1,389 acres, 10 ft maximum depth), main basin(905 acres, 33 ft maximum depth), Little Norway (150 acres, 10 feet maximum depth). Norway'smain basin has moderate water clarity in the summer (secchi=5.0 ft on 7/29/96) with moderatephosphorus levels (0.050 ppm on 6/18/91). Norway is the headwaters lake of the Shakopee Creekwatershed. Norway is connected to Games Lake via the Little Norway outlet. Norway receivesthe largest inflows of water from two County Ditches (27 &29) that enter the northwest andsouthwest corners of West Norway. Consequently, water quality is poor (decrease in waterclarity, frequent occurrence of algae blooms) in West Norway compared to the main basin dueto high nutrient inputs primarily from agricultural runoff in conjunction with frequentnutrient in-lake recycling due to wind and wave action. The main basin is highly developedalong the south and east shores. Little Norway is developed along the east shore. West Norwayis developed primarily along the southwest and northeast shore areas. The shoreline areas ofWest Norway and the south shore of the main basin are typified by agricultural row cropsadjacent to lake homes and a hardwood fringe. The most frequently occurring submergentvegetation species include muskgrass, water moss, coontail, sago pondweed, claspingleafpondweed, bushy pondweed, and curled pondweed. Submergents are abundant in Little Norway andin the main basin in depths less than 11 ft. Submergents are sparse in West Norway. Emergentvegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail) is restricted to the west portions of the mainbasin, northeast shore of West Norway, and abundant along the shoreline of Little Norway. Theprimary shoalwater substrates are sand, gravel, silt, rubble, marl, and detritus. Potentialwalleye spawning sites include the southeast shore (gravel/rubble) of West Norway, southeastshore of main basin, and a shallow shoal area extending from the south shore of the mainbasin (west of public access). Northern pike spawning areas include several inlets connectedmarsh areas (N, NW, SW side of W. Norway, SW of main basin) and a managed northern pikespawning area \"Engen NPSA\". Strand Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" (North side of WestNorway) was operated briefly from 1967-1972. Norway was last stocked in 1993 with 31,303walleye fingerlings (Table 1.) totalling 1,846 lbs (Table 2.). Norway is managed for walleyeand northern pike as the primary species with largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappieas the secondary species. Presently, a watershed study is in progress for Norway, Games, andAndrew Lakes. The purpose of this study is to identify the amount of water and nutrients thatenter the lake via various inlets and lakeshore property. Priority land management andeducation activities will target areas within the watershed where significant nutrientexporting has been occurring.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (14.3 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but above the historicalaverage (5.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (1.2 lbs from gillnets) was below thehistorical average (1.9 lbs). The largest walleye captured in the survey was 26.8 inches. The1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 62.6 and 9.1 respectively. Growthrates appear average compared to other area lakes. About 40% of the fish captured during the1996 summer survey were from the 1994 year class (due to natural reproduction). Young of year\"YOY\" walleye abundance was evaluated in 1996 by fall electrofishing. The 1996 fallelectrofishing abundance (49.5 YOY/hour due to natural reproduction) was within the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (10.9 - 55.6 YOY/hour) for area lakes with potential naturalreproduction (Table 3.). The overall median for Norway Lake is 49.5 YOY/hour. The 1996average size (6.9 inches) was similar to the overall average (6.8 inches) for lakes withnatural reproduction (Table 4.). Yearling walleye abundance (1995 year class) during the 1996spring electrofishing survey (different electrofishing stations in spring versus fall)appeared excellent (58.0 fish/hour, 8.3 inches average size). The 1996 fall yearling walleyeabundance (6.0 fish/hour) was below the overall lake average (13.8 fish/hour) for area lakes(Table 5.), but similar to the overall Norway Lake median (4.0 fish/hour). Electrofishinggear bias may be the reason for poor catch rates of yearling fish in the fall of 1996 due todifferent behavior or habitat requirements of larger yearlings compared to YOY fish. The 1996yearling average size (11.5 inches) was above the overall average (10.6 inches) for arealakes (Table 6.). There have been reports of good angling success for walleye within NorwayLake the last several years.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (2.4 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.2 - 7.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but below the historicalaverage 6.0 fish/gillnet. The 1996 average size (23.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets) wasabove the historical average (22.2 inches). The largest northern pike captured was 37.7inches (released) in 1996. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 72.7and 4.5 respectively. Growth rates appear good for ages III-V compared to other area lakes.About 50% of the fish captured in the 1996 summer survey belonged to the 1994 year class.There were no YOY northern pike caught during fall electrofishing surveys from 1994-1996(Table 7.). Northern pike fingerling production was low in 1996 (294 fish), however fish mayhave moved out of the spawning area and into the lake prior to the count (dam board removal)because of constant high water flowing over the dam boards. The historical average northernpike fingerling production is 38,614 fish (Figure 1.).     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (22.3 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.0 - 22.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but above the historicalaverage (16.9 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was similar to the historical average (6.5 inches). The largest yellow perch captured in thesurvey was 10.2 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 8.8 and0.5 respectively. Growth rates appear good compared to other area lakes. About 69% of thefish captured in the 1996 survey belonged to the 1995 year class.     Black crappie abundance in the 1996 trapnets (4.5 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (1.0 - 12.3 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but below thehistorical average (9.7 fish/trapnet). Black crappie abundance in the 1996 gillnets (2.3fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (0.8 - 11.1 fish/gillnet)for Lake Class 41, but below the historical average (13.2 fish/gillnet). The 1996 averagesize (6.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was below the historical average (7.4 inches).The largest black crappie captured in 1996 was 11.7 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 30.0and 6.7 (gillnets and trapnets combined) respectively. Growth rates appear average comparedto other area lakes. The dominant year classes captured in the 1996 survey include the 1995(51%) and 1994 (44%) year classes.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (19.5 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 - 14.9 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but slightly below thehistorical average (25.0 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (4.5 inches) was below thehistorical average (5.8 inches). The largest bluegill captured in the 1996 survey was 8.1inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 15.6 and 0.7respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to other area lakes. About 45% of the fishcaptured belonged to the 1994 year class.     Largemouth bass abundance in the 1996 spring electrofishing survey (25.3 fish/hour) wassimilar to the area median catch rate (32.4 fish/hour), but below the historical average forNorway Lake (42.7 fish/hour). The 1996 average size (1.4 lbs from spring electrofishing)was similar to the historical average size (1.2 lbs). The largest bass captured during thespring electrofishing survey in 1996 was 19.3 inches. The 1996 spring PSD and RSD-P was 53.3and 46.7 respectively. The catch rate of fish > 15 inches (preferred size) in 1996 (9.3fish/hour) was similar to the historical lake average (10.7 fish/hour). Growth rates appearaverage compared to other area lakes. About 21% of the fish captured during the springelectrofishing were age VIII plus.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.1 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.3 - 78.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, and the lowest historicalrecorded value (historical average= 2.6 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (11.7 inchesfrom gillnets and trapnets) was above the historical average (10.6 inches).     Carp abundance in 1996 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd median interquartilerange (0.7 - 5.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, and below the historical average (2.3fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (26.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was similar tothe historical average (26.0 inches).     Freshwater drum \"sheepshead\" abundance in 1996 (11.1 fish/gillnet) was within the 1stand 3rd median interquartile range (3.6 - 24.2 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, and similarto the historical average (12.1 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (16.4 inches fromgillnets and trapnets) was above the historical average (13.8 inches). The largest freshwaterdrum caught during the 1996 survey was 27.6 inches (10.6 lbs).     Norway Lake is a popular fishing lake for walleye, northern pike, black crappie,largemouth bass, and bluegill. Norway is a diversified fishery due to the variety of habitatswithin the different basins. Presently, walleye natural reproduction has been good during thelast three years, however, if natural reproduction significantly decreases then walleyefingerling stocking will be resumed. Experimental regulations are being considered for Norwayin order to improve the size structure of black crappie. Other management activities includethe continued operation of the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area when northern pike numbersare low/moderate or yellow perch are high; protecting emergent vegetation stands; improvingwater quality by encouraging area landowners to use best management practices (conservationtillage, planting buffer strips, restoring wetlands, proper feedlot and manure management,proper lawn fertilizer usage, updating dysfunctional septic systems). Improving water qualityis a major goal for Norway Lake. There are several large inlets that drain into West Norwayand Norway basins. Fortunately there are several small wetland areas that these inlets draininto before entering the lake, thus these wetlands filter a portion of the suspended solidsand nutrients before they enter the lake. The watershed study presently being conducted willprovide valuable information about the quality and quantity of water entering the Norway,Games, and Andrew chain of lakes. This information will aide both private and public partiesto target efforts and limited dollars to effectively reduce nutrient inputs into the system.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye on Norway during September 26, 2016. The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Norway is a large (2,339 acres), multi-basin, moderate depth (33 feet maximum) and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction contribution in Norway is variable based on previous fall and summer surveys. Walleye fry (1.6-3.8 million) had been stocked recently in Norway from 2007-2010 (various strains) and 2012 (Spicer strain). Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked in 2009 (2,152,425 Private and Spicer strain fish) and 2016 (885,643 Spicer strain fish). Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 OTC marked fish) and 2014 (33,373 OTC marked fish). A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings were stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 318 fingerlings, 360 adults), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 1,400 yearlings, 3 adults) and 2012 (16,842 yearlings). <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (94.0 YOY/hour, 6.4 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. OTC marked fish accounted for 67% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye Catch. Low YOY walleye numbers (16.0 YOY/hour, 6.7 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (50.0 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. OTC marked fish accounted for 42% (21.0 YOY/hour) of the 2014 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catch rate. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (4.0 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured during the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were moderate to low due to fry stocking and/or natural reproduction (32.0 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye abundance was low due to natural reproduction in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey (14.0 YOY/hour, 6.7 inches), but high due to fry stocking and/or natural reproduction (72.0 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches) in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of Walleye frylings (OTC marked) were stocked into Norway during the 2011 summer (16,779 fish); however no marked fish were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. The Norway YOY Walleye historical catch rate is 27.2 YOY/hour.  <br> \n <br> \nNo yearling Walleye were captured in 2016. Low yearling Walleye numbers (4.0 fish/hour, 8.9 inches) were captured in 2015. There were moderate numbers of yearling Walleye (14.0 fish/hour, 8.2 inches) due to natural reproduction captured in 2014. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2013 fall survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.0 fish/hour, 8.8 inches) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Norway Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Norway Lake during late July of 2005. Norway is a large sized (2,344 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are 296 lake homes/cabins and 2 resorts that exist along the lakeshore. Norway receives moderate recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the resorts, and lakeshore homeowners. Water clarity was poor during July of 2005 (secchi=3.5 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense during late summer especially in the West Norway basin. Nutrient levels are variable from high to moderate in the lake. West Norway basin (1,389 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. Little Norway basin connects to Games Lake via a narrow channel. The Big Norway basin (905 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Aquatic vegetation consists mostly of various pondweeds, bulrush, muskgrass, cattails, northern milfoil, coontail, and water moss within the lake. Eurasian water milfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian milfoil is present at low to moderate densities in the West Norway and Big Norway basins. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway. Norway is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Walleye fingerlings are generally stocked into Norway after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction. The Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed includes Norway and several downstream connected lakes (Games, Henchien, Middle, Andrew, Florida). Two large county ditches upstream of Norway are considered the headwaters of Shakopee Creek. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project. The Shakopee Creek Watershed group continues to monitor water quality and flows in the watershed, and encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2005 (32.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 19.03 fish/gillnet. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.4 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight and length is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike numbers were low in 2005 (0.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical catch rate is 5.90 fish/gillnet. The 2005 northern pike average size was moderate (3.30 pounds and 24.6 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.85 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches and larger) northern pike was low (0.50 fish/gillnet) for Norway. Northern pike growth rates for Norway were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2001 northern pike year class comprised 29% of the 2005 assessment northern pike catch. The largest northern pike captured was 39.0 inches from the 2005 assessment. Bluegill numbers were moderate to abundant in 2005 (19.24 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 21.88 fish/trapnet. The 2005 bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.5 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) bluegill was low (2.29 fish/trapnet) for Norway. Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2005 (4.47 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rate is 8.94 fish/trapnet. The 2005 black crappie average size was small to moderate (0.33 pounds and 7.6 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality (8.0 inches and larger) black crappie was moderate (2.41 fish/trapnet) for Norway. Black crappie growth rates for Norway were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 3-5. The 2004 and 2001 black crappie year classes comprised 42% and 29% respectively of the 2005 black crappie assessment catch. The largest black crappie captured was 12.3 inches in the 2005 assessment.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2005 trapnets (0.35 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.31 fish/trapnet. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was small to moderate (0.95 pounds and 9.2 inches) from trapnets. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2005 due to time constraints. Abundant numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the last spring electrofishing survey in 2001 (71.43 fish/hour, 12.4 inches average length).Walleye numbers were low to moderate in 2005 (4.13 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 6.55 fish/gillnet. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate (1.11 pounds and 14.4 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.79 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches and larger) walleye was low (1.38 fish/gillnet) for Norway. Walleye growth rates for Norway were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2003 walleye year class (4,136 fingerlings were stocked in the 2003 fall) comprised 20% of the 2005 walleye assessment catch. A moderate naturally produced walleye year class (2001 walleye year class) comprised 33% of total walleye catch in the 2005 assessment. Walleye fry were stocked in the 2005 spring (1.23 million). The largest walleye captured was 27.8 inches from the 2005 assessment.Black bullhead numbers were low in 2005 (1.63 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 4.17 fish/gillnet for Norway. The 2005 black bullhead average size was large (1.36 pounds and 13.0 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.90 pounds from gillnets.Freshwater drum numbers were abundant in 2005 (51.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 18.85 fish/gillnet for Norway. The 2005 freshwater drum average size was small (0.88 pounds and 12.7 inches) from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 1.11 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Norway include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian milfoil in connected waters, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project, operating the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Norway fishery will be sampled in the 2010 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Norway Lake during late July of 2015. Norway is a large sized (2,339 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. West Norway basin (approximately 1,300 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. Little Norway basin connects to Games Lake via a narrow outlet channel. The Big Norway basin (approximately 900 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Norway receives moderate recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the resorts, and lakeshore homeowners. The immediate watershed is mostly agricultural row crops with lesser amounts of residential development, wetlands and hardwood stands. There are 8 inlets that flow into the various Norway basins and an outlet channel that flows into Games Lake. Two large inlets (Kandiyohi County Ditches 27 & 29) drain significant agricultural runoff into the West Norway basin. Nutrient levels are variable generally from high to moderate in the lake. Water levels were low during the spring and fall, but normal during the 2015 summer.  <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was fair to poor during July of 2015 (secchi reading=3.4 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and sometimes intense during late summer especially in the West Norway basin. The Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area (1979 acquired) is located on the southwest shore of the West Norway basin. There are two Norway Aquatic Management Area \"AMA\" tracts (Larson and Little Norway). The Larson Tract (2011 acquired) is located along a channel between the main and West Norway basins. The Little Norway Tract (2014 acquired) is located on the southwest side of Little Norway and north side of the main basin. Emergent vegetation consists of scattered stands of cattails and hardstem bulrush in all three basins. Submergent vegetation density is usually light to moderate consisting mostly of sago pondweed, bushy pondweed, wild celery, muskgrass, northern milfoil, Eurasian watermilfoil, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed and water moss within the shallow areas (< 15 feet deep). Eurasian watermilfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian watermilfoil is currently present at low to moderate densities in all three basins and recently in connected Games Lake (2014). Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway. Norway is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed includes Norway and several downstream connected lakes (Games, Swan, Henchien, Middle, Andrew and Florida). The two large Kandiyohi County Ditches (CD 27 & 29) upstream of Norway are considered the headwaters of Shakopee Creek. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project. The Shakopee Creek Watershed group continues to monitor water quality and flows in the watershed, and encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2015 (6.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the Norway historical average (17.33 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.3 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2015 (0.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Norway historical average (5.07 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike catches have been below 1.0 fish per gillnet the last three surveys. The 2015 Northern Pike average size was large (8.60 pounds and 34.1 inches) from gillnets. Norway has a history of producing large Northern Pike per local reports. There is adequate Northern Pike spawning habitat within Norway and adjacent upstream wetland areas, however natural reproduction or recruitment has been poor in recent years. The Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" had been used to produce modest Northern Pike fingerling numbers in past years. However, the spawning area structure was in need of repair in recent years. The Engen NPSA water control structure and dike was repaired with cooperation from the West Central Chapter of the Minnesota Darkhouse & Angling Association in 2012. However, low water prevented the use of Engen NPSA in 2014 and 2015. Northern Pike were recently stocked from a variety of sources in 2013 (383 fingerlings, 98 adults; Engen NPSA), 2014 (702 adults; winter rescue source) and 2015 (9,532 fingerlings; New London Hatchery Pond Production).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2015 (15.18 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 20.86 fish/trapnet. The 2015 Bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.15 pounds and 5.7 inches) from trapnets. However, there were also moderate numbers of large (8.0-10.2 inches) Bluegill captured in the 2015 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant (18.41 fish/trapnet), but the average size (0.15 pounds and 5.8 inches average) was small in 2015, due in part to the young and large 2014 year class. The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 9.74 fish/trapnet. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from trapnets. There were moderate numbers of Black Crappie greater than 8.0 inches captured in the 2015 trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were moderate in Norway  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were moderate (30.40 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size (1.07 pounds and 11.7 inches) was also moderate. There were low numbers of Largemouth Bass greater than 15.0 inches in the 2015 spring electrofishing catch. The previous Norway spring electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was conducted during 2001 (71.43 fish/hour, 12.4 inches average length). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2015 (8.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Norway historical average (6.92 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.36 pounds and 15.2 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.67 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of Walleye greater than 15.0 inches in the 2015 survey nets. The 2012 year class comprised almost half of the 2015 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye natural reproduction is sporadic and usually marginal in Norway. The Walleye population has been maintained by various Walleye stockings. Fall electrofishing surveys have been used to monitor natural reproduction or Walleye stocking success (fry, fryling). Young of Year \"YOY\" (fingerling size) Walleye numbers in fall electrofishing surveys were abundant during 2010 (72.00 YOY/hour, fry stocking and natural); moderate in 2012 (32.00 YOY/hour, fry stocking and natural) and 2014 (50.00 YOY/hour, fryling stocking and natural); low in 2011 (14.00 YOY/hour, natural), 2013 (4.00 YOY/hour, natural) and 2015 (16.00 YOY/hour, natural). Yearling Walleye numbers were moderately abundant (14.00-22.00 fish/hour) in 2010-2012 and 2014, but low in 2013 (0.00 fish/hour) and 2015 (4.00 fish/hour) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (1.6 - 3.8 million) were stocked recently in Norway from 2007-2010 and 2012. Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 fish) and 2014 (33,373 fish). Marked (fryling stocked) fish accounted for 0% and 42% respectively of the 2011 and 2014 YOY Walleye fall electrofishing catch rates. A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings were stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings, 1,864 pounds), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 987 pounds; 318 fingerlings, 91 pounds; 360 adults, 287 pounds), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 737 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 200 pounds; 3 adults, 6 pounds) and 2012 (16,842 yearlings, 802 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were almost nonexistent in 2015 survey nets (0.06 fish/trapnet, 0.00 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 1.64 fish/trapnet and 3.53 fish/gillnet for Norway. The 2015 Black Bullhead average weight and length were 0.22 pounds and 7.4 inches from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum \"Sheepshead\" were overly abundant in 2015 (46.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Norway historical average (21.03 fish/gillnet). It was the second recorded highest catch for Norway. The 2015 Freshwater Drum average size was small (0.71 pounds and 10.93 inches) from gillnets. The Freshwater Drum historical average weight is 1.07 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low in 2015 (0.71 fish/trapnet) compared to the Norway historical average (1.61 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Common Carp average size was large (10.94 pounds and 28.32 inches) from trapnets. The historical average weight is 9.72 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Norway include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in connected waters, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for other potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project, operating the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Norway fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species and 2016 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Norway is a large (2,344 acres), productive, multi-basin lake located 8 miles west of New London, MN in Kandiyohi County. The three major basins include West Norway Lake (1,389 acres, maximum depth 10 feet, light submergent vegetation density), Little Norway (about 150 acres, 10 feet maximum depth, abundant submergent vegetation), and the main basin (about 905 acres, maximum depth 33 feet, abundant submergent vegetation). Excessive nutrient inputs and associated siltation are a problem from agricultural sources via inlets and the surrounding lake shore are a problem. Past management has been directed primarily towards walleye and northern pike. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in Norway with 1000 to 2000 lbs every other year since 1981. Prior to 1981, both walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked at various rates and frequencies. A northern pike spawning area (Engen NPSA) has produced an average of 25,000 fingerlings per year since 1984, however, fingerling production was poor (432) in 1993. Other notable species stocked were small numbers (200/year) of muskellunge in the early and mid 1970's. Commercial removal of carp, bullheads, suckers, and freshwater drum has been limited in the last fifteen years. Since 1991, 28,100 lbs of bullhead, 815 lbs of freshwater drum, 220 lbs of suckers, and 218 lbs of carp have been removed. In past years, Norway has been known as a good northern pike/largemouth bass/panfish fishery. A creel survey was conducted during the winter 1991-92 and summer of 1992 on Norway, Games, and Andrew Lakes. Angling success during this time period was poor considering the previous reputation of the lake. The estimated winter harvest in 1991-92 was 3,288 sunfish spp., 2,382 black crappie, 394 northern pike (277 taken by spearing), and 26 walleye. The estimated summer harvest was 1,322 sunfish spp., 797 largemouth bass, 374 black crappie, 314 northern pike, and 97 walleye.     The 1993 walleye catch rate (4.9 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (4.4 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range (3.2 - 11.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The average walleye size in 1993 was 1.9 lbs. Growth rates appear to be average compared to other local lakes. The walleye population in Norway is maintained by stocking, however there has been no concrete documentation on the extent of natural reproduction.     The 1993 northern pike catch rate (2.8 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.1 - 6.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (6.5 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size (3.8 lbs) was above the historical average (2.9 lbs). Growth rates appear to be slightly above average. In addition to the Engen NPSA, there is potentially good northern pike natural reproduction that occurs upstream in two intermittent marsh inlets located on the south end of the main basin and West Norway Lake. Northern pike natural reproduction has been sporadic the last six years due to the drought in the late 1980's and erratic spring water levels in the early 1990's.     Black crappie catch rates in 1993 (7.4 fish/gillnet, 3.8 fish/trapnet) were below the historical averages 14.8 fish/gillnet, 10.5 fish/trapnet), but within the normal ranges for Lake Class 41. The average size in 1993 (0.2 lbs) was slightly lower than the historical average (0.3 lbs). Growth rates appear to be poor. In past years, Norway was noted as an excellent spring/winter crappie fishery. However, the Norway crappie population has declined in recent years which has been a similar trend in other area lakes.     The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate in 1993 (63.4 fish/hour) was above the catch rate in 1991 (39.5 fish/hour). However, the 1993 average size was 0.7 lbs compared to 1.6 lbs in 1991. There appears to be moderate numbers of two to three year old bass present. Growth rates appear to be average compared to local lakes. The decline in the 1993 average size compared to 1991 may be due to greater incidental harvest of bass greater than 12 inches due to poor fishing for other targeted species (northern pike, walleye) in the summer of 1992.     Bluegill abundance in 1993 (24.1 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (1.1 - 14.0 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but similar to the historical average (25.9 fish/trapnet). The 1993 average size (0.1 lbs) was below the normal range (0.2 - 0.4 lbs) and below the historical average (0.2 lbs). The average bluegill length was 5.4 inches. Growth rates appear to be slightly below average for area lakes. Bluegill size structure has been fair in previous years. The best bluegill population size structure and optimal abundance occurred in 1988 (10.4 fish/trapnet, average size=0.3 lbs).     The 1993 yellow perch catch rate (53.5 fish/gillnet) was the highest recorded value for Norway. The 1993 catch rate was above the normal range (3.3 - 23.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (16.2 fish/gillnet). The average size (0.2 lbs) was also above the historical average (0.1 lbs).     Freshwater drum (\"sheepshead\") abundance in 1993 (16.5 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (12.3 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range (0.3 - 35.9 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The average size was 1.5 lbs. Although freshwater drum are a palatable fish when prepared correctly, local anglers have little preference for keeping and eating drum. Only 15% of the freshwater drum caught during the 1992 summer creel survey were kept by anglers. Likewise, there is no stable local commercial market for freshwater drum.     The carp catch rate (1.1 fish/trapnet) was slightly below the historical average (2.5 fish/trapnet). The average size in 1993 (7.3 lbs) was similar to the historical average (8.6 lbs). Presently, the carp densities do not appear to be a problem in Norway.     The combined 1993 black and brown bullhead catch rate (0.8 fish/trapnet) were below the historical average (3.6 fish/trapnet). Low densities of bullhead have been apparent in many local lakes the last several years. Yellow bullhead numbers were also below average in 1993 (1.5 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (2.4 fish/trapnet). It has been inferred that yellow bullhead are effective predators on small bluegill. The highest densities of yellow bullhead (5.4 fish/trapnet, average size=0.9 lbs) also occurred during the best historical bluegill population size structure and optimal abundance in 1988.     Norway has a diverse fishery which makes managing for multiple species a realistic approach. Current stocking rates (< 1 lb/littoral acre) appear insufficient for providing a good walleye fishery based on the lake size, diversity, and abundant forage base present (yellow perch). Progressive increases in walleye fingerling stocking density (i.e. 2 lbs/littoral acre in 1995) and continued evaluations should provide greater benefits to anglers, but still maintain sufficient forage base numbers of yellow perch for other species such as northern pike to prey on. Presently, low numbers of walleye are present in Norway which would lead one to believe that some other factors besides potential competition are limiting black crappie populations (exploitation, environmental factors, etc.). Based on the historical decline in black crappie size structure and abundance, experimental regulations will be pursued. Norway can receive very heavy fishing pressure, especially during the winter when the black crappie are biting. The decline of northern pike abundance in Norway is similar in other local lakes. Northern pike abundance should improve with the onset of better environmental spawning conditions and the availability of abundant forage (yellow perch). Bluegill population size structure will be difficult to improve in Norway. Maintaining higher predator populations (largemouth bass, northern pike, yellow bullhead) will probably have the greatest positive effect for improving bluegill size structure and maintaining optimal abundance on a lake of this size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Norway is a large and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County with several distinctbasins (Little Norway, Big Norway, and West Norway). Norway is a popular fishing lake forwalleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass. Local anglers hadexcellent to good angling success for walleye, bluegill, and black crappie in recent years.Black crappie (average size=8-11 inches) fishing was excellent during the 1998-99 winter.Good walleye natural reproduction was documented by fall night electrofishing surveys in 1995and 1996. Moderate to poor walleye natural reproduction was documented in 1994 and 1997.Norway was stocked with 31,303 walleye fingerlings in 1993, but no walleye were stocked from1994-1997. The Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area produced 18,816 northern pike fingerlingsfor Norway in 1998. An intensive watershed study \"Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project\" wasconducted by various public agencies, local lake associations, and private individuals from1996-1998. Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project personnel measured water quality and flow fromvarious inlets in order to identify major nutrient loading sources for Norway, Games andAndrew Lakes. The study information is being used to promote best management practices andimprove water quality in the watershed.     Walleye numbers were abundant in Norway during 1998 (14.00 fish/gillnet) compared to theNorway historical average (6.53 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average length and weight was15.9 inches and 1.50 lbs from the gillnets. The 1995 and 1996 walleye year classes (due tonatural reproduction) comprised 40% and 32% of the 1998 walleye gillnet catch. Walleye growthrates were excellent in Norway. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on September14, 1998 in order to evaluate walleye natural reproduction in Norway. There were low numbersof young of year \"YOY\" walleye (15.0 YOY/hour, average length=7.9 inches) present in the 1998fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction was poor for many other local lakes(6.1 YOY/hour, local average) in 1998. DNR Spicer Fisheries personnel stocked 36,190 walleyefingerlings in the 1998 fall because of low YOY walleye numbers documented in 1997 and 1998.      Norway contained abundant numbers of freshwater drum \"sheepshead\" (38.67 fish/gillnet,average weight=0.80 lbs.), northern pike (11.67 fish/gillnet, average weight=2.33 lbs.),black crappie (30.83 fish/trapnet, average weight=0.24 lbs.), and yellow perch (28.67fish/gillnet, average weight=0.12 lbs.) in 1998. The 1996 black crappie year class comprised73% of the 1998 black crappie catch.     Low numbers of bluegill (8.65 fish/trapnet, average size=0.18 lbs.) and black bullhead(3.17 fish/gillnet, average weight=0.58 lbs.) were present in Norway during 1998. Bluegillfishing success was fair to poor during the 1998 summer and 1998-99 winter.     A spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass was not conducted on Norway Lake in1998. However, a spring electrofishing survey conducted in 1996 indicated moderate numbersof largemouth bass (25.9 fish/hour, average weight=1.4 lbs.) in Norway compared to otherlocal lakes, but numbers were below the Norway historical average (42.7 fish/hour, averageweight=1.2 lbs.).      The Norway Lake fishery appears to be in excellent condition for walleye, northern pike, and black crappie. Yellow perch numbers appear to be adequate for providing a good foragebase for walleye and northern pike. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitoradult fish population numbers in Norway every four years by summer test netting and YOYwalleye numbers annually by fall night electrofishing surveys in order to evaluate theeffectiveness of current management practices. In addition, the DNR Spicer Fisheries Officewill continue our participation in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project and other habitatprojects in order to improve the water quality of Norway Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on September 20, 2023. Five stations were sampled for a total of 35 minutes in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate submergent vegetation densities (Eurasian watermilfoil) were present in the main basin during the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Clarity was poor (6-12 inches) with a water temperature of 73 F. Blue-green algae bloom was moderate in the West Basin. We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Freshwater Drum and Largemouth Bass. Moderate numbers of Yellow Perch, shiners, Common Carp and Black Crappie were also observed in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nNorway is a large sized (2,339 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. West Norway basin (approximately 1,300 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels and limited submergent vegetation. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. The Big Norway basin (approximately 900 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Water levels were low in 2020-2022. Eurasian watermilfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian watermilfoil is also present in downstream lakes of Games (2014), Andrew (2019) and Florida (2009). Zebra Mussels were found in Norway, Games and Andrew in 2018. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction occurs in Norway but is sporadic based on previous surveys. Spicer Strain Walleye fry were recently stocked in Norway during 2012 (1,568,599 fry), 2016 (885,643 Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry), 2018 (1,132,151 fry), 2022 (861,474 fry) and 2023 (504,179 fry). OTC marked fry were also stocked in 2009 (2,152,425 fish). OTC marked Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 frylings) and 2014 (33,373 frylings). OTC marked fish accounted for 0%, 42% and 67% respectively of the 2011, 2014 and 2016 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catch rates. A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings have been stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings, 1,864 pounds), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 987 pounds; 318 fingerlings, 91 pounds; 360 adults, 287 pounds), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 737 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 200 pounds; 3 adults, 6 pounds), 2012 (16,842 yearlings, 802 pounds) and 2020 (959 yearlings, 442 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were moderate (37.71 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches) in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (133.20 YOY/hour, 5.82 inches) in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers in fall electrofishing surveys were abundant in 2010 (72.00 YOY/hour,) and 2016 (94.00 YOY/hour); moderate in 2012 (32.00 YOY/hour), 2014 (50.00 YOY/hour) and 2018 (56.40 YOY/hour); low in 2011 (14.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (4.00 YOY/hour), 2015 (16.00 YOY/hour) and 2019 (4.00 YOY/hour). No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2017 or 2020. The Norway YOY Walleye historical average catch rate and length are 31.84 YOY/hour and 6.68 inches respectively. Yearling Walleye numbers were moderately abundant (14.00-22.00 fish/hour) in 2010-2012 and 2014, but low in 2013 (0.00 fish/hour), 2019 (4.00 fish/hour), and 2022 (6.00 fish/hour, 11.23 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (18.86 fish/hour, 10.85 inches) in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in the most recent 2019 standard survey (12.67 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 7.33 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.26 pounds and 14.98 inches) from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) Walleye was also high (6.83 fish/gillnet) for Norway. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2016 and 2015 Walleye year classes comprised 35% and 17% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Norway include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in connected waters, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for other potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project, operating the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Norway fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species and 2024 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey was conducted on Norway Lake during late July of 2010. Norway is a large sized (2,344 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are 328 lake homes/cabins, 53 recreational vehicles and 2 resorts that exist along the lakeshore. Norway receives moderate recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the resorts, and lakeshore homeowners. The immediate watershed is mostly agricultural row crops with lesser amounts of residential development, wetlands and hardwood stands. There are 8 inlets that flow into the various Norway basins and an outlet channel that flows into Games Lake. Two large inlets carry significant agricultural runoff which includes County Ditches 27 & 29. Nutrient levels are variable generally from high to moderate in the lake. Total phosphorus levels (0.026 ppm) were relatively low in June of 2010. Water levels were normal during the 2010 summer. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm to depths of 12 feet. Water clarity was fair during July of 2010 (secchi=3.5 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense during late summer especially in the West Norway basin. West Norway basin (1,389 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. Little Norway basin connects to Games Lake via a narrow outlet channel. The Big Norway basin (905 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Emergent vegetation consisted of scattered stands of cattails and hardstem bulrush in all three basins. Submergent vegetation density was light to moderate consisting mostly of sago pondweed, bushy pondweed, wild celery, muskgrass, northern milfoil, Eurasian milfoil, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed and water moss within the littoral areas of the lake. Eurasian milfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian milfoil is present at low to moderate densities in the West Norway and Big Norway basins. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway. Norway is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed includes Norway and several downstream connected lakes (Games, Henchien, Middle, Andrew and Florida). The two large county ditches (CD 27 & 29) upstream of Norway are considered the headwaters of Shakopee Creek. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project. The Shakopee Creek Watershed group continues to monitor water quality and flows in the watershed, and encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2010 (9.57 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Norway and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 18.24 fish/gillnet. The 2010 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.13 pounds and 6.37 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight and length is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was 0.00 fish/gillnet for Norway.

The 2009 year class comprised 24% of the northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2010 (15.35 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Norway, but above the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 21.33 fish/trapnet. The 2010 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.79 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (2.29 fish/trapnet) for Norway. Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2 and 7-8, but within the normal ranges for ages 3-6. The 2008 and 2007 year classes comprised 59% and 23% respectively of the bluegill gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010. YOY bluegill numbers were abundant (83.50 YOY/seine haul, 1.41 inches average length) in the shoreline seine hauls during 2010. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2010 (9.82 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Norway and similar lakes. The black crappie historical catch rate is 9.01 fish/trapnet. The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate (0.26 pounds and 7.22 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low to moderate (2.47 fish/trapnet) for Norway. Black crappie growth rates for Norway were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and above the normal ranges for ages 5-7. The 2008 and 2009 year classes comprised 46% and 32% respectively of the black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010.

The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.31 fish/trapnet. The 2010 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.95 pounds and 9.17 inches) from trapnets. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2010 due to time constraints. The last spring electrofishing survey indicated high numbers of largemouth bass during 2001 (71.43 fish/hour, 12.4 inches average length) in Norway. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (9.43 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Norway and similar lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of the fish population was conducted on Norway Lake in July of 2001. Norway is a large lake with multiple distinct basins (West Norway, Norway Main Basin, Little Norway) located in Kandiyohi County. Norway receives moderate recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the two resorts, and lakeshore homeowners (296 homes/cabins). Water quality and clarity is poor to fair depending upon the basin. Nutrient levels are variable from high to moderate in the lake. West Norway basin (1,389 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. Little Norway basin connects to Games Lake via a narrow channel. The Norway main basin (905 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Eurasian water milfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001. The Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed which includes Norway and several other downstream connected lakes (Games, Henchien, Middle, Andrew, Florida) is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, feedlots, grasslands, and residential homes. A high level of nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria enters the West Norway basin from agricultural runoff via two Kandiyohi County Ditches. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters group encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Norway for a variety of fish species that include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2001 (27.1 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (16.4 fish/gillnet). Black crappie numbers were also abundant in the previous survey in 1998 (30.8 fish/gillnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was small (0.16 lbs. and 5.9 inches from gillnets). Approximately 62% of the black crappie captured in the 2001 summer survey were young fish hatched in 2000. Black crappie growth rates in Norway were above average for fish 3 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. Local anglers have reported good angling success for black crappie especially during the winter months in recent years. The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 summer survey was 12.8 inches.Bluegill numbers were low in 2001 (12.5 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (22.14 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 5.2 inches from trapnets). Bluegill growth rates in Norway were above average for fish 3 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer survey was 8.7 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (71.6 fish/hour) and the highest recorded estimate for Norway. The 2001 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.15 lbs. and 12.4 inches from the spring electrofishing survey). Largemouth bass growth rates in Norway were generally below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 17.6 inches.Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2001 (4.4 fish/gillnet), but below historical average (6.4 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was moderate (2.88 lbs. and 23.2 inches from gillnets). Northern pike growth rates in Norway were above average for fish 2 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 summer survey was 34.5 inches. A northern pike spawning area \"Engen NPSA\" located long the southwest side of the West Norway basin is operated each spring for the production of northern pike fingerlings.Walleye numbers were moderate to high in 2001 (9.25 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (6.80 fish/gillnet). The 2001 average size was moderate (1.82 lbs. and 16.4 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates in Norway were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 summer survey was 27.1 inches. Norway was last stocked with walleye fingerlings (36,190 fish; 2,225 lbs.) in the fall of 1998.Walleye natural reproduction in Norway is generally frequent, but numbers produced usually are low to moderate based on previous fall and summer surveys. Moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (54.9 YOY walleye/hour, 6.6 inches average size) were documented in the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey. All YOY walleye sampled in the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey were from natural reproduction. The Norway Lake historical average fall electrofishing catch rate for YOY walleye is 30.2 YOY walleye/hour. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2001 (13.1 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average catch rate (17.7 fish/gillnet). The 2001 average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 6.5 inches).Other notable fish species captured in the Norway 2001 summer survey included high numbers of freshwater drum \"sheepshead\" (19.9 fish/gillnet), low numbers of black bullhead (2.8 fish/gillnet), and low numbers of yellow bullhead (1.5 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 15.6 fish/gillnet for freshwater drum, 4.4 fish/gillnet for black bullhead, and 1.3 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead. Current fish management activities on Norway include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project, operating the Engen NPSA, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural walleye YOY numbers as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Norway fishery will be surveyed again in the spring and summer of 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on September 27, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Five stations were sampled for a total of 50 minutes in the 2022 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate submergent vegetation densities were present in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. Clarity was poor with a water temperature of 63.5 F. We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Yellow Perch and shiners. Moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass, Freshwater Drum, and Black Crappie were also observed in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorway is a large sized (2,339 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. West Norway basin (approximately 1,300 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels and limited submergent vegetation. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. The Big Norway basin (approximately 900 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. Water levels were low in 2020-2022. Eurasian watermilfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian watermilfoil is also present in downstream lakes of Games (2014), Andrew (2019) and Florida (2009). Zebra Mussels were found in Norway, Games and Andrew in 2018. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway.  <br> \n <br> \nSpicer Strain Walleye fry were recently stocked in Norway during 2012 (1,568,599 fry), 2016 (885,643 Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry), 2018 (1,132,151 fry) and 2022 (861,474 fry). OTC marked fry were also stocked in 2009 (2,152,425 fish). OTC marked Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 frylings) and 2014 (33,373 frylings). OTC marked fish accounted for 0%, 42% and 67% respectively of the 2011, 2014 and 2016 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catch rates. A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings have been stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings, 1,864 pounds), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 987 pounds; 318 fingerlings, 91 pounds; 360 adults, 287 pounds), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 737 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 200 pounds; 3 adults, 6 pounds), 2012 (16,842 yearlings, 802 pounds) and 2020 (959 yearlings, 442 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (133.20 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers in fall electrofishing surveys were abundant in 2010 (72.00 YOY/hour,) and 2016 (94.00 YOY/hour); moderate in 2012 (32.00 YOY/hour), 2014 (50.00 YOY/hour) and 2018 (56.40 YOY/hour); low in 2011 (14.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (4.00 YOY/hour), 2015 (16.00 YOY/hour) and 2019 (4.00 YOY/hour). No fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2017. The Norway YOY Walleye historical average catch rate and length are 31.84 YOY/hour and 6.7 inches respectively. Yearling Walleye numbers were moderately abundant (14.00-22.00 fish/hour) in 2010-2012 and 2014, but low in 2013 (0.00 fish/hour), 2019 (4.00 fish/hour), and 2022 (6.00 fish/hour, 11.2 inches) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in the most recent 2019 standard survey (12.67 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 7.33 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.26 pounds and 15.0 inches) from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) Walleye was also high (6.83 fish/gillnet) for Norway. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2016 and 2015 Walleye year classes comprised 35% and 17% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Norway include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in connected waters, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for other potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project, operating the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Norway fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species and 2024 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

Norway is a large (2,339 acres), multi-basin, moderate depth (33 feet maximum) and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction contribution in Norway is variable based on previous surveys and standard analysis. Walleye fry (1.6-3.8 million) had been stocked in Norway from 2007-2010 (various strains) and 2012 (Spicer strain). Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked in 2009 (2,152,425 Private and Spicer strain fish) and 2016 (885,643 Spicer strain fish). Unmarked Spicer strain Walleye fry (1,132,151) were stocked in 2018. Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 OTC marked Pike/Red River strain fish) and 2014 (33,373 OTC marked Pike River strain fish). A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings were stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings, 1,864 pounds), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 987 pounds; 318 fingerlings, 91 pounds; 360 adults, 287 pounds), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 737 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 200 pounds; 3 adults, 6 pounds) and 2012 (16,842 yearlings, 802 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (56.40 YOY/hour, 6.08 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. A fall electrofishing survey was not conducted on Norway in 2017. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (94.00 YOY/hour, 6.36 inches) were captured in the 2016 fall night electrofishing survey. OTC marked fish accounted for 67% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye Catch. Low YOY walleye numbers (16.00 YOY/hour, 6.73 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (50.00 YOY/hour, 6.10 inches) were captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. OTC marked fish accounted for 42% (21.00 YOY/hour) of the 2014 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catch rate. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.89 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured during the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were moderate to low due to fry stocking and/or natural reproduction (32.00 YOY/hour, 6.04 inches) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye abundance was low due to natural reproduction in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey (14.00 YOY/hour, 6.73 inches), but high due to fry stocking and/or natural reproduction (72.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches) in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of Walleye frylings (OTC marked) were stocked into Norway during the 2011 summer (16,779 fish); however no marked fish were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. We observed abundant to moderate numbers of YOY Freshwater Drum, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Shiners and Largemouth Bass in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nNo yearling Walleye were captured in 2018 or 2016. Low yearling Walleye numbers (4.00 fish/hour, 8.92 inches) were captured in 2015. There were moderate numbers of yearling Walleye (14.00 fish/hour, 8.23 inches) captured in 2014. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2013 fall survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (22.00 fish/hour, 8.83 inches) in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye catch rates were 18.00 YOY/hour (9.60 inches) in 2011 and 21.00 YOY/hour (9.90 inches) in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (8.40 fish/gillnet) was within the normal ranges for Norway and similar lakes in the most recent 2015 summer gillnet survey. The 2015 Walleye average weight and length were 1.36 pounds and 15.15 inches from gillnets. The 2012 and 2014 Walleye year classes comprised 44% and 17% respectively of the 2015 Walleye summer gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Norway Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Norway Lake during late July of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Two Index of Biotic Integrity \"FIBI\" targeted surveys for all near shore fish species were conducted in August of 2019. A Fall Electrofishing targeted survey for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye in September of 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nNorway is a large sized (2,339 acres), moderately deep (33 feet maximum depth), multi basin (West Norway, Big Norway, Little Norway), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. West Norway basin (approximately 1,300 acres) is a shallow (<10 feet deep), turbid, and windswept basin with high nutrient levels and limited submergent vegetation. Little Norway basin (150 acres) is a protected and shallow (<10 feet deep) basin with abundant aquatic vegetation. The Big Norway basin (approximately 900 acres) is 33 feet deep maximum with moderate aquatic vegetation densities and moderate water clarity. There are 328 lake homes/cabins, 53 recreational vehicles and 2 resorts that existed along the lakeshore in 2010. Norway receives moderate recreational and angling use in the summer from local residents, visitors to the resorts, and lakeshore homeowners. The immediate watershed is mostly agricultural row crops with lesser amounts of residential development, wetlands and hardwood stands. There are 8 inlets that flow into the various Norway basins and an outlet channel that flows into Games Lake. Two large inlets carry significant agricultural runoff which includes Kandiyohi County Ditches 27 & 29. Nutrient levels are generally high to moderate in the lake. Water levels were high during 2019. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm to depths of 18 feet. Water clarity was fair to poor during July of 2019 (secchi reading=3.0 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense during late summer especially in the West Norway basin. The Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area (1979 acquired) is located on the southwest shore of the West Norway basin. There are two Norway Aquatic Management Area \"AMA\" tracts (Larson and Little Norway). The Larson Tract (2011 acquired) is located along a channel between the main and West Norway basins. A recently acquired Norway \"AMA\" Little Norway Tract (2014) is located on the southwest side of Little Norway and north side of the main basin.  Little Norway basin connects to Games Lake via a narrow outlet channel. Water flows out of Games Lake and eventually downstream into Swan, Henchien, Andrew and Florida. Aquatic vegetation was surveyed at 40 transect sites in 2010 and 2019. Emergent vegetation consisted of scattered stands of cattails and hardstem bulrush in all three basins. Submergent vegetation density was light to moderate in 2019 consisting mostly of sago pondweed, bushy pondweed, water celery, muskgrass, northern milfoil, Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\", coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed flat-stemmed pondweed and water moss within the shallow areas (< 10 feet deep). Eurasian watermilfoil was found scattered throughout the West Norway basin in August of 2001 and in the Big Norway basin during 2005. Eurasian watermilfoil was found at 30% of the transect sites in 2010, but 75% of the transect sites in 2019. Although Eurasian watermilfoil is present at most sites, densities are generally low to moderate in all three Norway basins. Eurasian watermilfoil is also present in downstream lakes of Games (2014), Andrew (2019) and Florida (2009). Zebra Mussels were found in Norway, Games and Andrew in 2018. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, gravel, rubble, and boulder in Norway.  <br> \n <br> \nNorway lies within the larger Chippewa River Watershed District and sub watershed of Upper Shakopee Creek. The Chippewa River Watershed District was the lead agency for coordinating: nutrient reduction measures, protection from invasive species, information/education, storm water management and the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project prior to 2019. The local Soil Water Conservation District is currently the lead agency.  <br> \n <br> \nThe two large Kandiyohi County Ditches (CD 27 & 29) upstream of Norway are considered the headwaters of Shakopee Creek. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. A group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel have been involved in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters group has monitored water quality and flows in the watershed, encouraged landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilized existing government programs, provided education, and technical assistance. Thus far, DNR Fisheries has provided assistance with lakeshore re-vegetation and water quality monitoring projects within the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey of nearshore fish species was attempted by seine hauls and backpack electrofishing at 24 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations. We sampled 22 stations by near shore electrofishing and 19 stations by seining. Two stations (EFB16 & EFB17) were not accessible for electrofishing or seining in a shallow south bay. Approximately 26 different fish species (17 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 22 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), potentially large sized non-gamefish (Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum, Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead and White Sucker) and small sized non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Fathead Minnow, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Tadpole Madtom, Golden Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Spottail Shiner and Blackchin Shiner).  <br> \n <br> \nFish that require narrow habitat (e.g. continual water flow, submerged woody material, gravel substrate, abundant bulrush vegetation, undisturbed near shore areas, etc.) or water quality conditions (e.g. high clarity, low iron concentrations, moderate phosphorus availability, specific temperature/oxygen ranges, etc.) are classified as intolerant habitat disturbance species. Examples of intolerant habitat disturbance species captured in the FIBI survey included: Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner and Banded Killifish captured in Norway. High tolerant habitat disturbance species captured included: Black Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score was good (51) for Norway, which is above the impairment threshold (36) for this set of similar statewide lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe following results are based on standard summer survey gillnetting and trapnetting, spring Largemouth Bass Electrofishing and YOY Walleye fall electrofishing catches: <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2019 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 4.86 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.86 pounds and 25.65 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 3.36 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were fair. The 2013 and 2012 year classes comprised 29% and 25% respectively in the 2019 Northern Pike survey catch. Norway has a history of producing large Northern Pike. The largest Northern Pike captured was 33.03 inches in the 2019 survey nets. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Norway in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThere is adequate Northern Pike spawning habitat within Norway and adjacent upstream wetland areas, however natural reproduction or recruitment has been poor in recent years. It is unclear if chemical runoff pollution, low spring water levels, degraded habitat or a combination of factors is negatively affecting Northern Pike recruitment in Norway. The Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\" had been used to produce modest Northern Pike fingerling numbers in past years. In prior years, the spawning structure was in need of repair. The Engen NPSA water control structure and dike was repaired with cooperation from the West Central Chapter of the Minnesota Darkhouse & Angling Association in 2012. However, low water levels prevented the use of Engen NPSA in 2014 and 2015. Northern Pike were recently stocked from a variety of sources in 2013 (383 fingerlings, 98 adults; Engen NPSA), 2014 (702 adults; winter rescue sources), 2015 (9,532 fingerlings; New London Hatchery Pond Production) 2016 (4,766 fingerlings, 79 adults; Engen NPSA), 2017 (500 fingerlings; Engen NPSA) and 2018 (24,324 fry, 330 fingerlings; Engen NPSA). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high in 2019 (41.94 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 22.36 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.73 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.16 pounds from trapnets. There were no Bluegill over 8.00 inches captured in the 2019 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2019 (6.59 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average catch rate of 9.51 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Black Crappie average size was small (0.18 pounds and 6.18 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were slow to moderate. The 2018 and 2015 year classes comprised 74% and 9% respectively of the 2019 Black Crappie survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant (41.00 fish/hour) in the 2019 post spawn mid-June electrofishing survey. Sampling was done at 6 representative sampling stations. The 2019 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.02 pounds and 11.30 inches). A previous electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was conducted during post spawn conditions at three historical (bulrush) sites in mid-June of 2015 (30.40 fish/hour, 11.71 inches average length). Largemouth Bass growth rates were fair. The 2015 and 2016 year classes each comprised 22% of the 2019 Largemouth Bass catch from mid-June electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2019 (36.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate of 18.67 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.27 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2019 (12.67 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 7.33 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.26 pounds and 14.98 inches) from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye was also high (6.83 fish/gillnet) for Norway. Walleye growth rates were fair. The 2016 and 2015 Walleye year classes comprised 35% and 17% respectively of the 2019 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers in fall electrofishing surveys were abundant in 2016 (94.00 YOY/hour); moderate in 2012 (32.00 YOY/hour), 2014 (50.00 YOY/hour) and 2018 (56.40 YOY/hour); low in 2011 (14.00 YOY/hour), 2013 (4.00 YOY/hour) and 2015 (16.00 YOY/hour). No fall electrofishing survey was conducted in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nSpicer Strain Walleye fry were recently stocked in Norway during 2012 (1,568,599 fry), 2016 (885,643 Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry) and 2018 (1,132,151 unmarked fry). OTC marked Walleye frylings were stocked in 2011 (16,779 frylings) and 2014 (33,373 frylings). OTC marked fish accounted for 0%, 42% and 67% respectively of the 2011, 2014 and 2016 fall electrofishing YOY Walleye catch rates. A combination of Walleye fingerlings, adults and yearlings have been stocked in 2008 (85,235 fingerlings, 1,864 pounds), 2009 (11,651 yearlings, 987 pounds; 318 fingerlings, 91 pounds; 360 adults, 287 pounds), 2011 (15,477 fingerlings, 737 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 200 pounds; 3 adults, 6 pounds) and 2012 (16,842 yearlings, 802 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2019 (0.12 fish/trapnet and 0.50 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 1.53 fish/trapnet and 3.32 fish/gillnet for Norway. The 2019 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.04 pounds and 12.15 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.68 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum numbers were abundant in 2019 (29.17 fish/gillnet). The Freshwater Drum historical average catch rate is 21.61 fish/gillnet for Norway. The 2019 Freshwater Drum average size was moderate (1.18 pounds and 13.90 inches) from gillnets. The Freshwater Drum historical average weight is 1.08 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were moderate in 2019 (1.18 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 1.58 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Common Carp average size was moderate (6.40 pounds and 21.95 inches) from trapnets. The historical average weight is 9.49 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Norway include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil in connected waters, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for other potential invasive species introductions, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Watershed Project, operating the Engen Northern Pike Spawning Area, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Norway fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species and 2020 for YOY Walleye. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
