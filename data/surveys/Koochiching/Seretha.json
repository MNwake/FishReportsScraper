Sixty-six percent of the lake is less than 15 feet and several winterkills have been reported.  The most recent winterkill reported was in 1989.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1977.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2008. <br> \n     <br> \nBluegill abundance in trap nets was 153.44 fish/set, which was the highest ever recorded in Seretha Lake and almost 4 times higher than the previous record set in 2003 (39.11 fish/set).  The largest captured was 9.1 inches total length (TL) and the oldest was seven years old.  Age in trap nets ranged from 5-7, with age-6 representing 66% of the sample.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide means.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were illegally or accidentally introduced several years ago, which was confirmed by night electrofishing during the 2003 investigation.  Several largemouth bass were observed while netting in 2008; however, electrofishing was not included in the 2008 survey.    <br> \n         <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance 10.67 fish/set, which was well above most class 8 lakes. Three year-classes were captured in gill nets and age ranged from 3-5 years.  Total length ranged from 19.2-27.7 inches and growth was slightly above the statewide mean, but below the area mean.  The mean weight was well above what is found in similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was 1.33 fish/set, which was below what is found in most class 8 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 5-10 years in both gear types combined.  Total length ranged from 18.8-26.0 inches in all gear types combined.  Growth was well above the area average.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seretha is a clear, 56 acre, class 8 lake located 14 miles northeast of Northome.  Although the maximum depth is 25 feet, several winterkills have been reported.  The most recent winterkill reported was in 1989.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1977.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2003.    Bluegill were very abundant (39.11 fish/set in trap nets).  The population is young and sizes are generally small.  However, anlgers report good fishing for bluegill with some keeper-sized fish.  The largest captured during the population assessment was 8.0 inches total length (TL) and the oldest was four years old.  Age in trap nets ranged from 2-4, with age-2 composing 54% of the sample.  Growth was greater than the area and statewide means.      Largemouth bass were illegally or accidentally introduced several years ago.  Night electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass on May 29, 2003.  A total of 35 bass were captured at a rate of 35.0 fish per hour of on-time.  All fish were age-1 and 5.0 inches or less.  Numerous 10-12 inch largemouth bass were observed on nests, but only one bass older than age-1 was captured during the population assessment.       Northern pike gill net abundance was greater than most class 8 lakes.  Five year-classes were captured in gill nets and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Total length ranged from 14.5-27.5 inches and growth was slightly above the statewide mean, but below the area mean.  The average weight was above most class 16 lakes.      Walleye gill net abundance in 2003 was 3.00 fish/set, which was above the median of 2.83 fish/set for class 8 lakes.  Three year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-8 years in gill nets.  Total length ranged from 5.2-22.4 inches in all gear types combined.  Growth was slightly below the area and statewide averages.    </p>",

There is a public access on the west side of the lake with a dock, gravel boat access, and picnic area.  <br> \n <br> \nSeretha has suffered from winterkills in the past due to low dissolved oxygen levels in late winter. A water quality check in March of 2019 revealed extremely low oxygen levels throughout the water column. A regularly scheduled fisheries survey was already set for June of 2019. This survey revealed that there were good numbers of Northern Pike still present in the lake. Unfortunately, no other species were sampled. Northern Pike are a particularly hardy species during low oxygen events.  <br> \n <br> \nDNR Fisheries has actively managed Seretha in the past through fish stocking. A Walleye fry stocking regimen is in place, and will be one tool used to rebuild the gamefish community in Seretha. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill over 8 inches were sampled and the average was 6.2 inches. A decrease in numbers from the last assessment and the absence of fish over 4 years old indicates that there may have been a winterkill in 2010. Fast growth of Bluegill should help Seretha bounce back quickly after winterkill events.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Seretha. Pike numbers were above the expected range for the lake class, but size is relatively small. The largest Pike was 25 inches, and the average was just over 19 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked in Seretha since the late 1970's. Catch rates of Walleye in gill nets have declined over the past three investigations, with no adult Walleye being sampled in 2014. Several juveniles were sampled during spring electrofishing, and one was sampled in trap nets. Walleye numbers will likely remain highly variable in the future, and fisheries managers will continue to experiment with management options to maximize angling opportunities in Seretha.   <br> \n</p>",
