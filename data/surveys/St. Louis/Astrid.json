                "narrative": "<p>Astrid Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Astrid Lake was thermally stratified on 07/30/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 13.5 ft where the temperature was 60 F.  The major inlet, from Crellin Lake, has a steep rapids limiting fish movement; there was no flow in the inlet on 08/02/2000.  The outlet, tributary to the Hunting Shack River, had no barriers to fish movement downstream to USFS 200.  Astrid Lake bottom substrates were mostly sand and gravel.  Aquatic plants were sparse and grew to a depth of 7 ft; the most common plants were sedges, horsetail, and sweetgale.Fish sampling in this lake survey consisted of four gillnet sets, six trapnet sets, and shoreline seining.   Six previous investigations, dating back to 1974, consisted of 3-5 gillnet sets and, in 1974 only, shoreline seining.  No trapnets were set prior to 2000.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 9.4 fish/net (13.2 lb/net) was in the second quartile for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 14.0 fish/net (15.6 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by northern pike and walleye, followed by rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.  Low numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch were also present, as well as Johnny darters and several species of minnows.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (3.8/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 5.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 19.9\" (1.8 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 17.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2000 was 28.0\".  Growth of pike captured in 2000 was generally in the first quartile for area lakes, although the pike scales were difficult to read.Walleye numbers in 2000 (2.5/gillnet, 3.6/trapnet) were in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively, for this lake class, and the gillnet catch was higher than the median catch of 1.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 12.5\" (0.8 lb) in the gillnets, which was in the first quartile for this lake class, and was smaller than the average size of 15.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in the trapnets averaged 14.2\" (1.2 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was larger than in the gillnets.  The largest walleye, caught in a trapnet, was 24.8\".  Most of the walleye (66 percent) were age two, from the fry-stocked 1998 year class.  Walleye growth was generally in the third quartile for area lakes.Rock bass numbers in 2000 (0.5/gillnet, 6.5/trapnet) were in the second and fourth quartiles, respectively, for this lake class and the gillnet catch was similar to the median catch of 0.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Rock bass sizes averaged 7.6\" (0.4 lb) in the trapnets, which was at the third quartile for this lake class.Shorthead redhorse were only captured in the trapnets in 2000, while white sucker were only captured in the gillnets.  Sucker numbers (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 3.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes averaged 16.8\", while redhorse sizes averaged 19.1\".    </p>",

The total number of fish (8.5/gillnet) and pounds of fish (11.5/gillnet) captured in this assessment is fairly low.   No trapnets have been set in this lake due to inaccessibility. Northern pike sizes are smaller than average for the area, while walleye sizes are larger than average.  Northern pike recruitment is satisfactory.  Natural recruitment of walleye is almost nonexistent and the population is dependent on fry stocking.  Walleye growth is faster than average, while northern pike growth is slower than average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Astrid Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.   Astrid Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index <br> \n <br> \nAstrid Lake was thermally stratified on 7/24/2006 with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 13 feet, where the temperature was 63 F.  The major inlet to Astrid Lake, from Crellin Lake, has a steep rapids limiting fish movement.  The outlet, tributary to the Hunting Shack River, has no barriers to fish movement downstream to USFS Road 200.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Astrid Lake are mostly sand and gravel.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 feet. The most common plants are shoreline fringe plants including sedges, horsetail, and sweetgale. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2006 fish population assessment consisted of 4 gillnets.  Seven previous fisheries investigations on Astrid Lake, dating back to 1974, used 3-5 gillnets.  Trapnets (6 sets) were used only during the 2000 investigation.  Shoreline seining was done in 1974, 1976, and 2000. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2006, as in previous investigations on this lake, were dominated by northern pike, walleye, and white sucker.  Low numbers of other fish species were captured. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (5.8/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median pike catch of 5.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2006 averaged 18.3 inches (1.3 lb), which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class, but was similar to the average size of 18.0 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2006 was 27.2 inches.  Pike from six year-classes were captured in 2006.  Pike growth was slower than normal by area standards (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were present in low numbers (0.2/gillnet) in the initial 1974 fisheries investigation.  Walleye fry were stocked annually from 1975-78 and biennially from 1980-2006.  Walleye numbers in 2006 (4.0/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were higher than the median walleye catch of 2.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2006 averaged 13.6 inches (1.1 lb), which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 15.1 inches in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye from seven year-classes were captured in 2006, with about equal numbers from stocked years and from non-stocked years.  Walleye growth was in the normal range (second or third quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nSucker numbers in 2006 (2.5/gillnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median sucker catch of 3.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2006 averaged 16.4 inches (2.0 lb), which was normal (at the median) for this lake class and was similar to the average sucker size of 16.3 inches in all investigations on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nA few of the northern pike examined in 2006 were infected with neascus (black spot). Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

This lake is characterized by it's surrounding landscape dominated by red pines with other conifers and sandy shoal water areas. \n\nThere is an 88 rod portage from FR 200 located on the W side of the lake for public access. Another option is to navigate the Hunting Shack River upstream from the Echo Trail (CR116). There are two USFS campsites located on the lake for visitor use.\n\nWalleye numbers in 2016 (3.3/gill net) were slightly higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average walleye sampled was 17 inches long and about 6 years old. The largest walleye sampled was nearly 31 inches long. Walleye fry have been stocked in Astrid Lake since the 1970's.\n\nNorthern pike numbers in 2016 (3.7/gill net) were slightly lower compared to past assessments on this lake. The average pike sampled was 19 inches long and the largest pike was 28.5 inches long.\n\nSix other species were sampled including bluegill, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker and yellow perch. This is the first time bluegill have been sampled or observed in Astrid Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Astrid Lake is a 120 acre lake located 20 miles north of Tower.  The access is via a portage from USFS Road 200.  The lake can also be accessed via the Hunting Shack River from the Echo Trail.  This requires adequate water levels on the river which is subject to low water levels at times.  Astrid has a maximum depth of 30 feet and brown bog-stained water.   <br> \n <br> \nOn July 8, 2021 Astrid Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 79 F and a bottom temperature of 47 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 21 feet where the temperature was 47 degrees.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand, boulder, and ledge rock.    <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 11.7 fish/net which was below average compared to past surveys on Astrid Lake.  Yield was 17.1 lbs/net which was also below average for the lake.  Fish species sampled were white sucker, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, shorthead redhorse, burbot, and rock bass.    <br> \n <br> \nTwelve walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 2.0 fish/net, which was right at the average compared to other similar lakes but slightly below average compared to past surveys on Astrid Lake.  Lengths ranged from 10 to over 24 inches with an average of over 17 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 10 years with 58% of the catch coming from years when walleye fry were stocked.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 3.0 fish/net which was the second lowest on record compared to past surveys on Astrid.  Lengths ranged from 15 to 24 inches with an average 19 inches.  Sizes were similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 0.8 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes but slightly better than the average for Astrid.  Sizes were relatively small with a range of 5.5 to 8 inches, which was similar to past surveys.   <br> \n</p>",
