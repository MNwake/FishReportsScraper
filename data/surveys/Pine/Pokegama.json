The yellow perch at 20.18 per set was slightly low but showed a marked increase compared to previous surveys.  The bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie had very low figures while the white crappie was slightly high in the trapnet and very high in the gillnet.  The black, brown, and yellow bullheads all had very low population figures.  The channel catfish and white sucker had slightly high populations.  The redhorse was slightly low while the white bass, bowfin, and carp had average populations.  The freshwater drum was high at 17.36 per set.  The largemouth bass was not taken in the gill net or trapnet but was present in the shoreline seining results.  Largemouth bass also observed in shallow water by survey personnel.  Muskellunge are present in Pokegama Lake but none were captured.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a very fertile highly developed 1,474 acre basin located near Pine City west of I-35.  Despite having an abundance of shallow water acreage (61% at 15 feet or less), the lake has not experienced a major summer or winter fish kill in many years.  Nuisance algae blooms have been an issue since 1929 which has prompted local concerns in regards to the lakes water quality over the past decade.  According to a study conducted by Barr Engineering in 1991-92, phosphorus loading into Pokegama Lake originates from a variety of sources.  These include, in order of abundance, internal loading from sediments, Pokegama Creek, Snake River, septic systems along the lake margin, directprecipitation, the remaining watershed, and urban sources.  Pokegama Lakes high nutrient levels, which is causing densealgae blooms, is a limiting factor for aquatic plant abundance and ultimately the types of fish present and their abundance.  The lake is currently managed primarily for walleye and northern pike with black crappie, white crappie, and channel catfish as the secondary management species.A standard lake survey was conducted during the open water season of 2000 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning fish habitat, and the water quality.  Fish sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, summer gill and trap netting, late summer shoreline seining, and fall night electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleye.  Walleye numbers were below normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 1.4 pounds, was within a normal range.  Lengths of sampled walleye extended from 9.8 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 15.9 inches.  Since strong year classes of walleye were present during non-stocked years, walleye fingerling stocking was discontinued in 1991.  However, year classes represented since 1992 were found to be small during the 2000 survey.  This suggests that the contribution of natural fish to the walleye population may not be adequate to sustain a suitable population.  As part of the accelerated walleye stocking program, which began during the summer of 1999, 1.5 million walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2000.  The abundance of northern pike and the average weight, at 3.2 pounds, were above normal.  When compared to previous surveys dating back to 1953, the 2000 abundance level was at an all time high.  Measured northern ranged from 13.1 to 32.0 inches with an average length of 23.5 inches.  Normal growth was determined for walleye and northern pike.  Black crappie numbers were well above normal while white crappie abundance was at a normal level.  The 2000 catch rate was the highest ever recorded for black crappie.  Overall, white crappie numbers have remained consistent since the last survey in 1995.  Black crappie lengths extended from 3.9 to 11.6 inches while white crappie lengths ranged from 4.6 to 12.3 inches.  Both crappie species were found to have a very large 1997 year class.  When compared to crappie growth statwide, Pokegama Lake crappie had above average growth at age one and normal growth thereafter.  A total of 63 channel catfish ranging from 12.6 to 31.3 inches were sampled with an abundance of nice sized fish at 22.0 inches or greater in length.  Spring night electrofishing captured a total of 7 largemouth bass ranging from 5.0 to 12.0 inches.  Historically, largemouth numbers have always been low.  Lack of submerged vegetation may be a limiting factor for largemouth.  Bluegill sunfish were found at a normal abundance level while the average size was above normal.  Bluegill lenths ranged from 4.3 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Despite Pokegama Lakes lack of adequate submerged vegetation, bluegill abundance levels in 2000 reached an all time high with the majority of bluegill from the 1995 year class.  Bluegill growth was determined to be normal.  Yellow perch, an important food source for walleye and northern pike, were found at record high levels in 2000.  Shoreline seining efforts found excellent reproductive success for black crappie and good natural reproduction for bluegill sunfish and yellow perch.  The fish community in Pokegama Lake was also made up of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), chestnut lamprey, common carp, freshwater drum, greater redhorse, golden redhorse, hybrid sunfish, logperch, pumpkinseed sunfish, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, spottail shiner, white bass, and white sucker.  Black bullhead, bowfin, and common carp were normal in abundance while brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead were below normal and freshwater drum, shorthead redhorse and white sucker were above normal.Anglers are likely to encounter a few keeper sized walleye or an abundance of nice sized northern pike or channel catfish.  The abundance of larger catfish present provides an extraordinary lake fishing experience in the Pine City area.  Currently, an excellent number of black and white crappie between 7.0 and 9.0 inches are part of the crappie population and should provide a satisfying fishing experience to panfish anglers over the next couple years.  Panfish enthusiasts could also see more nice sized bluegill sunfish during their fishing outing since the number of larger bluegill present is at an all time high.  The current management goals set for Pokegama Lake are to maintain a walleye population between 1.5 and 4.0 per gill net lift with an average weight ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 pounds, to increase the northern pike population to a rate somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 per gill net lift, and to control the freshwater drum population to less than 15.0 per gill net lift through commercial removal.  The 2000 assessment found walleye abundance slightly below the desired range while northern pike numbers exceeded their desired range.  However, current average walleye size and freshwater drum abundance satisfy the above stated goals.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing larger fish will help maintain or enhance the quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Since Pokegama Lake already has poor water quality, additional nutrient input may further decrease water quality.  Land users within the surrounding watershed and lakeshore property owners can assist with improving the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of the lake with native plants, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of imperivous surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a very fertile, highly developed 1,474 acre basin located near Pine City.  Despite having an abundance of shallow water acreage (61% at 15 feet or less), the lake has not experienced a major summer or winter fish kill in many years.  Nuisance algae blooms, an issue since 1929, have prompted local concerns in regards to the lake's water quality over the past decade.  According to a study conducted by Barr Engineering in 1991-92, phosphorus loading into Pokegama Lake originates from a variety of sources.  These include, in order of abundance, internal loading from sediments, Pokegama Creek, Snake River, septic systems along the lake margin, direct precipitation, the remaining watershed, and urban sources.  This nutrient load can cause dense algae blooms which limit aquatic plant abundance.  The shoreline is predominately sand with public access available on both the north and south shore.  Management is primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Walleye stocking ceased from 1991 until 2000, when annual fry stocking was initiated.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2004 when fall fingerling stocking resumed. A lake population assessment was conducted during July of 2005 to evaluate the current status of the fish population and lake managemnent goals.  Walleye numbers remained below normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 2.9 pounds, was above the normal range.  Lengths of sampled walleye extended from 16.1 to 24.6 inches with a 19.7 inch average.  Year classes have been small since walleye fingerling stocking was discontinued in 1991.  This suggests that the contribution of natural fish to the walleye population may not be adequate to sustain a suitable population.  Hopefully, the return of fall fingerling stocking will raise walleye numbers to goal levels.  Like walleye, northern pike numbers have decreased compared to the last two nettings and were below the normal range for the lake class.  However, both northern abundance and size met the management goals.   Pike averaged 3.4 pounds and ranged from 9.7 to 39.4 inches.  Black crappie numbers remain good with most larger than 8 inches.  White crappie were far less abundant but can still add to the crappie catch.  A total of 13 channel catfish ranging from 13 to 27.2 inches were sampled offering a rare, trophy fishery.  Spring night electrofishing captured a total of 9 largemouth bass all exceeding 12 inches in length.  Though bass were quality sized their abundance has historically been low compared to many lakes in the management area.  The lack of submerged vegetation in mid summer may be limiting largemouth recruitment.  Bluegill sunfish were found at a normal abundance with a quarter pound average.  Bluegill lenths ranged from 4.0 to 9.6 inches with 45% of the catch 7 inches or larger.  Yellow perch, an important food source for walleye and northern pike, were still abundant after reaching record levels in 2000.  Enough perch, 27%, exceed 8 inches to provide at least a bonus to panfish anglers.  The fish community also included black, and brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheephead), pumpkinseed sunfish, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, lake sturgeon, and white bass.  Fishing pressure is generally moderate but, coupled with pleasure boaters, lake use can be high.  Anglers are likely to encounter a few quality sized walleye, northern pike, or channel catfish.  Black crappie and bluegill should provide good fishing for panfish enthusiasts with an occasional nice sized white crappie or yellow perch.  The current management goals set for Pokegama Lake are to maintain a walleye population between 1.5 and 4.0 per gill net lift with an average weight ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 pounds, a northern pike catch rate somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 per gill net lift, and to control the freshwater drum population to less than 15.0 per gill net lift through commercial removal.  The 2005 assessment found walleye abundance below the desired range while management goals were met for northern pike and drum abundance, and walleye size. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a very fertile, highly developed 1,474 acre basin located near Pine City.  Despite having an abundance of shallow water acreage (61% at 15 feet or less), the lake has not experienced a major summer or winter fish kill in many years.  Nuisance algae blooms, an issue since 1929, have prompted local concerns in regards to the lake's water quality over the past decade.  According to a study conducted by Barr Engineering in 1991-92, phosphorus loading into Pokegama Lake originates from a variety of sources.  These include, in order of abundance, internal loading from sediments, Pokegama Creek, Snake River, septic systems along the lake margin, direct precipitation, the remaining watershed, and urban sources.  This nutrient load can cause dense algae blooms which limit aquatic plant abundance.  The shoreline is predominately sand with public access available on both the north and south shore.  Management is primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Walleye stocking ceased from 1991 until 2000, when annual fry stocking was initiated.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2004 when fall fingerling stocking resumed.  Walleye fingerlings (903 pounds) are now stocked annually.  <br> \n <br> \nA lake population assessment was conducted during July of 2010 to evaluate the current status of the fish population and lake management goals.  Walleye numbers remained below normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 1.4 pounds, was in the normal range.  Lengths of sampled walleye extended from 9.3 to 24.0 inches with a 15.2 inch average.  Based on walleye age data, year classes have been small from non-stocked years.  This suggests that the contribution of natural fish to the walleye population may not be adequate to sustain a fishable population.  Hopefully, the increase in fall fingerling stocking will raise walleye numbers to goal levels.  Like walleye, northern pike numbers have decreased compared to the last three nettings and were below the normal range for the lake class.  Pike averaged 2.9 pounds and ranged from 12.7 to 33.2 inches.  Black crappie numbers remain good with most larger than 9 inches.  White crappie were far less abundant but can still add to the crappie catch.  A total of 65 channel catfish ranging from 14.4 to 30.3 inches were sampled offering a rare, trophy fishery.  Spring night electrofishing captured a total of only 2 largemouth bass.  Though bass were quality sized their abundance has historically been low compared to other lakes in the management area.  The lack of submerged vegetation in mid to late summer may be limiting largemouth recruitment.  Bluegill sunfish abundance was low based on the trap net catch but unusually high in the gill nets.  With a 0.35 pound average, more than half the bluegills caught exceeded 7.5 inches in length.  Yellow perch, an important food source for walleye and northern pike, were relatively scarce after posting high catches in 2000 and 2005.  Enough perch, 62%, exceed 8 inches to provide at least a bonus to panfish anglers.  The fish community also included black and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), chestnut lamprey, common carp, freshwater drum (sheephead), pumpkinseed sunfish, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, and white bass.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure is generally moderate but, coupled with pleasure boaters, lake use can be high.  Anglers are likely to encounter a few quality sized walleye, northern pike, or channel catfish.  Black crappie and bluegill should provide good fishing for panfish enthusiasts with an occasional nice sized white crappie or yellow perch.  The current management goals set for Pokegama Lake are to maintain a walleye population between 1.5 and 4.0 per gill net lift with an average weight ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 pounds, a northern pike catch rate somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 per gill net lift, and to control the freshwater drum population to less than 15.0 per gill net lift through commercial removal.  The 2010 assessment found walleye and northern pike abundance below the desired range while management goal was met for freshwater drum.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Pokegama Lake was conducted on June 24-25, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Eighteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each station was sampled by backpack electrofishing. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seventeen stations but one station was not seined due to soft substrates, abundant wild rice, and deep water.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Burbot, Logperch, and Rock Bass) and one species that is classified as tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data are combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from the 2019 FIBI survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Pokegama Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey contributed biological information about the health of the fish community in Pokegama Lake to the Snake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama is a 1,474 acre lake managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and crappie.  Various stocking has occurred through the years but has ceased since 1991.  Commercial roughfish harvest still takes place on an occasional winter, with the last removal in 1993.  During July 10-14, 1995, a DNR fisheries crew conducted a population assessment to evaluate the present fish population on Pokegama Lake (lake class 27).  Gear types consisted of 12 gillnets and 12 trapnets.  Four of the 12 gillnets were intentionally set in shallow water (4.5-6') to see if walleye net catches would increase.  Past surveys indicated that walleyes in Pokegama Lake frequent shallow water during the summer months.  Additional fish sampling included shoreline seine hauls to document young-of-year hatch/survival.Netting found the walleye abundance to be at normal levels for this type of lake, however, the nets sampled the highest walleye catch compared to previous catches in the 8 surveys dating back to 1953.  The previous high catch was in 1987.  The 4 \"shallow\" gillnet sets contributed to 48% of the overall gillnet catch, which in some ways validates the assumption that walleyes are frequently more common in shallow water in Pokegama Lake, during summer months.  The walleyes sampled ranged from 11.9 to 25.0 inches with an average of 15.4 inches.  Most were from 13-19 inches.  Average weight was 1.2 pounds.  Ages 2-6,7, and 9 were sampled with ages 3 and 4 being dominant.  Over 1/3 of the walleyes sampled were ages 2 and 3 which were natural reproduced fish occurring after the lake's final stocking in 1991.  This is good evidence of Pokegama's walleye population consisting of natural fish without the use of stocking.  With the strong presence of ages 2 and 3 in the lake, this confirms the reasoning for the discontinuation of walleye stocking.  The age 2 fish were less abundant than age 3 but it shows consecutive natural walleye hatch and survival.  In most natural walleye lakes, the walleye spawning success is far from consistent.  Pokegama Lake is no exception.  Water levels bounce 2-3' annually which can directly affect hatching success.  The Snake River has been known to contribute to the walleye population, but fish movement between lake and river have not been assessed.  Early shoreline seining checks on the lake (7/10/95) found young-of-year walleye which accounts for natural reproduction in 1995.  Other survey years have also sampled walleyes from years when there was no stocking.The northern pike abundance was below expected normal levels for this lake type.  The good side is that it was the highest recorded catch since 1953.  Their lengths ranged from 13.5 to 29.3 inches with an average of 20.7 inches.  Average weight was 2.2 pounds.  A 39.4 inch northern pike weighing 15.0 pounds was captured near the northeast end of the lake.  Ages 2-7 were represented in the catch.The channel catfish again showed how their abundance levels maintain an important role in the general fish population.  They add a feature unique to Pokegama's fishery while providing a goodsize distribution.  Lengths ranged from 13.8 to 24.6 inches with an average length of 19.7 inches.  Average weight was 2.7 pounds.Black crappie catches were typical of their \"cyclic\" historical catch.  The trapnets showed improvement to their abundance with the highest catch on record.  Lengths from the trapnets ranged from 3.2 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches.  Apparently, ages 2 and 3 were represented well in the catch.The white crappie gillnet catch has varied from highs to lows through the years and now falls within the normal abundance range for this lake type.  The trapnet catch, however, was also the highest on record categorizing them with above normal abundance.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 15.3 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.Bluegill abundance continues to be low.  Past surveys have never shown bluegills to be a dominant panfish in the lake but their sizes are well distributed indicating annual spawning.  Once in while there has been a strong presence of bluegills, as reflected by good angler catches.  The lack of lakewide submerged vegetation most likely determines their low presence.  For this species, weeds are habitat and the more weeds the lake has (to a desirable point) the more bluegills would be present.  Recently, the DNR and Pokegama Lake Association have been making steps towards planting shoreline cover plants, such as bulrush, to provide for fish habitat, shoreline stabilization, and natural water buffers whereby the plants feed off of excessive nutrients common to the lakes water.  This process can only benefit the lake in many ways.Largemouth bass have never been sampled in gillnets or trapnets in any of the surveys dating back to 1953.  The only time the DNR records this fish would be during shoreline seining and electrofishing efforts, and only then is an adequate number of bass sampled to show their presence.  Similar to the low bluegill catch, this lake is not suited as a bass lake unless there is an increase in vegetation.Freshwater drum have made their mark in the fish population of Pokegama Lake.  Since the 1970's, they have been sampled more numerously than the other species, but on occasion the crappies were sampled at higher levels.  Again, high levels were found during this survey.  Drum ranged from 4.4 to 16.3 inches with the average around 11.0-12.0 inches.Redhorse species, golden, shorthead, and silver always make up a significant catch in the nets.  Unlike carp, these sucker-type fish are native to the Snake River system and are a natural part of the lake's ecosystem even though they sometimes appear to be very abundant.  Their natural diet consists of mostly small aquatic organisms, especially insect larvae.  They are actually considered by some to be an indicator of how healthy or clean the water is.   Past surveys had similar netting results.Common carp were sampled at normal abundance levels for this type of lake.  They were large fish averaging 29.6 inches with the largest being 34.3 inches.  This catch was slightly lower than the historical average catch for Pokegama Lake.  Carp will always be present in the lake and river system.  As long as the game fish species remain at their recent levels, carp abundance should stay in check and hopefully their impact on the lake will be held to minimum.Nine other species were represented in the netting gear; bowfin, chestnut lamprey, golden shiner, logperch, pumpkinseed, smallmouth bass, white bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.  The abundance levels of all nine species were either normal or below normal for this type of lake (lake class 27).Prepared by Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

AGING OF WALLEYES INDICATES THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNI- FICANTLY TO THE CURRENT POPULATION. FINGERLING STOCKING IN 1984 AND 1985 HAS NOT PRODUCED AGE CLASSES SUFFICIENTLY LARGE ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE WALLEYE GROWTH RATE IS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THIS AREA AND THE MEAN LENGTH OF WALLEYES TAKEN IN NETS IS 13.4 INCHES. NORTHERN PIKE (0.27/SET) HAVE SHOWN A REAL DECLINE SINCE 1981 (1.36/SET) AND ARE VERY LOW COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN (3.88/SET) THE GROWTH RATE OF THE SEVEN NORTHERN PIKE TAKEN APPEARS TO BE NORMAL. YELLOW PERCH )12.27/SET) HAV E SHOWN A REAL DECLINE SINCE 1981 (20.18/SET) AND ARE BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN (24.27/SET) BUT REMAIN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN SURVEYS PRIOR TO 1981. THE MEAN LENGTH IS 6.6 INCHES. ALTHOUGH NO LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE TAKEN IN NETS, YOY BASS WERE PRESENT IN SHORELINE SEINING. ONLY ONE MUSKELLUNGE WAS TAKEN  IN NETS (30.7 INCHES). SPRING 1988.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake, located west of Pine City, is a highly developed and extremely fertile lake of 1,474 acres. The lake is currently managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike. The lake is stocked with approximately 500 lbs. of Walleye fingerlings in odd-numbered years. There are two public concrete boat ramps on the lake, one on the north end and one on the south end. A survey comprised of 12 gill net and 10 trap net sets was conducted in late July 2018 to assess fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers with a gill net catch of 1.1 fish per net. Although this is low compared to similar lakes, it is typical compared to previous surveys of Pokegama. Size was typical averaging 14.6 inches and growth appears to be good. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Northern Pike at a rate of 1.83 fish per net. This is low compared to similar lakes but is typical for Pokegama and meets the management goal of 2 fish per net. Size was large with fish ranging from 20 to 33 inches and averaging 26 inches in length. Almost all fish aged were assigned to year classes from 2013 to 2010 and growth appeared to be somewhat variable.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 4.5 fish per trap net. This was better than previous surveys and high relative to similar lakes. Size was typical with the average length being 9 inches and the longest 11.6 inches. Not many small individuals were sampled. White Crappie abundance was low with 0.5 fish per trap net and 2.75 fish per gill net. These catch rates are below average for the lake class but White Crappie abundance has been low in Pokegama Lake since the 1990's. White Crappie size was typical averaging 9.4 inches in gill nets with some large fish, the largest of which was 12.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate of 4.3 fish per trap net was low but similar to the last several surveys. Low abundance was offset by large size which averaged 0.28 lbs. Bluegills have historically had a relatively large size structure in this system. Fish averaged 6.8 inches in length with the largest being just over 9 inches and 58% of fish sampled exceeding 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has historically been quite variable and it remains low with a catch rate of 3 fish per gill net. Fish averaged 8 inches in length but the largest was only 9.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish had a historically high catch rate of 9.4 fish per gill net. This is approximately three times larger than the lake's historic average. These fish were of impressive size with an average weight of 3.7 lbs. and average length of 20.3 inches. The largest individual measured 32.8 inches and approximately a quarter of fish sampled were longer than 25 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 1.5 fish per net, substantially higher than the last several surveys. Fish were of a typical size ranging from 13.8 to 15.4 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was conducted in late May. Largemouth were sampled at a rate of 10.7 fish per hour and Smallmouth were sampled at a rate of 3 fish per hour. These are both low rates but higher than any previous Pokegama surveys. This is the first time that Smallmouth have been sampled using spring nighttime electrofishing. The Smallmouth were only about 9 inches long and the Largemouth averaged 12.3 inches but the largest individual was 19.3 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake is a very fertile, highly developed 1,474 acre basin located near Pine City.  Despite having an abundance of shallow water acreage (61% at 15 feet or less), the lake has not experienced a major summer or winter fish kill in many years.  Nuisance algae blooms are common in summer due to phosphorus loading from the watershed, the lake margin, lake sediments and direct precipitation.  This nutrient load can cause dense algae blooms which limit aquatic plant abundance.  The shoreline is predominately sand with public access available on both the north and south shore.  Management is primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Walleye stocking ceased from 1991 until 2000, when annual fry stocking was initiated.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2004 when fall fingerling stocking resumed.  Walleye fingerlings (903 pounds) are now stocked annually.  <br> \n <br> \nA lake population assessment was conducted during July of 2014 to evaluate the current status of the fish population and lake management goals.  Based on the gillnet catch, Walleye were below normal for lakes of this type in both their number and average size.  Trapnets are not usually the gear of choice for assessing Walleye, however they captured notably larger Walleye during the 2014 assessment of Pokegama Lake.  Lengths of captured Walleye from the two gear types combined ranged from 7.3 to 25.3 inches.  Of the Walleye aged, most were 3 year olds from the 2011 year-class.  The Northern Pike numbers have decreased each assessment since 2000 and were below the normal range for the lake class. Northern Pike from gillnets and trapnets combined averaged 4.4 pounds and ranged from 9.8 to 37.2 inches.  Black Crappie numbers remain good with most larger than 9 inches.  White Crappie were far less abundant but can still add to the crappie catch.  Channel Catfish were less numerous than in the previous assessment but slightly larger averaging just over 22 inches and 4 pounds.  Channel Catfish provide a different opportunity that some anglers may enjoy.  Compared to similar lakes, Bluegill Sunfish were typical in abundance but larger in size.  Most Bluegills sampled exceeded 7.5 inches in length with 30% of the catch 8 inches or better.  Yellow Perch, an important food source for Walleye and Northern Pike, were again low in number.  Half the perch catch exceeded 8 inches, providing at least a bonus to panfish anglers.  The fish community also included Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Chestnut Lamprey, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (Sheephead), Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, Lake Sturgeon, Bigmouth Buffalo, Quillback, and White Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure is generally moderate but, along with pleasure boaters, lake use can be high.  Anglers are likely to encounter a few quality sized Walleye, Northern Pike, or Channel Catfish.  Black Crappie and Bluegill should provide good fishing for panfish enthusiasts with an occasional White Crappie or Yellow Perch.  The current management goals set for Pokegama Lake are to maintain a Walleye population between 1.5 and 4.0 per gill net lift with an average weight ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 pounds, a Northern Pike catch rate somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 per gill net lift, and to control the Freshwater Drum population to less than 15.0 per gill net lift through commercial removal.  The 2014 assessment found Walleye and Northern Pike abundance below the desired range while the management goal was met for Freshwater Drum.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pokegama Lake, located west of Pine City, is a highly developed and extremely fertile lake of 1,474 acres. The lake is currently managed primarily for Walleye and sunfish. The lake is stocked with 1,170 lbs. of Walleye fingerlings in odd-numbered years. A ten sunfish bag limit was initiated in 2022 to help maintain size quality. There are two public concrete boat ramps on the lake, one on the north end and one on the south end. A survey comprised of 12 gill net (July), 12 trap net (May) sets and night electrofishing (June) was conducted to the assess fish populations and lake management goals.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at their highest rate since 1995, 2.3 fish per net.  Walleye size was good with more than half the sample exceeding 15 inches.  Natural reproduction's contribution to the population is evidenced by the 2020-year class, a non-stocking year, representing more than a third of the aged Walleyes.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Northern Pike at a rate of 2 fish per net, a typical catch for Pokegama Lake. Pike were quality sized with more than half the sample longer than 26 inches and an average weight of 4.3 pounds.  Most aged northerns were between 4 and 7 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of both Black and White Crappie was up in both net types compared to most prior assessments. Crappie size was very positive especially in the May trap net catch where three fourths of the Black Crappie and all White Crappie were over 9 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nDespite the change to May sampling the Bluegill catch, 3.4 fish per trap net, was like the last several surveys. Low abundance was offset by large size with averages of 6.8 inches and a third of a pound.  Fish over 9 inches were present.  Bluegills have historically had a larger size structure and lower abundance, both factors that led to the new 10 fish bag limit.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has historically been quite variable and remains low with a catch rate less than one fish per gill net. Although bigger fish were present most were under 8 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch, 4.3 per net, has moderated since the high catch in 2018 to a level near the  historic average. Fish size remains impressive with an average weight of 3.9 lbs. and average length of 21.5 inches. The largest individual measured 32.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities look promising on Pokegama Lake. Quality sized Walleye, Northern Pike and Bluegill are available at abundance levels typical of the lake. Both Black and White Crappie numbers are up with an plenty of nine-inch plus fish. Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, White Bass and Lake Sturgeon all offer anglers an option not available in many lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In July 1990 a lake survey was conducted on Pokegama Lake to assess the fish population status.  Netting consisted of 11 gillnet and 8 trapnet sets and shoreline seining efforts.  Night electrofishing in early September took place to gather more data on walleye relative abundance due to low catches during the survey.  Based on the results of these efforts, the status of the fish population compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows:\n  The walleye (0.18/set) net catch has shown a real decrease from net catch of the previous survey in 1987 (3.18/set).  This catch exhibits a population lower than the statewide median catch (2.28/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.00/set).  The walleye net catch (2 fish) was considered very low.  Electrofishing efforts captured 7 walleyes, (2.54 walleyes/hour).  They ranged from 9.0 - 11.4 inches with a median length group of 9.5 - 9.9 inches.  As documented in the present survey, electrofishing efforts were rated as poor due to heavy algae blooms and low response to the electrical field.  The trapnet catch for the 6 walleyes taken during the survey was 0.75/set.  Age analysis of the 15 walleyes sampled by all efforts consisted of 7 year-classes.  Age classes I and II made up 67% of this sample.  Growth rates were similar to normal when compared to statewide average growth rates.  Annual walleye fingerling stocking for Pokegama Lake has taken place since 1984, with the exception of one year (1986). According to recent surveying techniques, there does not appear to be any positive impact on the walleye population, due to stocking.  Historically, natural reproduction within the lake, and especially the Snake River, has demonstrated that walleye net catches for Pokegama Lake are consistent with the statewide median catch.\n  Although the walleye net catches were low, additional information pertaining to the fish population status should be credited.  For example, the DNR creel census conducted on Pokegama Lake in 1988 recorded a high walleye catch rate of 0.50 walleyes/hour.  Comparative catch rates from two popular walleye lakes in Minnesota, Mille Lacs Lake and Lake of the Woods, recorded catches rates of 0.17 walleyes /hour and 0.30 walleyes/hour, respectively.\n  The northern pike (0.36/set) net catch was higher than the 1987 catch (0.27/set) but was below the statewide median catch (3.43/set) and the first quartile (1.75/set).  Historically, the net catches have been low.  The length frequency distribution ranged between 19.0 - 33.9 inches.  Mean weight was 4.18 pounds.  \n  The white crappie (11.75/set) net catch was up considerably from the 1987 catch (0.29/set).  This increase was well above the statewide median (1.60/set) and was above the third quartile (5.33/set).  The lengths ranged from 6.5 - 9.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5 - 7.9 inches.  Age class II represented 81% of this catch.  Growth rates expressed normal to fast growth.\n  The black crappie (1.00/set) catch was up slightly from the previous survey (0.43/set) but lower than the statewide median (5.86/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.75/set).  In surveys dating back to 1953, black crappies have generally been caught in lower numbers compared to white crappies.\n  Largemouth bass have never been recorded in trapnets or gillnets since the 1953 summer surveys, although, shoreline seining has always recorded young-of-year bass in each of the surveys.  The necessary suitable habitat for bass appears to be limited.  Electrofishing efforts did not record any largemouth bass during the 2.76 hours of shocking time.\n  The bluegill (2.75/set) catch dropped from the previous survey (5.28/set) and falls well below the statewide median (21.79/set) and below the first quartile (6.37/set).  Bluegill net catches have always been considered low for this lake.\n  The channel catfish (2.18/set) net catch was lower than the 1987 catch (2.55/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 11.0 to 24.9 inches.  Age classes III - VIII were represented by this sample.  \n  The yellow perch (1.54/set) catch took a real decrease from the previous survey catch (12.27/set) and fell below the statewide median and first quartile, 12.75/set and 4.91/set, respectively.\n  Carp have long been of concern in Pokegama Lake.  Removal by netting was attempted several times by State crews.  Since 1984, commercial fishing has removed 547,115 pounds of carp.  The 1990 net catch (0.38/set) decreased from the 1987 catch (1.71/set) and was lower than the statewide median (1.00/set).\n  Like the carp, most anglers do not desire to harvest freshwater drum.  The drum catch (14.27/set) was up from the previous survey (5.09/set) and was typical of the statewide median catch (14.92/set).  Commercial fishing since 1984 has removed 110,040 pounds of freshwater drum.\n  Eight (8) other species, captured by gillnets and trapnets, included:  bowfin, white sucker, silver redhorse, golden redhorse, shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and white bass.  Five (5) of these fish species were below their respective first quartile net catches:  bowfin, the three bullhead species, and white bass.  The redhorse species were at typical net catches when compared to statewide medians.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  A population assessment of Pokegama Lake was conducted on July 6-9, 1992 utilizing eleven gillnet sets and five shoreline seine hauls to evaluate walleye abundance.  Based on fish samples collected at this time the present fish population of Pokegama Lake was evaluated through comparisons with previous investigations and lake class medians (lake class 32).\n  The walleye gillnet catch (1.73/set) was a significant increase from the 1990 catch of 0.18/set and considered normal in reference to the lake class median of 2.28/set.  The sampled walleye ranged in length from 8.0-25.0 inches with a median length group of 13.0-13.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 1.34 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 1.56 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from spine and scale samples indicated that captured walleye were one, three, four, six, seven, or nine years old with nearly 3/4 being three and four years old.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of the species.  As mentioned in the additional field notes section, field crews observed many walleyes being caught in six feet of water.  Standard gillnetting techniques do not sample shallow water in lakes like Pokegama due to navigational hazards.  Gillnets were set in depths greater than eight feet.\n  The northern pike gillnet catch has historically been low.  The current catch (1.45/set) was a significant increase from the 1990 survey catch of 0.36/set but below the first quartile value (1.75/ set) of the lake class suggesting a low population.  The sampled northern pike ranged in length from 12.0-31.9 inches with a median length group of 20.0-20.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 2.12 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 2.44 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike ranged from two to eight years of age with 50% being four and five years old.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of northern pike.\n  The channel catfish gillnet catch (4.18/set) was the highest ever recorded on Pokegama Lake by DNR personnel dating back to 1953.  Sampled channel catfish ranged in length from 8.5-27.9 inches with a mean length group of 17.0- 17.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 2.35 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from spine samples indicated that the captured channel catfish ranged in age from two to seven years with one nine year old.  Half of the fish were four years old.  The growth of channel catfish in Pokegama Lake is very near the norm for the Snake River watershed.\n  The black crappie gillnet catch (1.82/set) was up from the 1990 catch of 0.18/set but normal compared to the lake class median of 5.14/set.  The sampled black crappie ranged in length from 4.0-9.9 inches with a mean group length of 7.0-7.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.20 pounds which is very near the lake class mean of 0.22 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured black crappie ranged in age from three to seven years with a fairly even distribution among the age classes.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The white crappie gillnet catch (1.36/set) was down from the 1990 catch of 5.36/set and below the first quartile value (2.71/set) of the lake class.  Sampled white crappie ranged in length from 4.0-9.9 inches with a median length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.17 pounds which is normal based on the lake class mean of 0.21 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured white crappie ranged from two to five years of age with 75% being four and five years old.  Growth was normal relative to the statewide growth rate of black crappie.\n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (8.18/ set) was a significant increase from the 1990 catch of 1.54/set but is normal with reference to the lake class median of 12.75/set.  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 5.0-10.9 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.17 pounds which is normal compared to the lake class mean of 0.14 pounds.  The five shoreline seine hauls captured 3,086 young of the year yellow perch.\n  Four other species (common carp, white sucker, bluegill, and freshwater drum) were sampled by the gillnets.  The common carp and bluegill both had catch rates of 0.09/set which is below their respective lake class medians of 0.63 and 2.50/set.  The common carp, bluegill, and freshwater drum all had mean weights above their lake class means while the mean weight of white sucker was below.  Freshwater drum have historically been the most abundant fish sampled on Pokegama Lake in both numbers and biomass.\n</p>",
