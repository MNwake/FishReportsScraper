The lake is essentially split into two separate basins with a channel in between.  Water clarity is good in the eastern basin, with visibility to 23 feet.  The western basin is almost entirely surround by undeveloped, public land and is more \"bog stained\", with a visibility of 11 feet during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was average compared to similar lakes at 5.8/gill net.  Average size was 20.5\" and 62% of the fish were below the 22-26\" protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nGilbert has had a special 5 fish bag limit for both Black Crappies and Sunfish in place since 2005.  The numbers of both Black Crappies (0.3/trap net) and Bluegills (3.8/trap net) were below average for this type of lake.  Mean length of the Bluegills was 5.9\", with 42% measuring 7\" or longer.  Mean length of the Crappies was 8.1\".  A larger amount of Crappies were caught in gill nets (1.2/net).  The average length of these fish was 7.5\", with 36% measuring 8\" or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing survey targeting Largemouth Bass was not completed this survey.  Largemouth Bass were captured in average numbers in gill nets (0.4/net).  Average length was 11.3\".   <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels were discovered in Gilbert in 2014.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on August 24, 2015 by IBI Program Staff. The survey consisted of 10 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake. All stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, 6 were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and 3 were sampled with a 15-foot seine. One station was not sampled with a seine because of dense vegetation. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish, which included 5 intolerant species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no tolerant species. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Gilbert Lake scored at the impairment threshold developed for similar lakes.   The FIBI score is comprised of several metrics.  Gilbert Lake scored well on several metrics with a low diversity of tolerant species in the nearshore gear, low diversity of omnivorous species, and high relative biomass of top carnivores in the gill nets. Gilbert Lake scored poorly on other metrics due to a low relative biomass of insectivores and the high relative biomass of omnivores in the trap nets compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Gilbert Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

OTC marked fry and fingerlings have been stocked since 2001.  Only 3 walleyes were captured resulting in a gill net CPUE of 0.3.  This was below the lower quartile value (1.3) for lake class 25 and similar to the previous assessments.  The walleyes ranged in length from 16.1 to 22.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in high numbers (10.0/gill net) and had an average length of 19.0\" They ranged in length from 6.9 to 30.8 inches.  Black crappies and largemouth bass were down from the previous assessment, but still in the third quartile.  Black crappies ranged in size from 4.2 to 10.9 inches with a mean length of 8.1\".  Largemouth bass ranged in size from 8.9 to 15.2 inches with a mean length of 13.0\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included bluegill, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Lake is about 357 acres with a maximum depth of 45 feet; about 63% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Residential development is evident along much of the shoreline but natural vegetation remains along sections of shoreline.  There are areas with woody habitat along the shoreline.  A survey targeting the near shore fish community was conducted on Gilbert Lake on 5 August, 2014. Sampling sites were 100 feet long and ten stations were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 10 stations, but some sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining was conducted at 8 sites, but 7 of the sites were heavily vegetated and/or had deep drop-offs, making sampling difficult and requiring use of a narrower seine. Emergent vegetation, soft sediments, and deep water prevented seining at 2 sites.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured the following species of fish: (in alphabetical order) Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Silverside, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe survey captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality and/or shoreline disturbance including: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass.  Only one tolerant species (Green Sunfish) was sampled in nearshore sampling in very low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nThis sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   Gilbert Lake is located in the Mississippi River Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Lake is a 369 acre lake located on the north side of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  The Lake reaches depths of 45', with 61% being 15' deep or less.   Gilbert is highly developed, except for the western basin which is in public ownership.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake.  Water clarity is good in the eastern basin with a secchi reading of 16.0'.  The western basin is more \"bog stained\", and has a secchi reading of 8.5'.  Gilbert has a diverse aquatic plant community.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was average compared to similar lakes at 7.7/net.  Average size was 18.4\" and 1.4 lbs.  Northern pike over 24\" made up 9% of the catch.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help keep a balanced northern population. <br> \n <br> \nGilbert has had a special 5 fish bag limit for both black crappies and sunfish in place since 2005.  The black crappie gillnet and trapnet catches were both below average at 0.2 and 0.6 respectively.  Average length was 10.2\" for gillnets and 7.1\" for trapnet caught fish.  For both gears combined 33% of black crappies were at least 9\" in length.  The bluegill catch of 2.9/trapnet was below average.  Bluegills had an average length of 5.4\" and 19% measured at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass had a catch rate of 101.5/hr. run time.  Average length was 11.9\" and 51% measured 12\" or greater.  Largemouth bass were captured in average numbers in gillnets.  Average length was 14.4\".  <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels were discovered in Gilbert in 2014.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.</p>",

Gilbert Lake has a special regulation limiting the daily possession to five Sunfish and five Crappies.  The reduced daily limit began in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies ranged in length from 5.4 to 14.5 inches.  Average length was 9.6 inches and 66% of the Crappies measured 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills ranged in length from 5.7 to 9.7 inches.  Average length was 7.7 inches and 83% of the Bluegills measured 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe five Crappie and five Sunfish daily limits have been successful in maintaining the quality panfish angling opportunities in Gilbert Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert is a 369 acre lake located at Brainerd, in Crow Wing County.  The lake is 45 feet deep and about 61% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a moderately hard water lake with moderate phosphorus fertility and water clarity that is typical for this area.  In 1997 there were 12.6 homes/cabins and one resort located along the 7.8 miles of shoreline.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel, with appreciable areas of muck also present.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species help cycle nutrients and provide some shoreline protection from wave activity.  Bulrush enhances quality of bass/panfish spawning habitat and wild rice does the same for northern pike.  Submerged species provide cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic life.The 2004 fish catch was rather variable.  When compared to similar type lakes, catches of walleye, pumpkinseeds and rock bass were in the \"low\" category while the northern pike catch was \"high.\"  Walleye fry were stocked in 2001 and 2003 as part of a research project.  No fish from these stockings were sampled in 2004, although two larger walleyes were caught.The northern pike catch was in the \"high\" cateegor again in 2004.  Pike ranged from 13.98-28.35 inches long and averaged 19.5 inches and 1.6 pounds, similar to the 1997 catch.  Pike aged 2-6 were sampled and growth was \"average.\"  Nearl one-half of the pike were from the 2001 year class.Largemouth bass were best sampled by spring electrofishing  In mid-May 165 bass were sampled.  Size ranged from 4.7-17.2 inches,  averaged 10.4 inches, and 26% were at least 12 inches long.  Ages 1-8 were sampled, growth was \"average,\" and the most abundant year classes were form 2001 and 2002.The bluegill catch of 9.11/trap net was the lowest to date but remains in the \"average\" category.  Bluegills ranged from 2.6-8.3 inches, averaged 5.3 inches, and about 10% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Ages ranged from 2-9 years and showed fairly uniform year class strength through age 7.The black crappie catch was \"high\" in gill nets and \"average\" in trap nets.  In a combined sample, ages ranged from 2-6 years and 78 % were from the 2001 year class. Size ranged from 5.1-12.4 inches and about 12% were at least 8 inches long.  Crappie growth was \"average.\"Special regulations will limit crappie and bluegill anglers to daily bag limits of five of each species, effective in spring of 2005.</p>",

Gilbert Lake has a special regulation limiting the daily possession to five sunfish and five crappies.  The reduced daily limit began in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies ranged in length from 6.5 to 13.2 inches.  Average length was 9.5 inches and 70% of the crappies measured 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills ranged in length from 3.0 to 9.5 inches.  Average length was 6.9 inches and 49% of the bluegills measured 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe five crappie and five sunfish daily limits have been successful in maintaining the quality panfish angling opportunities in Gilbert Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike population remains high (above the third quartile for the lake group) with a small average weight of 1.47 lbs and a relatively poor size structure (no fish greater than 24 inches were sampled). Northern pike growth is approximately the same as the statewide average for the first three growth years, then is slower starting in the fourth growth year. The bluegill population remains at an average level with a trapnet CPUE of 18.3 compared to the 1980 survey trap net CPUE of 17.1. The size structure remains poor with only 2 of the 146 fish sampled greater than 7.0 inches. The growth of the bluegills is considerably slower than the statewide average at all ages. The bowfin, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead and black crappie populations are average for the lake group, while the black bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and largemouth bass populations are lower than average. No walleyes or yellow perch were sampled during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert is a 369 acre lake located at Brainerd, in Crow Wing County.  The lake is 45 feet deep and about 61% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  It is a moderately hard water lake with moderate phosphorus fertility and clarity about \"average\" for the area.  In '97 there were 98 homes/cabins and one resort located along the 7.8 miles of shoreline.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet in depth are primarily sand and gravel, with appreciable areas of muck also present.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species help cycle nutrients and provide some shoreline protection from wave activity.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species, while wild rice can provide spawning substrate for northern pike.  Submergent species provide cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic life.The fish catch in 1997 was rather variable.  When compared to similar type lakes, the catch of bowfin (dogfish) was in the \"high\" category, while catches of black crappie, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and rock bass were in the \"low\" category.The northern pike catch was below previous catch rates in Gilbert Lake but was \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.  Pike averaged 18 inches and 1.6 lbs. in size in '97.  Five age classes were present and fish from the 1994 and 1995 year classes made up the majority of the sample.  Pike growth was good.Walleyes were last stocked in 1978 and were last sampled in the 1982 netting.  Largemouth bass were caught in \"low\" numbers in trap nets in '97.  Late spring night electrofishing provided a better sample, however.  Sixteen of seventeen bass caught in spring were at least 8.0 inches long.  Of those sixteen fish, a respectable 81% were at least 12.0 inches long and 44% were at least 15.0 inches long.  Bass as large as 16.9 inches were sampled.  Six age classes were present, growth was \"slow\" and the strongest year class sampled was from 1990.  Young bass were common in shoreline seine hauls made in mid August.The bluegill catch was also lower than previous catches in Gilbert Lake but remained in the \"average\" category.  Six age classes were sampled in trap nets and growth was \"slow.\"  The strongest year classes were from 1991 and 1994.  About 16% of the sampled bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.  Young bluegills were also common in shoreline seine hauls.Typical forage species were scarce in 1997 net catches.  Yellow perch, important food for northern pike, bass and walleyes, were only sampled by shoreline seining, and in low numbers.  White suckers were absent from test nets in '97.Other species sampled in '97 included yellow bullheads and brown bullheads.  Both species were caught in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.</p>",
