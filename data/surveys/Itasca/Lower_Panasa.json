                "narrative": "<p>Lower Panasa Lake is located 1.5 miles southeast of Calumet, Minnesota in the Mississippi River Watershed.  Lower Panasa Lake has a total surface area of 254 acres, a littoral area of 169 acres (67%), and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is moderately fertile and the Secchi depth was 2.6 feet in 2014.  The lake has one inlet and one outlet, both by the name Panasa Creek.  The Lower Panasa Lake outlet flows into the Swan River.  The lake is managed for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in August of 2014 to assess the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch of 44.5 per net was high compared to similar lakes, but typical for Lower Panasa.   Lengths ranged from 5.1 to 9.8 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Size structure was poor, as few fish exceeded the quality size of 8 inches.   Perch populations often exhibit variable year class production.  Only 4 year classes were present (ages 2-5) and the 2011 year class comprised 68% of the sample.  Growth was near the statewide average, as perch averaged 7.5 inches by age 5.  Poor size structure may limit angler popularity in Lower Panasa, but perch provide an important prey item for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have been variable but generally appear to increase over time.  Northern Pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when Northern Pike occur at high densities.  The 2014 catch of 11.0 per gill net was typical for lakes with similar habiatats and near the long term average for Lower Panasa.  Past samples have resulted in moderate size structure with few fish exceeding the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Pike length ranged from 14.8 to 27.9 inches and averaged 21.2 inches in 2014, and size structure was poor, as no captured fish exceeded 28 inches.   Five year classes were present (age 2-6) and growth was near the statewide average as pike grew to 26.4 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar lakes typically do not support large Walleye catches and past samples from Lower Panasa have resulted in a Walleye catch of less than 3.5 per gill net, despite frequent stocking.  The 2014 catch of 1.2 per gill net was within the expected range for the lake class and near the long term median for Lower Panasa.  Walleye length ranged from 10 to 25 inches with an average of 19.2 inches.  Size structure was good as 43% of the sampled Walleye exceeded the angler preferred length of 20 inches.  Past assessment have shown the Walleye population is maintained primarily by fry stocking.  Six of the seven captured Walleye in 2014 corresponded to a fry stocked year.  Growth was fast as Walleye averaged 19.8 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Crappie catches have varied considerably in Lower Panasa Lake.  No crappie were captured in the gill net in 2014, and the trap net catch of 0.6 per net was less than expected.  Captured crappie were generally small, averaging 5.2 inches.  Poor size and low abundance may limit the popularity of the crappie fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Bowfin, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Panasa Lake is located near Calumet, is 254 acres, 25 ft deep, and is moderately productive.  At the time of the assessment, secchi depth was only 2.6 ft due to an algae bloom.  Heavy aquatic vegetation growth is common in the summer months.  Lower Panasa is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.The immediate watershed is heavily impacted by mining activities, and has negatively affected the water quality of Upper Panasa Lake.  Lower Panasa is connected to Upper Panasa through an inlet, and therefore is also affectected by mining activities in the watershed.  Local anglers mention that both lakes turn red with sediment washing into the lakes after heavy rains.  In addition, Lower Panasa indirectly receives treated sewage from Calumet, and water being pumped from Hill Annex mine.  Walleye gill net catch was 3.3/set which is higher than the expected value for similar lakes.  Average weight was 2.2 pounds and length varied from 9.5 to 23 inches.  Walleye fry were recently stocked in 1993 and 1997.  Size structure of the population was good and the majority of fish sampled were greater than 15 inches.Northern pike gill net catch was 19.0/set which is above the expected range for similar lakes.  Average weight was 2.4 pounds.  Size structure was generally poor with most of the fish sampled less than 24 inches.  However, one fish sampled was greater than 37 inches.Yellow perch gill net catch was 67.7/set which is more than three times the expected range for similar lakes.  Length varied from 4.5 to 11 inches, however, most of the fish sampled were less than 9 inches.Bluegill trap net catch was 1.1/set which is below the expected range, although Lower Panasa has historically had a low bluegill abundance.  Black crappie trap net catch was 1.4/set which is within the expected range.Although largemouth bass were sampled with trap nets, spring electrofishing did not sample any largemouth bass.Species of commercial interest include black bullhead and bigmouth buffalo.  Black bullhead abundance is higher than expected for similar lakes, and commercial fishing is done on a regular basis. Water quality and nutrient loading are major concerns for Lower Panasa Lake.  Mining runoff, and sewage effluent increase turbidity and nutrient loading, which increases turbidity and aquatic vegetation growth.  Substantial improvement in the fishery is unlikely unless water quality issues can be addressed.</p>",
