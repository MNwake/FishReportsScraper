                "narrative": "<p>Bogus Lake is an 18-acre designated stream trout lake located 15 miles northeast of Grand Marais. Public access is through a carry-in portage landing along the west shore. The primary management species in Bogus Lake is splake, which are stocked as fingerlings annually. The 2023 standard survey was conducted to evaluate the survival and growth of stocked splake year classes. In addition, 0.25-inch trap nets were set to evaluate the nearshore minnow community in Bogus Lake that may provide forage for larger piscivorous splake and/or interspecific competition for stocked fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nSplake abundance in the 2023 survey was the lowest seen in the lake, however it was similar to other stream trout lakes in the area. Splake up to 13.4 inches were sampled and individuals from most recent stocking events were present (2021 and 2022), but no older fish were found. The average sized splake was smaller than in previous surveys. Small mesh trap nets captured high levels of minnows indicating good forage for larger splake, but also indicate potential competition as white sucker numbers were also high. Habitats are still suitable for splake in Bogus Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

Most of the 2003 catch consisted of fish from the previous fall's stocking, but fish as old as four years were also taken.  Splake growth rates had been slightly faster than average for this area.  Population estimates were done as part of this assessment.  It was estimated that the lake supported a total of 178 splake in late September 2003, of which 51 fish were 12 inches in length or longer.  Although those numbers may seem low, they are typical of the numbers of fish to be found in stocked stream trout lakes in this area.White sucker were present, but not abundant.  No other undesirable fish species were found.</p>",
