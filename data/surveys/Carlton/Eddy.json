                "narrative": "<p>Eddy lake is 23 acres and is located 3 miles north of Moose Lake, MN along Interstate Highway 35.  Access is via the Moose Horn River from Hanging Horn Lake, however this access can be difficult during low water periods.  The maximum depth is 37 feet with 83 percent of the lake being less than 15 feet deep.  Population assessments have been conducted on Eddy Lake in 1974 and 1980, and an initial survey was conducted in 1967.     The fish population is mainly comprised of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  Both catch rates and growth rates are typical for bluegill when compared to populations from other lakes in the Duluth area.  There is a strong year class which should recruit into the fishery in 2000.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegills sampled were 6.0 inches or longer and the average size of all bluegills sampled was 5.4 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were the most abundant fish sampled.  Scale samples were not taken and growth parameters were not evaluated.  However, 18 percent of the pumpkinseed sunfish sampled were 6.0 inches or greater and the average size was 5.0 inches.  Northern pike and black crappie populations are currently low, however, both species have historically been more abundant.     Catch from the one-quarter inch trapnets suggests that largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch had successful reproduction in 1998.  Adult largemouth bass have never been captured in standard sampling gear in any of the previous assessments or surveys.     Other species sampled during this survey include green sunfish, rock bass, common shiner, spottail shiner, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

It has a permanent inlet and outlet in the form of the Moose River running through the northwest side of the lake.  The river appears to offer fair to good spawning habitat.Many species of aquatic vegetation are present in Eddy Lake.  About seven percent of the present lake water surface area is covered by standing emergent vegetation.  The greatest depth to which rooted submerged plants grow is five feet.Eleven species of fish were taken by test netting during the survey.  When compared with state-wide averages, northern pike catches were slightly below average.  Bullhead catches were about average, sunfish were slightly above average, and black crappies were well above average.Shoal bottom types consisted of 65% clay with some gravel and boulder in it and 35% muck.Local reports indicated that although Eddy Lake is not heavily fished, it has always produced fair fishing for panfish, northerns, bass and occasionally walleye.</p>",
