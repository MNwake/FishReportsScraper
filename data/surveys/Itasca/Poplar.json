Access is gained through an outlet channel to Lorraine Lake, which is occasionally blocked by beavers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate within the expected range for lakes similar to Poplar.  Size structure appears moderate, indicated by an average length of almost 24 inches for sampled fish.  Anglers are reminded they can help maintain a quality pike fishery by releasing fish larger than 24 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average as northern pike typically exceeded 24 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled above the expected range in gill nets, yet the trap net catch rate was less than expected.  Both gears sampled crappie within the expected range in the previous assessment.  Size structure appears relatively good with about 38% of the crappies sampled in gill nets exceeding 10 inches.  Growth was slow for ages one and two and similar to the statewide average for all others.  Black crappie averaged ten inches by age six. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in trap nets, within the expected range.  Previously, the bluegill catch was less than expected, conducive to a quality size structure.  Similar to the previous assessment, the bluegill population was dominated by fish less than 8 inches (99%), indicating poor size structure.  Bluegill averaged almost eight inches by age 8. <br> \n <br> \nBoth gears sampled largemouth bass within the expected range, but this may not accurately represent the population due to net avoidance, typical of bass.  Lengths ranged up to almost 15 inches.  Only one largemouth was sampled in the previous assessment.  Ages one through six were present in the sample.  Largemouth bass averaged 12 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee were both sampled at relatively low abundance, similar to the previous assessment.  The average yellow perch size was small and of little interest to anglers, while Triaenophorus was present in 75% of the tullibee sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",
