                "narrative": "<p>Over 90%, 48 of the 53, Walleye captured came from 1985 and 1986 year-classes. Presence of these year classes corresponds to fingerling stocking in those years. A 1984 fry stocking appears to have been marginally successful. Mean weight of Walleye sampled was less than 1.0 lb. Northern Pike abundance has remained stable, but mean weight has increased from 1.5lbs in 1985 to 2.0lbs in 1988. Yellow Perch relative densities remain low. The Bluegill population was mostly composed of intermediate-size fish. Seventy-nine (79%) percent of the Bluegills sampled were 4.0-4.9 inches long. However, there appears to be some highly desirable Bluegill exceeding 9.0 inches in length. Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were not adequately sampled. Lake Irene holds a sizable population of quality-size Yellow Bullheads, which could have sport or commercial value. Northern Cisco were also present and grow to a harvestable size. Smaller Northern Cisco provide forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer trap net survey in Irene Lake was conducted by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff on August 3-5, 2022. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 10 species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Northern Pike, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net data were combined with nearshore and gill net data from a 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Cisco), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Irene Lake is likely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score that is near the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene is a 630-acre, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) bass-panfish lake located approximately one mile northwest of Miltona in Douglas County. Two public accesses are located on the northwest shore off of NW Irene Road and on the southeast shore off County Road 64.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Irene's bass-bluegill fishery is in good shape.  Largemouth bass abundance has increased nearly 200-percent since 2000 and 2005, with about 70-percent of the population currently measuring between 12 and 15-inches.  Bluegill abundance has remained about the same since the 1980's but average individual size appears to be increasing to a mean length of 6.5 inches.   Assuming continued good growth rates, bluegill recruitment to larger size categories can be expected.  As with most bluegill fisheries, angler restraint and common sense are essential in maintaining quality of the fishery.  Releasing larger bluegills in exchange for harvesting a few smaller ones is beneficial and helps to maintain quality angling.    <br> \nWalleye proved abundant in response to supplemental stocking and a sustained decline in northern pike numbers.  Gillnet catches averaged 14.8 walleye/net.   Most captures were less than four years old and not yet large enough to be keepers.  Average length was 12.6 inches.   With an additional year's growth, walleye fishing during the 2011-2012 angling season should be reasonably good.   Northern pike abundance has continued to decline following the high water period of the late-90s.   Growth of older pike is poor due to limited adult yellow perch numbers.  There aren't many 30.0 inch and larger pike in the lake.  Average length of pike measured in the gillnet catch was 21.9 inches.  <br> \n   <br> \nLake Irene continues to support a healthy northern cisco or tullibee population. The sustained presence of this coldwater species indicates water quality is relatively good.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene is a 639-acre lake located near the town of Miltona in northeast Douglas County.  Lake Irene lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and outflows to Lake Miltona via a non-navigable channel on the south shoreline.  Residential development is moderate.  Most shoreline development occurs along east and southwest shorelines.  Much of the undeveloped western shoreline supports bulrush and cattails.  Average and maximum depths are 20 and 44 feet, respectively.  Water clarity was 7.0 feet during the 2020 survey.  Two public accesses are available.  One is located on the northwest shore off NW Irene Road and the other is on the southeast shore off County Road 64.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Irene.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020. \n \nLake Irene supports a healthy sunfish community.  Bluegill grow quickly, allowing them to reach sizes of interest to anglers.  In 2020, Bluegill averaged 7.2 inches in length with many exceeding 8 inches.  The largest sampled was 9.7 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to release these large fish to preserve the genetics of larger Bluegill in this system.  Lake Irene was included in the Quality Sunfish Initiative because of its high-quality Bluegill fishery that exhibits fast growth, moderate density, and has a history of producing large fish.  A 10-fish daily bag limit was implemented on March 1, 2021 to help maintain or potentially improve the size quality of this population.  For more information about the Quality Sunfish Initiative see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/sunfish/index.html. \n\nBlack Crappie were abundant.  This population also tends to exhibit fast growth and an impressive size structure.  Most crappie exceeded 10 inches in length and the largest measured 13.5 inches.  Three strong year classes were present, which should provide quality fishing opportunities for the next few years.\n  \nLargemouth Bass are also common in Lake Irene.  Sixty-eight bass, ranging in length from 5.7 to 17.7 inches, were collected in gill nets in 2020.  Average length was 11.9 inches.\n \nWalleye abundance has declined in recent years but remains at a level above what is expected for similar Minnesota lakes.  Average size was 16.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  The largest Walleye sampled measured 25.7 inches.  A very strong 2017 year class should provide Walleye anglers with harvest opportunities for the next couple of years.  The MN DNR and Lake Irene Association supplement this population with fingerling stockings.\n  \nSimilar to previous surveys, Northern Pike abundance was moderate.  Pike numbers in Lake Irene appear to stay relatively stable at low to moderate densities, a contrast from overabundant pike populations found in many west-central Minnesota lakes.  Lower density typically results in a higher size structure.  Mean and maximum lengths of pike sampled in 2020 were 22.4 and 34.7 inches, respectively.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Lake Irene is in the North-central Zone, where all pike 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Anglers can keep 10 pike but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches.  For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest pike below 22 inches to help keep this population in check.\n\nFew Yellow Perch were sampled and small average size limits angling interest for this species.  Yellow Bullhead were extremely abundant and most were large individuals.  Over 58% of Yellow Bullhead collected were 12 inches or larger.  Additional species sampled include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Tullibee (Cisco), and White Sucker.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.\n\nLake Irene is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, initially confirmed in 2012.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) negatively affect lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving any access.  For more information regarding AIS see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/index.html. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene is a 630 acre basin located near the town of Miltona in Douglas County.  Maximum depth of the lake is 44 feet.  Water quality and clarity are considered very good.  Studies have indicated that Lake Irene is likely sensitive to an increase in nutrient inputs.  Poor land use practices around the shoreline and within the watershed that increase polluted runoff will have a negative impact on Lake Irene.  Lake Irene supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is common in shallow areas.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are present throughout the lake.  These plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, protect the shoreline from wave action, and compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients.  These plants are critical for maintaining good water quality and fish populations in Lake Irene.The fish community in Lake Irene is typical for a lake of this size with good water clarity and ample aquatic vegetation.  Data from the lake survey indicate that northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie are all relatively abundant and have desirable size distributions, which should provide quality angling.  Lake Irene attracted many anglers seeking nice catches of bluegill during the summer of 2000 and black crappie during the winter of 2000-01.  Walleye abundance has decreased in recent years and is a concern to the Lake Irene Association.  Recent fry stockings and natural reproduction have been unsuccessful in reaching management goals.  Walleye stocking strategy will be revised to address the low numbers found during the lake survey.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Irene.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty species were collected during this survey.  Six species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, and Pugnose Shiner) were considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.   \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Irene.</p>",

Average weight was 3.3lbs/fish and shifted to 1.4lbs/fish at the time of the 1980 survey.  This shift is reflected in the frequent disturbances (e.g. winterkill) and may be in part complicated by a stocking of rescue fish in Feb. 1979.  Abundance of Northern Pike is 12.2 fish/gillnet set with the majority in the 2-3 year brackets as opposed to the 3, 4, 5, and 6 brackets in the 1974 survey.  Walleye abundance remained the same since 1974 at 3.8/GN</p>",

Gillnet catches averaged 11.9 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates from lakeswith similar chemical and physical characteristics (1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches averaged3.8 fish/net in 1974 and 1980, 8.7 fish/net in 1985, and 12.8 fish/net in 1988.  The average weight offish captured in 1994 was 1.7 pounds.  Sixty percent of the fish captured were 15 inches in length orgreater.  The age class distribution of walleye captured in gillnets indicates that naturalreproduction produced a strong year class in 1992 and fry stocking or natural reproduction produced astrong year class in 1988.  The increase in walleye abundance over the past fifteen years has coincidedwith a significant decrease in northern pike, bluegill, and yellow perch numbers.  This may be theresult of intraspecific competition, predation, or some unknown environmental variable.Northern pike catches averaged 3.2 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 9.0, 12.2, 3.8, and 4.0fish/net in 1974, 1980, 1985, and 1988, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 45% of the fish captured were 21 inches inlength or greater.   The average weight of fish captured was 2.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass are abundantand the size structure of the population should appeal to most anglers.  Daytime, DC electrofishingyielded 73.0 fish per hour.  Approximately 70% of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greaterand 16% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.4 pounds.  Bluegill trapnet catchesaveraged 4.1 fish/net which is below the normal range of mean catch rates for similar lake types (6.1 - 46.6 fish/trapnet).  Trapnet catches averaged 20.4, 28.7, and 8.1 fish/net in 1980, 1985, and 1988,respectively.  Most of the fish captured were less than six inches in length.  Yellow perch gillnetcatches averaged 2.8 fish/net.  As with northern pike and bluegill, yellow perch numbers have declinedsignificantly since 1980 when gillnet catches averaged 17.2 fish/net.  The normal range of mean catchrates from similar lakes is 3.4 - 43.6 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene is a 630-acre, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) bass-panfish lake located near the town of Miltona in northeast Douglas County.  Two public accesses are located on this lake.  One is on the northwest shore off of NW Irene Road and the other is located on the southeast shore off of County Road 64.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Consequently, an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community is present within this basin.Lake Irene is primarily a bass-panfish fishery, but it also supports a high-quality walleye population.  Walleye abundance in 2005 was 9.1 fish per gill net, which is well above expected abundance levels for this type of lake.  Walleye numbers have increased substantially in recent years due to reestablishment of a walleye fingerling stocking program and additional stockings completed by the Lake Irene Association.  Size structure of this population is relatively small but most fish sampled were individuals from the 2002 and 2003 year classes.  Expect size structure to improve in future years as these year classes move through the fishery.  Bluegill abundance has also increased in recent years and anglers can expect good catches of medium-sized fish.  A few large bluegill are also present.  Largemouth bass and northern pike are both relatively abundant and these two populations exhibit a moderate size structure.  Other game fish species include black crappie and yellow perch.  Black crappie are not sampled effectively with trap nets during late summer so survey data is likely not representative of actual population characteristics.  Previous angler reports suggest that crappie fishing can be quite good on this basin.  Yellow perch abundance is extremely low and most fish sampled were relatively small.  Other fish species sampled during the 2005 survey include tullibee, white sucker, bullheads, and pumpkinseed sunfish.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene is a 639-acre lake located near the town of Miltona in northeast Douglas County.  Lake Irene lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and outflows to Lake Miltona via a non-navigable channel on the south shoreline.  Maximum depth of the basin is 44.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 19.8 feet.  Ecological productivity is constrained by basin morphology.  Only 37% of the surface area is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  The lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  The thermocline was detected below 15.0 feet in depth during the early-August 2014 fish community assessment.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 21.0 feet were insufficient to support fish until fall mixing occurs.  Secchi transparency measurements typically exceed 8.0 feet during summer months.  Residential development is moderate.  Most shoreline development occurs along east and southwest shorelines.  Much of the undeveloped western shoreline supports a robust, mixed growth of hardstem bulrush and cattails.  <br> \n  <br> \nLake Irene supports a high-quality Walleye fishery sustained by some natural recruitment and regular supplemental stockings by the Lake Irene Association and MN DNR.  Walleye catches in 2014 averaged 9.1 fish per gillnet, which is well above expected abundance levels for similar lakes.  The population sample included representatives of 10 age classes.  Walleye captures ranged from 6.9 to 28.7 inches in length.  Average size in 2014 was 14.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.   Size distribution measures were strongly influenced by high relative proportion of three-year-old individuals making up the population sample.  A very strong year class was established in 2011.  Age-3 fish account for 75% of the total gillnet catch.  Cohorts of the 2011 year class averaged 14.0 inches at capture.  If average growth can be sustained, these fish should approach 16.0 inches in late summer of 2015. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management efforts are benefitted by low to modest densities of Northern Pike.  Most pike captured during the 2014 survey were small.  Average length of gillnet captures was 20.6 inches.  The largest pike measured was 27.8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Irene lacks an expansive littoral area and extensive vegetated habitat, but does sustain a healthy sunfish community.  Bluegill and Black Crappie are moderately abundant and in response, these popular panfishes grow reasonably well.  Size structure of both populations was dominated by medium-sized fish in 2014, but with an adequate life span, Bluegill and Black Crappie can grow to memorable sizes.  The largest Bluegill captured during the 2014 survey measured 9.9 inches. Two crappies exceeded 13.0 inches in total length.  Spring electrofishing catches in 2014 described an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  Age distribution of bass captures extended to age 15.  The bass population offers quality fishing opportunities due to a relatively high proportion of older fish in the lake.  Over half of the total electrofishing catch was comprised of nine- and ten-year-old fish.  Mean and maximum lengths for Largemouth Bass captured by electrofishing were 14.4 and 17.5 inches, respectively.  Growth of Largemouth Bass drops rapidly beyond age five, so Lake Irene is not likely to yield 20.0-inch fish.   Other members of the sunfish family residing in Lake Irene include Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and various sunfish hybrids.  No Rock Bass have been captured since the 1980 survey. <br> \n <br> \nFish management concerns include a sustained decrease in Yellow Perch abundance.  Catch rates of this important prey fish have remained well below the range of normal catches from similar basins during all recent surveys.  Scarcity of preferred-size prey may explain slow growth or potential high mortality of older, larger predators.  A few harvestable-size perch are present. Those perch caught in gillnets averaged only 7.7 inches in length. <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the 2014 survey include Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2020. <br> \n <br> \nPublic accesses are located on the northwest shore off of NW Irene Road and on the southeast shore off of County Road 64. <br> \n <br> \nLake Irene is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2012.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irene supports a quality panfish fishery. In the spring of 2021, a targeted panfish survey was completed to better assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2021. The goal of the new regulation is to increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate the effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates and growth rates were moderate. The age structure was extended and Bluegill up to age 11 were sampled.  The presence of these older fish also meant many larger Bluegill were observed. Many fish over 9 inches were sampled with the largest being 10.5 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates and growth rates were also moderate. Many year classes of crappies were present.  Almost 50% of the Black Crappie were over 10 inches and the largest crappie sampled was 12.7 inches.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Irene. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Irene was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2011. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",

In 1974 and 1980 there were 3.83 Walleyes/gillnet and it has increased to 8.67/gillnet in the present survey. This increase in Walleyes could be the result of stocking. There is strong correlation between stocking records and age-class distribution. A 1984 fry stocking appears to be successful along with a 1982 fingerling stocking the increase in Walleyes may also be due to the decrease in Northern Pike numbers. Northern Pike have decreased from 9.00/gillnet in 1974 and 12.16/gillnet in 1980 to 3.83/gillnet in this survey. The Yellow Perch population has also dropped from 28.00/gillnet in 1974 and 17.17/gillnet in 1980 to 1.83/gillnet presently. The decrease in Yellow Perch may have been caused by the high Northern Pike numbers in previous years. Northern Cisco are also present to provide forage. Black Crappies, although not well sampled are in a quality size range. Bluegills are of a borderline quality. But should contribute to the anglers creel.</p>",
