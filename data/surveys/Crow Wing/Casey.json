Algal blooms occur during summer and partial winterkill conditions occasionally exist during more severe winters.  There is state land adjoining the lake but no developed public access.The fish population appeared typical for this kind of lake.  Black bullheads, which are tolerant of low winter oxygen conditions, made up about one-half of the fish catch in trapnets (used to indicate abundance of bullheads, bass, crappies and sunfishes).  Of the sport fish species, bluegills and crappies were present in average numbers.  Crappie growth was slow and bluegill growth was also slow until about age five.  Spawning conditions appeared to be good for these species.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers but individuals seemed to have good growth.  Spawning conditions appeared to be limited.  Forage species present included low numbers of yellow perch and average numbers of golden shiners.  Bowfin (dogfish), an additional predator species, was also present, as were largemouth bass.</p>",
