                "narrative": "<p>Jorgens Lake is a 66 acre, 21-foot deep lake located on the Kabetogama Peninsula within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park (VNP). The lake has a rocky shoreline and the immediate watershed is relatively steep and heavily forested. Waters within Jorgens are heavily stained and infertile. Jorgens is within VNP's proposed designated wilderness and as such motors are not allowed.  Access is via a 0.9-mile long portage trail from Ek Bay on Kabetogama Lake.  VNP maintains a campsite on the lake but not a rental boat.Northern pike were the most abundant species in the gill-net catch.  Pike numbers were high relative to other lakes in the same ecological classification but were slightly below the abundance recorded during the only previous investigation in 1971.  Pike sizes, however, have improved since 1971.  During the 2005 investigation, pike ranged from 13.0 to 27.4 inches with an average length of 22.9 inches. In 1971, all pike caught were less than 23.0 inches long and the average length was 18.9 inches.  Growth of Jorgens Lake pike is slow relative to other lakes in the International Falls Management Area.Largemouth bass were also captured in the 2005 Jorgens Lake investigation.  Although passive sampling gears like gill nets are not well suited for capturing bass, two fish between 13.0 and 16.0 inches were caught suggesting, at least a small, self-sustaining population.  Reports from anglers fishing in Jorgens Lake also indicate that there are fair to good numbers of quality sized bass in the lake.    </p>",
