                "narrative": "<p>Blackwood is a 27 acre lake with 12 acres (44%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  The lake is located 7 miles north of Cromwell off State Highway 73.  Access is gained by walking in from the east side of the lake off Hwy 73.  Blackwood was surveyed in 1975 by DNR fisheries, and again during the summer of 2007 to evaluate species composition and to gather information about fish populations.  There is no record of any fish stocking into Blackwood Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 18.0 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2005 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Only 5 individuals were sampled.  Mean length of 9.0 inches was above average but growth was slow.  Only two year-classes were present, 2001 and 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 13.4 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.7 inches was large and growth was slow.  All year-classes from 1998 to 2003 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 6 largemouth bass were sampled during the survey.  Average length of sampled bass was 14 inches.  Length at age four of 11.3 inches represents average growth for Duluth Area bass populations.  Only two year-classes were present, 2002 and 2003. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was moderate with 20 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Four species were identified along 100% of the transects: yellow water lily, white water lily, coontail and northern water-milfoil.  Rare species include bulrush, horsetail, white buttercup and bushy pondweed, which were identified at 10% of the sampling stations.  The most common substrate types were sand and muck, which were identified along 100% and 90% of the transects, respectively.  Water analysis indicate Blackwood is a slightly basic, hard water lake.     <br> \n</p>",
