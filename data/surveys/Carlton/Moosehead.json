                "narrative": "<p>Moosehead is a 292 acre lake with 261 (89%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located immediately east of Moose Lake, MN and has a city administered, concrete, back-in access.  A public swimming beach is adjacent to the access.  Moosehead Lake has not been actively managed with fish stocking since 1985.  Moosehead Lake was surveyed in 2014 to update information on fish populations and aquatic habitat. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (3.3) but still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance has ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 per lift during four previous investigations from 1972 through 2006.  Average size was 16.6 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed inconsistent recruitment with six missing year-classes from 2002-2013. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 8.7 per trapnet lift was up from 2006 (1.7) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.6 inches was large and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2010 year-class and consistent recruitment with all year-classes from 2006 through 2012 represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 8.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2006 (5.1) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2007 and 2011 year-classes and all year-classes from 2005 through 2012 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  Bass electrofishing was not attempted in previous investigations but Largemouth Bass were sampled with regular assessment gear in 1977 and 1989.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate of 4.1 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time was below average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Largemouth Bass average length was 15.8 inches.  Not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth, but recruitment appears sporadic with two missing year-classes from 2004-2010. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (9.0) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 21.6 inches.  Northern Pike were not aged for this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 11.0 was up from 2006 (7.0) but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.1 inches.  Yellow Perch were not aged for this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon have been documented in gillnet samples from investigations conducted in 1989 and 1999.  There are also anecdotal reports of spawning activity in the Moosehead River near the Highway #61 Bridge at the outlet of Moosehead Lake.  Anglers have reported catching large Lake Sturgeon in Moosehead Lake.  No Lake Sturgeon were encountered during this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during this investigation include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nA substantial percentage (31%) of lakeshore homeowners on Moosehead Lake have open yards extending to the shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can prevent excessive nutrient loading which leads to excessive plant growth and poor water quality by avoiding lawn fertilization, limiting aquatic vegetation removal, and implementing riparian best management practices.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Moosehead is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake of low fertility. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was also collected on aquatic vegetation.  Thirty-five aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 134 sampling points.  Water (wild) celery was the most frequently found plant (17% of stations sampled) followed by clasping-leaf pondweed (15%) and bushy pondweed (14%).  One invasive plant was identified at low abundance (reed canary grass) but this species is common in emergent wetland plant communities and has become well-established in Minnesota.  These data can be compared to future aquatic plant surveys of Moosehead Lake to estimate how the plant community may be changing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moosehead Lake is located on the east side of Moose Lake, MN. There is a city administered back-in access adjacent to the public park with a swimming beach. The lake is 279 acres and has a maximum depth of 18 feet. The 2023 survey was completed to update information about fish populations in Moosehead Lake. Special angling regulations on sunfish and crappie were implemented in 2022. These regulations are a daily limit of five sunfish, possession limit of 20 and a daily limit of five crappie, possession limit 10. This was the first survey since the special regulations were added to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 7.0 per trap net lift was in the normal range compared to similar lakes. The average length was 5.2 inches and seven fish were over 8 inches long. All year-classes from 2015 to 2021 were represented indicating consistent recruitment and over 80% of the catch was made up of strong year-classes in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Growth of Bluegill was above average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch was within the normal range for similar Minnesota lakes. The gill net catch for crappie was also within the normal range. The average length of Black Crappie was 7.3 inches and 13% of the catch was over 10 inches long. Six-year classes of crappie were determined with age-2 fish making up 67% of the catch. Growth of Black Crappie was above average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.2 fish per gill net lift was in the normal range for similar type lakes in Minnesota. The average length of sampled fish was 16.8 inches with the largest Walleye being 24.7 inches. Seven ages of Walleye were found and age-3 fish comprised 50% of the total catch. Growth appeared to be slow compared to other Duluth populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gillnet catch was within the normal range compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. The average size of pike was 22.3 inches with the largest fish measuring 31.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2 Largemouth Bass were caught via nighttime electrofishing. Lengths were 11.7 and 15.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThirteen Smallmouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing and gill nets caught a single Smallmouth Bass. The average length of Smallmouth Bass was 11.6 inches with a couple fish over 17 inches seen.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gillnet catch of was within the normal range for similar Minnesota lakes. The average length of perch was small at 6.3 inches and only two perch were longer than 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo large Channel Catfish were caught during the survey with both fish around 29 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Chestnut Lamprey, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Lake Sturgeon were encountered during the 2023 survey. Lake Sturgeon were caught in two previous surveys (1989 and 1999). There are anecdotal reports of sturgeon spawning activity in the Moosehead River near the Highway #61 Bridge at the outlet of Moosehead Lake. Anglers have reported catching large Lake Sturgeon in the lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moosehead is a 292 acre lake with 261 (89%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located immediately east of Moose Lake, MN and has a city administered, concrete, back-in access.  A public swimming beach is adjacent to the access.  Moosehead Lake has not been actively managed with fish stocking since 1985.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 3.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 per lift during four investigations from 1972 through 2006.  Average size was 14.4 inches and growth was slow.  Of the walleye aged from the 2006 investigation, 83% were born in 2002 or 2003. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 9.0 per gillnet lift was higher than 1999 (7.3) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 17.5 inches was small and growth was slow.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2005 were represented and no fish were older than age five. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 9.7 inches was large and growth was fast.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2005 were represented, with the strongest year-class in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 5.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.0 inches was large and growth was fast.  The 2001 year-class was strong and all year-classes from 1999 through 2004 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nLake sturgeon have been documented in gillnet samples from investigations conducted in 1989 and 1999.  There are also anecdotal reports of spawning activity in the Moosehead River near the Highway #61 Bridge at the outlet of Moosehead Lake.  Anglers have reported catching large (50-75 pound) sturgeon in Moosehead Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during this investigation include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  A smooth soft shell turtle was captured in a trapnet during the investigation.  This is the first report of this species in the Duluth Fisheries Management Area.  The exotic banded mystery snail was also identified for the first time in Moosehead Lake.</p>",

Walleye catch rates have hovered around 4.0 per gill net lift since 1950, fluctuating by a factor of two to three times or more.  The 1989 catch rate was 2.5.     Yellow perch have fluctuated greatly doing from a high of 58.5 per gill net lift to 7.8 in 1989.  Like walleye and yellow perch, northern pike have fluctuated greatly with a slight increasing trend.     Black crappie catch rate was 0.5 per trap net lift and never have been captured at high rates during past netting.  Bluegill have been increasing since early netting years and exhibited the highest catch rate to date for Moosehead Lake at 18.3 per trap net lift.  Pumpkinseed have increased slowly between 1972 and 1977 when 1.0 to 1.67 were taken per lift.  They exploded during the past 12 years, and 21.3 per lift were taken in 1989.     In general, white sucker, walleye, and yellow perch moved in parallel abundance patterns (up or down) between 1950 and 1989; northern pike oppositely to these species.</p>",

The lake is located immediately east of Moose Lake, MN and has a city administered, concrete, back-in access.   <br> \n <br> \nMoosehead has a history of producing large Bluegill and Black Crappie and new angling regulations to improve and protect these species are under consideration.  The proposed regulation is a daily limit of 5 sunfish, possession limit of 20 and a daily limit of 5 Black Crappie, possession limit 10.  The objective of this targeted survey was to obtain baseline information to describe Bluegill and Black Crappie size structure, age structure and growth prior to implementation of the reduced bag limit angling regulation change.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill spring trapnet abundance was 28.1 per lift.  Average length of Bluegill was 7.6 inches and maximum size was 9.5 inches.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 96%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 28%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2010 to 2018 represented.  The 2014, 2015 and 2016 year-classes were strong.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trapnet abundance was 8.85 per lift.  Average length of Black Crappie was 9.2 inches and maximum size was 12.1 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 81%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 39%.  The proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 12 inches) was 1%.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2012 to 2019 represented.  The 2015 year-class was strong.</p>",

There is a City administered boat access located on the northwest shore next to the City Park.  Previous assessments or surveys have been conducted in 1989, 1972, 1960 and 1950.     Moosehead Lake has a very diverse fishery due to the connection to the Kettle River drainage.  Thirteen species were documented from gill and trapnet samples.  Walleye and northern pike were sampled at a rate that was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, growth rates for walleye and northern pike were slow, with walleye reaching 12.8 inches at the beginning of their fourth year of life and northerns reaching 19.2 inches in length at the beginning of their fourth year of life.  Walleye size structure was relatively good with 56% of sampled walleye longer than 15 inches.  Northern pike size structure was poor with only 6% of the sample longer than 21 inches.  Bluegill abundance, size structure and growth were all good.  Eighty five percent of sampled bluegill were longer than six inches and bluegill were reaching 6.2 inches at the beginning of their fourth year.</p>",
