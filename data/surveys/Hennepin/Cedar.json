THE AVERAGE BLG SAMPLED WAS 5.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH (TL) AND 8.86 FISH PER POUND, WITH A TRAPNET PSD OF 16.0 PERCENT.  BLG WERE CAPTURED WELL ABOVE ALL TRAP AND GILL NET MEDIANS FOR NUMBER (19.4X GILL AND 4.9X TRAP NETS) AND POUNDS PER SET.  BLG GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE RATE IS BELOW AVERAGE.  LMB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS, BUT BELOW FOR TRAPNETS.  GROWTH RATE APPEARS TO BE NORMAL FOR LMB, AND ONE 15.1 INCH MALE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A 3.5 NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF LMB ALSO APPEARS TO BE VERY GOOD AS 43 YOY WERE CAPTURED IN THE 4 SEINE HAULS.  NOP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  THE 3 FISH CAUGHT APPEAR TO HAVE RECRUITED INTO THE POPULATION AS A RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  ALL WERE FOUND TO BE YOUNGER THAN THE LAST YEAR OF STOCKING OF WINTER RESCUE YEARLINGS.  GROWTH OF NOP WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL FOR AGES 1-4, AND BELOW FOR AGE 5.  ALL NOP AND HSF WERE CAPTURED IN DEEP WATER GILL NET SETS. THE HSF SAMPLED WERE ALL AGE 2+ FISH AND HAD TO HAVE MIGRATED INTO THIS BASIN FROM CALHOUN OR LAKES OF THE ISLES AS A RESULT OF YEARLING STOCKINGS IN 1991.  BASED ON THE GOOD GROWTH RATE OBSERVED IN THIS SAMPLE, ALL FOUR FISH ARE LIKELY FROM THE YEARLING STOCKED IN LAKE OF THE ISLES IN SPRING 1991.  WAE WERE CAPTURED BELOW STATE MEDIAN LEVELS, BUT ABOVE LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER GILL NET SET.  WAE HAVE NEVER BEEN STOCKED IN THIS BASIN, BUT HAVE IMMIGRATED FROM OTHER LAKES IN THE CHAIN.  THE AGE II+ WAE IS FROM A 1991 YEARLING STOCKING (144 FISH) IN LAKE CALHOUN.  AGE IV+ WAE ARE FROM FINGERLINGS STOCKED IN LAKE CALHOUN DURING 1988 (6,928).  WAE GROWTH RATE IS ABOVE AVERAGE THROUGH AGE 4+.  YEP WERE SAMPLED AT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS AND AVERAGED 6.2 WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS.  THE AVERAGE SIZE SAMPLED WAS 6.9 CARP WERE SAMPLED BELOW ALL TRAPNET MEDIAN AND WTS WERE CAPTURED IN EXCESS OF LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED INCLUDED YEB, BLB, HSF,GSF,AND PMK.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar is a 164-acre lake located in west-central Minneapolis.  It is the most upstream of three popular, familiar lakes in Minneapolis; downstream and connected are, in order, Lake of the Isles and Bde Maka Ska.  A city park, maintained by the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board, surrounds the majority of the lake.  This public land provides ample shorefishing opportunities, including a fishing pier.  Cedar has multiple locations to carry in small craft, and larger boats can access from the Bde Maka Ska boat ramp and travelling through two channels and Lake of the Isles.  Motors are restricted to electric only on the entire chain.  There are three swimming beaches on the lake, and it is a popular spot for swimmers and paddlers during the summer.  Cedar Lake is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Muskellunge; however, 2019 sampling did not target these species.  Several Largemouth Bass were incidentally captured in gill nets.  The fish ranged in size from 9.0 inches to 19.8 inches, with an average size of 14.4 inches and 1.82 pounds.  No Muskellunge were caught in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked in Cedar Lake between 2005 and 2015.  However, the fish have been present in low numbers in the lake for decades, and stockings did not consistently boost Walleye amounts sampled during these past few surveys.   Walleye seem to migrate into Cedar via the connection to Bde Maka Ska, which has been stocked with Walleye since the 1970's.  Fish sampled in 2019 ranged between 17.8 and 24.3 inches and averaged 20.1 inches and 2.87 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have been increasing in abundance in recent years, and their size is good.  Fish averaged 24.3 inches and 3.24 pounds, ranging from 15.2 to 31.7 inches.  Cedar Lake would be a good spot for anglers hoping to take advantage of the new Northern Pike regulation.  Anglers have a shot at both fish smaller than 22 inches, of which they can harvest 10, as well as fish exceeding 26 inches, of which they can harvest two.  All Northern Pike between 22 and 26 inches must be immediately released.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was high in 2019, but size of the fish tended to be small.  Average size was 5.4 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Twenty-seven percent of the fish were larger than 6 inches. While no trap netted Bluegill exceeded 8 inches, a few larger individuals were sampled in gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nA Black Crappie die-off occurred during the summer sampling of 2019.  The fish were caught in the trap nets at a high rate, possibly due to their distressed condition. Black Crappie ranged in length from 3.5 to 11.5 inches, and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.18 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 169-acre, class 24 lake, located near downtown Minneapolis.  Cedar Lake lies within a chain of lakes that includes Lake of the Isles and Lake Calhoun. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, tiger muskellunge (muskie), walleye, and yellow perch.  Northern pike, tiger muskie, walleyes, and largemouth bass were low in numbers.  Three tiger muskellunge averaging 27.6 inches (range: 24.2-33.9 inches) were sampled.  These fish (age-3 and age-6) coincide with the 1997 and 2000 fingerling stockings of tiger muskie into Lake of the Isles.  Apparently, migration via canals may be occurring.  Nine northern pike, averaging 25.2 inches and 3.4 pounds, and five walleyes between 17.8 and 23.6 inches were caught during this survey.  Because the ages of sampled walleyes coincide with past Lake Calhoun fingerling stockings (1991, 1997, and 2001), emigration to Cedar Lake may be occurring via canals.  Additionally, four largemouth bass between 7.0 and 15 inches were also sampled.  Cedar Lake has a panfish community consisting of bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and yellow perch.  Bluegills were very abundant and rarely exceeded 5.5 inches.  Only 19 bluegills were between 7.0 and 8.0 inches.   Of the 111 black crappies sampled, 85% were below 7.0 inches.  If allowed to mature, age-3 and age-4 crappies could provide consistent action the next couple of years.  Four yellow perch between 5.5 and 8.0 inches, 36 pumpkinseeds between 4.0 and 6.5 inches, and 15 hybrid sunfish were additionally sampled.  Six black bullheads, six bowfin (dogfish), and one trap net caught common carp were also sampled during this survey.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar is a 169-acre lake located in west-central Minneapolis.  It is most upstream in what is known as \"the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes.\"  Parkland, maintained by the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board, surrounds the majority of the lake.  This public land provides ample shorefishing opportunities.  Cedar has multiple locations to carry in small craft, and larger boats can access from the Lake Calhoun boat ramp and travelling through two channels and Lake of the Isles.  Motors are restricted to electric only on the entire chain. <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth of Cedar Lake is 51 feet and water clarity in early July was 4.2 feet.   At that time, the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 12 feet.  The water level was high due to record June rainfall.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite not being stocked, Walleye have been present in low numbers in Cedar Lake for decades.  The lake has benefited from the connection to Lake Calhoun, which has been stocked with Walleye since the 1970's.  Though, beginning in 2005, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked directly into Cedar Lake in odd numbered years.  The previous survey in 2009 netted 3.8 Walleye per gill net which was nearly double the number caught in any previous surveys.  However, in the 2014 survey, Walleye abundance was low (0.5/net) and more typical of that found in Cedar in previous surveys (excluding 2009).  The four Walleye sampled were 18.4, 21.2, 22.1 and 25.4 inches.  Three Walleye were aged and all were from year classes (2007, 2009) stocked directly in to Cedar Lake.    Low Walleye numbers in the 2014 survey may indicate poor survival of stocked fingerlings or suggest they migrated to Lake of the Isles and/or Calhoun.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been historically low in Cedar, averaging 1.6/ gill net over the previous 5 surveys.  Although, in 2014, 4.5/net were sampled, which is higher than average for the lake and greater than average when compared to other similar lakes.  Even with an increased abundance, size structure of the pike population has remained relatively favorable.  Fish averaged 4.5 lbs and 26.3 inches, ranging from 13.0 to 35.8 inches.  Twenty-seven Northern Pike were sampled and 8 (29.6%) were 28 inches or longer and 2 (7.4%) were 35 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake usually has high numbers of small Bluegill compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Compared to the previous 5 surveys, the 2014 catch (22.0/trap net) was below average (82.2/net), but size was still small.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets averaged 5.4 inches and 0.09 lbs.  They ranged from 3.1 to 6.6 inches, with only 15.6% longer than 6 inches and none 7 inches or larger; only two of 7-inch size were caught in gillnets.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have been moderately low and relatively consistent over time.  In 2014, they were sampled at a rate of 3.3/trap net.  The average over the previous 5 surveys was 3.9/net, ranging from 2.1 to 6.0/net.  Black Crappie size has been consistently small in Cedar as well, averaging 0.13 lbs over the last 5 surveys.  The average crappie was larger in 2014 at 0.18 lbs; however, this is still considered small.  Average length was 7.2 inches, the largest measured 9.3 inches, and 16.7% were longer than 8 inches.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was low and well below the average when compared to other similar lakes.  Size was small; mean length was 6.7 inches and the largest measured 7.8 inches.  Twenty-nine percent were between 7 and 7.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake was stocked with hybrid (Tiger) Muskellunge approximately every third year from 1982 to 2007.  After 2007, management strategies changed and stocking switched to pure-strain (Leech Lake broodstock) Muskellunge.  The current plan calls for stocking 63 Muskellunge fingerlings every other year.  Since the standard summer survey methods are not designed to extensively evaluate a Muskellunge population, sampling no Muskellunge in 2014 was not surprising.  (Spring trap nets are the preferred gear for Muskellunge assessments.)  It is likely a population exists in Cedar Lake due to its stocking history and connection to Lake Calhoun, which has an established Muskellunge fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the numbers from the 2014 assessment are not necessarily representative of the population present.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.  Despite this, 5 Largemouth Bass were sampled in the gill nets, considered high for that gear type.  Sampled fish ranged from 10.4 to 17.0 inches, averaging 14.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake lies within the Chain of Lakes near downtown Minneapolis.  Because of it's location, it receives considerable pressure from anglers.  Most anglers fish from shore, targeting the abundant bluegill population.  The 2000 survey found that bluegill abundance was over 4 times what is typical for lakes of this type.  However, the average size of bluegill was only 4.7 inches, and only 1% were above 6 inches.  Bluegill growth is slow.  Anglers targeting sunfish will also find pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish in limited numbers.  Black crappie are more abundant than previous surveys, but their average size is only 6.1 inches.  Most crappie are from a strong 1997 year class that, given time for fish to mature, may provide for a decent fishery in the future.  Yellow perch are also present in moderate numbers, although their average size is 6.2 inches.  No sampled perch exceed 8 inches.     Anglers wishing to target larger fish can catch several species in Cedar Lake.  Northern pike abundance is low for this lake type, but the average size is good.  Pike averaged 25.9 inches, and all were over 21 inches in length.  Hybrid muskellunge were stocked every third year in 1995 and prior.  Anglers may still encounter larger individuals that remain from these stockings.  Beginning in 1998, stocking was changed to pure strain muskellunge.  One 19.1 inch muskellunge from this stocking was caught in the 2000 survey.  One walleye was also captured.  Walleye are not stocked in Cedar Lake, but instead migrate from annual stockings in Lake Calhoun.  Previous surveys have captured more walleye than in 2000.  The lone fish measured 18.1 inches.  Limited numbers of largemouth bass were sampled in 2000, but standard sampling techniques are not very effective at catching them.  Most were under 6 inches, but 1 fish measured 18.9 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 169-acre, class 24 lake, located near downtown Minneapolis.  Cedar Lake lies within a chain of lakes that includes Brownie Lake, Lake of the Isles, and Lake Calhoun.  All lakes are connected via shallow canals.  The sportfish community consists of various sunfish species, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, tiger muskellunge (musky), walleye, and yellow perch.  Tiger musky, walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  Likely originating from the 2002 Lake Calhoun fingerling stocking, one age-3 tiger musky measuring nearly 29.0 inches was captured in a gill net.  Nine walleyes between 12.0 and 25.0 inches were also sampled during this survey.  Similar to the assessment performed in 2003, all sampled walleyes likely originated from past Lake Calhoun stockings (1997 fingerling, 2000 yearling, and 2003 fingerling).  Apparently, both tiger muskies and walleyes are migrating from Lake Calhoun via canals.  Twelve northern pike, averaging 27.5 inches and 5.0 pounds, and one largemouth bass, measuring 20.2 inches and weighing 5.2 pounds, were additionally sampled.      Cedar Lake has a slow growing panfish community consisting of small sunfish, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Bluegills were moderately abundant and rarely exceeded 5.5 inches.  Of the 53 black crappies sampled, 87% were below 7.0 inches, with no fish exceeding 8.0 inches.  Forty-four yellow perch between 4.5 and 8.0 inches, 37 pumpkinseeds between 4.5 and 6.0 inches, 3 hybrid sunfish, and one green sunfish were additionally sampled.Four bowfin (dogfish), three black bullheads, one yellow bullhead, and one white sucker were also captured during this assessment.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 169 acre class 24 lake located in the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes.  These lakes are heavily impacted by the surrounding city.  Storm water runoff impairs water quality.  Numerous water quality improvement projects have been implemented, minimizing impacts from the surrounding city.  Motor restrictions on the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes prevent Cedar Lake from experiencing heavy surface use.  There is carry-in access near the fishing pier.  Shore fishing is very popular on Cedar Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Cedar Lake is diverse.  Four species are present.  Cedar Lake walleye abundance increased to the highest value ever recorded.  Stocking fingerlings is responsible for this increase.   Walleye stocking began in 2005.  Stockings occurred in 2007 and 2009, and will continue in odd numbered years.  Walleye mean length was 16.26 inches.  Mean weight was 1.94 pounds.  Both abundance and average weight were above average.  Northern pike numbers were low.  This is typical of Cedar Lake.  In the 2009 population assessment largemouth bass abundance was high.   Largemouth bass averaged 9.53 inches and 0.58 pounds.  Keep in mind standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of LMB abundance.  Hybrid muskellunge, also called tiger muskie, are present in Cedar Lake.  Stocking of hybrid muskellunge occurs once every three years.      <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Cedar Lake.  Black crappie abundance is below average. Very few large fish were sampled.  Bluegill abundance decreased compared to the 2005 survey, but stayed within Cedar Lake's average range.  Abundance remains above average and average weight increased slightly.  Only 11.4% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  The bluegill poulation in Cedar Lake is stunted.  Yellow perch abundance in Cedar Lake is below average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in very low numbers.  Common carp abundance increased slightly since the 2005 survey,  but remains low.  Black bullhead were also sampled at low abundance.  This is typical for Cedar Lake.  Yellow bullhead were not sampled.  Previous surveys found yellow bullhead to be low as well. <br> \n <br> \nIn the Metro area, stunting in size is likely due to overpopulation and size selective harvest by anglers.  Overpopulation reduces the amount of food available to all fish, thus reducing growth rates.  Harvest of larger (keeper size) fish by anglers reduces the number of quality fish in a lake.  Harvesting large fish also removes the spawning stock and reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish remain in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large which promotes big fish genetics.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
