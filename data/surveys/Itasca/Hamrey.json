A TRAP NET CPUE OF 11.0/LIFT EXCEEDED THE THIRD QUARTILE (9.9/LIFT) FOR YEBS OF LAKE CLASS #28. THE MEDIAN LENGTH OF 44 YEB WAS 9.0 INCHES.  BLHS OF THIS SIZE MAY BE OF COMMERCIAL INTEREST.  A GILL NET CPUE OF 5.0/LIFT FOR NOP IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN FOR THIS SPECIES.  OF 21 FISH AGE 43% WERE DETERMINED TO BE THREE YEAR OLDS.  GROWTH RATES FOR AGE III FISH WERE DETERMINED TO BE NEAR NORMAL.  BLG CPUE VALUES WERE WELL BELOW LAKE CLASS MEDIANS.  AGE II, III AND IV WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE WITH AGE III FISH ACCOUNTING FOR 70% OF THE TOTAL.  GROWTH OF AGE III BLGS WAS DETERMINED TO BE WELL BELOW AVERAGE.  ALTHOUGH NO WAES WERE CAPTURED IN THE 1991 ASSESSMENT THEIR PRESENCE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN PREVIOUS TEST NETTINGS (1959 AND 1978). HAMREY LAKE HAS NO HISTORY OF WAE STOCKING.</p>",
