Average length was 21.2\", with 21% in the protected 22-26\" slot.  Northern Pike measuring at least 26\" in length made up an additional 6% of the catch with fish up to 36.2\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a rate of 131.0/hr run time. Average length was 10.6\", with 37% at least 12\" in length. Largemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers in gill net at 4.5/net.  Average length was 12.9\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in average numbers at 2.8/gill net and 1.0/trap net.  Average length was 12.0\" for gill net sampled fish, and only 6.8\" for trap net sampled fish.  For both gears combined 70% were at least 8\" in length.

Observed snapping turtles.Present Fish Population Status: Northern pike abundance is high (10.67 per gillnet) and a moderately good length frequency distribution exists.  The growth rate on northern pike is good and the majority of northern pike are relatively young fish which belong primarily in the II, III and IV year class groups.  Bluegill abundance of largemouth bass is good but growth rate slow.  Black crappie abundance is excellent with growth rate good and good length frequency distribution present.  Yellow perch as forage food are present in moderate numbers.  The population of walleye is very low.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place August 7, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other sampling site.  Ten species were sampled, including 2 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on August 7-9, 2023, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Suggest discontinuing use of the northern pike spawning area.Present Fish Population Status:  Since the last survey in 1966 the northern pike population has dramatically increased to a point of overabundance.  Indications are that this has caused a decline in populations of yellow perch.  Populations of other species are stable or slightly declined.</p>",
