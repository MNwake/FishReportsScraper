                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a small, clear water lake with moderate development and fastdrop-offs along shore.  It has a diverse fish community with the opportunity ofcatching quality size fish.  The walleye population is low and the majority of thefish sampled were less than a pound, however, walleye up to 31 inches wereobserved.  Turtle Lake has a history of producing large northern pike.  The pikepopulation has increased and the average size from the survey was 17 inches. Standard lake survey gear are inefficient at sampling large fish which may accountfor the absence of large fish (pike) in the 1995 survey.  Largemouth bass are lowin abundance and the average size was 12 - 14 inches.  The panfish populations inTurtle Lake consist of abundant black crappies and low numbers of bluegills. Tullibee, yellow perch, and possibly white suckers  provide an important prey basefor the walleye and northern pike.  Bullheads, bowfin, redhorse and carp are alsopresent in the lake.      Because of Turtle Lake's small size, selective harvest is encouraged for bothangling and spearing to minimize impact on the fish community.  Releasing largernorthern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish willhelp sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Lakeshore home ownersand others in the watershed need to use proper management practices to maintainwater quality and healthy fish habitat.</p>",

Walleye and tullibee were both caught during this survey and are below state median in numbers.  This walleye catch was three times higher than in two previous surveys.  Yellow perch are just below the median while bluegills are small and very abundant.  All three species of bullhead are present with black bullhead being the most abundant.  Black crappie are very common with some larger ones being caught.  Largemouth bass and carp are present in low numbers and bowfin are common.  Largemouth bass were fairly common in the natural reproduction checks.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Turtle Lake is a small, moderately deep lake, with excellent water clarity in late summer with a secchi disk reading of 18.5 feet.  The clear water could make fishing more of a challenge for anglers who may have to try night fishing especially if seeking walleye.  With the clear water, submergent vegetation grew out to a depth of 16 feet with muskgrass and Illinois pondweed being the most abundant species.  Wild rice was the most abundant emergent species around the lake.   Steep drop-offs and weedlines provide the most common fishing structures in the lake.  \n    The lake supports a variety of fish species which attract anglers including northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegills, and black crappies.  Turtle Lake has a reputation of producing some large pike and walleye likely due to the tullibee population in the lake.  Both the northern pike and tullibee showed a decline in abundance since the last survey but some quality pike were still observed.  Due to the lake's small size, the numbers of large pike could easily be decimated by overharvest.  People seeking northern pike should be aware of the fragile nature of this fishery and consider releasing large pike when they catch them.  Fingerling stocking likely sustains the walleye fishery in the lake and a variety of sizes was observed in the survey.  Fishermen occasionally report good walleye fishing in the spring.  Few largemouth bass were sampled during the survey and abundance has been low but reports were that anglers were catching some over the summer.\n     The summer survey showed few panfish of a size to interest most anglers but that is not unusual.  By late summer most of the panfish caught in surveys are the smaller ones thus our results are usually not a reliable indication of the adult population.  Past surveys have shown that the lake can produce quality size bluegills over 7 inches and crappies over 9 inches but also that the populations could easily be affected by angler harvest.  Pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass were also sampled but the fish were small.\n     Both tullibee and yellow perch abundance was low when compared to similar type lakes which could affect northern pike and walleye growth rates.  Both species can be important prey species for promoting good growth rates in the gamefish.  White sucker numbers were normal for this type of lake and can provide an alternative prey base.   All three species of bullhead, black, brown, and yellow, were sampled in the nets along with bowfin or dogfish.\n     Although, Turtle Lake has moderate development around it's shore, the homeowners have done little to disturb the shoreline vegetation.  The shoreline vegetation provides valuable fish habitat, protects again shoreline erosion, and filters pollutants entering the lake which helps maintain good water quality and clarity.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       The first ice-out assessment for Turtle Lake was conducted in mid-April, 2015.  Northern Pike and Walleye are management species and summer gill nets have been ineffective at sampling both species.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie are the primary management species for Turtle Lake with Walleye, Bluegill, and Tullibee (Cisco) being secondary.   <br> \n     The 2015 ice-out trap net assessment caught eighty Northern Pike between 7.7 and 40.2 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 19.6 inches and modal length 21 \u0013 22 inches.  Pike exceeding twenty-one inches accounted for 44% (n=35) of the catch with 2% (n=2) more than thirty inches in length.  Of the two pike exceeding thirty inches, one was thirty-six inches and the other forty inches in length.  Most of the pike(58%) were from 3 to 5 years of age with six additional year classes represented ranging from age 1 to age 11.  The largest pike displayed fast growth while most fish under 30 inches long showed normal growth. <br> \n      Black Crappie was one of the more numerous species in the 2015 ice-out assessment with 239 fish caught.  The sample size structure in the assessment demonstrated that Turtle Lake can produce some quality size crappie.  The fish measured from 7.6 to 12.4 inches in length with a mean length of 10.1 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 85% (n=204) of the catch with 61% (n= 147) more than ten inches, 15% (n= 35) over eleven inches, and 2% (n=6) exceeding twelve inches in length.  Age groups 4-10 were observed with 2006 producing the most prevalent year class accounting for 37% of the sample.  Age structure for Turtle lake crappies was unusual with 65% of the sample age 8 or older.  Crappies showed normal growth up to age 6 and slow growth thereafter. <br> \n      The 2015 ice-out trap net assessment has been the most effective method for sampling Walleye when comparing past sampling efforts.  A total of thirty-one Walleye between 12 and 29.8 inches were netted in the 2015 ice-out assessment.    A majority of the Walleye (84%; n=26) caught in the 2015 ice-out assessment were greater than twenty inches in length, indicative of the time of year.  A total of eleven year classes were represented in the 2015 sample ranging from 2 to 14 years of age.  No year classes were especially prominent and not all fish could be assigned to stocking efforts thus indicting the presence of naturally reproduced fish.  Walleyes exhibited fast growth when compared to area means. <br> \n      A wide range of sizes was displayed in the 2015 ice-out assessment Bluegill sample.  The fish measured from 2.8 to 9.1 inches in length with mean length of 5.7 inches.  Smaller Bluegill dominated the catch as only 24% (n=65) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 4% (n=11) more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n      Eleven Largemouth Bass were also caught in the 2015 ice-out trap net assessment, most of which were larger fish.  The fish measured up to 19.7 inches in length with 73% (n=8) of the bass exceeding sixteen inches.   <br> \n     Four other panfish species were netted in the 2015 ice-out assessment, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass.  Rock Bass was the most abundant of the panfish species.  All three species of bullhead were also caught with Brown Bullhead being the most abundant and Black Bullhead the least abundant.  Other fish species caught included Bowfin, Common Carp, Common Shiner, Greater Redhorse, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n     Results from the 2015 spring ice-out assessment suggests that this method of sampling may be the most effective method for evaluating Northern Pike and Walleye populations in Turtle Lake. <br> \n</p>",

About 33% (34 acres) of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.There are no inlets presene, but an outlet to Turtle Creek and the Long Prairie River is present on the southwest shore.The lake bottom consisted of sand to a depth of three feet along the entire shoreline and below the 3-foot contour the bottom consists of muck.Wild rice was quite abundant in the shallows along the east shoreline of the lake, and submerged pondweeds were common along the entire shoreline.A secchi disk reading of 14 feet at the time of the survey indicated that the lake was quite clear, and dissolved oxygen testing indicated that the dissolved oxygen content below 20 feet was too low to support warm-water fish at that time.The test net catches indicated that dogfish, brown bullheads, northern pike, and sunfish were present in good numbers, and tullibees, common suckers, perch, walleyes, largemouth bass, rock bass, and crappies were probably present in low numbers.  At the time of the survey spawning conditions were considered to be good for northern pike and most species of centrarchids, and poor for walleyes.Shoal water seining indicated that some natural reproduction of northern pike, perch, largemouth bass, sunfish, rock bass, and crappies had occurred in 1960.Local residents reported that northern pike fishing had been quite good in past years but has been poor recently, and that panfish fishing has been fair recently.No public access area is present to the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A panfish assessment was conducted on Turtle Lake in mid-June to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  The lake survey trapnets used in the mid-August survey of 2007 produced low catches although the 2007 crappie gillnet catch of 3.7/set was above the third quartile for lake class 28 for these species.  Six trapnets were set over a three-day period for a total of 12 lifts in the 2008 assessment.  Crappie, bluegill, and other gamefish were measured with scales taken from the panfish for age and growth analysis.  All other species were identified and counted. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish assessment captured forty-seven black crappie between 4 and 10 inches in length, for a catch rate of 3.9/set.  Mean length for the sample was 7.5 inches with a modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches and 11% (n=5) of the fish exceeding 9 inches in length.  The 2007 survey trapnets captured only eight crappie, which ranged from 4.7 to 9.7 inches in length.  Mean length for those crappies was 8.1 inches.  The black crappie catch from the 2007 gillnets was comprised of twenty-two crappie between 4.1 and 8.7 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 6.6 inches with two modal lengths of 4.5 - 5 inches and 8 - 8.5 inches.  The lake management plan for Turtle Lake is to maintain a black crappie catch of more than 5 per spring trapnet with at least 33% of the catch exceeding 9 inches in length.  Ages 1 thru 7 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment.  Ages 1 thru 3 displayed normal growth and the older fish slow growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 panfish trapnets were very effective at sampling bluegill, capturing a total of 798 fish.  The fish ranged in size from 1.2 to 8.5 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 5.8 inches with a modal length of 5.5 - 6 inches and 10% (n=78) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  The majority (63%, n=506) of the fish were between 5 and 6.5 inches.  The 2007 summer trapnets caught only fifty-four bluegill, which were between 3.6 and 8 inches in length.  Mean length for that sample was 5 inches with a modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches and 6% (n=3) of the fish more than 7 inches in length.  The lake management plan goal is to maintain a spring bluegill catch where at least 10% of the fish exceed 7 inches.  Ages 4 thru 9 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment with the majority of age groups exhibiting fast growth.  The strongest year class appeared to be from 2003. <br> \n <br> \nThree largemouth bass between 9 and 13 inches were also measured in the 2008 panfish assessment along with five northern pike ranging from 12 to 22 inches.  Other panfish species captured during the assessment included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and rock bass.  All three species of bullhead were sampled along with bowfin, common carp, white sucker, and yellow perch.  An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth for all species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a 116-acre lake located about 12 miles south of Staples. Generally, on-water lake activity is quiet, especially during the week. Residential development is light, water clarity is good and aquatic vegetation is diverse. Despite a maximum depth of only 39 feet, Turtle Lake supports a healthy Cisco population which may be its most unique feature. As a very desirable prey species, Ciscoes appear to be supporting a Northern Pike population that contain fish over 30 inches in length, as sampled during historical netting surveys. These large pike should be considered low-density and caution must be exercised when considering whether to harvest one. A quality fishery can be enhanced if only pike less than 22 inches are kept by anglers. This is especially true in a small lake like Turtle.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected during past surveys include Walleye, Black Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass. Walleye abundance is very low despite several years of fingerling stocking. There are some large to very large Walleyes present but they are few and far between. It does not appear that a quality fishery is being established under the current stocking plan and a re-examination of management strategies is needed.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are present in decent numbers but average size is on the small side. Black Crappie abundance is good and individual growth is doing well. A 2019 electrofishing survey caught many crappies and the proportion of the catch exceeding 10 inches was over 30 percent. Largemouth Bass are also present in good numbers with many fish sampled measuring 15 inches or greater. Because of Turtle's smaller size, fishing can be done from a small boat. The lake is oriented from west to east and because the south shoreline is heavily wooded, calm water can be found there even on windy days.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Turtle Lake was conducted on June 14-16, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Northern Redbelly Dace) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 28 lakes and the average length was 5.7 inches, with 21% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Turtle Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a small (104 acre), moderately deep lake, with good water clarity (8.5').  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 13 feet with coontail, muskgrass, and wild celery the most abundant plants.  Sand is the predominant substrate type.  The lake supports a significant tullibee population, which helps sustain the lakes ability to produce large northern pike and walleye.    Northern pike are abundant in the lake at the present time, though a majority of the fish are small (under 22 inches).  Turtle Lake is known for producing some large pike (10-20 lbs.) for anglers and spearers.  Due to the lake's small size, the numbers of large pike could easily be decimated by overharvest.  People seeking northern pike should be aware of the fragile nature of this fishery and consider releasing large pike when they catch them.  Large walleyes (25-30+ inches) also reside in Turtle Lake, however overall abundance of walleye is low.  Anglers did report catching some smaller \"eating\" size walleye in 2001.    Black crappie are the primary panfish species sought by anglers on Turtle Lake.  Crappies are found in good abundance and some large individuals (11-13 inches) have been reported in the spring.  Bluegill are also found in good numbers, however few fish sampled in DNR nets exceeded 7 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are good but few older fish were observed in the sample.  The past and present characteristics of the bluegill population suggest that the lake has the potential to grow bigger sunfish if harvest was reduced.  Largemouth bass also inhabit Turtle Lake and though their numbers are relatively low, the size structure is good.    Suckers, redhorse, bullheads, and bowfin are other species native to Turtle Lake.  None are found in numbers out of the ordinary for lakes of Turtle's type.  Much of the lake's shoreline remains undeveloped and provides good habitat for fish and wildlife.  Minimizing impacts to the lake's remaining undeveloped shoreline will be critical, especially if more shoreline is developed for residential uses.\t\t</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Turtle Lake July 17 and 22 of 2019 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted August 5-9.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 10 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.  Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.  The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.   Turtle Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 4 for comparative scoring and evaluation.  FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 67 which is above the impairment threshold of 38 and the excellent threshold (54).   These results indicate that Turtle Lake is in exceptional health based on the FIBI score which is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 28 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  Seven of these species are considered intolerant of habitat disturbance and two (Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead) are considered tolerant.   Common Shiners, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass made up a majority of the catch in near shore seining and Central Mudminnow were well represented in the near shore electrofishing.  Intolerant species such as Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner and Banded Killifish were present in small numbers while Iowa Darters were more commonly observed.  Northern Cisco where found in the gill nets, however Northern Pike were the most numerous species and accounted for the most biomass.  In the trap nets Bluegill and Black Crappie were the most abundant species and ranked highest in biomass.  The connection to the Long Prairie River provided by Turtle Creek likely adds to the diversity of the fish community assemblage. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Turtle Lake is a small, moderately deep lake with steep drop-offs and weedlines providing the primary fishing structures in the lake.   <br> \n      The lake supports a variety of fish species which attract anglers including Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Turtle Lake has a reputation of producing some large pike and Walleye likely due to the Tullibee population which provide high quality prey in the lake. Northern Pike abundance remains unchanged since the last survey and numbers were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes as well as within management goals.  Due to the lake's small size, the number of large pike could easily be decimated by overharvest. People seeking Northern Pike should be aware of the fragile nature of this fishery and consider releasing large pike when they catch them. Surprisingly, despite the abundant Tullibee population, growth for most of the pike caught in the survey was slow.  <br> \n      Although no Walleye were observed in the summer survey, several year classes were netted during the Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing assessment.  Fingerling stocking in even-numbered years along with immigration from the Long Prairie River sustains the Walleye fishery in the lake. Turtle Lake appears to support a moderate number of Largemouth Bass.  Most of the bass observed in the spring electrofishing were from 12 to 14 inches with some up to 19 inches measured.  The summer survey showed few Bluegill of a size to interest most anglers but that is not unusual. By late summer most of the Bluegill caught in surveys are smaller thus our results are usually not a reliable indication of the adult population. Past surveys have shown that the lake can produce quality size Bluegill over 7 inches.   Some nicer Black Crappie  up to 11 inches were caught in both the summer survey and spring electrofishing assessment.  Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Rock Bass were also sampled but the fish were small. <br> \n        Several significant year classes of Tullibee showed up in the 2013 survey which could provide some action for anglers and promote better growth rates in larger pike and Walleye.   Yellow Perch numbers continue to be low when compared to similar type lakes which could negatively affect growth rates in younger Northern Pike and Walleye which may frequent shallower water.  White Sucker numbers were normal for this type of lake and can provide an alternative prey base. All three species of bullhead, Black, Brown, and Yellow, were sampled in the nets along with Bowfin or Dogfish.   <br> \n       Although, Turtle Lake has moderate development around its shore, the homeowners have done little to disturb the shoreline vegetation. The shoreline vegetation provides valuable fish habitat, protects against shoreline erosion, and filters pollutants entering the lake which helps maintain good water quality and clarity. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Turtle Lake on June 14-15, 2022, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 35 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 83.0 (+/- 3.2) out of 100 possible. Approximately 48 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 71.6 (+/- 5.2), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 93.7 (+/- 1.5). \n\nRiparian lakeshore habitat quality, as indicated by a MNDNR StS score of 83, is moderate within Turtle Lake and above the statewide average score of 73. A moderate score indicates a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one Zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site. Protection of undisturbed riparian and aquatic habitat should provide buffering capacity, shoreline stability, and future contributions of coarse woody habitat into the lake.</p>",
