SMALL CARP RANGING FROM 11.0-16.5 INCHES AND AVERAGING 1.34 POUNDS EACH ARE QUITE ABUNDANT. ALL THREE SPECIES OF BLH ARE PRESENT, WITH BLB BEING THE MOST ABUNDANT.  LENGTH-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS INDICATE THAT AT LEAST 4 AGE CLASSES ARE PRESENT IN THE POPULATION AT THE TIME THIS SAMPLE WAS TAKEN.  GOS ARE ALOS ABUNDANT WITH NEARLY ALL FISH BEING BETWEEN 5.0 AND 6.4 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  BLC WERE SAMPLED IN ABUNDANT NUMBERS BY GILL AND TRAP NETS.  MOST FISH WERE IN THE SEVEN INCH LENGTH RANGE.  BUT GOOD NUMBERS OF NINE INCH FISH WERE ALSO SAMPLED.  THESE LARGER BLC REPRESENT A CALCULATED RSD = 21.13%.  THIS VALUE INDICATES A RELATIVELY BALANCED POPULATION OF THIS SPECIES AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW PREDATOR POPULATION PRESENT AND THE LIMITED USE OF THIS FISHERY DUE TO THE LACK OF PUBLIC ACCESS, BLC ARE LIKELY TO BECOME OVER ABUNDANT AND STUNTED IN THIS LAKE UNTIL WINTERKILL CONDITIONS OR STRESS RELATED DISEASE OUTBREAKS REDUCE NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN.  NOP WERE SAMPLED SLIGHTLY ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  SAMPLED FISH INDICATE A RELATIVELY NORMAL GROWTH RATE FOR THIS SPECIES.  YEP WERE SAMPLED NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH TYPES OF GEAR AND EXHIBITED A NICE AVERAGE SIZE (APPROX. 8.5 ONLY ONE ADULT BLG WAS SAMPLED, HOWEVER A FEW YOY FISH WERE SAMPLED AT EACH SEINING STATION.  BLC, GOS AND BLB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH TYPES OF GEAR.  CARP WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  IMMIGRATION BY OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN PAST YEARS OR BY LARGER INDIVIDUALS OF THE CURRENT SPECIES HAS BEEN LIMITED BY LOW WATER LEVELS DURING RECENT YEARS.</p>",

As there is no public access to Burandts, is not an actively managed lake but is occasionally surveyed in conjunction with Carver County staff to monitor fish populations and water quality.  The last population assessment was completed in 1991 for this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were found in below-average numbers for this lake class, with lengths ranging from 21.0-29.0 inches.  About 40% of those fish caught were above 24.0 inches in length, with the average weight per fish being about 3.0 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye, measuring 25.4 inches and weighing about 5.0 lbs, was sampled in a trapnet.  This represents a below average presence of walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were found in average numbers, with lengths ranging from 5.2-6.3 inches.  About 20% were over 6.0 inches, with the average weight per fish being about 0.08 lbs.  Largemouth bass were also sampled in good numbers but low average weight.  Sampled bass ranged in length from 4.5-7.0 inches.  Black crappie were also sampled in good numbers (12.5/ gillnet).  The crappies ranged from 4.0-10.0 inches in length, with 32% over 6.0 inches and 7% over 8.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were found in average numbers, ranging in length from 2.5-6.5 inches with 63% over 4.0 inches and 29% over 5.0 inches.  Pumpkinseed were also sampled at average numbers, ranging in length from 3.1- 4.8 inches with 46% over 4.0 inches.  One bigmouth buffalo was sampled, at 19.6 inches and 5.6 lbs.  Also sampled in average numbers were freshwater drum, yellow bullhead and common carp, with black bullheads being found in above-average numbers. <br> \n</p>",
