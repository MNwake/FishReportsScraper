                "narrative": "<p>R6 is a small impoundment of Canby Creek located west of Canby in Yellow Medicine County.  Its fishery is managed primarily for black crappie and northern pike.      Adult black crappie were stocked into R6 in 1997.  They were found in low abundance in 2000.  However, multiple year classes were present, indicating successful natural reproduction has occurred.  The vast majority of crappie were small and would not offer a quality angling opportunity.  Growth rates were slightly above average when compared to lakes in southern Minnesota.  A quality black crappie fishery will probably take a minimum of two years to develop.       Northern pike were also present in low abundance.  Only one adult northern was documented during the survey.  Three young-of-year northern pike were caught, indicating that pike were successfully reproducing.  Adequate northern pike spawning habitat is present in the lake.  It is likely northern pike numbers will increase in the next few years.     Yellow perch were moderately abundant. Most perch were small, but a fishable population of 9.0-11.0 fish were also present.  Growth rates were good.  A quality yellow perch fishery may develop over the next few years.     Adult bluegill were stocked in 1996.  This stocking appeared to fail as no bluegill were recorded during special asssessments in 1996, 1997 and 1998.  A draw-down of R6 occurred in 1996 and likely eliminated the bluegill population.  Adult bluegill were stocked again in 2000.  Successful reproduction was documented during the 2000 survey.  Future assessments will monitor the success of the 2000 stocking.     Other species present in low abundance included creek chub, common shiner and white sucker.     Management plans for R6 include a natural reproduction assessment in 2001 to evaluate the 2000 bluegill stocking, population assessments in 2004 and 2007 to monitor and evaluate fisheries management, and annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen levels and fishing pressure.   </p>",

Directions and access to the lake can be obtained from the Stone Hill Park Manager at Del Clark Lake near Canby. <br> \n     R6 provides angling opportunities for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike and yellow perch.  These species have fluctuated in abundance since fisheries investigations began in 2000.  During 2012 good numbers of largemouth bass and yellow perch were present, however they were somewhat small.  There were some large northern pike present.  Bluegill and black crappie have been abundant during past investigations, however low numbers were sampled during 2012.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>R6 is a small impoundment of Canby Creek located west of Canby in Yellow Medicine County.  It is managed for black crappie, bluegill and northern pike.     Adult black crappie were stocked into R6 in 1997.  An assessment in 2000 found only limited reproduction had occurred and crappie were present in low abundance.  In 2003, black crappie were abundant.  Although most crappie ranged from 5-7 inches, individuals over 14 inches were also sampled.  The majority of small crappie belonged to the 2001 year class and were growing slighly slower than normal.  It will likely take two more years for these crappie to measure near 9 inches.      Adult bluegill were stocked in 2000.  According to test nets in 2003, bluegill were abundant.  Most bluegill belonged to the 2000 and 2001 year classes, indicating stocked bluegill had successfully reproduced.  Most bluegill measured 4-6 inches.  A few individuals from the 2000 stocking were also sampled and measured 7-8 inches.  As with crappie, small bluegill were growing slightly slower than normal and it will likely require 2 years for most to measure near 7 inches.     Yellow perch were moderately abundant in 2003.  Most perch measured over 8 inches and a few individuals measured over 12 inches.  Anglers reported good yellow perch fishing during the winter of 2002/2003 and fair to good fishing should continue for the next few years.     A low abundance of northern pike were sampled in 2003.  Northern pike numbers have remained consistently low since being stocked in 1997.  A supplemental stocking of northern pike is scheduled for 2004.  Future assessments will monitor the effects of this stocking.     Largemouth bass stocked in 1994 and 1995 were likely eliminated during a draw-down in 1996.  Largemouth bass were not sampled in either the 2000 or 2003 assessments.  A reintroduction of largemouth bass in scheduled for 2004.  Reestablishment of largemouth bass should increase predation on small bluegill and black crappie and result in improved growth rates of those species.     Besides the largemouth bass and northern pike stockings, other fisheries management activities scheduled for R6 include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, annual ice-fishing pressure counts, natural reproduction investigation in 2005, and fish population assessment in 2006.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>R6 is small (17 acres) impoundment of Canby Creek located southwest of Canby in Yellow Medicine County.  It is owned by the Lac qui Parle-Yellow Bank Watershed District.  It is managed primarily for black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in 2006 was similar to 2003.  However, unlike abundance, size was smaller in 2006.  Average weight and length was 0.07 lb. and 4.6 inches.  Average size in 2003 was 6 inches and 0.12 lb.  Ages one and two (2005 and 2004 year-classes) were the most abundant year-classes, making up 83% of the black crappie aged.  No young-of-year black crappie were sampled, indicating a poor year-class for 2006. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance declined since 2003.  Size remained similar, with average size in 2006 being 5 inches and 0.1 lb. and average size in 2003 being 4.9 inches and 0.09 lb.  Two-year-old (2004 year-class) and four-year-old (2002 year-class) fish made up the majority (81%) of fish aged.  No young-of-year bluegill were sampled, indicating a weak 2006 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance is up slightly since 2003.  Unlike abundance, size and growth declined from 2003 to 2006.  Yellow perch averaged 8.6 inches and 0.3 lb. in 2003 whereas average size in 2006 was 6.2 inches and 0.1 lb.  Fish from the 2004 (2-years-old) and 2003 (3-years-old) year-classes were 82% of the perch aged.  Growth was much below the R6 average.  For example, the average length of a three-year-old yellow perch in R6 is 8.1 inches compared to 6.3 inches observed in 2006.  The decline in growth is likely due to the increase in the population and more competition for resources.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was similar to 2003.  Pike were large, with an average size of 31.6 inches long and 8.8 lbs.  Recruitment appears to be limited in R6.  All fish aged were from the 2001 year-class (5-years-old) and no young-of-year northern pike were sampled during this survey or in 2003.  Flooded vegetation is a primary spawning location for northern pike, and the previous years of dry weather have likely reduced its availability for pike reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nAdult largemouth bass were stocked in 1994 and 1995 but were not sampled during the 2000 or 2003 assessment.  The unsuccessful result of these stockings was attributed to a drawdown event conducted in 1996.  In May 2005, 12 adult largemouth bass were again stocked into R6.  This resulted in a successful production of many young-of-year largemouth bass.  Spring electrofishing sampled 678 largemouth bass per hour.  All of these bass were from the 2005 year-class and had a mean length of 6.3 inches.  The addition of this predator will hopefully increase the size and growth of the panfish species in R6. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were also sampled in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for R6 include fish stocking as needed, ice-fishing pressure counts, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and a resurvey in 2009. </p>",
