Largemouth Bass were scarce as were Bluegill (0.2/trap net). Yellow Perch (7.0/gill net) abundance was average and has increased since the 1965 netting when no perch were sampled. Nongame species present in low numbers were Bowfin and White Sucker. Black Bullheads are abundant (48.0/trap net) at eight times the local median.

                "narrative": "<p>Pitts Lake is a 93-acre lake located near the town of Avon in Stearns County. There is no public access and only three homes have been built around the lake.  The watershed is predominantly agricultural.  Maximum depth of Pitts Lake is 18 feet, but over 80% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Dissolved oxygen was good to a depth of 11 feet. The water was clear to 7.5 feet, which was the lowest depth that rooted aquatic plants were found. Cattails, which surround most of the lake, were common, as were bushy and curly-leaf pondweed. Pitts Lake is subject to occasional partial winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted during day-time for the first time in 2010. A total of 45 bass were collected at a higher rate than from other Montrose Area lakes. Bass ranged from 6 to18 inches and averaged 14 inches.  Age classes 2 through 9 were collected in this sample and growth rates were similar to statewide averages.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured in trap nets at a moderate rate. The population is satisfactory for fishing even though the net catches were below the statewide average. A total of 70 bluegill, between 4 and 8 inches, were caught. Bluegill were determined to be ages 2 through 5. Ages 2 and 3 grew faster than the statewide average; and bluegill reached six inches in three years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, northern pike and yellow perch were all caught in low numbers in 2010.  A total of 19 crappie, between 5 and 10 inches, was caught in trap nets. The catch was somewhat below the statewide average. Only four northern pike were caught in gill nets in 2010. This was the lowest catch of three surveys going back to 1965.  Northern pike were between 16 and 26 inches and determined to be ages two through four. Eight yellow perch which averaged 6.5 inches were caught in gill nets.  Growth rates for perch were faster than the statewide average. Yellow perch reached approximately six inches by the second year.  <br> \n</p>",
