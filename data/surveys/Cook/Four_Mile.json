All year classes in this natural population were well represented with 56% of the sample Ages I - III. The Northern Pike catch remained low as has been the case historically. The Yellow Perch catch increased about 50% over the previous assessments but yet was only about 70% of both the historical and lake class medians. White Sucker catch increased from 2.5 to 14.5/lift which was the highest catch recorded despite a 1989 - 1992 roughfish removal project.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Four Mile Lake has an area of 593 acres and has a maximum depth of 19.5 feet although the majority of the lake is less than 15.0 feet deep.  Water clarity was poor with visibility measured to five feet in the brown bog-stained water.  The shoreline around the lake is mainly covered in a mixture of deciduous and coniferous forest with the southwestern bay having marsh and bog covered shoreline.  The majority of the shoreline is under public ownership with a small portion being private ownership.  The aquatic and riparian plant community is diverse with 42 types of aquatic and riparian plants present during the 2016 survey.  Most of the main basin of the lake has a ring of hardstem bulrush and spikerush growing near the shore.  The southwestern bay is shallow and supports a dense bed of wild rice, which brings a variety of duck species to the lake.  Sand is the most common substrate present followed by gravel and rubble.  Walleye, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike are the most common game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFour Mile Lake is located 10 miles northwest of Tofte, MN off of USFS Road 170 (The Grade).  There is a U.S. Forest Service concrete ramp with a small dock located at the north end of the lake.  The access in is located within the four site Forest Service campground, and there is parking for at least five vehicles with trailers.  In addition to the campground, there are three remote water access campsites located along the shore of the lake.  The campground and remote campsites get a large amount of use during the summer and the lake is well suited for a variety of watercraft from medium size boats and pontoon boats to canoes and kayaks.  There are many boulders submerged just under the surface that are difficult to see in the dark water so caution should be used when boating on the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 standard survey was conducted to observe the aquatic habitat and fish populations in Four Mile Lake.  Investigations have been performed on the lake on a five year rotation to monitor the fish populations and the 2016 survey was the fourth investigation performed on this rotation schedule. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the 2016 survey, Walleye catch was above average relative to similar lakes in the Northeastern Minnesota.  The average length of Walleye was 13.94 inches with an average weight of 1.18 pounds.  Twenty-eight percent of the catch was over 15.00 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 25.98 inches long and weighed 5.73 pounds.  Thirteen year classes were represented in the 2016 survey indicating consistent recruitment to the population.  Walleye growth was average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in low numbers for the lake class.  One Black Crappie was caught in the gill nets and measured 4.49 inches long and weighed 0.06 pounds.  The trap nets sampled one Black Crappie, which measure 11.02 inches long and weighed 0.92 pounds.  Small mesh trap nets collected five adult Black Crappie and 698 young-of-the-year Black Crappie.  There were two Black Crappie caught in the small mesh nets that measured over 10.00 inches long with the largest measuring 11.81 inches.  Four year class were present in the sample based on scale aging, but with the low number of Black Crappie sampled growth cannot be precisely determined.  Black Crappie lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that may have an occasional strong year class.  The spawning habitat in Four Mile Lake appears to be good, but the cool climate of the northeastern Minnesota may be a limiting factor in successful reproduction.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch was below average for similar lakes in the Northeastern Minnesota.  This was the second consecutive survey to sampled Yellow Perch at below average numbers in gill nets.  Even with the lower than average numbers the average weight of Yellow Perch in the gill nets was 0.53 pounds, above average for similar lakes and average length was 9.66 inches.  Yellow Perch were sampled at average numbers with trap nets and had an average weight of 0.43 pounds (8.64 inches), which was above average for other lakes in the Finland Area.  The largest Yellow Perch sampled in 2016 was 13.07 inches long (1.15 pounds).  Seven year classes were sampled based on scale and otolith aging and growth of Yellow Perch appears to be average for the Finland Area  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch was below average for lakes in the Finland Area with only 11 fish sampled.  The average weight of the Northern Pike sampled was 2.06 pounds and average length was 20.57 inches.  The largest Northern Pike caught was 27.36 inch long and weighed 4.41 pounds.  Six year classes were present in the sample and growth of Northern Pike appears to be average for the Finland area.  Northern Pike, over the last four surveys, have been sampled at low numbers even with the lake presumed to have good spawning habitat for Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled at average numbers relative to similar lakes.  The average length of White Sucker was 16.69 inches and just over 2.00 pounds in weight.  Fourmile Creek is a popular spot for spearing White Sucker in the spring.  Small mesh trap nets also sample Blacknose Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, and unidentified minnows. <br> \n <br> \nFour Mile Lake is a good Walleye lake with decent numbers of eater size Walleye in the population.  The lake also has a good number of large Yellow Perch that anglers may consider targeting.  Besides the fish populations bringing anglers to the lake, the abundant wild rice in the southwest bay draws in ducks and duck hunters in the fall, and the campground is a popular spot for bear hunters.  The lake is also used by kayakers and canoes that just want to get out on the water on this scenic lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fourmile Lake is in the Superior National Forest approximately 10 miles northwest of Tofte. The lake has a maximum depth of 18 feet and the water is fairly bog stained with a secchi dics visible to a depth of 6.5 feet. There is a U.S. Forest Service access on the northeast end of the lake with a concrete ramp. Adjacent to the access there is a four unit Forest Service campground and there are three remote campsites around the lake. Most of the lake is surrounded by Federal land and the shoreline is undeveloped and in a wild state. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Fourmile Lake is comprised of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch black crappie, white sucker and various minnow species. In 2006 walleye were sampled in average numbers and the catch was somewhat higher than in 2001. Mean size was 1.1 lb per fish which is consistent with the size seen in previous assessments on this lake. Approximately half of the walleye collected in this assessment were between 14-18 inches. The walleye population in Fourmile Lake is maintained through natural reproduction and does not require stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in below average numbers in 2006 as they have been in past assessments on this lake. Most of the northern pike collected in past assessments have typically been smaller than average and this was the case in this assessment with over three fourths of the fish being smaller than 19 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers in 2006 compared to other lakes in this class although the size was above average. Mean size was 0.58 lb per fish and included fish up to 13.1 inches and a fairly high number of the fish larger than 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in below average numbers in 2006 as they have been in most of the other assessments conducted on this lake. As in previous assessments some black crappie larger than 11 inches were collected however Fourmile Lake is typical of a number of other lakes in the Finland area which maintain relatively low populations of black crappie but the quality may be above average. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fourmile Lake is a 593 acre, with 98% littoral and having a maximum depth of 19.5 feet.  There is a back-in concrete ramp, with a small dock, at the public access on the north end of the lake.  The U.S. Forest Service also maintains a four site campground (no fee) at this location with fire grate, picnic table and outhouse.  There are also two remote campsites on Fourmile Lake, accessible by water only, on the southeast shore.  A bulrush fringe exists around much of the northeast and west shores.  The south basin is shallow with floating-leaf burreed and wild rice over much of the surface. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye numbers in 2011 were well above average for the lake class, the average size of walleye sampled was 1.0 pound (14.1 inches); the largest walleye was 23.8 inches (4.4 pounds).  Thirty-eight percent of the walleye were greater than 15 inches.  Natural reproduction in Fourmile Lake supports the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike sample in 2011 was well below average for the lake class, but similar to low catches seen in previous investigations on Fourmile Lake.  The average weight of northern pike in the 2011 sample was 1.4 pounds (19.9 inches); the largest northern pike weighed 2.2 pounds (21.2 inches). <br> \n   <br> \nThe black crappie numbers were below average in 2011 for this type of lake; however, the average size was 1.0 pound (11.0 inches), the largest black crappie was 12.7 inches (1.5 pounds).  Established black crappie populations, in the Finland Management Area, are often characterized by small populations of fast growing fish associated with an occasional strong year-class.  Black crappie fisheries in these lakes are sporadic with some quality size (12 inch plus) fish associated with the strong year-classes.  While spawning habitat appears to be excellent in Fourmile Lake for black crappie, the cool climate in this portion of northeastern Minnesota has been a limiting factor for successful reproduction in Fourmile Lake and other area lakes with black crappie populations. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class in 2011; this has historically been the case in Fourmile Lake.  The average weight in 2011 of 0.6 pound (10.5 inches) was typical of past investigations.  Ninety percent of the total yellow perch catch was greater than eight inches.  Yellow perch natural reproduction appears to be sufficient to provide a forage base for the predator populations in Fourmile and a quality yellow perch fishery for the angler. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers are well above average in Fourmile Lake with an average weight over 2 pounds, in the 2011 population assessment.  The inlet on the north end of Fourmile Lake, from Toohey Lake, has a riffle below the culvert crossing U.S. Forest Service Road #170 (Wilson Grade) where many white suckers spawn in spring.  This is a popular location to harvest suckers for human consumption, after the May 1 season opens.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Four Mile Lake is located about 10 miles northwest of Tofte and has a US Forest Service rustic campground with a concrete log boat ramp off the Four Mile Grade (Forest Service 170) that provides public access. The lake has brown bog-stained water and covers an area of 593 acres with a maximum depth of less than 20 feet. Shallow rocks extend out from shore in some areas and boaters should use caution when navigating the lake. Anglers primarily target Walleye, although other popular species present include Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. The current fish community is sustained by natural processes that regulate the populations of each species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was 12.1 per gill net in 2021, which is similar to previous surveys of the lake dating back several decades. The average size of Walleye sampled was 13.6 inches and 0.92 pounds with the largest fish measuring about 26 inches long. Growth is considered normal for Finland area lakes with Walleye reaching 14.2 inches at age-5. Age analysis found year classes from each of the past several years. Results of the survey indicate natural reproduction continues to provide anglers with a good opportunity to catch and harvest a Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are another popular species targeted by anglers in Four Mile Lake. Historic surveys dating back to the 1980's have captured a low number of individuals. This is fairly typical of crappie populations in the Finland area that are low density and maintained through sporadic recruitment of year classes that are produced frequently enough to sustain the fishery. Catches from standard fisheries gear do not accurately reflect the angling opportunities for this species on this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also available to anglers and were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net in 2021. Net catches have been below the normal range for similar lakes in each of the eight previous surveys of the lake. While there is not an abundant population of pike, anglers may get a chance to battle this hard fighting species when fishing on the lake.</p>",

The walleye ranged from 8.4 inches to 29.0 inches (10.5 pounds) and averaged about 1.3 pounds.  The walleye population in Four Mile Lake is maintained entirely through natural reproduction.Northern pike were collected in below average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  The low catch rate is typical of catch rates recorded in earlier surveys on the lake.  All northern pike collected in this survey were small, with the largest weighing only 1.3 poundds.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers which included some quality size fish.  Sixty percent of the perch sampled were between 10.0 inches and 12.0 inches with fish up to 13.2 inches (1.3 pounds) taken.Black crappie were collected in average numbers during the survey with a few fish in the 10.0 inch to 12.0 inch range collected.  Four Mile Lake has supported a black crappie population for many years, which has included some quality size fish, however the population normally is not high.</p>",
