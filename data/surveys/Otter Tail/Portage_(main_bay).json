                "narrative": "<p>     Portage Lake is a 269-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately one mile east of Ottertail, MN.  Portage Lake is part of the Redeye River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to Portage Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 55% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 12.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 16.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Portage Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 61 along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are limited to the north shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice cattail, and bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Portage Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Portage Lake.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically remained high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 24.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.8 inches and 1.0 pounds.  The 2019 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.      <br> \n     Largemouth Bass abundance has also historically remained high.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.4 to 17.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     A moderate to high density Bluegill population exists.  Bluegill reproduction is consistently good; however, size structure is poor.  Only 2% of the Bluegills were 8.0 inches or greater in length and only 7% were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth rates are slow with an average length of 7.5 inches at eight years of age.      <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Portage Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Portage Lake was conducted on July 8, 2022 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was moved a short distance due to site conditions and one station was sampled by boat electrofishing.  A 15-foot seine was used at seven stations, a 50-foot seine was used at two stations and soft sediments and abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter and Mimic Shiner) and zero species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter and Mimic Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate Portage Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold and above the exceptional threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redeye Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Portage Lake is a 269-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail County approximately one mile east of Ottertail, MN.  Portage Lake is part of the Redeye River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to Portage Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 49 feet; however, 55% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 12.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 16.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Portage Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR concrete public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are limited to the north shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice cattail, and bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> \n     Largemouth Bass and Walleye are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Portage Lake.   <br> \n     Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 9.4 to 15.4 inches with an average length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically remained high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.0 to 23.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.1 pounds.  The 2015 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Portage Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.   </p>",

Nine sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish. Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Portage Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Redeye River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the fish survey, Minnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Portage Lake on Sep 22 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 28 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 75.4 (+/- 4.3) out of 100 possible. A score of 75.4 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderate, but a large difference was noted in shoreline condition between undeveloped and developed sites. Undeveloped sites had a mean score of 94.4, and excellent shoreline condition. However, developed sites were in poor condition with a mean score of 58.9. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Portage Lake is a 265-acre lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 49 feet with 56% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.6 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 14.2 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from a low of 8.5 feet to a high of 16.0 feet.  A recently renovated DNR public access is located along the east shoreline.  Portage Lake is included in class 31 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.       Development on the lake is low to moderate.  Year-round homes and cabins compose the existing development.  There is an operating farm located on the northeast part of the lake.  There are no resorts located on the lake.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.       Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are located in areas throughout the basin.  These plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and  are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the  aquatic habitat.       A special gill net assessment was conducted in 2001 and 2004 as part of a research project to evaluate walleye stocking.  Trap nets were not set during either of these assessments.       Walleye is the primary management specie in Portage Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  The walleye catch rate has exceeded the upper limit in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 25.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 12.6 inches and 0.7 pounds.  The 2001 and 2003 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.7 at four years of age.       Data from past and recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in Portage Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking and fry stocking are maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fry or fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Portage Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch that trophy fish in the future.  </p>",
