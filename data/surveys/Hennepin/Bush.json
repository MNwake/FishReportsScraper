Bluegill are the most abundant species present in the fish population and average small in size. While numbers of bluegill sampled is down from previous years, the size structure of the population and the slow rate of growth remains about the same. Hybridization between the various sunfish species present is common place and contributes a significant number of individuals to the overall panfish population. Largemouth bass are present in good numbers with some quality fish available to anglers. Over 1/3 of the bass sampled were 16.0 inches or longer. Northern pike are also present in good numbers with the average fish being about 21.5 inches in length and 2.3 pounds in weight. Hybrid Muskellunge are also present from stocking efforts but in relatively low abundance in relation to northern pike. Growth rate for all three major gamefish species is below average for a lake of this type.Yellow bullhead are also present in high numbers with the average individual being about 10 inches in length. Other forage species present but in below median levels for abundance include black bullhead, white sucker, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bush Lake is a 171-acre lake with a maximum depth of 28 feet. The lake is in the city of Bloomington in southern Hennepin County. Bush is actively managed for Largemouth Bass, with secondary emphasis on Bluegill. Bush also supports catchable populations of Northern Pike and Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by the City of Bloomington on the southwest side of the lake off West Bush Lake Road (up to 10 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Surface use restrictions allow up to 6-horsepower motors. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was completed on Bush Lake during the week of 6/12/2023 to monitor water quality and fish populations. Water color was clear, with good water clarity, measured at 11.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was 3.8 parts per million (ppm) at a bottom depth of 22 feet, meaning fish would be unable to use water depths greater than 22 feet during mid-summer. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Largemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2023 with nighttime boat electrofishing (36 fish/hour). A total of 54 bass were sampled, with an average length of 13.6 inches and the largest measured at 18.9 inches. The current population appears well balanced (a middle ground between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Bush Lake boasts a quality Largemouth Bass population with over 40% of fish sampled measuring greater than 15 inches, providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (38.8/net) near the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 349 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 4.4 inches, and the largest measured at 7.9 inches. Less than 1% of the total Bluegill sampled were greater than 7 inches. Although Bluegill are fairly abundant, very few large fish can be found. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (14.5/net), well above the expected catch rate of similar lakes. There were 87 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets during the 2023 survey. Average size of Northern Pike in the 2023 survey was 21.7 inches with the largest measured at 26.9 inches. Despite high numbers and small sizes, Bush Lake provides exceptional harvest opportunity with a possession limit of 10 and greater than 56% of sampled fish falling outside of the protected slot (22 to 26 inches). <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (3.2/net) and trap nets (0.4/net), below the expected catch rate of similar lakes. There were 22 Black Crappie sampled during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 7.5 inches, and the largest measured at 14.3 inches. Although crappie numbers are low, the chance at landing some really memorable (14\"+) fish exists in Bush Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil, a submersed invasive aquatic plant has been found in Bush Lake and remains present. Eurasian watermilfoil can limit recreational activities on water bodies by forming mats on the water surface and alter aquatic ecosystems by displacing native plants. The most important action that you can take to limit the spread of milfoil and other aquatic invasive plants is to remove all vegetation from your watercraft before you move it from one body of water to another.</p>",

A FAIR NUMBER OF LARGMOUTH BASS YOY WERE SAMPLED WHILE SEINING AND THEY WERE ALL 50 MM OR MORE, SHOWING YEAR CLASS STRENGTH. NO LEGAL SIZE WERE CAPTURED. BLUEGILLS WERE CAPTURED AT A RATE NEAR THE STATE MEDIAN BUT LOW FOR THE LOCAL CATCH RATE. I BELIEVE MANY MORE WERE PRESENT THAN WERE REPRESENTED BY OUR NETTING. HYBRID MUSKELLUNGE ARE ALSO KNOWN TO BE PRESENT BUT NONE CAPTURED AND NO REPORTS BY ANGLERS. PUMPKINSEED, HYBRID SUNFISH, WHITE SUCKER WERE NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS, BLACK BULLHEAD AND BLACK CRAPPIES WERE BELOW, AND YELLOW BULL- HEADS WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS WELL OVER THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS/</p>",

SAMPLING ABUNDANCE WAS 13.4 AND 11.2 TIMES STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS, RESPECTIVELY.  NO BLG WERE SAMPLED IN EXCESS OF 6.4: TOTAL LENCTH.  A PSD=3.85% AND AN AVERAGE RATE OF 16.1 FISH PER POUND REFLECT THE SMALL AVERAGE SIZE OF THIS SPECIES AT PRESENT.  SCALE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT GROWTH RATE FOR BLG IS BELOW AVERAGE.  PMK, HSF, AND GSF EXHIBIT A SIMILAR SIZE STRUCTURE (15.5, 13.9, AND 16.6 FISH PER POUND, RESPECTIVELY).  ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES WERE SAMPLED ABOVE TRAPNET MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET. YOUNG-OF-YEAR WERE SAMPLED DURING SHORELINE SEINING FOR ALL FOUR OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED PANFISH SPECIES.  LMB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE ALL GILL NET MEDIANS AND ABOVE LOCAL TRAPNET MEDIANS FOR NUMBER PER SET.  ELECTROFISHING RESULTED IN A CPUE OVER TWICE THAT FOR BASS IN PREVIOUS STUDY YEARS. NO FISH WERE SAMPLED IN EXCESS OF THE 16 SIZE USING ANY OF THE SAMPLING GEARS.  A LMB PSD= 28.6% WAS REALIZED FROM THE ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE. THIS REPRESENTS A 61.9% DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SAMPLING YEAR.  LMB GROWTH RATE DETERMINED FROM SCALE SAMPLES IS AVERAGE.  SEVEN TME WERE SAMPLED, SIX OF WHICH WERE FROM THE 1988 STOCKING.  GROWTH RATE IS BELOW AVERAGE.  NOP WERE SAMPLED IN EXCESS OF FOUR TIMES MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILLNET ABUNDANCE. NOP GROWTH RATE IS ALSO BELOW AVERAGE. A RSD 21= 26.92% WAS DETERMINED FOR SAMPLED NOP FOR ALL GEAR TYPES.  BLC AND BLB WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS, WHILE YEB AND WTS WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS.  BRB AND YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED, BUT IN LOW NUMBERS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bush Lake is a 188-acre, class 30 lake located in Bloomington.  A public boat launch is located on the southwest shore.  The lake has a 6 horsepower limit and an 8 mph speed limit is in effect during the day with a 5 mph limit at night.  The lake primarily managed for hybrid muskellunge and largemouth bass and is stocked with hybrid muskellunge every three years.  One 15.2 inch, 0.6 pound, one-year old hybrid muskellunge from the most recent stocking (2006) was sampled during this population assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch of northern pike was 7.5 per net, which higher than average for this type of lake.  This population has a low to moderate size structure with few individuals longer than 26 inches.  Mean length was 22.5 inches and mean weight was 2.5 pounds, which is right at the median quartile.  Individuals up to seven years old were sampled with the 2001 and 2003-year classes accounting for 60 percent of the total catch.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish are very abundant in Bush Lake but tend to be small.  The mean lengths for these species are all less than 5 inches, and few sunfish are larger than 7 inches <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled between the first and second gill net quartile for both abundance (4.2 per net) and mean weight (0.1 pounds).  Trap nets sampled fewer (1 per net) but larger (0.5 pounds) black crappie than gill nets.  Mean length was 6.6 inches in gill nets and 7.7 inches in trap nets.  Every year class from age 2 through 11 was present, indicating that recruitment has been consistent. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth gill net catch (1.3 per net) and mean weight (1.5 pounds) were both above average for this lake class.  Mean length was 13.9 inches and max length was 17.2 inches.  Growth is slower than average for this lake class, taking 6 years for bass to reach 12 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish that were sampled during this survey include yellow perch, black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bush is a 188-acre lake located in Bloomington.  The majority of the lakeshore is part of the city-owned Bush Lake Park.   A public boat launch is on the southwest shore, but City surface use restrictions allow only up to a 6-horsepower maximum for motors.  The speed limit is 8 mph during the day and 5 mph at night.   <br> \n <br> \nBush Lake has a maximum depth of 28 ft and good water clarity (11 ft in early June).  A standard population assessment, consisting of gill nets and trap nets, was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community.  Additionally, night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was conducted in June. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundantly sampled species in the spring trap nets.  Catch (18.8/net) was near average (24.6/net) when compared to other similar lakes in the state, although the size structure was small.  Fifty-six percent of the Bluegill were between 3.5 and 4.5 inches.  Size ranged from 3.2-8.1 inches, averaging 4.5 inches and 0.1 lbs.  Historically, Bluegill have been small in Bush Lake, averaging 0.1 lbs over the previous 4 assessments (dating to 1990).  Growth was comparable to other similar lakes in the West Metro Fisheries Area.  Bluegill were 4.1 inches by age 3 and 5.7 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were low in abundance in both spring trap nets (1.6/net) and summer gill nets (2.0/net).  This low catch was similar to the typically low values found previously.  In trap nets, size ranged from 4.7 to 10.0 inches, averaging 8.5 inches and 0.3 lbs.  The moderately high average size of these crappie can be attributed to the older ages they are able to attain.  The largest Black Crappie were between 8 and 10 years old.  Growth was slow.  They were 7.7 inches by age 5 and 9.0 inches by age 8.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Northern Pike were high-15.8/gill net-and size structure was fairly well-balanced.  Despite a healthy mix of small and larger fish, half were between 16 and 20 inches.  Size ranged from 14.5-27.2 inches.  Pike averaged 20.0 inches and 1.8 lbs, which is relatively small compared to other similar lakes.  The 2013 survey appeared to mark an end to a declining northern pike population.  Numbers had been declining for 4 consecutive surveys until this sampling.  During these past 4 assessments gill net catch had averaged 9.0/net.  Growth was slower than average compared to other similar lakes.  Pike were 16.4 inches by age 3 and 22.8 by age 6. <br> \n  <br> \nHybrid (Tiger) Muskellunge management first began with stocking in 1984; however the most recent stocking was in 2006.  No natural reproduction occurs.  One Hybrid Muskellunge was sampled in 2013.  That fish was 38.2 inches and 13.2 lbs.  Since their introduction, abundance of Hybrid Muskellunge in sampling gear has been low (0.2/ trap net, 0.4/gill net) and a quality population has not become established, particularly with the stabilization and recent increase of native Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked into Bush Lake.  Despite this, one Walleye (21.2 inches, 3.5 lb) was found in a gill net.  It is not known how the Walleye got into the lake and there in not expected to be a significant population present.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nA night electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted in the spring.  Seventy-two bass were sampled at a rate of 42/hour.  Relative abundance (42/hour) was average when compared to other West Metro lakes electrofished at night over the past two years (5 lakes, average= 45.8/hr, range = 18.6  102.3/hr).  Size ranged from 5.1-18.8 inches, averaging 11.6 inches and 0.9 lbs.  The size structure was somewhat balanced with 58 percent of bass between 8 and 12 inches, 22 percent between 12 and 15 inches, and 15 percent longer than 15 inches.  Growth was average through age 3, then older (age 4+) fish grew slower compared to other similar lakes.  Ages were relatively evenly distributed from 2 through 8; the oldest was age 10.  The strongest year class was 2009, which produced 28 percent of the bass.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of near shore fish species was conducted on June 30, 2015 by Lake IBI program staff.  Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with 3 sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 2 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 7 species of fish with most individuals from the centrarchid (sunfish) family.     <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in 2013 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (IBI) that describes the overall health of the fish community.  The Fish IBI score for Bush Lake indicates the fish community is not meeting expectations compared to similar lakes.  However, trap net data from the game fish survey may not be representative of fish community composition due to timing of sample collection.  Therefore there is insufficient information to make a determination about Bush Lake based on its Fish IBI score. <br> \n</p>",

THIS IS ALSO THE HIGHEST VALUE OBSERVED SINCE ANNUAL NETTING BEGAN IN 1985, WHICH RANGED FROM 7.6- 31.7/SET BEFORE 1990 SAMPLING.  THE PSD, 7.0, WAS ALSO THE HIGHEST SEEN SINCE 1985.  BLUEGILL GROWTH IS GOOD TO AGE 2 AND SLOW THEREAFTER; FISH AS OLD AS AGE 8 WERE SAMPLED.  LARGEMOUTH BASS ABUNDANCE WAS 24/HR ELECTROFISHING, COMPARED WITH A RANGE OF 9.3-22.7/HR ELECTROFISHING FROM 1986-89.
