                "narrative": "<p>Abundance of most fish species sampled in 1993 appeared to be similar to catch rates of the only previous survey, in 1973.The catch was also fairly similar to adjoining Star Lake (18-359).The catch of northern pike was average compared to lakes similar to Little Star.  Average size was nearly four pounds in 1993.  Three year classes were sampled; and growth was good, but rather variable.Crappies and bluegills were taken in average numbers as well and both species were slow growing.  All crappies sampled were age 4, as were more than one-half of the bluegills.Tullibees were found in average numbers and yellow perch in low numbers.  Both are important food fish for northern pike.  Rock bass, largemouth bass, black bullheads and yellow bullheads were all taken in low numbers in the 1993 survey.Little Star is a rather small lake with a generally soft bottom of marl and sand.  Aquatic vegetation is diverse but most species of plants are rather scarse.  Spawning habitat for sunfish, crappies and perch may be of poor quality because of soft bottom materials and may be one reason for what appears to be rather erratic spawning success of these fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Star Lake is a 50 acre lake located 5 miles southwest of Crosslake.  The lake is part of a chain of lakes characterized as having hard water, low fertility, and very good water clarity.  The maximum depth is approximately 30 feet and about 26% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are the lakes primary game fish species and were sampled at a rate of 5.5 per gill net.  This was similar to the three previous fish surveys.  Pike ranged from 12.2 to 33.4 inches with an average size of 20.9\" and 2.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nPopular panfish species in the lake include black crappie and bluegill.  Crappie were captured at a rate of 5.7 per trap net.  Age determination using crappie scales found growth was average and 67% of all crappies sampled were from the 2005 year class.  This suggests highly variable spawning success for crappie, which is typical for this chain of lakes.  Bluegills were captured in average numbers compared to similar lakes and previous surveys on this lake.  Several year classes of bluegill were captured, but growth was slow with few individuals reaching over 7\". <br> \n <br> \nAdditional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  A variety of minnow species were collected including brook silversides, mottled sculpin, and banded killifish, as well as least darters, a species of special concern in Minnesota.  Combining all methods, the 2010 survey identified 22 fish species in the lake. <br> \n</p>",
