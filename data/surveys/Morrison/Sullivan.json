PANFISH populations remain low and have not changed much since 1984.  All three species of BULLHEAD are present, with YELLOW BULLHEAD being the most abundant and are above average in size.  No YELLOW PERCH were sampled during the survey, however one was sampled during the natural reproduction check.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Long Lake is a small, 120 acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet and good water clarity.  The secchi disk reading of 10.5 feet at the end of August is better than average for a lake in central Minnesota.  The lake has abundant wild rice which forms a thick band around much of the lake.  There is a township owned public access on the east side.  Parking is limited as the access is narrow and the ramp is sand and gravel.  Much of the lake is developed except for the southwest side and north end which are mostly marsh.  Primary management species are largemouth bass and northern pike. <br> \n    The bass population in the lake has remained relatively stable over the years.  The average size in spring night electrofishing was about 12 inches or 1 pound with bass up to 17 inches measured.  Northern pike abundance has increased since the last survey and the population is dominated by smaller fish as few were more than 24 inches in length.   High pike numbers can be detrimental to the entire fish community and especially walleye management.   Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists. <br> \n A spring assessment in 2012 targeted the panfish in the lake since they provide an important fishery.  These spring nettings tend to exhibit a better picture of the adult bluegill population than the summer surveys do.   Most of the bluegill caught in the spring assessment were between 6.5 and 7.5 inches although a few over 8 inches were measured.  Long Lake appears to have a decent black crappie population as fish exceeding 9 inches were common in the spring sampling efforts.  Three other species of panfish in the lake include green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  <br> \n        Despite stocking by the Long Lake Association, the walleye population has shown no improvement in abundance.  For anglers lucky enough to hook into a walleye, chances are that it will be a nice one as two of three fish caught in the survey were over 18 inches.  Yellow perch have also been stocked by both the DNR and lake association in an attempt to increase abundance of the perch which could improve northern pike size and survival of the walleye.  This strategy has not worked either.   <br> \n     Other species found in the lake include yellow bullhead and bowfin or dogfish.  Bowfin can provide quite a fight for an angler and are known to be efficient predators on small bluegills.  Common carp were also observed during the spring electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> \n     Protecting Long Lake's extensive emergent vegetation beds should be a priority of the lake association and lakeshore owners.  Not only does the vegetation provide valuable habitat for the fish and wildlife, it also removes excess nutrients from the water and protects the shoreline from erosion.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to keep grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Poorly maintained septic systems can be a significant source of nutrients to a lake leading to algae blooms and excessive weed growth.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest and return the larger fish of each species to the water to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Harvesting small pike can reduce predation on the yellow perch, bass, and juvenile walleye, improving survival of those species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a small, 120 acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet and good water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 10 feet at the end of August.  The lake has abundant wild rice, coontail, and northern water milfoil which provides fish with abundant cover and spawning habitat.  Long Lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers seeking black crappies, largemouth bass, bluegills, and northern pike.         Fish populations in the lake have remained relatively stable since the last survey in 1994.  The one fish species to show an abundance change was the black crappie.  Crappie numbers displayed an increase since the last survey which was the result of three strong year classes produced 1996 through 1998.  Crappie fishing was reported as good the winters of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.  The northern pike population was dominated by small, slow growing fish.  All the fish seen in the summer assessment were less than 24 inches in length, however, one 28-inch pike was netted while electrofishing for bass.  Despite biennal stocking by the Long Lake Association the walleye population has shown no improvement.  The walleye seen in 2000 assessments did appear to come from stocking indicating limited survival of the fingerlings and no natural reproduction.  Anglers reported having good luck with largemouth bass.  The average size appears to be about a pound, however, bass up to 18 inches have been observed.       Bluegills provide another popular fishery on Long Lake.  Numbers were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes and the fish displayed normal growth.  While the average bluegill size appears to be about 5 inches, fish over 6 inches were common in a spring assessment, with one bluegill measuring just over 8 inches.  Pumpkinseed are another sunfish species in the lake that angling fun for kids.  While not as numerous as bluegills, the size structure of the population looks good with fish over 6 inches being common.       Long Lake has historically had low yellow perch numbers.  The net catch indicates the population was low for this type of lake and remains below desired management levels.  Low adult perch abundance can be a significant limiting factor in the lake for northern pike and walleye growth.  Large predator fish rely on perch or alternative species for good growth and survival.     Other species in the fish community included black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullheads.  Anglers seeking bullheads have an excellent opportunity to catch fish exceeding 11 inches in length.     Protecting Long Lake's extensive emergent vegetation beds should be a priorty of the lake association and lakeshore owners.  Not only does the vegetation provide important habitat for fish and wildlife, it also removes excess nutrients from the water and protects the shoreline from erosion.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to keep grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Poorly maintained septics can be a significant source of nutrients to a lake leading to algae blooms and excessive weed growth.  Anglers are encouraged to practive selective harvest and return the larger fish of a species to the water to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Harvesting small pike can reduce predation on the yellow perch, bass, and juvenile walleye, improving survival of those species.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Long Lake is a small, 120 acres lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet and good water clarity.  The secchi disk reading of 11 feet at the end of August is better than average for a lake in central Minnesota.  The lake has abundant wild rice which forms a thick band around much of the lake.  Two abundant species of submergent vegetation, coontail and canada waterweed, grow down to a depth of 16 feet.  Muck and detritus was the most common shoal water substrate in the lake.  The public access is on the east side and owned by the township.  Parking is limited as the access is narrow and the ramp is sand and gravel.  Much of the lake is developed except for the southwest side and north end which are mostly marsh.   <br> \n     One change that seems to have occurred since the last survey in 2000 was a significant decrease in northern pike abundance.  Northern pike numbers appear to be at the lowest level ever for the lake which could be beneficial.  High pike numbers can be detrimental to the entire fish community and especially walleye management.   Another positive was an improvement in the size structure in the pike population from the last survey.  Three of the northern pike exceeded 24 inches compared to none in the last survey.  Neascus was common on the northern pike which may not be appealing to some fishermen.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that usually resides in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Filleting the fish will usually remove most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans can not be infested. <br> \n     Despite stocking by the Long Lake Association, the walleye population has shown no improvement in abundance.  The 2006 catch rate was the lowest ever for the lake, but the fish were nice size.  If anglers are lucky enough to hook into a walleye, chances are that it will be a nice one as the average size seen in the survey was 21 inches or about 3 pounds.  Yellow perch have also been stocked by both the DNR and lake association in an attempt to increase abundance of the perch which could improve northern pike size and survival of the walleye.  This strategy has not worked either.  The bass population in the lake has remained relatively stable over the years.  The average size in spring night electrofishing was about 13 inches or 1.5 pounds with bass up to 18 inches measured. <br> \n     A spring assessment in 2006 targetted the panfish in the lake since they provide an important fishery.  These spring nettings tend to exhibit a better picture of the adult bluegill population than the summer surveys do.  Long Lake's bluegill population appears to be dominated by small fish as the average size caught in the spring assessment was only 5 inches, however, there were some fish up to 8 inches measured.  The black crappie population does not appear to be that impressive based on our sampling as few of the fish in either of the nettings exceeded 9 inches in length.  Three other species of panfish in the lake are green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n     Two species, brown and yellow, of bullheads were found in the lake with the yellow bullheads being the more abundant.  Both bullheads species had quality fish over 12 inches.  Bowfin or dogfish are also present.  This fish can provide quite a fight for an angler and are known to be efficient predators on small bluegills. <br> \n     Protecting Long Lake's extensive emergent vegetation beds should be a priority of the lake association and lakeshore owners.  Not only does the vegetation provide valuable habitat for the fish and wildlife, it also removes excess nutrients from the water and protects the shoreline from erosion.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to keep grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Poorly maintained septics can be a significant source of nutrients to a lake leading to algae blooms and excessive weed growth.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest and return the larger fish of a species to the water to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Harvesting small pike can reduce predation on the yellow perch, bass, and juvenile walleye, improving survival of those species.</p>",

A lake survey was also scheduled for the lake in late August that would use only gillnets to evaluate the gamefish population since summer trapnets tend to be ineffective at sampling large panfish.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and lifted two times for a total of 12 net lifts in the 2006 panfish assessment.  All of the gamefish, black crappies, and a subsample of bluegills were measured in the assessment.  Scales were taken from the bluegills and crappies for to provide age and growth data.   <br> \n    A total of 524 bluegills between 3.2 and 8.2 inches were netted in the 2006 spring assessment.  This was a better sample size than the 189 bluegills that were captured in the 2000 panfish assessment comprised of 18 net lifts.  Modal length for the 2006 catch was 5.5 - 6 inches with a mean length of 5.2 inches and 8% (n=40) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  Fish in the 2000 assessment measured from 3 - 8.5 inches in length with a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches, mean length of 5.5 inches, and 8% (n=15) of the fish more than 7 inches in length.  Both trapnet catches fell short of the management goal of having at least 15% of the bluegill trapnet catch exceeding 7 inches.  Ages 4 - 11 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with slow growth being shown in Ages 4 and 5 and normal growth thereafter. <br> \n    The 2006 summer gillnets were more effective at sampling black crappies than the spring assessment although the fish were smaller.  Crappies in the gillnet catch (n=23) were between 4.3 to 8.7 inches with a modal length of 4 - 4.5 inches and mean length of 5.8 inches.  In the spring assessment the crappies (n=11) measured between 7.7 to 10.8 inches in length.  Modal length for that sample was 7.5 - 8 inches with a mean length of 8.5 inches and 18% (n=2) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  The crappies catches in the 2000 nettings were similar with 26 being caught in the spring effort and 28 in the summer survey.  Fish in the spring ranged between 5.1 to 9.2 while the summer catch were between 4.3 - 9.1 inches.  Modal length for the spring catch was 7 - 7.5 inches with a mean length of 7.1 inches and 11% (n=3) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  Modal length for the summer catch was 6 - 6.5 inches with a mean length of 6.9 inches and only 4% (n=1) of the fish more than 9 inches in length.  Ages 1, 2, 4, and 5 were represented in the 2006 summer survey and and Ages 4, 5, and 7 in the spring assessment.  The 2002 year class accounted for 64% of the spring crappie catch while in the summer survey year classes were fairly equal in representation.  The fish displayed normal growth in both catches. <br> \n     Other species captured in the 2006 panfish assessment included 4 largemouth bass between 5.6 and 8.4 inches, 9 northern pike between 8 and 20.9 inches, and 2 walleye, 22.5 and 24.2 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were three other species of panfish that were sampled.  Two species of bullhead, brown and yellow, were captured along with bowfin (dogfish). <br> \n     Spring trapnets have proven to be an effective method for evaluating the bluegill population in Long Lake but have provided little information on the black crappies.  Other methods or time periods may have to be tried targeting that species.  <br> \n     An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

BULLHEADS are down in this year's survey with yellows' dominating the catch.  BLUEGILL and PUMPKINSEED catches were both lower in this survey with about 1/2 state average numbers and 1/3 average size.  LARGEMOUTH BASS were not sampled in the last survey, but are present in at least average numbers with good spawning sites and natural reproduction sampled.  BLACK CRAPPIES are present in twice the state average numbers and are of average size.  YELLOW PERCH were sampled in the 400' seine, but almost absent from catches in other gear.  WALLEYE: 3 year classes were sampled, they were in good condition.  There was a 10 pound walleye caught this year which probably came from the 1968 stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a small (120 acres), moderately fertile lake with good waterquality.  Aquatic vegetation provides fish with abundant cover and spawning habitatfor northern pike and sunfish is plentiful.  Shoreline development is fairly heavyand the lake receives moderate recreational use and fishing pressure.     Northern pike numbers have remained fairly stable and continue to be normalcompared with lakes similar to Long Lake.  The size structure of pike has improvedsomewhat since the last survey (1989) however growth rates remain slow for pikeless than four years old.  Northern pike larger than 24 inches accounted for 20%of the pike sampled in the lake survey and 25% from the ice-out netting.  Mostanglers catch small northerns but pike over 5 pounds are more common now thanduring the 1980s.  Anglers are encouraged to keep small pike (less than 21 inches)to improve both quality of the pike population and overall fish community balance.     Long Lake has historically had low numbers of yellow perch.  The yellow perchpopulation has improved somewhat in the latest survey but remains below desiredlevels.  Low adult perch abundance is a significant limiting factor on Long Lakebecause large predators rely on perch or an alternative prey base for good growth. The average length of perch caught in the spring ice-out netting was 4.3 inches. Growth rates were slow for all ages.  Intensive predation may be limiting survivalof larger perch and selecting for slow growing individuals.     Long Lake has a history of poor walleye fishing despite regular stockingbetween 1981 and 1989.  Walleye stocking failed to produce good fishing and wasdiscontinued after 1989.  A sample of eight walleyes was caught during the ice-outnetting.  Walleyes ranged in size from 18 to 25 inches and growth rates were good. The summer survey showed that walleye abundance is within the normal range forlake's of its type and walleye numbers have remained similar to the last threesurveys.  Walleyes sampled in the 1994 summer survey were between 18 and 27 inchescompared to 14 to 25 inches in the 1989 survey.     The largemouth bass population appears to be at moderate levels and anglersreport fairly good success.  A total of 38 bass were caught in the combined samplefrom spring electrofishing and ice-out netting with bass ranging in size from  7.7to 18.6 inches.  Four bass caught during the spring sampling were over 18 inchesin length, indicating the potential for a high quality bass fishery.     Bluegills are present in moderate numbers but small sunnies are commonlycaught by anglers.  Forty-six bluegills larger than 7 inches were measured in thespring ice-out netting which indicates the lake can produce large sunfish.  Growthwas slow for the bluegills sampled in the summer survey and normal for the largerbluegills sampled in the spring ice-out netting.     Black crappie abundance is within the normal range for the lake class. Crappie fishing is sporadic with occasional fish over 9 inches.  Crappies 4.6 to10.7 inches were measured in the summer survey and eleven crappies between 9.4 and10.9 inches were measured in the spring ice-out assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake (DOW# 49-0015-00; Lake Class 29) is a 126 acre lake located near Pine Center, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the east shore. Long Lake has 2.33 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 29; lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake is a multi-species lake that can offer a little something for every angler. Long Lake should be of most interest to panfish anglers. Good numbers of Bluegill were sampled with many over 7 inches and fish up to 10 inches. Also there were good numbers of Black Crappie with over half larger than 9 inches and fish up to 12 inches. While not many Northern Pike and Walleye were sampled biologists did see some larger fish. Largemouth Bass were similar to past surveys with low numbers, but most fish were good sized. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Long Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A panfish assessment was conducted on Long Lake in early June to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  A scheduled summer survey with gill nets was done in late August to evaluate the game fish populations.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice in the 2012 panfish assessment.  All fish were identified and measured with scales taken from the black crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.  Previous panfish assessments were conducted in 2006 and 2000. <br> \n     The 2012 panfish assessment caught 25 black crappie (2.1/TN) between 5 and 10.9 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches.  The 2012 catch displayed the most desirable sample size structure of the three panfish assessments.   Modal length for the sample was 9.5 - 10 inches with 48% (n=12) exceeding nine inches and 8% (n=2) more than 10 inches in length.  Ages 2 through 7 and 9 were represented in the 2012 crappie catch.  The dominant year class was from 2010 (Age 2) which accounted for 32% (n=8) of the sample.  Ages 2, 4, 5, and 6 displayed normal growth while the other age groups showed slow growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n     Fewer crappie were caught in the 2006 assessment, n=11 or 0.9/TN.  The fish measured from 7.7 to 10.7 inches in length.  Mean length was longer (8.5 inches) than in the other two assessments, but modal length was shorter than in 2012 (7.5 - 8 inches).  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 18% (n=2) of the catch with 9% (n=1) more than ten inches.  A strong year class from 2002 (Age 4), dominated the catch, comprising 64% (n=7) of the sample.   <br> \n     The crappie catch in 2000 was similar to 2012 in number (n=26) but the catch rate was lower, 1.4/TN.  The sample displayed the least desirable size structure of the three assessments.   Fish were between 5.1 and 9.2 inches in length with a mean length of 7.1 inches.  Modal length was 7 - 7.5 inches and only 12% (n=3) of the crappie were greater than nine inches in length.   <br> \n     Black crappie gill net catches have been within lake class 29 interquartiles of 1 - 4.8/GN the last three summer surveys.    Eleven crappie (1.8/GN) were caught in the 2012 summer gill nets while 23 (3.8/GN) were caught in 2006 and 28 (4.7/GN) in 2000.  All of the samples have been dominated by smaller fish although the 2012 survey caught fish up to 10.1 inches.  Mean length has ranged from 5.8 to 6.9 inches in the summer surveys.  The 2012 summer assessment had the highest catch of crappie exceeding nine inches, n=2 (18%) while none were caught in 2006 and one (4%) in 2000.   <br> \n     One alternative method for sampling black crappie may be spring electrofishing.  While conducting the spring largemouth bass electrofishing in 2012, twenty black crappie were also netted.  The fish ranged from 8.5 to 11.1 inches in length with a mean length of 9.8 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 9.5 - 10 inches with 85% (n=17) of the catch exceeding nine inches and 40% (n=8) more than ten inches in length.   Together spring electrofishing and spring panfish assessments provide a composite sample for evaluating a wider range of black crappie sizes and ages.  <br> \n     Bluegill catches have varied in the three spring panfish assessments.  The 2012 assessment netted 247 bluegill (20.6/TN) that ranged from 2.4 to 8.7 inches in length with a mean length of 6.7 inches.   The sample size structure of the 2012 catch was the most desirable of the three assessments with a modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches and 48% (n=118) of the bluegill exceeding seven inches and 8% (n=19) more than eight inches in length.   Ages 1 through 9 were represented in the sample.   Two year classes from 2007 (24%) and 2005 (23%) comprised almost half of the catch.   The majority of the age groups exhibited fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n     The 2006 panfish assessment had the highest bluegill catch, n=524 or 43.7/TN and the least desirable sample size structure.   Fish caught measured from 3.2 to 8.2 inches in length with a mean length of 5.2 inches.  Modal length was 5.5 - 6 inches with 8% (n=41) more than seven inches and 0.2% (n=1) exceeding eight inches.   <br> \n     The smallest panfish catch was 189 bluegill (10.5/TN) in 2000.  The fish were from 3.1 to 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 5.5 inches.   Modal length was 6 - 6.5 inches with 8% (n=15) exceeded seven inches and 0.5% (n=1) more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n     Summer gill nets have not produced many bluegill and few fish have been over seven inches with no eight inch plus fish caught.   Summer trap nets also were not very effective at sampling bluegill.  The highest catch was 151 bluegill (18.9/TN) in 1994 while the previous three summer surveys from 1973 to 1989 caught less than 52 fish.   Like with most summer trap nets, the catches were dominated by smaller fish.  </p>",
