Black crappie and bluegill are the two most sought after species. Nearly 70% of the black crappies sampled during the survey were larger than 8 inches, while over 25% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 7 inches. The walleye population, while sampled in lower numbers than previous surveys, is still within the normal range for this lake. 68% of the walleyes sampled exceeded 20 inches. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every odd numbered year at a rate of 2 pounds per litoral acre. This is twice the normal rate stocked throughout the state. This is a quarter of a pound per acre over the previous rate. Northern pike numbers have also dropped but are still within their normal range. 60% of the pike sampled were 25 inches or longer. A strong forage base made up of yellow perch and white suckers has helped led to above average size gamefish. A few bonus perch over 10 inches are available to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a productive 591-acre lake located in north-central Scott County.  It has a connection to Upper Prior Lake which is downstream to the northeast, though the connection is not navigable.  Maximum depth is 37 feet and the littoral zone (<15 ft) covers 49% of the lake area.  Nutrients from the watershed reduce water quality and contribute to significant algae blooms in the summer. A standard population assessment was conducted during late July 2012 to characterize the fish community.  Population assessments have been completed every other year since 1996.         <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, walleye relative abundance (2.8/gill net) was lower than the previous assessment in 2010 (5.3/net).  Despite a lower catch than previous years, the 2.8/net in 2012 was near the median compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye abundance has varied over time.  Gill-net catch has ranged from 3 to 10.5/net between 1996 and 2010, averaging 6.4/net.  The size structure of the population was high, where all walleye in gill nets were between 14.0 and 19.4 inches (mean = 16.3 inches), and 71% were between 15 and 19.4 inches.  Smaller 7.0 to 9.5-inch, age-1 walleye were sampled in the trap nets.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Walleye were 15.0 inches by age 3 and 18.7 inches by age 5.  All walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a low probability of natural reproduction.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has been increasing over the previous 3 assessments. The 5.2/gill net sampled in 2012 was moderately high and was the highest since 1996.  Pike abundance from 1996 to 2010 averaged 2.8/net and ranged from 0.83 to 5.7/net.  The population is composed of a large proportion of small, (less than 21 inches) young individuals.  The size structure of the population is low.  Twenty-three percent were 21 inches or longer and 6% were 28 inches or longer.  Northern pike in gill nets averaged 20.1 inches and 1.85 lbs, with the largest measuring 31.5 inches and 6.64 lbs.  Ages ranged from 2 to 6.  The 2009 year class made up 62% of the sample and accounted for the majority of the 16- to 19-inch fish.    <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment was conducted in September 2012 to characterize the largemouth bass population.  In 1 hour and 57 minutes of daytime boat electrofishing, two netters collected 44 largemouth bass at a rate of 22.5/hour.  Average length and weight were 8.6 inches and 0.42 pounds, with the largest measuring 16.0 inches and 2.58 lbs.  Size structure of the sampled population was small where 11% were 12 inches or longer and 2% were 15 inches or longer.  Ages ranged from 1 to 6.  Seventy-seven percent were relatively evenly distributed among ages 2 through 4.  Growth was slow when compared to the statewide average.   <br> \nLargemouth bass reached 9.1 inches by age 3 and 14 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were abundant in both the gill nets (39.8/net) and trap nets (12.5/net).  Despite high abundance, catch in both gear types has decreased over time.  Gill net catch was the lowest since 2006 and trap net catch was the lowest since 2004.  Between 1996 and 2010, gill net catch has averaged 44.8/net and trap net catch has averaged 24.1/net.  With both gear types combined, black crappie size structure was balanced.  Thirty-seven percent were 8 inches or longer and 3% were 10 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight were 7.0 inches and 0.28 lbs with the largest measuring 10.8 inches and 0.75 lbs.  Ages ranged from 1 to 6.  Forty-nine percent were age 2.  Growth was fast when compared to the statewide average.   <br> \nBlack crappie were 7.9 inches by age 3 and 9.9 inches by age 6.        <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population was low in abundance and had a small size structure.  Trap net catch (9.9/ net) was near the 25th percentile compared to other similar lakes.  Over the previous 5 assessments (2004-2010), bluegill abundance was low as well, averaging 6.0/trap net.  The majority of bluegill were less than six inches long (77%); however there was evidence of larger bluegill in the system as 3.8% were larger than 8 inches and the largest sampled was 9.2 inches.  Mean length and weight from trap nets was 4.7 inches and 0.10 lbs.  Ages ranged from 1 to 6 and 60% were age 2.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.   <br> \nBluegill were 6.4 inches by age 3, and 7.3 inches by age 5.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch relative abundance was moderately high (17.5/gill net) in 2012.  Catch was higher than the two previous assessments (4.5 and 2.3/net), however it was below the long-term average of 25.1/net from 1996-2010.  The size structure of the population was balanced where 52% were 8 inches or longer and 2% were 10 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight from gill nets was 7.8 inches and 0.23 lbs.  The largest measured was 10.2 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 4.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Yellow perch were 9.2 inches by age 3.      <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled were black bullhead, brown bullhead, common carp, green sunfish, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted in 2012.   Using backpack electrofishing and seining, 15 species were sampled including Johnny darter, black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, spotfin shiner, tadpole madtom, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment (including gill nets and trap nets).  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  Upper Prior Lake scored 47.9 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Spring Lake.  Walleye abundances are at their highest since the 1993 survey.  But they are, on average, smaller, and younger than they were in the 2000 survey.  This change is primarily being influenced by the recruitment of a strong year-class of 3 year-old fish (1999 year-class), which made up 66% of the sample.  These fish were stocked as fingerlings as were other year-classes, as there is no evidence to support the occurrence of natural reproduction.  The catch of 10 per gillnet is well above and 75th percentile levels for comparable lakes.  Average length and weight is 18.3 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Average weight is just below 75th percentile levels.  Twenty-seven percent of the sample was larger than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 26.8 inches and 6.7 pounds.  The average age decreased from 5.5 years in 2000 to 4.0 years in 2002.  Growth rates are above average for walleye in this type of lake as they have been in past surveys.Northern Pike are typically not very abundant but large in Spring Lake.  The pike abundance fell for the third survey in a row, and pike are smaller than they were in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 1.7 pike per gillnet is just above 25th percentile levels for comparable lakes.  Seven different year-classes of fish are represented in the sample of the population.  Average length and weight is 21.7 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Average weight is near median levels.  An impressive 67% of pike were over 28 inches.  The largest individual was 30.2 inches and 6.5 pounds.  The average age increased from 4.6 years in 2000 to 4.8 years in 2002.  Growth rates fell to about average for pike in this lake type.Some explanation for the slowing of pike growth may lie in the decrease in yellow perch abundance.  They have fallen from 73 per gillnet in the 2000 survey to 23 per net, which is near 75th percentile levels.  Growth rates are above average.  White sucker were also sampled in gillnets in lower numbers than in the last survey but still in above 75th percentile levels.  Golden shiners were another forage species present in the catch.Black crappie abundances are at historical highs.  Both the trapnet catch of 67.4 per net and the gillnet catch of 83 per net is well above 75th percentile levels.  The 2002 trapnet sample mean length and weight were 7.4 inches and 0.22 pounds.  Fifteen percent of the trapnet sample was over 8 inches long, however, the absolute numbers of large crappie sampled was large for a metropolitan area lake.  It has been a very popular fishery in recent years.  The largest individual sampled was 10.6 inches and 0.66 pounds.  The population is represented by many year-classes, especially 1997 and 1999-2001.  Growth rates are above average as they were in the last survey.  Smaller numbers of white crappies were sampled but they are a popular component of the fishery.Bluegill abundances have not changed considerably from the 2000 survey, but they are larger.  The catch of 31.4 per trapnet is between median and 75th percentile levels.  Average length and weight is 7.0 inches and 0.28 pounds.  An impressive 67% of population is longer than 7 inches.  However, there are not many longer than 7.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.9 inches and 0.55 pounds.  Many year-classes were represented in the catch but the 1999 year-class (age 3) was a large component.  Growth rates are above average for this lake class as they were in the last survey.  Shoreline seine hauls yielded a high number of young-of-the-year bluegill indicating a potentially successful year for natural reproduction.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets but they were sampled in above 75th percentile levels in trapnets.  A moderate number of young-of-the-year were sampled in seine hauls.  No electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass was conducted this year.Common carp were sampled between median and 75th percentile levels in trapnets.  In an effort to improve water quality, the Prior Lake-Spring Lake Watershed District hired commercial fishermen to seine for carp in January of 2002.  They harvested approximately 24,000 pounds of carp, a moderate catch by their standards.Yellow and black bullheads were sampled in moderate to high numbers for this lake type, but no brown bullheads were observed as in past surveys.  White bass, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also present.</p>",

The 2006 catch, 10.5 fish/net, was well represented by the 2001 (35%) and 2003 (55%) year-classes.  Average length and weight was up from 16.5 inches and two pounds in 2004 to 18.21 inches and 2.27 pounds.  No year-classes other than stocked year-classes were observed; therefore, natural reproduction was assumed to be nil. Walleye stocked in 2003 and 2005 were purchased from private vendors as part of the Accelerated Walleye Program.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch was up from 2.1 fish/gillnet in 2004 to 2.8 fish/gillnet in 2006.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 25 inches and four pounds to 25.9 inches and 4.5 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch increased 74% from 18.9 fish/gillnet in 2004 to 32.8 fish/gillnet in 2006.  Average length and weight was 7.7 inches and 0.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed included: black crappie, bluegill, bullhead (black and yellow), carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, largemouth bass, and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Growth of this species is very good due to the abundance of forage such as yellow perch, golden shiners, and black bullheads. Individual walleyes up to 27.6 inches were present.Bluegills and pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in abundant numbers. The average size of both species was less than 6.0 inches. Black crappies were also very abundant. This species had an average length of 7.4 inches with individuals up to 12.2 inches present.The northern pike population was sampled within normal levels for this type of lake. The average length caught during the survey was 23.1 inches. Over 20% of the northern pike were larger than 25 inches, and fish up to 35.7 inches were sampled.Three species of bullheads, black, brown, and yellow were sampled. Black bullheads were the most abundant and averaged 12.4 inches in length. Yellow bullheads and brown bullheads were each sampled in low abundance.</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 13 stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 sampling site.  Nearshore sampling components captured 18 species including 1 species that is considered intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and 3 species considered tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in 2015 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (IBI) that describes the overall health of the fish community.  The Fish IBI score for Spring Lake is well below expectations compared to similar lakes.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a 592-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet. Spring is located southwest of the City of Prior Lake. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp on the southwest side of the lake. Spring is a fertile lake, and in the summertime, dissolved oxygen levels become depleted in deeper water and fish will avoid the area.  In 2021, dissolved oxygen was low in depths greater than 16 feet.  Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Spring Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring is primarily managed for Walleye, and also holds healthy populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. Management includes Walleye stocking every other year. A Standard Survey including trap nets, gill nets, and boat electrofishing was conducted in 2021 to monitor the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, Walleye numbers were high for this area and a broad range of sizes of fish were caught.  Lengths were between 11 and 26 inches, and fish were distributed about evenly through the lengths.  Spring Lake is one of the better Walleye fisheries in the metro, and anglers could find a good return on their effort here.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Spring Lake, however they were sampled in low numbers and of modest size in 2021.  Nineteen fish were sampled by nighttime boat electrofishing in the spring, and size ranged between 8 and 16 inches, with an average fish length of 13 inches.  Although abundance of bass was low in 2021, the catch was similar to the previous bass survey in 2015, when 35 fish were sampled by boat electrofishing.  The bass population in this lake appears stable, at a lower abundance level than other lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was good, with the largest fish measuring over 37 inches. Almost three-quarters of the sampled fish were larger than 24 inches, which makes this population well-suited to the southern-zone pike regulation, allowing harvest of 2 fish greater than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets and trap nets, and the catch was high.  Average size of fish was on the small side; only 8% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.  The high abundance of this population is likely limiting growth as the fish compete with one another for forage.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were about average for this area, in 2021, and size was modest.  Average length was 5 inches, and only 9% of the sampled fish were larger than 7 inches. Although low water clarity benefits species such as Walleye, Bluegill populations are likely negatively affected by this factor. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were also about average for this area, and size was small. Yellow Perch are seldom targeted by anglers on Spring, but they are an important prey species for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a 591-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet. Spring Lake is located southwest of the City of Prior Lake, in northern Scott County. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the southwest side of the lake. The lake is subject to periodic, small-scale fish die-offs associated with stressful temperature and/or oxygen levels. Crappie and sunfish are the species most often affected, and fish population levels and fish-consumption safety are not comparably worse than other regional lakes. Neither Eurasian Watermilfoil nor Zebra mussels has been found in Spring Lake, but the lake should be considered as an \"infested water\" due to its connection to Upper Prior Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring is primarily managed for Walleye, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. Management includes scheduled walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years; other sizes/ages are substituted if insufficient fingerlings are available. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Spring Lake during the week of 7/30/2018 to assess the fishery. Spring is a highly productive lake with brown-stained water and low clarity, measured at 3 feet, with low oxygen below 14 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Spring Lake were high (6.3/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. Average length of Walleye was 21.3 inches with the largest measured at 26.4 inches. Over 97% of Walleye sampled were greater than 17 inches. Walleye growth here was fast compared to the statewide average. Spring Lake is one of the better Walleye fisheries in the metro and anglers should find an abundance of Walleye with desirable sizes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at moderate numbers (3.3/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was 27.8 inches, with the largest measured at 35.0 inches. The majority of pike were large, with 85% of fish greater than 24 inches. This pike population is well-suited to the new statewide Northern Pike regulation (effective 2018), which allow harvest of 2 fish greater than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (35.3/net) and trap nets (23.7/net), with both gear exceeding the average catch of similar lakes. There were 400 Black Crappie sampled, with an average length of 7.3 inches and the largest measured at 9.8 inches. High numbers of fish are likely limiting growth of Black Crappie, with only 22% of fish sampled being greater than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at moderate numbers with 8.3/net. There were 75 Bluegill sampled, with an average length of 6.0 inches and the largest measured at 7.5 inches. Although low water clarity benefits species such as Walleye, Bluegill populations are likely negatively affected by this factor. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were high with 37.8/net. Average size of Yellow Perch was 6.8 inches, with the largest measured at 8.5 inches. Due to small size structure, Yellow Perch is seldom utilized as a sport fish here. Despite providing limited fishing opportunity, Yellow Perch provide an important forage component for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Spring Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2018 survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a 580 acre lake located just southwest of Prior Lake.  Compared with other lakes in class 24, Spring displayed average walleye abundance.   However, abundance decreased compared to past surveys.  Walleye averaged 18.0 inches in length.  Average weight increased more than one half pound to 2.6, well above average.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remained at below average abundance.  This is typical for Spring Lake.  Average length and weight for northern pike were 28.6 inches and 4.8 pounds, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance and average weight increased since the last survey.  Both are above average for a class 24 lake.  Largemouth bass averaged 1.5 pounds and 17.2 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance increased from the last survey in 2004.  Spring Lake has consistently displayed a high abundance of black crappie compared to other class 24 lakes.  Black crappie averaged 6.5 inches and less than one-quarter pound.  Only 1.5% of sampled black crappie were larger than 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth bluegill abundance and average length increased since the 2004 survey.  Bluegill abundance is still low for this type of lake.  Nearly 90% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Yellow perch abundance remained within the normal range.  Average weight of yellow perch decreased slightly, but lies within the normal range as well.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets showed a high abundance of white sucker, similar to the 2004 survey.  White sucker averaged 17.1 inches and 2.2 pounds.   Golden shiner were sampled in average abundance.  Common carp abundance decreased since the 2004 survey.  Black bullhead abundance increased significantly, but remained in the normal range for a class 24 lake.  Abundance of yellow bullhead decreased.    <br> \n <br> \nOn June 17th, 2008 a fish kill was reported.  An unknown number of black crappie reportedly washed up on shore.  No investigation was conducted due to a lack of specific information.  June fish kills are typically bacterial-related.  Usually columnaris, a commonly occurring and natural bacteria, can result in a fish kill.  These events often coincide with the first rapid warm up of late spring or early summer.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a 591 acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet, located in north central Scott County.  Spring Lake provides ample recreational opportunities.  Fishing and boating are very popular.  Water quality in Spring Lake is poor, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 12 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing walleye and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 12 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Boaters should also keep in mind, new laws require the drain plug be removed while on public roadways.  <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Spring Lake is expanding.  Walleye average length was 16.7 inches.  Average weight was 2.10 pounds, above average compared to similar lakes.  Abundance was above average and showed an increase compared to the previous survey.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years.  Nearly 70% of sampled fish were young fish, either age one or three.    Northern pike numbers were on par with historic averages for Spring Lake.  In the 2010 population assessment largemouth bass abundance increased compared to past surveys, and is average for lakes similar to Spring Lake.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.  One 14.8 inch adult white bass was sampled.  White bass were not seen in Spring Lake before 2000.  Since then, they have been sampled in three different surveys.    <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Spring Lake.  Black crappie abundance is high.  Few large fish were sampled, but the average size has improved since the 2008 survey.  Average length was 7.8 inches.  Bluegill abundance decreased slightly and is below the average range for this type of lake.  Spring Lake bluegill average size is very good, over 6.5 inches.  Over 70% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Nearly two-thirds were 7 inches or larger.  Yellow perch abundance increased to a level within the average range.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average.  Average length was 6.8 inches.   Pumpkinseed were sampled at a low abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in below average numbers.   Common carp abundance increased slightly since the 2008 survey, but remains below average.  Black and yellow bullhead were sampled at below average abundance.  White sucker abundance was high and average weight was above average.       <br> \n <br> \nOn May 26th, 2010 a resident reported dead fish on the south shore of Spring Lake.  Given the time of year, water temperature conditions at the time and recent past springtime fish kills, a bacterial-caused die-off is the prime suspect.  In 2005 columnaris was confirmed as the cause of a similar fish kill.  For fertile lakes that warm rapidly, this phenomenon is common.  Based on biennial fish population assessments, these die offs have not caused noticeable declines in Spring Lake fish populations.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Spring Lake walleye population is within the normal range for abundance when compared to similar lakes. Over 40% of the walleyes measured during the summer survey exceeded 20 inches. Growth is very good with the 1993 and 1995 year classes being the most abundant. The average length from the 1993 sample was 21.6 inches and was 18.3 inches from the 1995 sample.         Northern pike numbers are also within the normal range of abundance. Their average length and weight sampled from the gillnets was 21.8 inches and 2.6 pounds. This species also has a very good growth rate. A total of 25% of the northern pike handled during the survey were over 25 inches in length.        A strong forage base of white suckers, yellow perch, and golden shiners supports the walleye and northern pike populations.        Bluegills, while being very abundant, measure only 6.3 inches on the average in the trapnets sample. Only approximately 9% of the bluegills measured were over 7 inches in length. Black crappies are also very abundant, but are rather small. The largest catch was from the gillnets, and they only averaged 6 inches in length. From a total of 486 black crappies caught during the survey only 5 exceeded 10 inches in length. White crappies were sampled in low abundance.        All three species of bullheads native to Minnesota were sampled in Spring Lake. Black bullheads and yellow bullheads were each caught at normal ranges of abundance. Brown bullheads were sampled exclusively in the gillnets. Young of the year bullheads also provide a good quality forage for walleyes and northern pike.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dominated by the 1999 and 2001 year classes, walleye abundance was high for this lake class and were commonly 12-15 inches or 20-23 inches long.  Northern pike were not abundant and catches were similar to previous surveys.  Mean length and weight was 25 inches and 4 lbs.  Black crappie were less abundant but bigger than previous surveys.  In 2002, mean length and weight in gill nets was 6.9 inches and 0.18 lb., compared to a mean length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.34 lb. in 2004.  Almost 90% of the crappie sampled in gill nets were 8 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill abundance was not as high as 2002.  Mean length decreased from 7 inches in 2002 to only 4 inches in 2004.  This was probably due to the large number of age 1 bluegill sampled.  Yellow perch were in average abundance for this lake class, with decent size.  Mean weight was 0.26 lb. and mean length was 8.2 inches.  Over 60% of the yellow perch were over 8 inches.  Although not a good indicator of largemouth bass populations, bass caught in gill nets and trap nets (five bass total) had a mean length 14 inches and a mean weight of almost 2 lbs.     Black bullhead catch per gill net was half what was caught in 2002, but still within the normal range for this lake class.  Though not significantly, yellow bullhead catch in gill nets also declined from 2002.  White sucker catch per gill net increased from 4.1 per net in 2002 to 6.1 per net in 2004.  Golden shiner abundance was similar to 2002.  Other species sampled include one white bass and several common carp.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a productive 591-acre, Class 24 lake located in north-central Scott County.  It has a connection to Upper Prior Lake which is downstream to the northeast, though the connection is not navigable.    The maximum depth is 37 feet and the littoral zone (<15 ft) covers 49% of the lake area.  Spring is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, and secondarily for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  A Standard Survey was conducted during 2015 to assess the gamefish populations.  Standard Surveys have been completed every other year since 1996.         <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Walleye were moderately abundant.  The catch rate of 4.7 fish per gill net was between the median and 75th percentile for this Lake Class. The size structure of the population was skewed toward larger individuals; 89% of the fish exceeded 15 inches, and 11% of the fish exceeded 20 inches.  The average size of Walleye was 17.14 inches and 1.89 pounds, and the largest fish measured 23.0 inches and 5.0 pounds.  Walleye reached an average of 15.4 inches by age 2, and 21.1 inches by age 6.  All walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a low probability of natural reproduction.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime boat electrofishing was conducted in late May of 2015 to characterize the Largemouth Bass population.  In 1 hour and 36 minutes of electrofishing, 35 Largemouth Bass were collected at a rate of 21.7 per hour of on-time.   Average size of the fish was 13.2 inches and 1.45 pounds, with the largest measuring 18.4 inches and 3.6 lbs.  Size structure was skewed toward larger individuals; 71% of the fish exceeded 12 inches, and 20% of the fish exceeded 15 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was very low in 2015.  The catch rate of 0.67 fish per gill net was below the 25th percentile for this Lake Class.  The four fish sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 18.0 to 25.5 inches, with an average size of 22.3 inches and 2.52 pounds.  Two Northern Pike were sampled in the trap nets, measuring 16.3 and 18.9 inches.  Northern Pike abundance is typically low in Spring Lake, and the 2015 survey continued to document this.  <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill abundance was low and 2015; the catch rate of 10.3 fish per trap net, a value between the 25th percentile and median for this Lake Class.  Average size of fish was 5.8 inches and 0.19 pounds; 43% of the fish exceeded 7 inches.  The largest fish measured 7.8 inches and 0.37 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were abundant in both the gill nets (27.5 fish per net, exceeding the 75th percentile) and trap nets (11.7 fish per net, between median and 75th percentile).  Twenty-one percent of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Mean length and weight were 5.8 inches and 0.18 lbs with the largest fish measuring 11.0 inches and 0.71 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch relative abundance was extremely high in 2015.  The catch rate of 81.8 fish per gill net was almost three times the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The fish tended to be small; only 4% exceeded 8 inches.  The average size was 6.3 inches and 0.12 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, White Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
