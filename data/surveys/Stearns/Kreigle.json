                "narrative": "<p>Kreigle lake is a 126 acre lake located two miles south of Avon in Stearns County. The lake has excellent water quality and a very diverse aquatic plant community. There is no public access. Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are present. The lake was surveyed  in June 2010. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was similar to the last survey in 2000 and typical for lakes similar to Kreigle. The average size was 21 inches and 2.3 pounds; the largest northern pike caught was  35 inches. Northern pike growth was similar to other lakes statewide. The percentage of northern pike longer than 24 inches was 22%. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in May 2010 by daytime electrofishing. The catch rate was good and 20% of bass were larger than 15 inches. The average size was 11.3 inches and one pound; the largest bass was 18.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of bluegill increased from the 2000 survey, but was within the expected range for lakes similar to Kreigle. Bluegill were mostly small; the average length was 5.7 inches and the largest individual was 7.5 inches. Bluegill growth was slow compared to statewide averages. Bluegill grew to six inches in length in eight years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught in low numbers, as in previous surveys, but the average length (9.7 inches) and weight (0.5 lbs) were high. Growth was similar to statewide averages. <br> \nNo yellow perch were caught in 2010; previous surveys have found low numbers of yellow perch. Other species caught included: brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

Yellow Perch abundance was below the lower area quartile. Zero perch were sampled in the 1965 survey. Bluegill were caught at a rate of 39.2/trap net, average for the local area. Modal length group in the sample was 4.5-4.9 inches. Growth of Bluegill was also slow. Black Crappie abundance was low but was similar to the 1.0/trap net catch in 1965. Year classes 2-5 are represented and growth was average. Largemouth Bass appear to be abundant and were taken in trap nets at a rate of 1.2/trap net. In addition to trap nets, Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 23.5/hour by night electrofishing in the fall. Several year classes were represented and growth was average. Other species present in Kreigle Lake are Yellow and Brown Bullheads, and Bowfin. Yellow Bullhead were abundant at 12.5/trap net, similar to 14.4/trap net in 1965.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kriegle Lake is located in Stearns County, near the town of Avon.  It is a small lake of 126 acres, with a maximum depth of 66 feet.  The lake's excellent water quality supports a large number of aquatic plant species, more than any known in the area.  The clear water and abundant vegetation make Kriegle well-suited for bass, panfish, and northern pike.  A fisheries survey was conducted in 2000 to assess game fish populations.  Northern pike were also collected for a study of mercury contamination in Minnesota waters.In general, fish populations have appeared to change little since the previous survey in 1987, which may reflect the low angling pressure the lake receives.  Northern pike were caught in numbers typical of a lake like Kriegle.  Pike ranged in size from 11 to 31 inches, and averaged 2 pounds.  As with many of the small, clear lakes in the area with high pike populations, Kriegle Lake has few yellow perch, a favored prey of pike.  Largemouth bass numbers were average, and bass sampled ranged in size from 5.0 to 19.5 inches, with 39 percent of fish larger than 12 inches.  Bass grew at average rates, reaching 12 inches in five years.  The lake has excellent spawning conditions for bass, with aquatic plants and firm substrate along the shoreline.Bluegill abundance appeared to be within the range expected for a lake like Kriegle, although fish were generally small.  The largest bluegill caught during the survey was 7.9 inches, but most were less than 6 inches.  Few black crappie have been caught during surveys of Kriegle Lake, but their size has been above average.  In 2000, the largest crappie captured was 12.6 inches.  Growth rates of most fish species were slower than the state average, while black crappie grew somewhat faster.</p>",
