                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is located approximately 14 miles east of Ely and is accessible by a concrete ramp off the Fernberg Road.  It is a 367 acre lake with a maximum depth of 115 feet and mostly clear water.  Ojibway Lake is a two-story fishery with deep, cold, well oxygenated water capable of supporting a cold water fishery and a shallow, warmer, but still well oxygenated area capable of supporting a cool and warm water fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nThree dissolved oxygen profiles (western, middle, and eastern basins) were taken on Ojibway Lake on July 25, 2022.  All three basins showed thermal stratification with surface temperatures near 70 F and bottom temps all around 40 F.  On the western basin, the depth range ideal for supporting lake trout was 23 to 80 feet.  In the middle basin, the ideal depth range was 25 to 65 feet.  The eastern basin is not capable of supporting lake trout in the summer but water with oxygen levels capable of supporting most gamefish was retained to a depth of 23 feet. <br> \n <br> \nOjibway is a popular lake for recreation.  Its shorelines and islands are rimmed with tall white, red, and jack pine as well as stands of spruce and cedar.  There are some cabins and homes on the western basin and north shore of the middle basin, but the southern shore and much of the eastern side of the lake is US Forest Service land.  A few camp sites and an access on the south shore to Triangle Lake can provide a boundary waters feel without the need for a permit or other restrictions.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are mostly absent except for some shallow bays.    <br> \n <br> \nThe overall deep water gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 13.9 fish/net which was below average for the lake.  Yield was 8.4 lbs/net which was just above average.  Fish species sampled in deep water gill nets were cisco, lake trout, and norther pike.  The overall shallow water gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 10.0 fish/net which was the lowest on record for the lakes.  Yield was 16.6 lbs/net which was just above average.  Fish species sampled were northern pike, rock bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, cisco, white sucker, walleye, largemouth bass, and black crappie.  The overall trapnet catch rate for all fish combined was 18.0 fish/net which was right at the historic average for the lake.  Yield was 3.9 lbs/net which was just below average.  Fish species sampled were bluegill, rock bass, northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nLake trout numbers in Ojibway Lake have generally been low, but the 2022 lake trout catch of 0.5 fish/deep gill net was the highest catch rate since 2005.  Six lake trout were caught ranging from 9 to nearly 34 inches with an average of 25 inches.  None of these fish had clipped fins indicating all were naturally reproduced.  Stocking last occurred in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nThree walleye were sampled in the shallow water gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3 fish/net.  Catch rates for walleye have always been extremely low (0.0 to 0.2 fish/net) on Ojibway.  Lengths of these three walleye were 18, 19, and 20 inches.  These fish were 4, 7, and 7 years old respectively.  Although the sample size is small, the growth of these fish was quite good.  Walleye stocking began in 2017.  Only the four year old fish came from one of those stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike shallow water gillnet catch was 3.0 fish/net which was the highest on record for the lake.  Lengths ranged from 19 to 32 inches with an average of nearly 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTwelve smallmouth bass were sampled in shallow water gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3 fish/net which was the second highest on record for the lake.  The mean weight for shallow water gillnetted fish was 1.2 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 17 inches with an average of 12 inches.  Growth rates were fairly slow compared to other lakes with the average smallmouth taking four years to reach 8 inches long.  Ages ranged from 2 to 10 years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch rate was 13.4 fish/net.  This was very good compared to other similar lakes and right at the average when compared to past surveys on Ojibway.  Sizes ranged from 3 to 7 inches with an average of just over 5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch shallow gillnet catch was 1.1 fish/net which was the lowest on record for the lake.  Fish were small with an average weight of 0.1 pounds and lengths ranging from 6 to 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2022 (13.3 fish/deep gill net) were just below the average value for all investigations on the lake (14.3 fish/deep gill net).  The average weight was 0.3 pounds and sizes ranged from 7 to nearly 14 inches with an average of nearly 10 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This assessment consisted of eight deep (below 55 F) gillnets set to capture cold water fish populations and to evaluate the prior stocking of fin-clipped Gillis Lake strain lake trout yearlings.  The results of this gillnetting show fish populations dominated by high numbers of cisco and lake trout.  One northern pike and one splake (stocked in 1991) were also captured.  Of 58 lake trout captured, 33 were left-pelvic fin clipped yearlings that had been stocked two months previously and averaged 7.7\" at the time of capture.  Fifteen were right-pelvic fin clipped trout that had been stocked as yearlings in 1992 and averaged 10.2\" when captured at age 3+.  Four were left-pelvic fin clipped trout that had been stocked as yearlings in 1990 and averaged 11.6\" when captured at age 5+.  Five unclipped trout, averaging 20\" and all larger than the clipped trout, were also captured.  The largest trout was 37\" and weighed approximately 20 lbs.  No young, unclipped trout were captured.  Trout ages were partially corroborated by otoliths taken from ten fin-clipped fish, several from each stocking, and from four larger unclipped trout.  Five of the clipped trout had both otoliths crystallized and were impossible to read.  Several clipped trout had one otolith readable, and two had both otoliths readable.  The readable otoliths were judged hard to read but indicated that some of the trout that were determined to be age 3+ from the length-frequency may, in fact, be age 5+.  This would indicate that the extremely slow growth shown in the previous paragraph may be even slower!  The larger, older trout had clear otoliths that were still hard to read but which indicated slow (but somewhat improved) growth.  Most trout stomachs were empty (64%), but 16% contained Mysis relicta and 20 % contained fish, mostly sculpins.  The two trout captured that were over 18\" were released alive and their stomachs were not examined.Cisco sizes ranged from 7.5\" to 13.5\" and averaged 10.5\".   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very deep, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very clear and soft (low mineral content) water.   The trophic status of Ojibway Lake is between oligotrophic and mesotrophic. <br> \n <br> \nOjibway Lake was thermally stratified on 08/18/2009 with a surface temperature of 70 ?F and a bottom temperature of 41 ?F.  In the west basin of the lake, adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 36 ft where the temperature was 47 ?F.  Previous investigations have shown that in the central basin of the lake 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 40 ft where the temperature is 40-45 ?F.  In the eastern bay 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of only 14 ft where the temperature is 55 ?F.  Oxygen levels in cold water in 2001 were quite low in the west and central basins of Ojibway Lake, dropping below 5 ppm as shallow as 35 ft.  The initial fisheries lake survey in 1950 considered Ojibway Lake to be a marginal lake trout lake based on its water quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe major inlet to Ojibway Lake, from Triangle Lake, has a short and steep watercourse with log jams and the remnants of a beaver dam at the head.  The outlet, to Camp 20 Lake has a long, braided channel with a log jam at the head, the remnants of an old filter barrier downstream (built when Camp 20 Lake was being stocked with trout), and a cattail and grassy swamp area farther downstream.  While these barriers may prevent upstream fish movement, they do not prevent downstream fish movement, as demonstrated by the movement of splake from Ojibway Lake to Camp 20 Lake after a 1991 stocking, and by the sudden appearance of walleye in Ojibway Lake in the 2005 investigation, presumably migrating from Triangle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Ojibway Lake are mostly boulder, ledge rock, rubble, and silt.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft; shoreline fringe plants are the most abundant, but northern milfoil, white waterlilies, and various pondweeds are also present. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a public access with a concrete boat ramp on Ojibway Lake at the site of the old Deer Trail Lodge on the north side of the lake.  There were 49 private homes and cottages on the lake in 2005, up from 39 in 1981, 25 in 1969, and 5 in 1950.  All of these homes and cottages are on the north and west sides of the lake and comprise about 30 percent of the shoreline; the remainder of the shoreline is U.S. Forest Service land.  Many of the private homes and cottages were on Forest Service leased lots, but were recently privatized through a land exchange. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the 2009 assessment was to evaluate the survival and growth of stocked lake trout yearlings by using 12 deep gillnets set in or below the thermocline at depths ranging from 25 ft to 85 ft and in water temperatures of 41-59 ?F.  Sixteen previous investigations, dating back to 1950, each used 7-18 deep gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nDeep water fish populations in 2009 consisted of cisco, lake trout, and burbot.  Burbot, a common coldwater fish species in the area, were first observed in Ojibway Lake in the 2005 investigation when a 22 inch specimen was captured.  The lone burbot caught in 2009 was 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2009 (6.6/deep gillnet) were well below the median of all investigations on this lake (16.3/deep gillnet) and lower than the 2007 catch rate (16.4/deep gillnet).  Cisco sizes in 2009 averaged 10.1 inches, which was similar to sizes in previous catches on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2009 was 13.5 inches.  Ciscoes are a rich forage fish and are responsible for the large size of some northern pike and lake trout in Ojibway Lake.  Ojibway Lake is open for netting of bait-sized cisco under the ice each fall. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout numbers in Ojibway Lake have generally been low, and the 2009 lake trout catch rate of 0.2/deep gillnet was similar to catch rates in the past three investigations dating back to 2001 (range: 0.3-0.5/deep gillnet) but lower than the median of all investigations (0.6/deep gillnet).  The two lake trout caught in 2009 were age 7 (from the 2002 year class) and age 11 (from the 1998 year class).  Neither had fin clips that would indicate they were stocked.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3 which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very deep, have an irregular shoreline shape, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Ojibway Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class.Ojibway Lake stratifies in midsummer and retains enough oxygen to support trout (5 ppm) to a depth of about 50 ft, at which depth the water temperature is about 50 F, and retains marginal oxygen (2 ppm) to a depth of about 85 ft.  The small eastern basin has much poorer oxygen in deep water.  The inlet from Triangle Lake has a steep, rocky watercourse and the outlet to Camp 20 Lake has a rocky watercourse and a filter barrier, both of which limit the movement of fish upstream.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly ledgerock, boulder, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft; floatingleaf pondweed is the most common plant.The 1997 special assessment consisted of deep gillnets set in and below the thermocline to capture and evaluate the cold water fish in Ojibway Lake: lake trout and cisco.  The total catch of fish in 1997 (all species combined) of 18.7 fish/gillnet (8.6 lb/gillnet) was similar to the average catch of 17.4 fish/gillnet (8.6 lb/gillnet) in twelve previous deep gillnettings in Ojibway Lake dating back to 1950.  Also similar to previous gillnettings in this lake, most of the fish captured in 1997 were cisco.Cisco numbers in 1997 (16.9/gillnet) were similar to the average catch of 14.9/gillnet in previous deep gillnettings in this lake.  Cisco sizes in 1997 averaged 10\"; the largest was 14\".  Forty percent of the cisco examined had Trianophorus larvae in their muscle tissue.  Trianophorus is a common parasite of cisco that cannot infect humans and is killed by cooking.Lake trout numbers in 1997 (1.7/gillnet) were similar to the average catch of 1.5/gillnet in previous deep gillnettings in this lake.  Lake trout numbers in 1992 (4.6/gillnet) and 1994 (7.3/gillnet) were higher than in 1997, but most of the trout captured in those nettings were yearlings which had been stocked a few months prior to netting.Every-other-year stocking of fin clipped Gillis Lake strain lake trout yearlings began in 1990.  Ten of the 19 lake trout examined in 1997 were clipped, stocked fish.  Three of the unclipped trout had deformed earbones, indicating that they were probably stocked trout which had regrown their clipped fins.  The three largest trout could have been stocked prior to the initiation of fin clipping in 1990.Growth of younger lake trout, stocked and naturally produced, appeared to be somewhat slow:  9\" at age two, 12\" at age four, 15\" at age five, and 16\" at age six.  Two of the larger fish were 23\" at age eight.Half of the lake trout stomachs examined were empty, while 22 percent contained fish remains and 28 percent contained insect remains.  No diseases or parasites were observed in the lake trout.In summary, lake trout are present in low-to-moderate numbers and in a good range of sizes.  At least half, and perhaps three-quarters of the trout were stocked.  Growth of younger trout is somewhat slow, as would be expected in a lake with an abundant population of cisco.  Cisco are very effecient invertebrate predators, and compete with young trout for zooplankton, insect larvae, and other invertebrates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very deep, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Ojibway Lake is oligotrophic-to-mesotrophic.Ojibway Lake was thermally stratified on 07/18/2005 with surface temperatures of 77 F and bottom temperatures of 40 F.  In the west and central basins of the lake, adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of about 46 ft, where the temperature was 42 F, and adequate oxygen for warm water fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to depths of 95 ft in the west basin and 65 ft in the central basin.  In the small east basin of the lake, 5 ppm oxygen was retained only to a depth of 14 ft, where the temperature was 55 F, and 2 ppm oxygen was retained only to a depth of 16 ft, where the temperature was 49 F.  Oxygen levels in cold water in 2001 were quite low in the west and central basins of Ojibway Lake, dropping below 5 ppm as shallow as 35 ft.  The initial fisheries lake survey in 1950 considered Ojibway Lake to be a marginal lake trout lake based on its water quality.The major inlet to Ojibway Lake, from Triangle Lake, has a short and steep watercourse with log jams and the remnants of a beaver dam at the head.  The outlet, to Camp 20 Lake has a long, braided channel with a log jam at the head, the remnants of an old filter barrier downstream (built when Camp 20 Lake was being stocked with trout), and a cattail and grassy swamp area farther downstream.  While these barriers may prevent upstream fish movement, they do not prevent downstream fish movement, as demonstrated by the movement of splake from Ojibway Lake to Camp 20 Lake after a 1991 stocking, and by the sudden appearance of walleye in Ojibway Lake in this investigation, presumably from Triangle Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Ojibway Lake are mostly boulder, ledge rock, rubble, and silt.  Aquatic plants in Ojibway Lake are sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft; shoreline fringe plants are the most abundant, but northern milfoil, white waterlilies, and various pondweeds are also present.There is a public access with a concrete boat ramp on Ojibway Lake, created at the site of the old Deer Trail Lodge on the north side of the lake.  There were 49 private homes and cottages on the lake in 2005, up from 39 in 1981, 25 in 1969, and 5 in 1950.  All of these homes and cottages are on the north and west sides of the lake and comprise about 30 percent of the shoreline, the remainder of the shoreline is U.S. Forest Service land.  Many of the private homes and cottages were on Forest Service leased lots, but were recently privatized through a land exchange.Fish were sampled in the 2005 fisheries lake survey with nine trapnets set along the shoreline in shallow water, 12 deep gillnets set in or below the thermocline at depths ranging from 25 ft to 85 ft and in water temperatures of 40-52 F, five shallow gillnets set in depths ranging from 6 ft to 25 ft and in water temperatures of 52-77 F, and six shoreline seine hauls used to sample young or small fish.  Fourteen previous investigations, dating back to 1950, each used 7-18 deep gillnets.  Three of these previous investigations used shallow gillnets, and two of these previous investigations used trapnets.  Shoreline seines were used in the 1950 and 1981 investigations.Fish populations in 2005 were dominated by cisco, white sucker, smallmouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  Rock bass and yellow perch were also fairly common.Shallow Water Fish PopulationsSmallmouth bass are the game fish most commonly caught by anglers in Ojibway Lake, and were present in the first fisheries investigation in 1950.  Smallmouth bass are known to be abundant in this lake despite fairly low catches in the sampling gears (bass are \"net-shy\" and difficult to catch in sampling nets).  Young-of-year smallmouth were the most common species captured in the shoreline seining in 2005.  Smallmouth numbers in the shallow gillnets in 2005 (1.8/net) were higher than the median catch of 0.5/net in all investigations on this lake.  The largest smallmouth caught in 2005 (18.5\") was caught in a deep gillnet.  Growth of smallmouth caught in 2005 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Largemouth bass are not as abundant as smallmouth bass in Ojibway Lake, but young-of-year largemouth were the second most common species captured in the shoreline seines in 2005.  Largemouth bass were reported to be present in a limnological study of Ojibway Lake in 1936.  The larger of two largemouth bass caught in the 2005 survey was 13.3\".  Bluegill sunfish were first observed in the 1981 investigation of Ojibway Lake, although they were present in the first investigation of Triangle Lake, upstream of Ojibway Lake, in 1974.  Bluegill numbers in the trapnets in 2005 (8.9/net) were lower than the 1992 bluegill catch of 14.8/net.  Bluegill sizes in 2005 averaged 5.6\"; the largest bluegill was 7.8\".  Growth of bluegill captured in 2005 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Rock bass numbers in 2005 (4.0/shallow gillnet, 2.8/trapnet) were similar to their numbers in previous investigations on this lake.  Rock bass were first observed in the 1981 investigation on this lake.White sucker numbers in Ojibway Lake gradually declined from 12.0/shallow gillnet in 1950 to none in 2005, and from 6.6/trapnet in 1981 to 0.1/trapnet in 2005.  The reason for the apparent decline in the white sucker population in Ojibway Lake is not known.Yellow perch numbers in 2005 (3.4/shallow gillnet) were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2005 averaged 7.5\"; the largest perch was 9.5\".  Growth of perch captured in 2005 was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (0.8/shallow gillnet, 0.2/trapnet) were low, but were similar to their numbers in previous investigations.  Pike sizes in 2005 averaged 29\"; the largest pike (caught in a shallow gillnet) was 38\" and 11.9 lb.   Growth of pike captured in 2005 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Walleye and black crappie were captured for the first time in Ojibway Lake in 2005.  The walleye were probably downstream migrants from Triangle Lake, but black crappie are not known to be in Triangle Lake.  The three walleye were quite large, ranging in size from 19.6\" to 24.3\", ranging from age five to age ten, and exhibiting growth that was faster than normal by area standards.  All of the crappie were age three, from the 2002 year class, and were growing faster than normal by area standards.  Most crappie were caught in the small eastern bay, but one was caught in the bay near the public access.Deep Water Fish PopulationsCisco numbers in 2005 (16.3/deep gillnet) were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2005 averaged 9.2\"; the largest cisco was 13\".  Cisco are a rich forage fish and are responsible for the large size of some northern pike and lake trout in Ojibway Lake.  Ojibway Lake is open for netting of bait-sized cisco through the ice each fall.Lake trout numbers in Ojibway Lake have generally been low, and the 2005 lake trout catch of 0.5/deep gillnet was similar to the median catch of 0.7/deep gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Four of the six lake trout captured in 2005 were fin-clipped, indicating they had been stocked as yearlings.  Two of the fin-clipped lake trout caught in 2005 were survivors of a paired stocking of Gillis Lake strain and Mountain Lake strain yearlings in May of 2004 at the average length of 7.0\".  One Gillis Lake strain lake trout (right ventral fin clip) had grown to 8.0\" in July of 2005, 14 months after stocking and at the age of 2+; this is slower than normal growth for area lake trout lakes.  One Mountain Lake strain lake trout (left ventral fin clip) had grown to 9.1\" in July of 2005, 14 months after stocking and at the age of 2+; this is normal growth for area lake trout lakes.  The stomachs of both of these small lake trout were empty.Two lake trout captured in 2005 had adipose fin clips and were from a 2002 stocking of Gillis Lake strain yearlings averaging 7.0\".  They had grown to 12.2\" in July of 2005, 36 months after stocking and at the age of 4+; this is normal growth for area lake trout lakes.Both of these trout had yellow perch in their stomachs.Two large lake trout (21.4\", 22.3\") captured in 2005 had no clipped fins.  They may have been the result of natural reproduction or they may have been stocked prior to 1990, which was when fin clipping of stocked lake trout began on Ojibway Lake.  They were aged with scales at age four, which, if true, would be extremely fast growth for area lake trout lakes, as lake trout of this size are typically about ten years old.  Area standards for lake trout growth  are based on the use of otoliths for ageing lake trout because the use of scales has been shown to underestimate the true age of lake trout.  One of the large lake trout caught in 2005 had smallmouth bass in its stomach, the other contained slimy sculpin.A burbot was captured in Ojibway Lake for the first time in 2005.  This 22\" specimen may have migrated downstream from Triangle Lake, where a burbot was captured in 1998.Many of the shallow water game fish examined in 2005 were infected with neascus (black spot), and many of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera.  Many of the cisco examined in 2005 had roundworms in their air bladders and triaenophorus cysts in their muscle tissue.  All of these parasites are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very deep, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.Ojibway Lake was thermally stratified on 07/30/2002 with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F, and retained 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of 35 ft, where the temperature was 45 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 50 ft, where the temperature was 41 F.  Oxygen levels at depth were poorer than normal in 2001; 5 ppm oxygen is retained to depths of 40 ft to 50 ft in most summers.The inlet from Triangle Lake has a steep, rocky watercourse, and the outlet to Camp 20 Lake has a rocky watercourse and a filter barrier which has been partially washed out.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline on Ojibway Lake are mostly ledgerock, boulder, and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft; floatingleaf pondweed is the most common aquatic plant.The 2001 fish population assessment consisted of 14 deep gillnets, set in or below the thermocline in depths of 25 ft to 80 ft.  Thirteen previous investigations, dating back to 1950, had deep gillnet sets, although some of these (prior to 1981) had some unstratified sets that were set shallow-to-deep through the thermocline.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the deep gillnets in 2001 of 13.6 fish/net (5.7 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 17.1 fish/net (8.1 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Deep water fish populations in 2001 were dominated by cisco.Cisco numbers in 2001 (13.1/net) were similar to the median catch of 15.5/net in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2001 averaged 9.8\", which was similar to the average size of 9.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2001 was 13.9\".Lake trout numbers in 2001 (0.3/net) were lower than the median catch of 0.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake, and were lower than recent catches (disregarding yearlings stocked in the same spring as the assessment) in 1992 (0.9/net), 1994 (3.1/net), and 1997 (1.7/net).  Reduced stocking levels and poorer oxygen levels may be responsible for the declining catch of trout in recent years  Only four lake trout were caught in 2001, ranging in size from 8.7\" to 28.5\".  All three of the smaller trout were fin-clipped, indicating they were stocked fish.  The larger trout may also have been stocked prior to the initiation of fin-clipping in 1990.  The two smallest clipped trout averaged 9.0\" (0.2 lb), and had been stocked 14 months earlier, in the spring of 2000, as part of a yearling stocking averaging 7\" (0.10 lb).  The larger clipped trout was 14.2\" (0.9 lb) and had been stocked 38 months earlier, in the spring of 1998, as part of a yearling stocking averaging 6\" (0.08 lb).  The growth of these stocked fish appears to be normal by area standards.A few good-sized smallmouth bass (14\" to 18\") were caught in the shallow ends of two of the shallower nets, in depths of 25 ft to 40 ft.</p>",

The trophic status of Ojibway Lake is between oligotrophic and mesotrophic. <br> \n <br> \nOjibway Lake was thermally stratified on 08/13/2007 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F.  In the west basin of the lake, adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 51 ft where the temperature was 42 F.  Previous investigations have shown that in the central basin of the lake 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 40 ft where the temperature is 40-45 F, and that in the eastern bay 5 ppm oxygen is retained only to a depth of 14 ft where the temperature is 55 F.  Oxygen levels in cold water in 2001 were quite low in the west and central basins of Ojibway Lake, dropping below 5 ppm as shallow as 35 ft.  The initial fisheries lake survey in 1950 considered Ojibway Lake to be a marginal lake trout lake based on its water quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe major inlet to Ojibway Lake, from Triangle Lake, has a short and steep watercourse with log jams and the remnants of a beaver dam at the head.  The outlet, to Camp 20 Lake has a long, braided channel with a log jam at the head, the remnants of an old filter barrier downstream (built when Camp 20 Lake was being stocked with trout), and a cattail and grassy swamp area farther downstream.  While these barriers may prevent upstream fish movement, they do not prevent downstream fish movement, as demonstrated by the movement of splake from Ojibway Lake to Camp 20 Lake after a 1991 stocking, and by the sudden appearance of walleye in Ojibway Lake in the 2005 investigation, presumably migrating from Triangle Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Ojibway Lake are mostly boulder, ledge rock, rubble, and silt.  Aquatic plants in Ojibway Lake are sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft; shoreline fringe plants are the most abundant, but northern milfoil, white waterlilies, and various pondweeds are also present. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a public access with a concrete boat ramp on Ojibway Lake at the site of the old Deer Trail Lodge on the north side of the lake.  There were 49 private homes and cottages on the lake in 2005, up from 39 in 1981, 25 in 1969, and 5 in 1950.  All of these homes and cottages are on the north and west sides of the lake and comprise about 30 percent of the shoreline; the remainder of the shoreline is U.S. Forest Service land.  Many of the private homes and cottages were on Forest Service leased lots, but were recently privatized through a land exchange. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the 2007 assessment was to evaluate the survival and growth of stocked lake trout yearlings by using 12 deep gillnets set in or below the thermocline at depths ranging from 25 ft to 85 ft and in water temperatures of 40-52 F.  Fifteen previous investigations, dating back to 1950, each used 7-18 deep gillnets <br> \n <br> \nDeep water fish populations in 2007 were dominated by moderate numbers of cisco and low numbers of lake trout.  Burbot, another common coldwater fish species in the area, were observed in Ojibway Lake only in the 2005 investigation when one 22\" specimen was captured. <br> \n <br> \nCisco numbers in 2007 (16.4/deep gillnet) were at the median value for all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2007 averaged 9.8\", which was similar to sizes in previous catches on this lake.  The largest cisco in 2007 was 13.5\".  Cisco are a rich forage fish and are responsible for the large size of some northern pike and lake trout in Ojibway Lake.  Ojibway Lake is open for netting of bait-sized cisco under the ice each fall. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout numbers in Ojibway Lake have generally been low, but the 2007 lake trout catch of 0.3/deep gillnet was lower than the median catch of 0.7/deep gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Two of the four lake trout captured in 2007 were fin-clipped, indicating they had been stocked. <br> \n <br> \nThe two fin-clipped lake trout caught in 2007 were survivors of a paired stocking of Gillis Lake strain and Mountain Lake strain yearlings in May of 2004 at the average length of 7.0\".  Both were Gillis Lake strain trout with a right ventral clip.  One had grown only to a length of 9.8\" in the 39 months since being stocked.  Although lake trout growth in Ojibway Lake has historically been slow, the growth of this individual was extremely slow.  The stomach of this trout was empty.  The other Gillis Lake strain trout was 14.6\", and exhibited growth that was faster than normal for this lake, but was typical of four year old lake trout in area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNo trout were caught from the 2006 yearling stocking (Gillis strain with adipose-right ventral clips and Mountain Lake strain with adipose-left ventral clips). <br> \n <br> \nOne unclipped lake trout was age 7, and at 16.2\" was smaller than the median length of 18.0\" for age 7 trout in area lakes.  The other unclipped trout was age 9, and at 21.9\" was smaller than the median length of 23.2\" for age 9 trout in area lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located 15 miles north northeast of Ely, MN Ojibway is a 371-acre Canadian Shield lake with a maximum depth of 115 feet. Sparse residential development has occurred along the northern shoreline.   Riparian zone vegetation remains intact.  Typical of lakes in this region of the state, rocky steep breaking shorelines and coarse woody debris abound.  A near shore survey (Index of Biotic Integrity; IBI) was conducted from 8/6-8/8/2013 to assess populations of non-game species and young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish using backpack electrofishing and trap nets.  Overnight sets of 1/4\" trap nets are used at each site in Canadian Shield lakes.  Seining occurs at sites where shoreline characteristics allow.  These sites are selected by the crew leader to include diverse seinable habitats; three seines were pulled in Ojibway. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted all 10 stations. Sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Small mesh trap nets were deployed where shoreline characteristics allowed.  Nets were set as close to assigned GPS points as possible.  New GPS coordinates were recorded if a net location was adjusted.  Seining was conducted at 3 sites with a 15-foot 1/8th inch mesh seine. Nearshore IBI sampling captured several species of fish including (in alphabetical order) black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, green sunfish, Iowa darter, johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.  This specific sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool that is being developed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency specifically for MN DNR Lake Classes 1-19.  Small mesh trap nets are not part of the state-wide IBI sampling protocol.   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore survey of Ojibway Lake captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality:  Iowa darter, rock bass and smallmouth bass.  One tolerant species, green sunfish, was also sampled. The surrounding landscape remains forested and minimal development has occurred within the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ojibway Lake is located approximately 14 miles east of Ely and is accessible by a concrete ramp off the Fernberg Road.  It is 367 acres with a maximum depth of 115 feet and clear water (the small bay on the east end of the lake connected by a shallow channel has much darker brown colored water).  \n\nThree dissolved oxygen profiles (western, middle, and eastern basins) were taken on Ojibway Lake on August 11, 2015.  All three basins showed thermal stratification with surface temperatures near 70 F and bottom temps all around 40 F.  On the western basin oxygen and water temperature suitable for lake trout occurred between 23 and 52 feet.  The middle basin ideal range for lake trout was 23 to 48 feet.  The eastern basin is not capable of supporting lake trout in the summer but oxygen levels capable of supporting most other gamefish was adequate to a depth of 23 feet.  \n\nOjibway is a popular lake for recreation.  Its shorelines and islands are rimmed with tall white, red, and jack pine as well as stands of spruce and cedar.  There are some cabins and homes on the western basin and north shore of the middle basin, but the southern shore and much of the eastern side of the lake is US Forest Service land.  A few camp sites and an access on the south shore to Triangle Lake can provide a boundary waters feel without the need for a permit or other restrictions.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are mostly absent except for some shallow bays.   \n\nOjibway has a long history of stocking dating back to 1915.  Several different species were introduced, but since 1992 stocking has been limited to lake trout yearlings every even year.  Due to poor growth and survival of stocked fish, stocking was discontinued after 2010.     \n\nThis population assessment consisted of three different net types: shallow water gillnet sets, deep water gillnet sets, and trapnet sets.  \n\nLake trout numbers in Ojibway Lake have generally been low, but the 2015 lake trout catch of 0.1/deep gill net is the lowest catch rate since 1977.  The only trout caught was 10 inches, weighed 0.3 pounds, was three years old, and was not stocked.    \n\nThree walleye were sampled in all the gill nets, although catch rates for walleye have always been extremely low.  Lengths were 16, 18, and 24 inches.  These fish were 2, 3, and 9 years old and showed good growth.  Walleye have not been stocked in Ojibway Lake since 1946 so it is possible these fish moved down the outlet from Triangle Lake or there may be a small population in Ojibway that is spawning.  \n\nThe northern pike population seems to be doing well in Ojibway Lake.  The shallow water gillnet catch was the highest on record for the lake at nearly 3 fish/net.  The average sized pike was 26 inches and over 4 pounds, but fish up to 38 inches were also sampled.  \n\nA total of 15 smallmouth bass were sampled in shallow water gill nets and trap nets.  The average weight was over a pound.  Although most of the fish were fairly small, bass up to 18 inches were captured.  Fish tended to grow slow compared to other area lakes.  Ages ranged from 3 to 8 years.  \n\nSix largemouth bass were sampled in shallow water gill nets and trap nets.  Most were small with lengths ranging from 6 to 14 inches.  Growth of largemouth was also fairly slow.  Ages ranged from 2 to 5 years.\n\nBluegill numbers seem to be on the rise in Ojibway Lake.  This assessment was the highest trap net catch recorded for the lake at nearly 23 fish/net.  This catch rate was very good when compared to other similar lakes.  Fish tended to be small though with a size range from 4 to 8 inches and an average of 5 inches.  \n\nYellow perch numbers are similar to previous catches.  The shallow gillnet catch was just over 3 fish/net.  Fish were small with sizes ranging from 6 to 7 inches.  These were the smallest perch sampled from Ojibway Lake.  \n\nCisco numbers in 2015 are similar to previous catches.  The deep gillnet catch was just over 13 fish/net.  Lengths ranged from 7 to 13 inches with an average of 9 inches.  \n\nAdditional fish species sampled but in small numbers include: black crappie, green sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.\n\nTriangle Lake flows into Ojibway Lake through a small outlet on Ojibway's south shore.  Triangle has had a population of rusty crayfish since 1986.  These crayfish are a non-native invasive species.  They had not been observed in Ojibway Lake until this survey.  A total of 22 rusty crayfish were captured from shallow gill nets and trap nets in 2015, no native crayfish were observed.  \n</p>",
