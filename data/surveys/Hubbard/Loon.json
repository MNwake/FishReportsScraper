                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a 112 acre lake located five miles southeast of Nevis in southeastern Hubbard County.  Loon Lake is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 5.5 feet.  There is no public access on the lake.  Due to the shallow depth, the only sampling gear used was trapnets.  The 2005 survey was the first full fisheries survey conducted on Loon Lake.  Past fisheries sampling on Loon Lake has been limited to dissolved oxygen and winterkill checks in 1989 and 1992 and a game lake survey in 1962.  Loon Lake provides fishing opportunities for panfish, northern pike, and bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Loon Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Hungryman, Hennepin, Paine, Peysenski, and Wolf.Loon Lake supports a good panfish population.  Bluegill abundance (33.3 bluegill/trapnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Rock bass and hybrid sunfish are also present in low numbers.Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were sampled in Loon Lake with largemouth bass being the more abundant of the two species.  Largemouth bass up to 18.5 inches were sampled.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers.Anglers will find a low to moderate northern pike population in Loon composed of medium sized pike.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 20.9 to 30.9 inches.  </p>",
