DURING JULY OF 1991, SOUTH STANCHFIELD LAKE WAS SURVEYED WITH SIX GILLNETS, SIX TRAPNETS AND THREE SHORELINE AREAS WERE SEINED.  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBE THE GAMEFISH POPULATIONS IN THE LAKE.  SOUTH STANCHFIELD LAKE HAD ABUNDANT POPULATIONS OF BLB AND CAP WHICH IS COMMON IN FERTILE WINTERKILL LAKES.  SPAWNING CONDITIONS WERE FAIR TO GOOD FOR PAN, LMB, AND NOP.  WAE SPAWNING CONDITIONS WERE POOR.  THE WAE NET CATCH (4.17/SET) WAS BETWEEN THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (2.67/SET) AND THE THIRD QUARTILE (5.00/ SET).  ALL THE WAE CAPTURED WERE TWO YEARS OLD AND ORIGINATED FROM A FRY STOCKING DURING 1989.  THE WAE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9.5 TO 19.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 13.0 TO 13.9 INCHES. BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATED A NORMAL GROWTH RATE WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES.  THE AVERAGE WAE WEIGHT (1.16 POUNDS) WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (1.43 POUNDS), BECAUSE ONLY TWO YEAR OLD FISH WERE CAPTURED.  FOR A WAE FISHERY TO EXIST STOCKING MUST BE USED.  WAE STOCKING HAS CONSISTED OF STOCKING FRY.  HOWEVER, FRY STOCKING HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTH STANCHFIELD LAKE.  DURING 1977, 200,000 FRY WERE STOCKED AND NONE WERE CAUGHT DURING THE LAKE SURVEY OF 1979, AND DURING 1971 430,000 FRY WERE STOCKED AND ONLY ONE WAS CAPTURED DURING A LAKE SURVEY IN 1974.  NOP WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE GILL- NETS AND ONLY FOUR WERE CAPTURED IN THE TRAPNETS (0.67/SET).  THIS WAS EQUAL TO THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (0.67/SET).  THE NOP RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 22.0 TO 27.9 INCHES AND AVERAGED 3.65 POUNDS (THIRD QUARTILE = 3.66 POUNDS).  THE NOP WERE TWO AND THREE YEAR OLD FISH, AND BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATED A FAST GROWTH RATE.  LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THE NOP POPULATION WITH REGARD TO NET CATCH AND FISH SIZE.  THE BLC NET CATCH (2.17/SET) WAS LOW, BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (2.25/SET), BUT REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE 1986 SURVEY (3.00/SET).  THE BLC RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5.0 TO 12.9 INCHES WITH MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 9.5 TO 9.9 INCHES.  BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATED A NORMAL GROWTH RATE, BUT THE AVERAGE BLC WEIGHT (0.52 POUNDS) WAS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (0.34 POUNDS) FOR THE LAKE CLASS.  THE LENGTH AND AVERAGE WEIGHT OF BLC HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED SINCE 1979.  YOUNG OF THE YEAR (YOY) BLC WERE NOT CAUGHT DURING THE SURVEY.  ALTHOUGH SPAWNING HABITAT WAS FAIR TO GOOD, HISTORICALLY THE BLG NET CATCH HAS BEEN LOW.  BLG WERE FIRST SAMPLED DURING 1986, AND DURING 1991 THE NET CATCH (1.17/SET) WAS FAR BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (7.00/ SET).  BLG RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5.5 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.0 TO 6.4 INCHES. BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS INDICATED A NORMAL GROWTH RATE AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT (0.24 POUNDS) WAS BETWEEN THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (0.20 POUNDS) AND THE THIRD QUARTILE (0.27 POUNDS).  FIFTY-THREE YOY BLG WERE SEINED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>SOUTH STANCHFIELD LAKE HAS A MANAGEMENT CLASSIFI- CATION AS A WARMWATER GAMEFISH LAKE WITH A HISTORY OF RATHR CONTINUOUS SEVERE OR PARTIAL WINTERKILLS CONFIRMED FROM THE EARLY 1940'S THROUGH 1979. A HISTORICAL HIGH ROUGHFISH POPULATION RELATE TO THIS FREQUENT WINTERKILL STATUS. BASED ON RESPEC- TIVE LOCAL MEDIANS, THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE NORTHERN PIKE, AS HAS BEEN  ITS HISTORY, WAS EXTREMELY LOW AT 0.17 PER GILLNET SET. THE BLUEGILL, ALTHOUGH SUFFICIENTLY STOCKED ON 6 SEPARATE OCCASIONS HAS BEEN ALMOST NON-EXISTENT IN THE PAST NETTING DATA AND WAS EXTREMELY LOW AT 0.33 PER TRAP NET SET. THE BLACK CRAPPIE SHOWED LOW POPULATION FIGURES WITH 3.00 PER TRAPNET AND SIZE RANGED FROM 7 TO 11.9 INCHES WITH A 51.9% OF FISH MEASURED BEING IN THE 8.0 TO 8.4 INCH SIZE RANGE. BASED ON 3 COMPARATIVE GILL NET SETS IN 1979, THE YELLOW PERCH SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE (97.4%) IN POPULATION. THE PRESENT CATCH RATE OF 7.83 PER GILLNET WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED LOW WHEN COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 24.27 THE YELLOW PERCH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 5.0 TO 9.9 INCHES WITH 40% OF THE FISH MEA- SURED BEING 5.5 TO 5.9 INCHES. IN 1979, PERCH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 5.0 TO 11.4 INCHES WITH 34.67% BEING 6.0 TO 6.4 INCHES. THE WHITE SUCKER AT 8.33 PER GILLNET WAS OVER 3 TIMES ITS LOCAL MEDIAN BUT OF SMALL SIZE WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 9.5 TO 9.9 INCHES. THE YELLOW BULLHEAD SHOWS A VERY LOW POPULATION AT 0.17 PER TRAP NET SET. THE BLACK BULLHEAD AT 7.50 PER TRAP NET WAS LOW WHEN COMPARED TO ITS LOCAL MEDIAN OF 24.47 AND HAS DECLINED FROM THE 145.14 PER SET IN 1979. SIZE RANGE IS FROM 6.5 TO 11.9 INCHES WITH 48% OF FISH MEASURED BEING IN THE 7.5 TO 7.9 INCH RANGE. THE BULLHEADS ARE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO BE OF COMMERCIAL VALUE. THE CARP AT 4.17 PER TRAP NET SET WAS OVER TWICE ITS LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.74 AND HAD DECLINED FROM AN ALL TIME HIGH OF 46.14 PER SET IN 1979. AVG WEIGHT OF THE CARP IN THE TRAP NETS WAS 2.73 LBS. THE CARP SHOULD PROVIDE SOME VALUE AS A COMMERCIAL FISHERY. THE GOLDEN SHINER AND THE COMMON SHINER, ALTHOUGH ABSENT IN THE GILLNET CATCH WERE TAKEN IN THE TRAPNETS IN HIGHER NUMBERS THAN THEIR LOCAL MEDIAN FIGURES AT 0.67 AND 2.17 RESPECTIVELY. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS ABSENT IN THE NET CATCHES BUT 1 YOUNG OF THE YEAR WAS TAKEN IN THE SHORELINE SEINING TO INDICATE THAT THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE LAKE.</p>",
