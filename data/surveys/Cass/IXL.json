Most of the sample of northern pike were less than 20 inches in length, though one fish 35 inches long was captured.  The bluegill tapnet catch (33.7/TN) was near average for lakes in this area.  Thirteen percent of the measured sample of bluegill were greater than 7 inches in length.  For the sampling methods used, fair numbers of largemouth bass and black crappie were captured indicating good populations of each.  The length frequencies indicate several year classes of both species are present.  One walleye was captured during the survey.  It was aged at greater than 5 years old.  A group of lakshore owners stocked purchased walleye fingerlings (1000+/year) by permit into Ixl during 1985, 1986, and 1987.  None of thse walleyes were captured during the survey.</p>",
