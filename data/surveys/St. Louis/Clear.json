                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Clear Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Clear Lake has no inlets or outlet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel and rubble, with smaller amounts of sand and finer materials.  Aquatic plants are sparse, grow to a depth of 6 ft, and are located mostly in patches around the shoreline.  Sweetgale and water horehound were the most common plants.Twenty four homes and cottages were counted in 2002.  Lakeshore lots have recently been platted on the north shore of the lake and increased development is anticipated.  There is no public access to this lake, but acquisition of an access site on the east side of the lake is being negotiated by DNR-Trails and Waterways.Fish sampling in this fisheries lake survey consisted of 9 trapnet sets and 6 gillnet sets.  Two previous investigations, in 1982 and 1992, consisted of 6 trapnet sets and 4-6 gillnet sets.  Shoreline seining was done in 1982 and 2002.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 38.9 fish/net (17.6 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 34.9 fish/net (12.0 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Trapnet catches were dominated by bluegill sunfish and black crappie.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 16.2 fish/net (41.8 lb/net) was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 19.2 fish/net (28.7 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Gillnet catches were dominated by northern pike and white sucker.Bluegill catches in Clear Lake have increased over time, from 0.5/trapnet in 1982, to 17.0/trapnet in 1992, and to 25.2/trapnet in 2002 (which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class).  However, the trapnetting dates have also changed, from August 9 in 1982, to July 14 in 1992, and to June 24 in 2002.  Since sunfish are caught more readily early in the summer in trapnets, we do not know if the increased bluegill catches in Clear Lake represent increases in population size or increased catchability.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 5.8\" (0.15 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 6.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  Very few bluegill in 2002 were 8\" or larger.  The largest bluegill was 9.3\".  Many of the bluegill (63%) were age four, from the 1998 year class.  Bluegill growth was near the median by area standards.Black crappie numbers in 2002 (6.3/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were at the median for all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2002 averaged 6.6\" (0.16 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 7.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie was 10.2\".  All but two crappie were ages two and three.  Crappie growth was faster than normal by area standards.Northern pike catches in Clear Lake have increased over time, from 2.0/gillnet in 1982, to 3.7/gillnet in 1992, and to 5.7/gillnet in 2002 (which was in the third quartile for this lake class).  However, as with bluegill sunfish catches in trapnets, pike are more readily caught in gillnets early in the summer so that we do not know if the increase in pike catches means higher pike populations, or is just a reflection of increased catchability.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 23.9\" (3.3 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 23.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike was 30.9\".  Pike scales were very difficult to read, and conclusions could not be reached about pike growth.Walleye numbers in 2002 (2.5/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 21.2\" (3.2 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 25\".  All walleye were age 7 or older, indicating that natural reproduction has not been successful in recent years.  Walleye growth appeared to be normal by area standards.Perch numbers in Clear Lake have declined over time, from 68/gillnet in 1982, to 13/gillnet in 1992, and to 0.3/gillnet in 2002. Since perch are more catchable in gillnets early in the summer, this decline in perch catches probably represents a real decline in the perch population over time.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass are probably more abundant than indicated by the standard gillnet and trapnet catches, as fair numbers of young-of-year bass were captured in the shoreline seines in 2002.  The largest bass in 2002 was an 18.7\" smallmouth.  Sucker numbers in 2002 (6.7/gillnet) and average sizes (17.6\", 2.2 lb) were in the third quartile for this lake class.Many of the bluegill, bass, and northern pike examined in 2002 were infected with neascus.  Some of the perch and rock bass also had yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",
