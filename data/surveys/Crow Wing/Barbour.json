                "narrative": "<p>Barbour Lake is 51 acres in size and is located just south of Garrison in eastern Crow Wing County.  It is connected to the much larger Smith Lake by navigable channel.  There were five homes/cabins along the 1.0 miles of shoreline in 1997.  There was no designated public access present.The lake is 54 feet deep and about 25% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was above average for the area in 1997.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily muck and marl.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species help cycle nutrients and buffer shorelines from excessive wave damage.  Species like bulrush and wild rice often enhance the quality of spawning habitat for a variety of fish species, but are generally absent from Barbour Lake.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide important cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic life.The 1997 test netting showed a varied fish population.  Northern pike numbers were \"low\" when compared to similar type lakes but pike averaged 32 inches and over 8 lbs. in size.  The catch rate was similar to that from adjoining Smith Lake.  Walleyes were not sampled but were caught in \"low\" numbers in Smith Lake.  The largemouth bass catch was in the \"average\" category and several age classes were present.  Bluegill catch was also \"average\" and about 20% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Other panfish caught at \"average\" rates included pumpkinseeds and rock bass.Yellow perch and tullibees are important forage fish for the lake's gamefish species.  Yellow perch were only sampled as young fish in Barbour and were caught in \"low\" numbers in Smith Lake.  Tullibees were caught in \"high\" numbers, however.  Other species sampled in '97 included bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullhead, both taken in \"low\" numbers in test nets.</p>",

The tullibee (cisco) average length was 11.3\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 24.7 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.3?C (46.9?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1974-2010 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2010. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
