                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catch rates averaged 20.2 fish/gillnet in 1991 which exceeds the stated goal in the lake management plan of 12.0 fish per net.  Walleye catch rates averaged 20.4 fish/gillnet in 1988.  The size structure of the Walleye population has remained fairly stable.  The percentage of quality-sized fish (PSD) increased from 39% in 1988 to 46% in 1991.  RSD-P was calculated at 5% in 1991 which is well below the management criteria of 20%.  Age 2 and 3 year old fish comprised 80% of the Walleye captured which would account for the lower structural indices. These dominant year classes are experiencing rapid growth with fish exceeding 12 inches at time of second annulus formation.  Average back-calculated of older fish met the management goal of 21 inches in total length at age 6.  The strong 1989 year class is most likely the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1988 and 1990 was prescribed by the lake management plan.  The results of past surveys have also demonstrated that natural reproduction occurs in Lake Andrew.  Northern Pike density is relatively low. Gillnet catch rates have decreased from 9.0/net in 1980, 4.0/net in 1985 and 1988, to 1.6/net in 1991.  This is below the management criteria of 5.0 fish/gillnet.  The decline in abundance is likely due to drought conditions experienced in the area over the past five years.  There has been a decline in Northern Pike abundance observed in lakes through the entire area.  Yellow Perch abundance has remained stable over the past ten years. Catch rates averaged 21.0 fish/gillnet in 1991.  A catch rate of 25 fish/net is the stated goal in the lake management plan.  The size structure of the Yellow Perch has changed little since 1988; RSD's were 18% and 20% in 1988 and 1991, respectively.  Bluegill catch rate has declined from 15.4 fish/trap to 3.9 fish/trap in 1988 and 1991, respectively.  Bluegill size distribution is desirable (PSD = 42%); however there were no fish that exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Bluegill were captured at a rate of 9.9/trapnet in September of 1991 during a statewide crappie research project. The PSD of those captured fish was 10.9%.  Black Crappie trapnet catches have been historically low; cpue has averaged 0.30 fish/net since 1974.  The catch rate in 1991 was 0.38 fish/net.  However, this is within the first and third quartile for lakes in the same lake classification (27).  Catch rates were significantly greater (CPUE of 38.5) during September when a trapnetting survey was conducted in Lake Andrew as part of an ongoing state wide crappie research project.  Obviously seasonal movements and behavior of crappie are responsible for the difference in catch rates.  Black Crappie may be a significant component of the recreational fishery even though the standard lake survey net sets captured few fish in June.  There is no evidence to suggest that Walleye abundance is having a negative impact on other sport fish populations.  Northern Pike populations have declined, however, this is likely due to conditions rather than intraspecific competition with Walleye.  However, there is strong evidence of natural recruitment occurring and the stocking of Walleye fingerlings at 1.5 lbs/littoral acre on an alternate year basis may not have an attractive cost/benefit ratio.  A stocking rate of 1.0 lbs/acre may provide the same Walleye density at a lesser cost.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrew is a 918-acre, moderately fertile basin located immediately south of Alexandria.  It is a relatively deep lake.  Mean and maximum depths are 29.0 and 83.0 feet, respectively.  Water clarity is considered good.  Average Secchi disk measurements typically exceed eight feet during much of the summer.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Residential development around the lake is considered moderate.  Most of the watershed remains in agricultural production, but municipal and light industrial developments have encroached into the watershed.  A concrete public access is located along the south shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrew holds a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community.  Of particular interest are large expanses of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along north and west shorelines.  These areas provide critical habitat for many fish species and must be protected to maintain integrity of the fish community.      <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrew supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management efforts are directed at sustaining a walleye fishery. Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year schedule to supplement natural recruitment and bolster walleye abundance.  Stocking efforts have been highly successful and walleye are currently abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 10.3 fish/net in 2012, exceeding catch rates considered normal for this type of lake.  High abundance is attributed to an extremely strong 2008 year class.  Fall electrofishing efforts indicated another strong year class was produced in 2012.  Thus, walleye abundance will likely remain high in future years if this year class recruits to the sport fishery.  Although current abundance is high, smaller fish dominate the fishery.  Mean size in 2012 was just 13.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes contributing to the fishery include northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfishes, namely bluegill and black crappie.   Northern pike are relatively abundant.  In response, growth is below average and the population is skewed towards a high proportion of small individuals.  Too many small pike is a common problem in many lakes in west-central Minnesota.   Harvest of small pike is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Largemouth bass catches during electrofishing surveys have decreased in recent years but this population is still considered abundant.  Much of 2011 population sample was comprised of young fish, but bass exceeding 15.0 inches are common.  Good panfishing opportunities also exist.  In 2012, both bluegill and black crappie populations exhibited lower abundance but favorable size structure.  Mean length of bluegill and black crappie was 7.0 and 10.1 inches, respectively. Yellow perch are also present, but don't contribute much to total harvest.  Few exceed 8.0 inches in length.      <br> \n <br> \nOther species recorded in the 2012 lake survey included bowfin (dogfish), common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and brown and yellow bullhead.  The next DNR lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure on Lake Andrew can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the high-quality attributes of Lake Andrew's fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and directed harvest on more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2023 on Lake Andrew to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were high, but only 16% of Bluegill were preferred-size (>8.0 inches). Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Andrew are fast and 6 year old Bluegill averaged 8.5 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was 9.1 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were low and all fish captured were age 4 and younger. Approximately 24% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are fast; average length of age 4 fish was 10.2 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 10.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Andrew. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrew was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2016. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance, as measured by gillnet catch rates, has increased from 11.50 fish/net in 1985 to 20.60 fish/net in 1988. Mean weight has decreased from 1.74 pounds in 1985 to 1.28 pounds in 1988. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1986; therefore, it is difficult to evaluate natural reproduction. There was one age 1 and six age 5 Walleye captured which would indicate the possibility of limited natural reproduction. The 1986 year-class appears very strong and will average 15 plus inches in 1989. Yellow Perch abundance has been stable over the last four surveys. Northern Pike exhibited a catch rate of 4.20 fish/gillnet and a mean weight of 2.43 lbs. Four of 29 Northern Pike netted were over 26.0 inches. Northern Cisco and Yellow Perch may provide the forage base for larger Nnorthern Pike and Walleye. Bluegill size distribution and growth are good. Sixty-four percent were over 6.0 inches in length. Bluegill growth rate was excellent. Age 4 fish averaged 6.0 inches in length. Black Crappie age distribution was good and they appear to recruit to a large size. Largemouth Bass were sampled by using electrofishing gear. Growth was moderately fast with age 4 bass averaging 13.0 inches. Black, brown, and yellow bullhead are present in sufficient numbers and sizes to provide a quality fishery. Bullhead may have commercial value.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrew (922 acres) is a moderately developed basin located approximately six miles south of Alexandria.  A concrete public access is found on the southeast shore off Lake Andrew Road SW.  Water clarity is high (7.0 feet) and aquatic plants are common.  Average and maximum depths are 29 and 83 feet, respectively.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Andrew.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.   \n\nWalleye were abundant (9.2/gill net).  Average size was 14.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Nine age classes were present.  Two- and four-year-old Walleye comprised 73% of the gill net sample.  Growth rates were moderate (14.8 inches at age 4), likely related to high population abundance and moderate productivity of Lake Andrew.  Walleye fry are stocked on alternate years to supplement natural reproduction.  Recent fall electrofishing surveys documented strong numbers of juvenile Walleye.  Good fishing opportunities should continue into the coming years.  \n\nNorthern Pike remain abundant (12.7/gill net).  Catch rates are approximately double the average of similar lakes in Minnesota.  Over 80% of all pike collected were less than 22 inches in length.  Lake Andrew falls in the North-central Zone where all pike 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Anglers can keep up to 10 pike but no more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Largemouth Bass are common in Lake Andrew.  Twenty-seven bass, ranging in length from 10.6 to 15.2 inches, were sampled with gill nets.  Bluegill were abundant and the average length was 7.4 inches.  The largest Bluegill measured 9.8 inches.  Lake Andrew's high-quality Bluegill population has been proposed for a special regulation (10-fish daily bag) as part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative.  Reduced daily harvest limits have potential to maintain or potentially improve size quality of Bluegill populations by allowing individuals to live longer and grow larger.  Opportunity for public input for this proposed special regulation will occur during fall 2021.  Black Crappie were not highly abundant (1.4/gill net), but average size was high (10.8 inches).  Yellow Perch are common (26.1/gill net), but numbers of harvestable-size fish is low.\n\nOther species recorded in the 2020 lake survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024.  \n\nZebra mussels, an aquatic invasive species, were confirmed in Lake Andrew in 2016.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment and remove aquatic vegetation prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrew is a 946-acre, moderately fertile basin located just south of Alexandria.  Mean depth is 29 feet. Water clarity has decreased in recent years but is still considered good.  Average secchi disk measurements typically exceed six feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Residential development around the lake is considered moderate.  Most of the watershed remains in agricultural production, but municipal and light industrial developments have encroached into the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrew holds a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community.  Of particular interest are the large expanses of hardstem bulrush and common cattail bordering the north and west shoreline.  These areas provide critical habitat for many fish species and must be protected to maintain integrity of the fish community.      <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrew supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management efforts are directed at sustaining a walleye fishery.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement natural recruitment and bolster walleye abundance.  Stocking efforts have been successful and walleye are currently abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 14.4 fish/net in 2007, exceeding catch rates considered normal for this type of lake.  Average size of walleye in the 2007 population sample was 15.0 inches and 1.2 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes contributing to the fishery include northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfishes, namely bluegill and black crappie.   Northern pike are relatively abundant.  In response, growth is below average and the population is skewed towards a high proportion of small individuals.  Largemouth bass catches during electrofishing surveys have increased in recent years.  Bass can now be described as abundant.  Much of the population is comprised of young fish, but captures exceeding 15.0 inches are common.  Good panfishing opportunities also exist.  Anglers can expect moderate numbers of both bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill caught in 2007 averaged 6.5 inches. Black crappie averaged 8.8 inches.  Yellow perch are also present, but do not contribute much to total harvest.  Few exceed 8.0 inches in length.      <br> \n <br> \nOther species recorded in the 2007 lake survey included bowfin (dogfish), tullibee, common carp, white sucker, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and black, brown, and yellow bullhead.  The opportunistic common carp responded to heavy rains and high water in June of 2003 with a very successful spawning event.  Gillnet catches increased from 0.2 fish and 1.3 pounds per net in 2003 to 11.8 fish and 44.8 pounds per net in 2007.  Shoreland property owners and anglers have complained of the notable increase in carp abundance.  Maintaining habitat conditions optimal for maximal diversity and standing stock of gamefishes is extremely important towards minimizing carp and black bullhead abundance. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the high quality attributes of Lake Andrew's fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and directs harvest on more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThere are no special regulations restricting harvest of gamefishes caught from Lake Andrew.  A 24.0-inch maximum length limit regulating harvest of northern pike was rescinded as of March 1, 2008.  Given above-average chances of harvesting walleye or small northern pike, too few pike were harvested to satisfy objectives of the regulation.  The \"hammerhandle\" problem is common in many lakes in west-central Minnesota.   Harvest of small pike is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrew is a 918-acre, moderately fertile basin located just south of Alexandria.  It is a relatively deep lake.  Mean and maximum depths are 29.0 and 83.0 feet, respectively.  Water clarity is good.  Average water transparency measurements typically exceed 9.0 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Residential development around the lake is considered moderate.  Most of the watershed remains in agricultural production, but municipal and light industrial developments have encroached into the watershed.  A concrete public access is located along the south shoreline off South Lake Andrew Drive.  \n\nLake Andrew is now designated as an infested waterbody due to presence of zebra mussels.  Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2016.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html \n\nLake Andrew holds a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community.  Of particular interest are large expanses of hardstem bulrush and common cattail bordering the north and west shoreline.  These areas provide critical habitat for many fish species and must be protected to maintain integrity of the fish community.     \n\nLake Andrew supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management efforts are directed at sustaining a Walleye fishery.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction and bolster walleye abundance.  Stocking efforts have been highly successful and Walleye are currently abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 12.6 fish/net in 2016, exceeding catch rates considered normal for this type of lake.  High abundance is attributed to an extremely strong 2012 year class, which accounted for approximately 77% of the Walleyes captured in gill nets.  Age and growth analyses indicated the majority of Walleyes from this year class have grown to a harvestable size.  This cohort ranged in length from 12.4 to 18.1 inches with an average length of 14.9 inches.  Fall electrofishing efforts indicated another extremely strong year class was produced in 2016.  Walleye abundance will likely remain high in future years if this year class recruits into the sport fishery.  \n\nOther gamefishes contributing to the fishery include Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfishes such as Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Yellow Perch.   Northern Pike are extremely abundant.  A record- high survey catch occurred in 2016.  This population is largely comprised of young or small individuals.  Mean pike length was just 18.7 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Too many small pike is a common problem in many lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Harvest of small pike is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Largemouth Bass catches during electrofishing surveys have decreased in recent years.  Current abundance is considered moderate.  Much of the population is comprised of younger, smaller fish.  Only 12% of the 2016 sample exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill numbers have increased in recent years and current catch rates describe population density as moderate, in terms of both abundance and size structure.  Harvestable-size Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are also present but abundance of these species is relatively low.     \n\nOther species recorded in the 2016 lake survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2020.  \n\nFishing pressure on Lake Andrew can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the high-quality attributes of Lake Andrew's fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and directed harvest on more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch larger fish.  \n\n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Andrew.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nNineteen species were collected during this survey.  Five species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Common Carp and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.   \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Andrew.</p>",

STOCKING OF WALLEYE FINGERLINGS IN ALTERNATE YEARS, HAS ALLOWED FOR FASTER GROWTH WITHOUT EFFECTING NET CATCHES SIGNIFICANTLY. THE NUMBER OF WALLEYES PER GILLNET IS DOWN FROM THE LAST SURVEY BUT THE MEAN SIZE IS 0.4 LBS LARGER. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE DECREASED IN NUMBER (FROM 11.9 IN 1980 TO 4.0 IN 1985). THIS REDUCTION IN NUMBERS HAS ALLOWED THE MEAN SIZE TO INCREASE FROM 1.3 LBS TO 1.75 LBS. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS RE- MAINED STEADY AND SHOULD PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT FOR- AGE BASE ALONG WITH THE CISCO. BLUEGILL NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND ARE AN ACCEPTABLE SIZE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrews supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation grows toa depth of 17 feet and is common in shallow areas.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush stands aredense along the mostly undeveloped western and northern shorelines.  Walleye catches averaged 8.5 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches were greater in the two previous surveys;averaging 20.0 fish/net in 1991 and 20.4 fish/net in 1988.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight offish captured was 1.5 pounds.  Northern pike catches increased from 1.4 fish/gillnet in 1991 to 14.8fish/gillnet in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.2 fish/net in 1988 and 4.0 fish/net in 1985.  Thenormal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.8 -9.0 fish/gillnet.  The recent increase innorthern pike abundance is the result of a strong year class developing in 1993 when high water levels provided access to optimum spawning habitat in adjoining marsh areas.  Mean weight of fish captured was1.6 pounds.  Electrofishing yielded 34.4 largemouth bass per hour.  Approximately 70% of fish capturedwere 12 inches in length or greater and 12% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 7.8fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 3.93 - 21.4 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1980. Size structure of bluegill captured in trapnets was favorable.  Three of four fish captured were 6inches in length or greater.  Black crappie were not adequately sampled with standard survey gear toevaluate the population.  A research project examining exploitation of bluegill and black crappie inAndrews Lake suggests a moderate population density comprised of relatively large individuals.  Yellowperch catches averaged 38.3 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes (7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches ranged from 21.0 - 33.8 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1980.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Andrew Lake is a 946-acre lake located south of Alexandria.  There is a good public access with ample parking.  The lake has an abundance of both submergent and emergent vegetation. Cattail and hardstem bulrush are abundant along the west shoreline.  Submerged vegetation creates a well-defined weedline at approximately 13 feet.  The abundant vegetation contributes to the good water quality by stabilizing the shoreline and by utilizing excess nutrients in the water.  Water quality can be maintained if the vegetation is preserved and proper land use is practiced within the watershed.  Sanitary sewer service became available to most of the lakeshore homes in 1999.Andrew Lake is known as a quality all around fishing and recreational lake.  Walleye are relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 7.9 fish per net.  Recent fingerling stockings in 1994 and 1996 seem to have been successful.  A strong year class developed in 1998 which corresponds to a year in which fry were stocked.  Natural reproduction is also evident in the age class distribution of fish captured with gill nets.  Fall electrofishing results suggest that another strong year class was produced by natural reproduction in 1999.Northern pike are also abundant.  Most of the fish captured were less than 24 inches in length.  However, a fish measuring 38.5 inches was captured in a gill net and an angler reported catching a 40-inch fish during the summer of 1999.  An experimental 24 inch maximum length limit was imposed in 1997 in an attempt to provide a trophy northern pike fishery on Lake Andrews.  Quality panfishing opportunities are also available on  Lake Andrews.  Bluegill  are relatively abundant and average about 6 inches in length.  The largest fish was just under 10 inches.  Lake Andrews is one of the most consistent producers of 2 pound crappies in the area.  Bluegill and black crappie are usually caught just off the edge of the weedline during  summer months.  Largemouth bass are also present in good numbers.  The large expanses of emergent vegetation along the relatively undeveloped west shore provide good spawning and nursery habitat for these bass, as well as bluegill and black crappie.  This critical habitat must be protected from future development which has started to encroach on this shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrew is a popular, recreational lake located just south of Alexandria.  Water quality and clarity remain good.  Seechi disk transparency averages about 8 feet during summer months.  Water quality parameters are usually in the upper 30th percentile of all lakes within the North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregion.  Present and future residential development along the shoreline of Lake Andrew has the potential to negatively impact water quality and overall lake health.  Lakeshore homeowners tend to turn undeveloped natural shoreline into a manicured lawns and a clean sand beach.  These alterations destroy critical near shore and onshore native vegetation.  This vegetation provides ideal fish and wildlife habitat.  These plants also filter surface water runoff and protect the shoreline from wave and boat traffic induced erosion.  Aquatic plants also help to maintain water quality by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Lake Andrew is known as a quality fishing lake.  Walleye are relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 12 fish/net in 2003, which meets the goal stated in the Lake Management Plan.  Walleye have been stocked in five of the last six years to increase abundance and meet the Lake Management Plan goal. Natural reproduction also occurs and has produced strong year classes in the past.Northern pike are also abundant.  However, average size of the fish is relatively small.  An experimental 24-inch maximum length limit was imposed in 1997 in an attempt to improve the size structure of the northern pike population.  Only eight percent of the fish captured in 2003 were larger than 24 inches, and anglers seem unwilling to harvest the smaller fish.     Lake Andrew also provides quality panfishing opportunities.  Bluegill and black crappie are both relatively abundant, and good growth rates allow both species to reach quality sizes.  Largemouth bass are also abundant and have a desirable size structure.  The large expanses of bulrush and cattail along the north and west shoreline provide quality habitat for these three fish species.  These areas must be protected to maintain desirable fish populations    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The scheduled fish community assessment was completed in mid-June.  Catch efficiency of gillnets and trapnets was very poor.  For example, only two black crappie and one bluegill were captured in 12 trapnet sets.  Gillnet catches of  walleye and northern pike  were atypically low in comparison to catch records from preceding surveys.  Low catches of walleye in survey gear was inconsistent with expectations of multiple strong year classes of young walleye recruiting into the fishery. These expectations were based on high elecrofishing catches of young-of-year walleye during fall natural reproduction checks.  Low walleye catches during the 2011 survey was also inconsistent with catch reports of anglers.  Fishing success for walleye during the 2011 fishing season was exceptional, albeit most catches were 12.0 - 14.0 inch fish. <br> \n <br> \nBased on great divergence of 2011 gamefish catches from preceding survey statistics and inconsistency of survey catch statistics with angling reports, it is deemed that 2011 survey records under-represent abundance of most gamefishes and actual fishing potential.  Another survey is scheduled for completion in 2012 to validate findings or more accurately describe gamefish abundance, size distribution, and fishery attributes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Andrew Lake was conducted on July 5-14, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 11 stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program Staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Bowfin catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes.   <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Andrew Lake is likely adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by a FIBI score barely above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
