                "narrative": "<p>Upper South Long Lake is a 802 acre lake located about 8 miles southeast of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the southwest shore.  The lake is heavily developed with 31 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1999 data.  Many of these are small seasonal cabins and conversion of these may be an issue in the future.  The maximum depth is 47' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, marl, and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 43 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lillies are still relatively common along much of the shoreline, although the overall area has diminished in recent years.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2004 walleye catch of 1.9/gill net was below average and the lowest catch since 1979.  Eight different year classes were represented with both natural reproduction and stocking accounting for the current population.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 15.0\" and 1.2 lbs in 1999 to 16.9\" and 1.7 lbs in 2004.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2004 at 9.7/gill net.  This is the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight decreased from 25.6\" and 4.1 lbs in 1999 to 23.1\" and 2.9 lbs in 2004.  Growth was relatively good with 35% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  The 2001 year class was most abundant, representing 50% of the catch and measuring approximately 19-24\".  The largemouth bass abundance of 0.7/trap net is average when compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 113.1/hr with an average length of 13.1\" and 66% measuring at least 12\". The 2004 bluegill catch declined from 1999, but at 22.8/trap net, it is typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in good numbers when compared to similar lakes, however, size was small.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The 2004 tullibee catch was average at 2.1/gill net and is comparable to similar lakes.  Yellow perch abundance has varied widely in the past, ranging from 1.8 to 50.3/gill net.  The 2004 catch of 11.1/gill net is average when compared to this and similar lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper South Long Lake is an 802 acre lake located about 8 miles southeast of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the southwest shore.  The lake is heavily developed with 31 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1999 data.  Many of these are small seasonal cabins and conversion of these may be an issue in the future.  The maximum depth is 47' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, marl, and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 43 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lillies are still relatively common along much of the shoreline, although the overall area has diminished in recent years.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nThe 2007 walleye catch of 1.8/gill net was below average and the lowest catch since 1979.  Five different year classes were represented with the 2005 year class (age 2) accounting for 62% of the current population.  Average length and weight were 13.9\" and 1.1 lbs in 2007.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2007 at 3.5/gill net.  Average length and weight were 25.0\" and 3.4 lbs in 2007.  Growth was relatively good with 60% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  \n\nThe largemouth bass abundance of 0.6/trap net is average when compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 97/hr with an average length of 10.8\" and 38% measuring at least 12\". \n\nThe 2007 bluegill catch of 21.4/trap net is typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in good numbers when compared to similar lakes, however size was small.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and were caught in low numbers in 2007. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper South Long is an 802 acre lake located 8 miles southeast of Brainerd.  The lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet with 34% of the lake being shallower than 15 feet.  The lake has moderate fertility and water clarity was very good in 1999.  The aquatic plant community is rather diverse with abundant submerged vegetation present. Scattered beds of waterlilies and bulrush beds around the shoreline have been diminishing in size in recent years.  These beds are very important for spawning habitat and water quality.  The surrounding shoreline consists of a mixed forest with some nice red pine stands along the gentle to steep sloped shoreline.  Heavy development consists of homes, cottages and two resorts.  Walleye numbers in the 1999 survey of 5.1 fish/net was higher than previous surveys and comparable to similar type lakes.  Seven age classes were present with three of the age classes comprising 77% of the catch.  Average size was 15.0 inches and weighed 1.2 lbs.  Growth rates were normal.  The northern pike catch rate of 1.8 fish/net is below normal for this lake type however comparable to past nettings for this lake. Fish  ranged from 14.4 to 33.3 inches with an average size of 25.6 inches.  Ages four and younger comprised 80% of the catch.  Growth rates were slightly above normal.  Fishing pressure may be the reason so few older walleye and northern pike exist.    Largemouth bass were present in above normal numbers with size ranging from 5.0 to 15.4 inches.  Growth rates are a little below normal.  Historically Upper South Long has been a very good crappie lake and a catch rate of 2.2 fish/net in 1999 is normal for this lake type.  Average size was 7.9 inches.  Bluegill numbers were high and 97% were under 7.0 inches.  Growth rates were normal.  Yellow perch were found in low numbers at 4.1 fish/net.  Tullibee and white sucker were found in moderate numbers.</p>",

Average size was 15.8\" and 85% were 12\" or longer. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population looked pretty good.  While numbers were average (5.6/gill net), size was decent, with an average length of 25.0\" and 27% of the fish were above the 22\"-26\" protected slot.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nThe bass population looked healthy, with an electrofishing catch rate of 94.3/hr. run-time.  Average length was 11.4\" and 48% of the fish were 12\" or larger, with fish up to 17.5\". <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish on Upper South Long appeared to be small.  The average bluegill length was 5.2\" (only 4% were 7\" or larger) and only 18% of the black crappie were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper South Long Lake is a 795-acre lake with a maximum depth of 47 feet.  Residential development is evident along much of the shoreline. The riparian zone has been altered in many areas; trees have been removed along much of the shoreline and manicured lawns extending to the water's edge and rip rap is common.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted on Upper South Long Lake on 1-2 July, 2013 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 14 stations around the perimeter of Upper South Long Lake.  Sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining (15 ft or 50 ft) was conducted at 13 sites. Emergent vegetation and soft sediments prevented seining at one site.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured a large number of species of fish including: (in alphabetical order) Banded Killifish, Black crappie, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Pike, Pugnose Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore survey of Upper South Long Lake captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality including: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass. One tolerant species, Green Sunfish, was sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data to develop an IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) score which is indicative of the health of Upper South Long Lake. This sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in development in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper South Long is an 802 acre lake located about seven miles southeast of Brainerd.  A public access is present on the southwest shore.  About 34% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  This is a hardwater lake.  Water clarity is somewhat below average for the area.  Shallow water soils are mainly sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species like bulrush are important because they often provide preferred spawning sites for bass and panfish species.  Submergent plants grow to a depth of about 10 feet in the lake.  These species provide important hiding and feeding areas for a variety of fish species.Walleyes, largemouth bass and northern pike were important gamefish species found in the 1994 netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, walleyes were found in \"average\" numbers.  Ages 2-7 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 1.1 lbs. in '94.  About 63% of walleyes sampled were from the 1988, '90 and '92 year classes, when fingerlings stocking was done; the other 37% were from years when no stocking was done.  Largemouth bass were also caught in \"average\" numbers.  Ages 1-5 were sampled and growth was good.  About 50% of the bass sampled were from the 1991 year class.  A number of young bass were taken in shoreline seining.  The northern pike catch was \"low\" compared to similar type lakes but appeared \"typical\" when compared to previous nettings of this lake.  Ages 2-4 were sampled, in uniform numbers, and growth appeared good.  Average size was about 2.0 lbs..Yellow perch, tullibees and white suckers are important food sources for the lake's gamefish.  All were found in \"average\" numbers in '94.  Yellow perch and tullibee were found in \"low\" numbers in the 1989 netting, while the sucker catch was very similar to the '94 catch.Bluegills and black crappies are important panfish species found in the lake.  Bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers and the catch was similar to that from the 1989 netting.  Ages 2-7 were sampled and growth was slow.  Nearly one-half of the bluegills were from the 1989 year class.  The catch of black crappies was also \"average\" and similar to that found in 1989.  Crappies had good growth.  All crappies aged were from the 1991 year class.Other species caught in '94 included black and brown bullheads, in low numbers; as well as dogfish (bowfin) and yellow bullheads, in average numbers.  Golden shiners and greater redhorse were sampled in the lake for the first tine in 1994.</p>",
