The lake's watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development.   In addition to the highly agricultural use surrounding the lake, the association also has a diversion that is used to augment water levels in the lake by pumping water from the Watonwan River to Long Lake on the east end of the lake.  Long Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Long Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 26, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nOne young-of-the year Walleye was captured for a rate of 2.5 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was not successful.

Long Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake has a troubling recent stretch of history involving serval fish kills. A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2022 with gill nets and trap nets.  Following the survey, there was a fish kill event in September that caused a large amount of Black Crappie to die.  While the amount of fish dead was unknown, the estimated number was easily in the thousands.  A follow-up survey was done in October with 1 gill net and 3 trap nets in an attempt to determine the extent of the fish kill.  Results of that survey indicate that all species are still present, but likely a large percentage of Black Crappie greater than 8 inches likely experienced mortality. Finally, and unfortunately, the winter of 2022-2023 was long and harsh and resulted in many shallow southern Minnesota lakes experiencing winterkill. Long Lake was included in those lakes experiencing winterkill. Another survey was conducted in May 2023 to determine the extent of the winterkill. The survey indicated a partial winterkill that left many undesirable fish species and a lake that needed to be restocked with gamefish.  <br> \n <br> \nIn May 2023, 128,000 Walleye fry (Lower Mississippi Strain from Lake Sarah egg-take) were stocked. An October daytime electrofishing survey confirmed that the Walleye stocking was very successful with 226 6.1 inch age-0 Walleye caught in 30 minutes of electrofishing (452 per hour extrapolation). This is very encouraging as it is the most age-0 Walleye ever documented (stocked or natural) in a single year class for Long Lake. Contingent upon survivability of the fish in Long Lake over the next year or two, Long Lake is well suited for a big bounce back recovery. Minnesota Walleye research shows that age-0 Walleye over 5-6 inches have a very good chance of survival to older ages. Additional Walleye stocking will occur as well as additional fish sampling conducted to verify the recovery of the Walleye in Long Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264 acre lake located just south of St. James, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet and is fairly clear compared to other lakes in this area.  Long Lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species with black crappie, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and channel catfish managed secondarily.  The walleye catch rate in 1998 was somewhat on the low side compared to lakes similar to Long.  Lengths of walleye ranged from 14 to 23 inches and averaged about 20 inches.  The average weight of walleye sampled during the 1998 survey were just under three pounds.  The lake was stocked with walleye fry in 1998 as part of a genetic study being done by the University of Minnesota.The black crappie catch rate was high during the 1998 survey compared to lakes similar to Long.  The population appears to have increased since 1990.  Lengths from crappies sampled in trap nets ranged from 4 to 12 inches with an average length of 10 inches.  The black crappies averaged about 1/4 lb.The number of bluegills in 1998 was similar to the number of bluegills in 1994.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches.  The average weight of bluegill sampled in trap nets was 0.2 lbs.  Yellow perch catch rate in 1998 was high compared to lakes similar to Long.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Many of the fish were in the 6.5 inch range and should provide good fishing opportunities over the next couple of years. Other species captured during the 1998 population assessment included channel catfish, largemouth bass, black bullhead, white sucker, common carp and freshwater drum.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Long Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

THE MAJORITY OF THE BLCS COLLECTED WERE 8 TO 9 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH.  THE BLG CPUE OF 1.25 WAS BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  THE 1990 CPUE WAS ALSO BELOW THE 1985 CATCH RATES.  BLG GROWTH WAS NEAR AVERAGE FOR LAKES IN THE WINDOM AREA. NOP, CAP AND YEP CATCH RATES WERE ALL BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS.  ADDITIONALLY, CATCH RATES FOR EACH SPECIES DECLINED FROM THE 1985 SURVEY.  THE BLB TRAP NET CATCH OF 65.8 FISH PER NET WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN, HOWEVER, IT REPRESENTS A THREE-FOLD INCREASE OVER THE 1985 CATCH.

Walleye numbers have increased over the last four years according to our most recent survey in 1994.  Lengths ranged from 9.5 to almost 26 inches and the average weight from fish in gillnets was almost 2.7 lbs.  Many of the walleye sampled were in the 17 to 21 inch range.  Local anglers reported good success on walleye up to 9 lbs with several fish above 6 lbs.Black crappie and bluegill numbers have also increased since 1990 according to our survey.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 6 to 10 inches with most of the crappie in the 8 inch category.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 5.5 to 8 inches with the majority of the fish in the 7 inch range.  The channel catfish population appears to be good in Long Lake.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 17 inches.  Black bullhead numbers are low in Long Lake according to our survey.  Of the black bullhead that were sampled, the majority of fish were in the 10 to 11 inch range.Yellow perch numbers have also increased in Long Lake since 1990.  The majority of fish were age 2 and should provide some excellent angling in 1995 and 1996.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a 264-acre lake located 5 miles south of St. James in Watonwan County.  Long is managed for walleye primarily while black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are managed as a secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate of 1.0 fish/net in 2010 was nearly equivalent to 2006.  The gill net catch rate was slightly higher in 2002 when 3.6 fish/net were caught.  The average length of fish caught in gill nets was only 10 inches; however, the average length caught near shore in our trap nets was 21.4 inches.  This may indicate that at the time of the survey, the larger fish were near shore foraging.  Starting in 2011 we will be trying a new stocking strategy to try and improve net catches in the future.  We typically stock walleye fingerlings (8-10 inches long) in the fall of the year.  Starting in 2011 we will be stocking higher numbers, but smaller sized walleye in the late spring to early summer. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were also low in Long Lake based on our survey results in 2010.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 inches and averaged 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in Long Lake in 2010.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from  6.1 to 9.7 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Bluegill were also caught in our trap nets in 2010.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 5.9 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWe do not manage for northern pike in Long Lake but a fair population is present.  The average length of northern pike caught in our nets was 25.8 inches with one fish over 35 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWe did not electrofish with a boat for largemouth bass in 2010 to assess the population but local anglers on the lake some very nice largemouth bass are present in Long Lake.  Largemouth bass were sampled with shoreline seines and a back pack electrofishing unit. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were also down but appear to be higher than they were in 2006.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 6.0 to 11.1 inches and averaged 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe freshwater drum gill net CPUE of 39.3 fish/net in 2010 was the highest ever recorded on Long Lake.  The gillnet CPUE in 2010 was over twice as high as the gill net CPUE of 15.0 fish/net in 2006 and almost 10 times higher than the catch rate of 3.4 fish/net in 2002.  Lengths of freshwater drum caught in gill nets ranged from 8 to 16 inches and averaged 10 inches.  The freshwater drum population was dominated by fish in the 8 to 9.5 inch range.  This strong year class impacted the 2010 gill net catch rate. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in our nets during the fish survey included common carp, channel catfish, green sunfish, and fathead minnows. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Long Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264-acre, class 43 lake, located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development.  In addition to the highly agricultural use surrounding the lake, the association also has a diversion that is used to augment water levels in the lake by pumping water from the Watonwan River to Long Lake on the east end of the lake.  Long Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2022 with gill nets trap nets.  Following the survey, there was a fish kill event in September that caused a large amount of Black Crappie to die.  While the amount of fish dead was unknown, the estimated number was easily in the thousands.  A follow-up survey was done in October with 1 gill net and 3 trap nets in an attempt to determine the extent of the fish kill.  Results of that survey indicate that all species are still present, but likely a large percentage of Black Crappie greater than 8 inches experienced mortality. Finally, and unfortunately, the winter of 2022-2023 was long and harsh and resulted in many shallow southern Minnesota lakes experiencing winterkill. Long Lake was included in those lakes experiencing winterkill. Another survey was conducted in May 2023 to determine the extent of the winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nSeven species were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Black Bullhead were most abundant by biomass (93.7%) followed by Bigmouth Buffalo (2.2%), Common Carp (2.0%), Northern Pike (1.9%), and all other species (Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead) less than 1%.  <br> \n <br> \nIt was apparent after seeing the amount of Black Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Common Carp biomass in the gill nets and trap nets that there was a partial winterkill. The partial winterkill left tolerant species in much greater abundance than the other remaining gamefish species (Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch). Therefore, a restocking effort was undertaken in Long Lake. Walleye fry (128,000 lower Mississippi strain from Lake Sarah egg-take operation) were stocked in May. Black Crappie were also restocked in May (105 broodstock adult fish pre-spawn) in order to boost the low density population that remained. Bluegill and Largemouth Bass (both pre-spawn) were stocked in June with 675 adult Bluegill and 18 spawning pair (36 total) of adult Largemouth Bass. Finally, in order to add to the Northern Pike population 497 fall fingerling (7 fish/pound) were stocked. These fish should do well in Long Lake and result in a fishable population of each species a year or two from now. An October daytime electrofishing survey confirmed that the Walleye stocking was successful with 226 fish that averaged 6.1 inches in 30 minutes of electrofishing (452 per hour extrapolation). This is very encouraging as it is quite possibly the most age-0 Walleye ever observed in a single year class for Long Lake. Contingent upon survivability of the fish in Long Lake over the next year or two, Long Lake is well suited for a big bounce back recovery. Additional stocking to augment the fish community as well as additional fish sampling will be conducted to verify the recovery of the fish in Long Lake.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264-acre, 13 foot deep, low-complexity shoreline lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development.  In addition to the highly agricultural use surrounding the lake, the association also has a diversion that is used to augment water levels in the lake by pumping water from the Watonwan River to Long Lake on the east end of the lake.  Long Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2022 with 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and seven trap nets.  Following the survey, there was a fish kill event in September that caused a large amount of Black Crappie to die.  While the amount of fish dead was unknown, the estimated number was easily in the thousands.  Samples of dead fish from the fish kill were sent to the DNR pathology lab in St. Paul. Results were inconclusive and showed no single known cause of the fish kill. A follow-up survey was done in October with 1 gill net and 3 trap nets to determine the extent of the fish kill.  Results of that survey indicate that all species are still present, but many Black Crappie have been eliminated.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring July, 12 species were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Black Crappie were most abundant by biomass (23.9%) followed by Common Carp (18.3%), Bluegill (17.6%), Freshwater Drum (13.8%), and Black Bullhead (11.0%) with all other species (Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Channel Catfish) less than 5% each.  Long Lake is actively managed for Walleye primarily followed by Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. Each managed species is discussed in the following paragraphs.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have typically done poorly in Long Lake, as catch rates have averaged 1.6 per gill net and have not exceeded 3.0 per gill net since 2002 despite aggressive stockings over its history.  The 2022 catch rate of 0.7 per gill net was similar to catches in the mid-to-late 1990's and was less than the expected range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Two Walleye, 24.8 inches and 26.5 inches, were caught in the gill net sample.  Since the early 1990s, various stocking strategies including fry, frylings (an intermediate size fish), fingerlings, yearlings and adults have been employed to increase Walleye abundance, with little success.  Regardless of stocking strategy, abundance continued to be very low, thus fry stocking (cheapest method) began again in 2017 at a frequency of three out of 4 years at 500 per littoral acre.  The management goal was not met because the catch rate did not exceed 5.0 per gill net.  The management goal will need to be adjusted in the future to reflect an inability to produce a consistent Walleye population.  While a large population of Walleye may not be possible in Long Lake, large individual Walleye have been caught and continue to be sampled and caught in the lake.  Walleye appeared to be spared from any negative impacts from the September fish kill.  Abundance and size of Walleye in the October sample (3 total Walleye all over 19 inches) was similar to the summer sample (4 total Walleye all over 20 inches).     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high in 2022.  The catch rate was 38.1 per trap net, higher than the long term average of 32.9 per trap net, and exceeding the interquartile range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  The 2022 catch rate was a decrease from 57.3 per trap net observed in 2018 but still above relative abundances observed since 2002 (64.75 per trap net).  Additionally, the gill net catch rate was the greatest ever observed at 79.0 per net verifying an extremely abundant population.  Black Crappie ranged from 6.2 inches to 10.4 inches (8.4 inch average) in the trap net sample and ranged from 4.5 inches to 9.5 inches (7.4 inch average) in the gill net sample.  Condition of Black Crappie was average.  Interestingly, condition of Black Crappie in the gill net and trap net samples declined as length increased indicating some density dependent stress among larger individuals.  It appeared as if the Black Crappie over 8 inches were experiencing some stress.  After the fish kill in September, the gill net catch rate of Black Crappie was 11.00 per gill net.  While the catch rate was nearly 7 times less than the summer sample amount of 79.0 per net, the post kill catch rate was still within the normal range (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  Trap nets only caught 5 Black Crappie during the post kill sampling.  Black Crappie ranged from 3.8 inches to 7.7 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches in the gill net sample while they ranged from 7.3 inches to 7.7 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches in the trap nets.  It is apparent that many larger Black Crappie over 8 inches likely experienced mortality during the fish kill.  While this is concerning, due to poor water quality from heavy algae blooms, the remaining Black Crappie will have less competition for resources and should have excellent growth over the next several years.    <br> \n   <br> \nIn 2022, the Bluegill catch rate was 48.6 per trap net.  This catch rate is the greatest on record, dating back to 1985 and is more than twice the long-term average of 16.9 per trap net.  Prior to 2022, trap net catch rates have only been above the upper quartile value of 20.0 per trap net twice (2002 and 2006).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 5.4 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.2 inches, with 77 percent of Bluegill being greater than 7.0 inches in length.  Fortunately, it appears the September fish kill didn't have much effect at all on the Bluegill population as 19.0 per trap net were caught in October.  In October, Bluegill ranged in length from 4.1 inches to 8.1 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Thirty-five percent of Bluegill were over 7.0 inches.  Bluegill are a bright spot in the fish community in Long Lake.  The management goal was met because a fishable population of Bluegill exists.  A robust Bluegill population with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as predators may be the best fish management scenario for Long Lake moving forward.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2022 was 10.0 per gill net, within the interquartile range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net) but less than the long-term average of 33.3 per gill net.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Body condition of Yellow Perch was good, indicating that they are feeding successfully.  Yellow Perch were present in similar relative abundance (12.0 per gill net) and length (6.1 inches to 7.4 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches) during the post fish kill survey in October indicating little change in the Yellow Perch population.  The management goal was met because a fishable population of Yellow Perch is present in Long Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOf the species not discussed above, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and Black Bullhead were the most abundant by biomass.  They have been long-time members of the fish community and continue to have an important presence in the community.  Of the species with less than 5% biomass during the July survey, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike are the most notable.  Largemouth Bass are not easily sampled with gill nets or trap nets so this relative abundance is most likely less than what is actually in the lake.  Largemouth Bass angling has been very good in Long Lake over the past 5 years, and this should continue.  Electrofishing may need to be done to properly assess the relative abundance of Largemouth Bass.  Northern Pike are a very important top predator in Minnesota Lakes, especially where crappie and Bluegill are numerous.  Only 1 Northern Pike was sampled in 2022. As a result, Northern Pike fall fingerlings (102 fish 12-14 inches) were stocked in October.  Those fish should add an important top predator to the population and help to control the abundant Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nEven after the significant Black Crappie kill during the late summer of 2022, Long Lake is poised for a bright angling future.  Bluegill are abundant, and of a decent size for anglers.  Largemouth Bass angling is good and Northern Pike abundance is on the rise with the recent stocking.  The only negative is the lack of consistent Walleye abundance.  Walleye stocking may need to focus on adding yearling fish when they are available in local production ponds.  Additionally, continued Northern Pike stocking should occur as they are available to provide a predator presence to control reproduction of non-managed species as well as aid in balancing an abundant Bluegill population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLong Lake is a 264-acre lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock rip rap or sand blankets, which disrupt the natural riparian buffer. Agriculture and riparian development likely cause poor water quality in the form of algae blooms. Adding more nutrients to the system through a diversion pump from the South Fork of the Watonwan River likely does not help algal blooms.  In an effort to mitigate the algae blooms, Long Lake is sporadically treated with copper sulfate, temporarily improving water clarity. Copper sulfate treatments likely have adverse effects on the food web in Long Lake because it kills algae, the main food source for zooplankton and other aquatic invertebrates, which are prey for small fish, which are eventually prey for large predators such as walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass. Long Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. A combination of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012, with the current stocking regime calling for walleye frylings to be stocked two out of three years (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015). Other management species have not been stocked in recent years. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 23, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and seven trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nCatch rates of walleye in Long Lake have historically been low, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 2006 to 4.0 per gill net in 1985. In 2014, the walleye catch rate was 2.3 per gill net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Since the early 1990s, various stocking strategies including fry, frylings, and fingerlings have been employed to increase walleye abundance, with little success. Currently, walleye frylings are being stocked two out of three years at a rate of 150 fish per littoral acre (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018). Age estimates from otoliths (ear bones in walleyes) indicated the presence of four year-classes from 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Three of the four year-classes correspond to years in which stocking occurred. The one walleye from the 2006 year-class (non-stocking year) may be a result of natural reproduction or was moved from another water body to Long Lake. Walleyes ranged from 11.1 to 24.1 inches and averaged 16.6 inches. Growth of walleye in Long Lake is slow. Mean length at age-3 for Long Lake walleye was 14.2 inches while the mean length for age-3 walleye from similar lakes was 17.7 inches. Walleyes were somewhat skinny, indicating that prey is available but not overly abundant. Although early indications are that this stocking strategy has not significantly increased walleye abundance, fryling stocking should continue until the next scheduled survey in 2018 to fully evaluate this strategy. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie abundance in Long Lake has been highly variable, with catch rates ranging from 0.0 per trap net in 1990 to 64.8 per trap net in 2002. In 2014, the black crappie catch rate was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) at 1.0 per trap net, down significantly from the 2010 catch rate of 23.8 per trap net. Black crappie ranged in length from 3.9 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. Black crappie appeared to be plump, indicating black crappie are foraging successfully. The decreased abundance of black crappie is likely a result of a lack of recruitment in recent years. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. This variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a \"boom-or-bust\" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates.  <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nSimilar to 2010 (0.9 per trap net), bluegill were captured at a rate of 0.7 per trap net in 2014 which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net). Since 1990, bluegill catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 1990 to 35.9 per trap net in 2002, and have averaged 11.6 per trap net. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 7.0 inches and averaged 4.2 inches. Despite their low abundance and small size structure, bluegills appear to be reproducing in Long Lake, as evidence by 389 young-of-the-year (YOY) \"sunfish\" being captured in a July 2014 near shore survey.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nLong Lake's yellow perch population was at an all-time high in 1998 when they were captured at a rate of 51.0 per gill net. Since, the population gradually declined to 2.0 per gill net in 2010. It appears that the population has rebounded significantly in 2014, as yellow perch were captured at a rate of 20.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Despite the increase in catch rate, yellow perch were small, ranging from 5.3 to 10.2 inches and averaging 6.3 inches. The majority of yellow perch sampled were less than 6.5 inches in length (80 percent). Yellow perch were plump, indicating that they are foraging successfully. In two or three years, yellow perch should reach a length acceptable to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \nIn 2014, largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 21.0 per hour, which is the highest bass electrofishing catch rate observed on Long Lake since 1995. Prior catch rates ranged from 2.0 per hour in 1998 to 8.0 per hour in 1995. Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 21.0 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. Only three largemouth bass over 9.0 inches were sampled, with the majority (86 percent) being approximately 6.0 to 8.0 inches in length. Three year classes of largemouth bass were sampled including fish from 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), and 2007 (age-7). Age-1 largemouth bass averaged 7.0 inches and age-2 bass averaged 8.0 inches. According to anglers and lakeshore owners, large bass are present and should continue to provide a good angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nNorthern pike are not managed in Long Lake, but the population maintains itself at low levels. The 2014 catch rate was the same as the 2010 catch rate, 1.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). Northern pike lengths ranged from 18.0 to 25.0 inches and averaged 21.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance has remained low since 1990. The trend continued in 2014, as the black bullhead catch rate (25.7 per gill net) did not exceed the low end of expected catch rates for similar lakes. Black bullheads ranged in length from 7.6 to 11.4 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance has steadily declined since the high in 1994 (25.2 per gill net) to 3.3 per gill net in 2014. This catch rate is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. <br> \nFreshwater drum abundance in gill nets declined from 39.3 per gill net in 2010 to 8.7 per gill net in 2014. Conversely, trap net catches of freshwater drum increased from 2.4 per trap net in 2010 to 4.7 per trap net in 2014. Both gill net and trap net catch rates in 2014 exceed the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (8.3 per gill net; 3.3 per trap net). Freshwater drum ranged from 13.3 to 19.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264-acre, 13 foot deep, low-complexity shoreline lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development.  In addition to the highly agricultural use surrounding the lake, the association also has a diversion that is used to augment water levels in the lake by pumping water from the Watonwan River to Long Lake on the east end of the lake.  Long Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2022 with 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and seven trap nets.  Following the survey, there was a fish kill event in September that caused a large amount of Black Crappie to die.  While the amount of fish dead was unknown, the estimated number was easily in the thousands.  Samples of dead fish from the fish kill were sent to the DNR pathology lab in St. Paul. Results were inconclusive and showed no single known cause of the fish kill. A follow-up survey was done in October with 1 gill net and 3 trap nets to determine the extent of the fish kill.  Results of that survey indicate that all species are still present, but many Black Crappie have been eliminated.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring July, 12 species were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Black Crappie were most abundant by biomass (23.9%) followed by Common Carp (18.3%), Bluegill (17.6%), Freshwater Drum (13.8%), and Black Bullhead (11.0%) with all other species (Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Channel Catfish) less than 5% each.  Long Lake is actively managed for Walleye primarily followed by Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. Each managed species is discussed in the following paragraphs.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have typically done poorly in Long Lake, as catch rates have averaged 1.6 per gill net and have not exceeded 3.0 per gill net since 2002.  Since the early 1990s, various stocking strategies including fry, frylings (an intermediate size fish), fingerlings, yearlings and adults have been employed to increase Walleye abundance, with little success.  The 2022 catch rate of 0.7 per gill net was similar to catches in the mid-to-late 1990's and was less than the normal range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Two Walleye, 24.8 inches and 26.5 inches, were caught in the gill net sample.    Regardless of stocking strategy, abundance continued to be very low, thus fry stocking (cheapest method) began again in 2017 at a frequency of three out of 4 years at 500 per littoral acre.  The management goal was not met because the catch rate did not exceed 5.0 per gill net.  The management goal will need to be adjusted in the future to reflect an inability to produce a consistent abundant Walleye population.  While a large population of Walleye may not be possible in Long Lake, large individual Walleye have been caught and continue to be sampled and caught in the lake.  Walleye appeared to be spared from any negative impacts from the September fish kill.  Abundance and size of Walleye remaining the October sample (3 total Walleye all over 19 inches) was similar to the summer sample (4 total Walleye all over 20 inches).     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was extremely high in the mid-summer sampling in 2022.  The catch rate was 38.1 per trap net, higher than the long term average of 32.9 per trap net, and exceeding the normal range of catch rates for this class of lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  The 2022 catch rate was a decrease from 57.3 per trap net observed in 2018 but still above relative abundances observed since 2002 (64.75 per trap net).  Additionally, the gill net catch rate was the greatest ever observed at 79.0 per net verifying an extremely abundant population.  Black Crappie ranged from 6.2 inches to 10.4 inches (8.4 inch average) in the trap net sample and ranged from 4.5 inches to 9.5 inches (7.4 inch average) in the gill net sample.  Condition of Black Crappie was average.  Interestingly, condition of Black Crappie in the gill net and trap net samples declined as length increased indicating some density dependent stress among larger individuals.  It appeared as if the Black Crappie over 8 inches were experiencing some stress.  After the fish kill in September, the gill net catch rate of Black Crappie was 11.00 per gill net.  While the catch rate declined nearly 7 times less than the summer sample amount of 79.0 per net, the post kill catch rate was still within the normal range (1.4 to 13.8 per gill net).  Trap nets only caught 5 Black Crappie during the post kill sampling.  Black Crappie ranged from 3.8 inches to 7.7 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches in the gill net sample while they ranged from 7.3 inches to 7.7 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches in the trap nets.  It is apparent that many larger Black Crappie over 8 inches were lost due to the fish kill.  While this is concerning, due to poor water quality from heavy algae blooms, the remaining Black Crappie will have less competition for resources and should have excellent growth over the next several years.    <br> \n   <br> \nIn 2022, the Bluegill catch rate was 48.6 per trap net.  This catch rate is the greatest on record, dating back to 1985 and is more than twice the long-term average of 16.9 per trap net.  Prior to 2022, trap net catch rates have only been above the upper normal range of 20.0 per trap net twice (2002 and 2006).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 5.4 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.2 inches, with 77 percent of Bluegill being greater than 7.0 inches in length.  Fortunately, it appears the September fish kill didn't have a large effect on the Bluegill population as 19.0 per trap net were caught in October.  In October, Bluegill ranged in length from 4.1 inches to 8.1 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Thirty-five percent of Bluegill were over 7.0 inches.  Bluegill are a bright spot in the fish community in Long Lake.  The management goal was met because a fishable population of Bluegill exists.  A robust Bluegill population with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as predators may be the best fish management scenario for Long Lake moving forward.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2022 was 10.0 per gill net, within the normal range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net) but less than the long-term average of 33.3 per gill net.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Body condition of Yellow Perch was good, indicating that they are foraging successfully.  Yellow Perch were present in similar relative abundance (12.0 per gill net) and length (6.1 inches to 7.4 inches with a mean length of 6.7 inches) during the post fish kill survey in October indicating little change in the Yellow Perch population.  The management goal was met because a fishable population of Yellow Perch is present in Long Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOf the species not discussed above, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, and Black Bullhead were the most abundant by biomass.  They have been long-time members of the fish community and continue to have an important presence in the community.  Of the species with less than 5% biomass during the July survey, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike are the most notable.  Largemouth Bass are not easily sampled with gill nets or trap nets so this relative abundance is most likely less than what is actually in the lake.  Largemouth Bass angling has been very good in Long Lake over the past 5 years, and this should continue.  Electrofishing may need to be done to properly assess the relative abundance of Largemouth Bass.  Northern Pike are a very important top predator in Minnesota Lakes, especially where crappie and Bluegill are numerous.  Only 1 Northern Pike was sampled in 2022. As a result, Northern Pike fall fingerlings (102 fish 12-14 inches) were stocked in October.  Those fish should add an important top predator to the population and help to control the abundant Bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \nEven after the significant Black Crappie kill during the late summer of 2022, Long Lake is poised for a bright angling future.  Bluegill are abundant, and of a decent size for anglers.  Largemouth Bass angling is good and Northern Pike abundance is on the rise with the recent stocking.  The only negative is the lack of consistent Walleye abundance.  Walleye stocking may need to focus on adding yearling fish when they are available in local production ponds.  Additionally, continued Northern Pike stocking should occur as they are available to provide a predator presence to control reproduction of non-managed species as well as aid in balancing an abundant Bluegill population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long is a 264 acre lake located south of St. James in Watonwan County.  The lake has 4.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 13 feet.  The lake is managed for walleye primarily while black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, and largemouth bass are managed secondarily.The walleye population is similar to other lakes like Long Lake.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 16.5 inches to 24.0 inches and averaged 18.7 inches.  The majority of the fish sampled were three years old.Long Lake has a good yellow perch population according to our net catches.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 4.4 to 10.2 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  Five consecutive age groups of perch were observed during the survey which means there is consistent recruitment.Long Lake has had a long history of good black crappie populations.  The population once again is high when compared to lake similar to Long Lake.  Lengths of crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 10.8 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  The reason the average length was so small was because 89% of the fish sampled were one year old.The bluegill population also looks good when compared to other lakes like Long Lake.  The catch rate was 35.9 in 2002 compared to 4.8 in 1998 and 5.8 in 1994.  Lengths of bluegill caught in our trap nets ranged from 2.8 to 8.4 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  The northern pike population is high when compared to lakes like Long Lake.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 8.2 to 31.7 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  The largest northern pike sampled was in a trap net and was 38.3 inches in length.The number of largemouth bass caught while electrofishing was similar to the catch rate in 1994.  Local bass clubs do on occasion hold bass fishing tournaments on the lake.  Lengths of largemouth bass sampled during the survey ranged from 7.6 to 15.1 inches and averaged 11.0 inches.  Two, three, and four year old bass were caught during the survey.The black bullhead population is similar to other lakes like Long Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead captured in our nets ranged from 10.2 to 12.2 inches and average 10.8 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Long Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264-acre lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development.  Long Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 16, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and seven trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have typically done poorly in Long Lake, as catch rates have averaged 1.7 per gill net and have not exceeded 4.0 per gill net since 1985.  The 2018 catch rate of 2.0 per gill net was similar to historical catches and was not within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 16.5 to 24.6 inches and averaged 19.6 inches.  Since the early 1990s, various stocking strategies including fry, frylings, fingerlings, yearlings and adults have been employed to increase walleye abundance, with little success.  Regardless of stocking strategy, abundance continued to be very low, thus fry stocking (cheapest method) began again in 2017 at a frequency of three out of 4 years at 500 per littoral acre.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Black Crappie catch rate was 57.3 per trap net, higher than the long term average of 31.3 per trap net, and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  The 2018 catch rate was a drastic increase from 1.0 per trap net observed in 2014.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.1 to 10.4 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Long Lake Crappie fishing should be good for the next couple of years.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 2010, Bluegill abundance has been very low in Long Lake, as catch rates were less than 1.0 per trap net prior to 2018.  In 2018, the Bluegill catch rate was 17.3 per trap net, higher than the long term average of 12.4 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 4.2 to 8.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches, with 65 percent of Bluegill being greater than 7.5 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was the highest catch rate ever observed in Long Lake at 199.0 per gill net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 9.5 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  The high abundance of Yellow Perch in Long Lake should bode well for anglers looking for Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are not managed in Long Lake, but the population maintains itself at low levels. The 2018 catch rate was 2.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). Northern pike lengths ranged from 21.3 to 35.6 inches and averaged 25.9 inches.  Long Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance has remained low since 1990. The trend continued in 2018, as the black bullhead catch rate was 25.0 per gill net.  Black bullheads ranged in length from 4.8 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance has steadily declined since the high in 1994 (25.2 per gill net) to 0.5 per gill net in 2014. This catch rate is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 13.8 per gill net).  Other species sampled included Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Hybrid Sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a 264-acre lake located in Watonwan County just south of St. James.  The lake has 4.7 miles of shoreline and is a class 43 lake.  Long is managed for walleye primarily while black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, and largemouth bass are managed secondarily.  Walleye fingerlings are presently stocked every other year in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLong Lake has a fair walleye population when compared to other lakes with similar characteristics as Long.  Lengths of walleye sample in our gill nets ranged from 21 to 26 inches and averaged just above 23 inches.  The two strongest year classes apparently were the result of fingerling stockings in 1999 and 2001. <br> \n <br> \nAnother valuable fishery in Long Lake is for panfish.  The black crappie population was similar to other lakes like Long.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 4 to just over 8 inches with a average length of just over 6 inches.  Age 1 through age 4 black crappie were observed during the assessment indicating good natural reproduction.  Long Lake has a high population of bluegill when compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  Lengths of bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged from 5 to 7 inches and averaged just over 5 inches.  Three different year classes were seen during the survey but the majority of fish were age 3. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population in Long Lake is similar to other lakes with similar characteristics.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5 to just over 7 inches and had an average length of just over 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSome very nice northern pike were sampled in trap nets in Long Lake.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 26 to just over 34 inches and averaged just over 32 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the assessment included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, channel catfish, white sucker, freshwater drum, and common carp. <br> \n <br> \nToo maintain a healthy fishery in Long Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",
