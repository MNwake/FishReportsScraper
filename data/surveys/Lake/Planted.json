The secchi disk is to the bottom, and water color is brown due to bog stain. The lake has a muck/detritus bottom substrate. An abundant growth of emergent and submerged vegetation is found throughout the lake. The lake is primarily a waterfowl area. The shallow depth of the lake creates winterkill problems which limits the fish populations.</p>",
