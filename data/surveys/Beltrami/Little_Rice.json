They ranged in size from 15 to 20 inches with an average length of 17 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the most abundant predatory fish found in Little Rice. A total of 18 were captured and measured during the 2019 survey with lengths from 11 to 23 inches and an average size of 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are a very important prey species and were found in healthy numbers. Perch were measured up to 10 inches in length and averaged just over 7 inches. <br> \n</p>",
