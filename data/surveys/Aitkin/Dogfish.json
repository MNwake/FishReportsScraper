                "narrative": "<p>Dogfish Lake is small and infertile, yet should provide adequate fishing for those who can gain access to the lake. Fish growth is slow in this infertile lake and most fish do not reach large size. Black crappies were fairly abundant and relatively small. The average size was only 7.4 inches long and the largest black crappie was only 9.3 inches long. Bluegills were caught at a normal rate for this type of lake and were also somewhat small, averaging just 5.6 inches long. The largest bluegill was only 8.4 inches long. High catch rates of small yet acceptable panfish may make up for the lack of large individual size. Angling may be best in the spring when the floatingleaf and submerged plants are not yet as dense as they are in mid-summer.The gillnet catch indices indicate northern pike can produce an acceptable fishery in Dogfish Lake. Northern pike in the gillnet sample were caught at a normal rate for this type of lake, ranged from 17.6 inches to 27.3 inches long and averaged 23.0 inches long. Fishing the weedline is probably the only way to effectively catch northern pike in Dogfish Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dogfish is a small lake located about 1.5 miles west of Aitkin along US Highway 210.  There is no public access to the lake, so access must be gained through private property. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were abundant, but small, with an average length of 6.5 inches.  The largest was 9.5 inches long.  Growth rates were slow for the first few years and then increased to normal rates. Therefore, the strong year classes from 2004 and 2006 should provide good numbers of acceptable size fish in the coming years, as they grow into sizes preferred by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill abundance was down since the last survey, with very few fish over 7 inches. Growth rates were relatively slow, however one fish over 8 inches was observed.  It appears that longevity to at least 8 years is needed to produce a modest number of larger sized bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were also above average in abundance and should provide some good fishing for anglers targeting them.  The largest largemouth sampled was 19.4 inches long, with an average length of 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers that do gain access to Dogfish Lake would have an excellent opportunity to catch  good sized northern pike.  They averaged more than 25 inches in length, and the largest one was more than 32 inches long.  Growth rates were faster than average.  If catch and release is practiced for these larger pike, they should continue to provide an excellent fishery. <br> \n</p>",
