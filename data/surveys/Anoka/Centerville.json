THE LAKE SUSTAINS A SIZEABLE CARP POPULATION WITH APPARENTLY GOOD REPRODUCTION. OTHER GAMEFISH PRESENT IN LOW NUM- BERS ARE NORTHERN PIKE, WHITE CRAPPIE, AND LARGE- MOUTH BASS. IN ADDITION, MUSKIES HAVE ENTERED CENTERVILLE LAKE PROBABLY BY MIGRATION FROM BALD EAGLE LAKE THROUGH CLEARWATER CREEK AND PELTIER LAKE. FORAGE SPECIES PRESENT ARE GOLDEN SHINER, WHITE SUCKERS. SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF STOCKED WALLEYE FRY IS GOOD, AND ADEQUATE FORAGE IN THE FORM OF PERCH IS PRESENT. BLUEGILL SAMPLED EXHIBITED A GOOD SIZE DISTRIBUTION WITH APPROXI- MATELY 74% OF THE INDIVIDUALS OVER 6.0 INCHES IN TRAP NETS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Centerville Lake has a history of high rough fish populations.  Winter aeration has been conducted as needed since 1988-89 to prevent winterkill of game fish.  The lake is managed as a walleye fishery and is stocked annually with walleye fry which has resulted in strong year classes.The gillnet catch indicates good numbers of walleye.  Lengths range from 8.5 to 28 inches, with a 17 inch average and nearly 75% over 15 inches.  Local reports are that walleye fishing success is poor despite the high population.  This is attributed to lack of structure in the lake, and may also be due to a high natural prey base.  Northern pike numbers were low in 1997, as they have been in the past.  Northern pike size structure is very desirable, though, with an average size of 27 inches and 40% of the catch over 30 inches.  Yellow perch are present in moderate numbers, but are small - 5 to 8 inches with a 6 inch average.  Bluegill numbers are also low to moderate but small - 5 inch average.  Black crappie numbers are low, but size is very nice - from 9 to 13 inches with a 12 inch average.  Small black bullhead (6.5 to 7.5 inch) are very abundant.  Largemouth bass are present, but in low numbers.         </p>",

Walleye fry were stocked annually at variable rates from 1989 to 2012, with the exception of 1994, 1995, 2005 and 2007. Since 2004, WAE fry are scheduled to be stocked biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 3,000 fish/littoral-acre (828,000 fry). Walleye were sampled below the median level for gill net abundance in class 24 lakes.  The gill net catch rate of WAE is down from the level observed in 2007. The average size of gill net sampled WAE in 2013 was 21.8 inches and 4.1 pounds. Approximately 83 percent of all WAE captured measured 20 inches or longer. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight in gill nets. The average size NOP captured in gill nets was approximately 24.7 inches and 3.6 pounds. Approximately 10 percent of sampled NOP measured 30.0 inches or longer. Yellow Perch (YEP) catch rate increased from 2007. The average size of YEP sampled was 7.6 inches and 0.21 pounds. Approximately 39 percent of all YEP captured measured 8 inches or longer. Bluegills (BLG) were sampled above the average level of abundance for trap nets however has decreased since the assessment in 2007.  The average BLG sampled in trap nets was 5.9 inches and 0.12 pounds. Approximately 9.7 percent of BLG sampled were 7.0 inches or longer.  Black Crappies (BLC) were sampled above the median level of abundance for gill nets, however overall abundance in both gears has decreased from 2007. The average BLC sampled in gill nets was 7.5 inches and 0.23 pounds. Approximately 7.0 percent of BLC sampled in gill nets were 9.0 inches or longer.  Largemouth Bass (LMB) were sampled at an above average level of abundance in both the gill nets and trap nets.  The average size of LMB sampled was 12.9 inches and 1.4 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Centerville Lake is a eutrophic 455 acre basin that is assigned to lake class 24. With a maximum depth of 19 feet, a winter aeration system is in place to prevent major winterkills. Walleye is the primary management species in the lake. They have been stocked at variable rates in the past but since 2017 they are stocked at a rate of 1,000 fry/littoral-acre annually. This is a decrease from prior stocking rates which were as high as 5,500 fry/littoral-acre as recently as 2010. The lake was sampled using gill nets and trap nets in July 2019. The previous survey was conducted in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nNo walleyes were sampled during this survey. This appears to be a continuation of a trend of decreasing Walleye catches since the early 2000's. The previous survey had a catch rate of only 1.5 fish per net. This decreasing trend is despite high stocking rates for year classes that should have been represented. The management goal for Walleyes has not been met since the 2007 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 9.5 fish per gill net. The Pike catch is typical relative to the last few surveys but it is substantially higher than catch rates from surveys prior to 2002. Mean weight of 3.2 lb is higher than average for the lake class and typical relative to historical surveys. Average length for Northern Pike was 23.9 inches with the largest fish measuring 32.2 inches.  <br> \nTrap nets sampled Black Crappie at a rate of 3 fish per net, which was below average for the lake class but typical for the lakes history. Gill nets were much more effective at sampling Crappies with a catch rate of 26.5 fish per net, a rate higher than average for similar lakes. Historical catch rates are widely variable for both gear types. Mean weight in gill nets of 0.16 lb was low relative to previous catches. Crappie averaged 6.4 inches in length and topped out at 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 10 fish per net. This rate is low relative to the lake class and previous surveys. The average length of fish was 5.1 inches with only one fish longer than 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at the lowest rate in the survey history with only 0.75 fish per gill net. This is a continuation of a substantial decline since the 1982 survey and a catch rate of 344 fish per net.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets. Little about their abundance can be inferred from this information though as these gears are ineffective at sampling bass. Other species sampled were: Black Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Common Carp. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Centerville Lake is primarily managed for Walleye (WAE).  Walleye fry were stocked annually at variable rates from 1989 to 2004 with the exception of 1994 and 1995. Since 2004, WAE fry are scheduled to be stocked biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 3,000 fish/littoral-acre (828,000 fry). Walleye were sampled above the median level for abundance in gill nets. The gill net catch rate for WAE is down from the level observed in 2002 and no individuals under 5 years of age were captured. The average size of gill net sampled WAE in 2007 was 20.9 inches and 3.1 pounds. Approximately 65 percent of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. One 27.6 inch Channel Catfish (CCF) weighing 9.75 was captured and released during this assessment. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight in gill nets and reflected the second highest catch rate ever observed for this lake. The average size NOP captured was approximately 24.85 inches and 3.98 pounds. Approximately 30 percent of sampled NOP measured 30.0 inches or larger. Growth rates for WAE and NOP were found to be good. Yellow Perch (YEP) catch rates more than doubled since 2002. The average size of YEP sampled was 6.3 inches and 0.10 pounds. No YEP sampled measured over 8.0 inches in length. Bluegill (BLG) abundance in trap nets continues to increase and was the highest ever recorded for this lake. The average BLG sampled was 6.24 inches and 0.18 pounds. Approximately 25 percent of sampled BLG measured 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie (BLC) abundance was above median levels for abundance in both the gill net and trap samples. The average size of BLC sampled measured 8.1 inches and 0.28 pounds. Approximately 3.4 percent of all BLC captured measured 9.0 inches or longer. Very few Largemouth Bass were sampled, but some quality size individuals (18.0 inches or larger) were captured in the trap nets.</p>",

Walleye and Bluegill are the primary management species in the lake. The 2021 spring trap netting survey was conducted to provide baseline information on Bluegill for the new 5-fish bag limit experimental fishing regulation that went into effect in 2021. The goal of this regulation on Centerville Lake is to increase the size structure of Bluegill.  <br> \nNine trap nets were set on April 27, 2021 and lifted on April 28, 2021 catching a total of 230 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.4 inches up to 8.5 inches in length, with an average size of 6.6 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 89 Bluegill. Most of the fish were from three different years, 2018 (3 years old), 2016 (5 years old) and 2015 (6 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2013 year-class (8 years old). The size structure of Bluegill found in Centerville Lake is below average for East Metro-area lakes, with 8% of fish 7 inches or larger. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1989 with the exception of 1994 and 1995. Sampling nets caught Walleyes in the highest level of abundance since 1992. The average fish was approximately 15.0\" and 1.44 pounds. About 7 percent of the Walleyes captured measured 20.0\" or more. Northern Pike were sampled in record numbers with the average fish being 21.6\" and 2.5 pounds. Approximately one-in-every six Northern Pike measured 24.0\" or more. Bluegill and Black Crappie also showed significant increases in their abundance. Bluegill were sampled in the record abundance with the average fish being 5.7\" and 0.16 pounds. Over 13 percent of the Bluegill sampled were 7.0\" or more, with the largest fish captured being 8.3\". Black Crappies in this survey averaged 7.1\" and 0.22 pounds, with the largest fish captured being 11.3\". All fish exhibited good weight for their lengths and growth rates. Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead populations showed significant declines in abundance in sampling nets. Yellow Perch have declined steadily since the introduction of Walleyes, while the decline of the Black Bullhead population appears to be just during the last 5 years.</p>",
