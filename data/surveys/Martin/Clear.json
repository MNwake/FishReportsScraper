                "narrative": "<p>Clear lake covers 273-acres and is approximately 1 mile long.  The deepest spot in the lake is around 7 ft.  The bottom type is predominantly sand and aquatic vegetation is limited.  Clear Lake is primarily managed for walleye.  Walleye numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 12 to 25 inches with a mean length of approximately 19 inches.  The walleye population appears to be dominated by fish of quality and preferred lengths.  In 1996, a good number of walleye will be more than 20 inches in length with some over the 25-inch range.  Clear Lake was last stocked with walleye fry in 1995.The yellow perch population in Clear Lake is considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow perch ranged in lengths from 5 inches to 8 inches with an average length of 6 ?.Although the lake is currently dominated by smaller perch, these fish should grow into quality lengths of more than 8 inches in the following year.  Yellow perch were never officially stocked in Clear Lake.Clear Lake also supports a fair number of white crappie.  The majority of white crappie were between 6 and 7 inches in length.  The largest white crappie collected in our trapnets was 10 ? inches in length.The black crappie population is considered low compared to similar lakes in our area.  All the fish sampled in our trapnets were 9 to 11 inches in length.Clear has always had a high population of bullhead.  Bullhead collected in our trapnets ranged from 4 to 9 inches with an average of 6 ? inches.Channel catfish were stocked in Clear Lake in 1985 and 1995.  A few channel cats were collected in our trapnets.  Catfish lengths ranged from 14 to 18 inches.Although at low abundances, Clear Lake also contains northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake, like many of the lakes in the pothole prairie region, is fairly shallow and quite productive.  Despite lakes being consistently fertile, crappie and yellow perch population densities tend to cycle between highs and lows in several of the area lakes.  However, unlike many of the lakes in this area, Clear Lake does not have an aeration system.  Dissolved oxygen has been low enough for liberalized fishing only twice since 1949.  The walleye population in Clear Lake looks promising for the next couple of years unless the lake becomes vulnerable to a substantial \"winterkill.\"  The average walleye gill net catch was 22.00 fish/net set which was higher than the upper range for this type of lake.  Historically, average walleye gill net catches have not been this high since 1991 (41.00 fish/net set).  Total lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets ranged between 7.56 and 25.83 inches, with an average of 14.46.  The mean walleye trap net catch was 2.67 fish/net set which was close to the expectations for this type of  lake.  Total lengths of walleye in trap nets ranged between 7.87 and 27.95 inches, with an average of 15.87.  The mean walleye weight per fish was 2.35 lbs./fish which was higher than normal for the area lakes, indicating the walleyes are in good condition.  Shoreline seining found one young of the year in three seine hauls and walleye fall electrofishing recorded 28.00 fish/hour, indicating some natural reproduction and fry stocking survival.      The average yellow perch gill net catch was 7.75 fish/net set which is what is expected for the area lakes.  Historically yellow perch average gill net catches have varied between 7.75 fish/net set in 1999 and 161.00 fish/net set in 1991.  Although yellow perch numbers are somewhat depressed, the catches are still within the expected range for this type of lake.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 5.71 and 10.00 inches, with an average of 7.89.  A good portion of yellow perch was observed in the range of 5.50 to 5.99 inches.  Shoreline seining captured four young of the year yellow perch, which indicated some successful natural reproduction in 1999.  The yellow perch numbers are depressed compared to historical catches but the population is still within the expected range for this type of lake.It appears the black crappie population has become established as a balanced self-sustaining fishery after the introductory stocking of 105 adults in 1993.  The average black crappie trap net catch was 4.22 fish/net set in 1999 which was normal for this type of lake.  Total lengths of  black crappie ranged between 5.75 and 13.39 inches, with an average of 7.79.   The only other catch of black crappie in trap nets was recorded in 1995 (0.75 fish/net set).  No black crappie were sampled shoreline seining in 1995 or 1999.  The fact that only one white crappie was sampled in gill nets and no white crappie in trap nets indicates the population density was lower than other area lakes.The mean channel catfish gill net catch was 0.50 fish/net set which indicates the population density is low.  Channel catfish were also sampled in 1995 when the average gill net catch was 2.67 fish/net set.The mean black bullhead trap net catch was 55.75 fish/net set which was within the expected range for this lake class.  Average gill net catches have ranged between 6.0 fish/net set and 243.75 fish/net set.  Total lengths of black bullheads ranged between 5.67 and 8.94 inches, with an average of 8.10.  A relatively high density black bullhead population was present that consisted mostly of smaller sized fish.  This fishery provides a great opportunity to teach children how to fish because the frequency of catching bullheads would likely be high.  The average common carp trap net catch was 6.22 fish/net set which was higher than expected for this lake class.  Total lengths of common carp ranged between 11.81 and 23.31 inches, with an average of 19.53.  All of these data suggest above normal densities of common carp and a population size structure that consisted mostly of larger individuals.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in southern Martin County, near Ceylon, just north of the Iowa border. Clear Lake is circular in shape, has a surface area of 273 acres, a maximum depth of 7 feet and has typical features found in prairie pothole region lakes. Walleye is the primary species managed for in Clear Lake with yellow perch, white crappie, black crappie and channel catfish managed as secondary species. Walleye fry are stocked two out of every three years. The past decade has provided anglers with periods of good fishing for walleye. However, partial winterkill in 2001 decimated the gamefish population. Successful fry stockings in 2001 and 2002 appear to have the walleye population on the road to recovery. Although Clear lake may benefit from an aeration system, the last substantial winterkill before 2001 was in 1979. Dissolved oxygen has been low enough for liberalized fishing only twice since 1949.The walleye population suffered a setback as a result of the 2001 winterkill. Fortunately, successful fry stockings after the winterkill have produced walleye caught in our nets ranging from 9.4 to 18.2 inches with an average length of 15.6. The walleye have exhibited excellent growth and the possibility exists for angling opportunity in 2004.The yellow perch population is low compared to similar lakes. However, yellow perch lengths taken from our nets averaged nearly ten inches. Sufficient numbers of yellow perch appear to be present to allow for population growth recovery from the 2001 winterkill. Yellow perch should be stocked if the next population assessment does not show net sets averaging 2.0 fish per net or greater.The Clear Lake black crappie population is above the average of similar lakes. The catch rate was 9.1 in 2003 compared to 4.22 in 1999. Three different age groups were observed during the survey which indicates the black crappie population was unaffected by the 2001 winterkill.Black bullhead numbers were at historic lows for Clear Lake but still above the average found in similar lakes. Black bullheads sampled in nets ranged from 4.21 to 10.31 inches with an average of 7.49.One channel catfish was sampled during the survey. Net catches suggest the channel catfish population suffered a severe setback from the 2001 winterkill. Historical sampling has shown limited natural reproduction. In order to re-establish a channel catfish fishery and possibly control high black bullhead numbers a more frequent channel catfish stocking plan should be initiated.Other species of fish sampled during the survey include common carp, bigmouth buffalo, hybrid sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is 261 acres located in Martin County near the City of Ceylon.  Clear Lake has a maximum depth of seven feet and is located in a watershed that is comprised primarily of agriculture (90 percent).  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and White Crappie.  Clear Lake was surveyed the week of August 1, 2016 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Walleye were captured at a rate of 2.7 per gill net, which is the lowest catch rate ever recorded on Clear Lake, and is near the lower end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 per gill net).  Walleye ranged from 9.7 to 17.3 inches in length and averaged 13.2 inches. Growth was slow as age-3 fish averaged 10.6 inches.  Walleye were skinny, indicating that prey may be scarce.  Natural reproduction does not occur in Clear Lake, as all aged Walleye corresponded to stocking events. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2003, the Yellow Perch catch rate has been below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 per gill net). The 2016 catch rate was similar at 1.3 per gill net.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6.4 to 7.5 inches, and were skinny.  The panfish niche is possibly being filled by the high crappie abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 16.4 per trap net in 2016, above the long term average of 9.7 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 9.4 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. The 2016 White Crappie catch rate of 12.9 per trap net exceeded the long term average of 3.5 per trap net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.0 per trap net).  White Crappie ranged in length from 4.7 to 9.2 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Within the next couple of years, Black Crappies should be reaching a size that is desirable to anglers and are abundant enough that they should provide good angling action.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish, ranging from 17.7 to 31.4 inches, were caught at a rate of 1.7 per gill net, slightly above the long term average.  The Black Bullhead catch rate was 8.1 per trap net, well below the long term average of 127.0 per trap net.  Common Carp were caught at a rate of 2.7 per trap net, similar to catch rates since 2003.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

Clear Lake has a maximum depth of seven feet and is located in a watershed that is comprised primarily of agriculture (90 percent).  Despite having a relatively small watershed (3.4 to 1 watershed-to-lake-ratio), water quality is typically poor and is heavily influenced by agricultural runoff.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and White Crappie.  Clear Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 27, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 23.8 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was somewhat successful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 7.5 to 8.7 inches and averaged 8.1 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 261-acre lake located in Martin County near the City of Ceylon.  Clear Lake has a maximum depth of seven feet and is located in a watershed that is comprised primarily of agriculture.  Water quality is typically poor despite having a relatively small watershed.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black and White Crappie.  Clear Lake was surveyed the week of July 20, 2020 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.        <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate was 6.7 per gill net, which is an increase from the 2016 catch rate of 2.7 per gill net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Catch rates of Walleye in Clear Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 2.7 per gill net in 2016 to 41.0 per gill net in 1991 and have averaged 12.8 per gill net over all surveys.  Zero Walleye less than age-5 were sampled in gill nets in 2020. Year classes sampled included age-5, age-6, age-7, and age-10; however, some Walleye that were 11.5 to 14.5 inches were sampled in trap nets, but not aged, and are likely age-3 Walleye.  The 2014 year class (age-6) accounted for 73 percent of the gill net sample, with all year classes corresponding to stocking years, except the 2015 year class (age-5) which only had one fish sampled.  Walleye lengths ranged from 11.7 to 24.3 inches and averaged 17.2 inches.  Walleye growth appears to be slow as mean length of age-6 and age-7 Walleye was 20.6 inches and 18.2 inches, respectively.  The current stocking regime of 1 of 2 years at 500 per littoral acre will be reassessed after the 2024 survey on Clear Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch cate rate in 2020 was 5.3 per gill net, the highest catch rate since the early 2000's, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Adult Yellow Perch (N=330) that were stocked in 2017 appear to have slightly increased the abundance of Yellow Perch in Clear Lake.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 6.3 to 9.0 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Clear Lake does not appear to be a destination for Yellow Perch anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2020 of 24.6 per trap net was an increase from 16.4 per trap net in 2016 and exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.7 to 12.2 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Black Crappie are abundant in Clear Lake but average size hasn't changed much since the 2016 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie abundance has drastically increased in Clear Lake with catch rates of 66.0 per gill net and 25.9 per trap net, both greatly exceeding their expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 8.4 per gill net and 0.3 to 6.0 per trap net).  Gill net and trap net catch rates in 2020 both represent the highest catch rates of White Crappie ever recorded in Clear Lake.  White Crappie were small, with lengths ranging from 4.4 to 12.1 inches and averaging 7.5 inches.  White Crappie should be easily caught on Clear Lake, but size will likely be small.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish, ranging from 9.5 to 24.1 inches and averaging 16.7 inches, were caught at a rate of 10.0 per gill net, the highest recorded catch rate in Clear Lake surveys.  Black Bullheads were not sampled in trap nets, which have averaged 114.3 per trap net since 1951, and had a catch rate of 3.7 per gill net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake located near the city of Ceylon in Martin County just north of the Iowa border is a 261-acre DNR class 43 lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet.  A class 43 lake simply indicates that it is shallow and highly impacted by a high level of nutrients.  The majority (~90%) of the land surrounding Clear Lake is agricultural with the remaining land being mainly urban.  Therefore, water influences to Clear Lake are generally based on agricultural land use practices.  Improvements in farming practices and agricultural drainage would result in increased water quality and clarity for Clear Lake.  A fish population assessment was conducted July 30th through August 2nd, 2012 to assess the health of the fish community.  Water quality measurements were also taken on Clear Lake during the summer of 2012.  Overall the water quality and clarity measurements indicate low water quality and very little clarity.  Improvements in water quality and clarity in Clear Lake should focus on improving agricultural drainage to reduce nutrient runoff within the watershed.  Water quality improvements have direct effects upon the fish community and overall fish health within the lake.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie, and channel catfish are managed secondarily. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye occasionally reproduce naturally in Clear Lake with occasional recruitment also occurring from the East Fork of the Des Moines River.  In addition to natural reproduction, walleye fry have been stocked into Clear Lake since 1986 helping to sustain a fishable population.  Since 1986, the walleye population abundance has cycled up and down.  In 2012, the catch rates were back up to high levels of 32.5 fish per gill net and 3.0 fish per trap net.  Interestingly, the catch rates have remained within or above the normal expected ranges for gill nets and trap nets since 1991 indicating a relatively stable walleye population exists in Clear Lake.  The walleye sampled in 2012 ranged in length from 7.5 to 23.5 inches with 5 age groups present from fry stocking in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011.  Additionally, analysis of the size structure indicated a balanced size distribution of the walleye population.  However, the health condition of the walleye in Clear Lake was poor.  Usually walleye populations experience some decline in health during the warm summer months, but Clear Lake walleye had additional stress that was occurring leading to poorer health than expected.  A closer examination of the health of the walleye in the sample shows that the health of the fish increases slightly as the fish get bigger.  This indicates that the population is experiencing some serious foraging stress during early years (ages 1-3) but then larger food items may become available for larger fish that small fish cannot eat helping to increase their health and play \"catch-up\".  Overall, the walleye population appears to be doing well and the population is most likely going to decline over the next several years due to a low health index.  Given the up and down pattern of the walleye population in Clear Lake since 1986 shows that the population most likely goes through growing pains in which the lake cannot sustain a very high abundance of walleye leading to low health of the fish and then a decline in abundance to more sustainable levels.  This is actually a natural way for the population to maintain healthier fish in the lake that will lead to more desirable fish for anglers to catch.  Currently, the walleye population is at an abundance that appears to be unsustainable and will decline over the next several years.  With that said, catch rates will still be high and anglers targeting walleye will be successful and they should harvest up their daily limit (see regulation book for inland waters walleye daily limit) to help the population recover to produce healthier fish.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in Clear Lake has declined over the past 22 years from a high of 161.0 fish per gill net in 1991 to the most recent catch of 2.6 fish per gill net in 2012.  The yellow perch in the 2012 sample ranged in length from 6 to 8 inches with 2 age groups present.  The yellow perch were in good health.  Local anglers have been successfully catching yellow perch suggesting a more robust yellow perch population exists in Clear Lake than what was sampled in 2012. There is a possibility that the limited time the nets were set in the lake poorly sampled the yellow perch population, but decent catches of walleye (a similar species in terms of behavior) suggest the yellow perch population is in fact experiencing a decline.  This is not uncommon; yellow perch on a statewide scale have been experiencing population declines with no clear explanation.  It is suggested that milder winters in recent years have led to conditions that favor survival of other species that compete with and prey upon yellow perch and cause a decline in yellow perch abundance over time.  Regardless of the exact reason, yellow perch abundance has declined substantially in Clear Lake over the past 22 years and future management may include stocking of adult pre-spawn yellow perch to help boost the population.  Furthermore, increased awareness should be focused on maintaining or creating suitable spawning habitat within the lake (i.e. submerged aquatic vegetation).  Increases in the health of the watershed (land surrounding a lake that contributes surface water runoff) via buffers on tributaries that feed surface water into Clear Lake should reduce a barrage of nutrients that enter the lake during high runoff events thus reducing the creation of severe algae blooms that suffocate aquatic vegetation and yellow perch eggs during spawning in the spring.  The success of the future yellow perch population appears dependent upon intensive management via stocking or improvements to habitat or a combination of the two.  Anglers who like to fish for yellow perch should consider another area lake as the population in Clear Lake is at levels that may not produce an experience that angler's desire, although yellow perch are quick to recover and fishing may improve over the next 2 to 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of crappie are found in Clear Lake, white crappie and black crappie.  Both species were present in high abundance in the survey nets in 2012.  The 2012 black crappie trap net catch rate was 31.3 fish per net which is 1.5 times greater than the upper normal range.  In the same way, the 2012 white crappie trap net catch rate was 7.8 fish per net which is 1.3 times greater than the upper normal range.  Black crappie in the sample ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches and white crappie ranged in length from 4 to 11.5 inches.  Analysis of the size distribution of black and white crappie in the sample indicates populations that are approaching a balanced size structure with good numbers of small and large fish.  Additionally, the overall health values of both the black and white crappie populations indicated very healthy populations of each exist in Clear Lake.  Since 1999, the crappie population (specifically black crappie) has increased from 4.2 fish per trap net to 31.3 fish per trap net with doubling of the catch rate occurring every survey up until 2012 when it only increased 20% from the previous survey.  It appears the crappie population is starting to dominate the fish community within Clear Lake.  Crappie anglers should be pleased by the number of fish that they find while fishing Clear Lake.  Harvest of crappie up to a legal limit (see regulation booklet) should be considered by each angler as it will help to thin the population leading to healthier fish that will not compete with each other and will then grow to larger sizes, maybe even approaching 15 inches or more.   <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish have been managed for recreational angling in Clear Lake since 1985 when adult channel catfish were stocked.  Since 1985, Clear Lake has been stocked twice with channel catfish, once in 1995 and 10 years later in 2005, both stockings with fingerlings.  The catch rate of channel catfish has fluctuated from 2.7 fish per gill net in 1995 to less than 1 per gill net in 1999, 2003, and 2007, and then to a current high of 6.5 fish per gill net in 2012.  The channel catfish in the 2012 sample ranged in length from 7 to 14 inches with 2 age groups represented.  The size structure of the channel catfish in the sample indicated a population dominated by small fish.  The two year classes present are most likely the progeny of the channel catfish stocked in 2005 with no evidence of larger fish from the 2005 stocking present in the lake.  The overall health of the channel catfish population was good.  It appears that the channel catfish population is sustaining itself through years of good reproduction followed by years of reproduction failure.  Currently, the population is susceptible to predation by walleye and competition with similar species such as black and yellow bullhead (which were both present in high numbers the gill net [black bullhead=38.5 fish per gill net] and trap net sample [yellow bullhead=4.8 fish per trap net]).  Channel catfish may not be best suited for stocking as a management species in Clear Lake.  Given large populations of walleye, black crappie, white crappie, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead there are not many resources available to sustain a population of channel catfish that will attain large sizes that recreational anglers prefer.  Future management of channel catfish will be considered if the population can maintain fish with larger size, if not, management with stocking may be discontinued.  Catfish anglers will find some small fish in Clear Lake, but anglers looking to catch larger fish should travel to nearby Fox Lake where larger channel catfish can be found. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Clear Lake, that were not mentioned above, during July and August of 2012 include bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, common carp, and white sucker.  Bigmouth buffalo were found to be in high abundance which is good to keep common carp in lower abundance as bigmouth buffalo and carp can compete for similar habitat and food resources.  Bluegill were found to be in low abundance and should be considered to be simply a \"bonus\" species while fishing for walleye and crappie. Common carp were found to be at a level that is considered to be \"low normal\" for Clear Lake and are most likely being kept in check for overpopulating because of competition for resources with bigmouth buffalo.  Finally, white sucker were found to be in low abundance and are most likely a main forage for large walleye and crappie.    <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake is dominated by large populations of walleye, black crappie, white crappie, and bigmouth buffalo.  It appears that there is some significant foraging stress occurring in the walleye, yellow perch, and channel catfish populations leading to declines in abundance (yellow perch), health (walleye), and size structure (channel catfish).  Overall improvements in the abundances of managed game species such as walleye and yellow perch need to focus on improving water quality, habitat, and decreased competition with other species such as channel catfish and crappie.  Currently, Clear Lake is dominated by a very healthy black and white crappie population that should please anglers.  Additionally, crappie anglers will find numerous skinny walleye added to their catch as a \"bonus\".  Thinning the crappie and walleye population through harvesting fish should be a good thing for Clear Lake and will help to increase the overall health of the walleye and crappie populations as long as anlgers follow the daily limits outlined in the regulation booklet issued each year.  Future management by the DNR will focus on stocking yellow perch and maintaining good numbers of walleye.  Clear Lake will be a good destination for crappie and walleye anglers over the next 2 to 3 years.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 261-acre lake located near Ceylon in Martin County just north of the Iowa border.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.\n\nClear Lake has been opened to liberalized fishing twice since 1949, including 1978-79 when it suffered a major winterkill. Despite being one of the few fishing lakes in the Windom Area without aeration, winter dissolved oxygen levels had held up fairly well since 1979 until a partial winterkill in 2001 severely depleted the gamefish population.\n\nWalleye sometimes reproduce naturally in Clear Lake, and the secondary management species had all survived well from 1979 to 2001. Occasional recruitment may occur from the East Fork of the Des Moines River. Current management practice should remain consistent with the past unless future winterkills become more frequent at which time Clear Lake would be a candidate for some type of aeration system.\n\nThe walleye gill net catch rate was 5.00 per net in 2007 compared to 4.3 per net in 2003 and 22.0 per net in 1999.  As you can see, the partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001 had quite an impact on the walleye population.  The trap net catch rate was 3.3 per net in 2007 indicating that the population appears to be recovering.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 7.5 to 23.0 inches and averaged 11.9 inches.  Three different ages of walleye were observed during the assessment, which coincided with fry stockings.  All year classes were from after the 2001 winterkill.\n\nThere is a very nice population of black crappie in Clear Lake.  The trap net catch rate was 25.7 per set in 2007 compared to 9.1 in 2003 and 4.2 in 1999.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4.9 to 9.5 inches and averaged  7.0 inches.  \n\nThe yellow perch population is low in Clear Lake.  Only three yellow perch were sampled during the 2007 assessment.\n\nClear Lake has good numbers of black bullhead but on the small side.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.3 to 7.2 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  \n\nOther species sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, channel catfish, and yellow bullhead.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Clear Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",
