Forage species abundance seems to be remaining at satisfactory levels.  The Yellow Perch catch dropped slightly since 1975 but is still about seven times higher than the statewide median.  Northern Pike have increased eight fold since 1975 to four times the state median, but the growth rate remained average with an average weight of 2.5 pounds.  Five age classes of pike were present.  The Walleye population increased some to about twice the state median and is dominated by fish stocked in 1975 and 1979.</p>",

The catch of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were within the range of expected values for lake class 31; and the catches of White Sucker and Walleye were above the third quartile value.  Catches of Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch all increased significantly since the last (1987) survey.  Northern Pike were caught at a rate of 8.5/ gill net and the average size was 2.5 pounds. Fish ranged in length from 15-31 inches.  Growth was average for both sexes.  Several year classes were represented; and ages 2 and 3 were the most abundant in the sample.  Walleye and Yellow Perch were abundant and captured at a rate of 11.3 and 19.2/ gill net, respectively.  Growth of Walleye was fast for females at all ages and fast for males age 1 and 2, and then average thereafter.  The Walleye generally corresponded to years of fingerling stocking. Especially prevalent were age 2 fish (53% of the sample) from the 1990 stocking.  Yellow Perch ranged in size from 4.5-8.5 inches and modal length was six inches.  Important species captured in trap nets were Bluegill and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Black Crappie.  Catches of all three species were within the range of expected values for lake class 31.  Catches of Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead were very low (<2 fish/lift). Bluegill were abundant and taken at a rate of 51.6/ trap net.  The size was generally small and ranged from three to seven inches.  The modal length was 3 1/2 inches.  Black Crappie ranged in size from six to nine inches and the modal length was 6.5-6.9 inches. Four year class of Largemouth Bass were represented in the trap net and gill net samples.  Growth was average. Largemouth Bass are thought to be abundant and trophy size fish are occasionally taken by anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grand Lake is a 650 acre lake located two (2) miles south of Rockville in eastern Stearns County. The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet with moderate water quality. It has a modest watershed (< 7,000 acres) dominated by row crops, forest and pasture. A DNR public access is located on the south side of the lake and the lake was designated infested with starry stonewort in 2017. A lake survey was completed August 17 - 21, 2020 to update fisheries data last collected in 2015 and included summer gill netting and trap netting. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are a primary managed species in Grand Lake and are managed through fingerling stocking during even numbered years with occasional stocking by the Lake Association. Walleye abundance in 2020 was similar to 2015 and within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 12 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and two (2) pounds. Walleye ages ranged from two (2) to 12 years old with age-2 fish making up 52% of the ageing sample. Walleye growth is fast, taking two (2) years to reach 14 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant and small, but offer anglers the opportunity to catch good numbers. The pike population is comprised mostly of small fish with only 3% of the pike sampled being over 26 inches and none were longer than 30 inches. Northern Pike sampled in 2020 ranged in length from nine (9) to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and two (2) pounds. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant small pike (<22 inches) and release more of the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help improve the size structure. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing is the preferred sampling method to assess Largemouth Bass populations; however bass sampling was not conducted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Largemouth Bass were last surveyed in 2015 and found in lower than average numbers; however the average size was good (14 inches) and 33% were longer than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was similar to 2015 with a few quality size Bluegill present. Twenty-nine percent of the Bluegill sampled were longer than six (6) inches, but only 3% were longer than eight (8) inches. Five hundred fifty-six Bluegill were sampled and ranged in length from two (2) to nine (9) inches with an average length of five (5) inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in gill nets and trap nets was lower than 2015, but within the range of expected values for gill nets and below the expected values for trap nets. Only 10 Black Crappie were caught during the survey and ranged in length from six (6) to 12 inches with an average length of nine (9) inches. Surveys in late summer likely under represent panfish abundance and size structure. Targeted near-shore sampling around spawning time is recommended for both Bluegill and Black Crappie to better assess their abundance and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was similar to 2015, but below the expected range of values for similar lakes. Only three (3) Yellow Perch were sampled during the survey and all were six (6) inches in length. Yellow Perch abundance has been low since 2008 and is likely limited due to high numbers of Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grand Lake is a 650 acre lake located two miles south of Rockville in eastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 34 feet and a modest watershed dominated by row crops, forest and pasture. A DNR public access is located on the south side of the lake. Grand Lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Walleye and was last surveyed in 2008. Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller Northern Pike and good sized Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation was common along the south and west shoreline, primarily wild rice, yellow waterlily and bulrush. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but coontail and chara were the dominant species in 2008. Curly leaf pondweed was present but rare. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 5.5 feet in August and MPCA data show an average of six feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 20 feet in mid July. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were identical to 2008, but lower than 1998 and near the average for similar lakes. Walleye lengths ranged from 10.2 inches to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 2.0 pounds. Walleye ages ranged from 2 to 16 years old with most fish between 4 and 7 years old. Walleye growth was fast, averaging nearly 16 inches in three years. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year for many years by the DNR and occasionally by the lake association. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have been high in recent surveys. The catch rates in 2015, 2008 and 1998 were well above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Northern Pike lengths in 2015 ranged from 10.5 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.7 pounds. Northern Pike were smaller compared to the last survey; only 6% of pike were 24 inches or longer in 2015, compared to 26% in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in May by nighttime boat electrofishing; bass numbers were low, but size was good. The catch rate of 28.2/hour was low compared with the Sauk Rapids Area average of 73.6/hour; however, the results in 2008 (82.9/hour) were much higher. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 8.0 to 17.8 inches with an average length of 13.8 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 33% were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were much higher than 2008, but within the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from 2.9 inches to 9.3 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches. Black Crappie numbers were low, but similar to other lakes like Grand. Lengths ranged from 4.2 to 12.2 inches with an average length of 8.2 inches. Surveys in late summer likely under represent   panfish abundance and size; netting near shore around spawning time would probably be more effective. <br> \n <br> \nVery few Yellow Perch were caught, well below the average for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 5.1 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches. Yellow Perch abundance is likely limited by high numbers of Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOthers species captured included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye, northern pike and black crappie catch per lift were above upper-range expected values, while yellow perch catch per lift was between the low and mid-range expected values for lakes similar to Grand Lake. The gill net catch rate for northern pike significantly increased from 8.50/lift in 1992 to 18.83/lift in 1998; however, mean weight per fish decreased from 2.50 lbs to 1.75 lbs., respectively. Northern pike sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 9.0 to 33.0 inches, with a mean length of 19.5 inches.  Growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as Age I, II, III, and IV individuals reached 14.72, 18.99, 21.95, and 25.60 inches, respectively. The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has appeared to decrease from 19.17/lift in 1992, to 13.17/lift in 1998, and mean weight per fish increased from 0.10 to 0.13 lbs., respectively. Yellow perch sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.5 inches, with a mean length of 6.7 inches.  Yellow perch growth was average compared to other Minnesota lakes as Age II, III, and IV individuals reached 5.88, 6.51, and 7.66 inches, respectively. The gill net catch rate for walleye has appeared to decrease from 11.30/lift in 1992 to 9.50/lift in1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained similar at 1.83 lbs. and 1.85 lbs., respectively.  Walleye sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 7.0 to 28.0 inches, with a mean length of 16.4 inches.  Growth was average for Minnesota lakes as individuals reached 16.08, 17.26, 19.41 and 22.61 inches by Age IV, V, VI and VIII, respectively.  Walleye fingerlings stocked in 1990, 1992 and 1994 were represented in the catch, however, the 1997 stocking may not have been vulnerable to the gear in 1998.The gill net catch rate for black crappie has appeared to decrease from 18.50/lift in 1992 to7.50/lift in 1998; however, mean weight per fish increased from 0.18 to 0.44 lbs., respectively. Black crappie sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 4.5 to 11.5 inches, with a mean length of 8.3inches.  Growth was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes as individuals reached 4.80, 5.70, 8.82, 10.46, and 11.00 inches by Age I through V, respectively.  Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of four primary fish species: bluegill (12.10/set), pumpkinseed sunfish (8.60/set), hybrid sunfish (1.10/set), and white sucker(1.40/set).  Pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker abundance were above the upper-range expected values for lakes similar to Grand Lake, while bluegill abundance was between the low and mid-range expected values. The trap net catch rate for bluegill has significantly decreased from 51.60/set in 1992 to 12.10/set in 1998; however, mean weight per fish has remained similar at 0.07 lbs.  Bluegill sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.0 inches with a mean length of 4.4 inches.  Growth was average as Age I through VI individuals reached 3.17, 4.09, 5.01, 6.24, 6.77, and 7.22 inches, respectively. The trap net catch rate for pumpkinseed sunfish has remained similar at 8.70/set in 1992 and 8.60/set in 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3 to 7 inches, with a mean length of 4.9 inches.  The trap net catch rate for hybrid sunfish has appeared to decrease from 4.10/set in 1992 to 1.10/set in 1998.  Hybrid sunfish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3 to 7.5 inches, with a mean length of 5.1 inches. Largemouth bass in Grand Lake were sampled by night electrofishing during spring.  The electrofishing catch rate for largemouth bass was 38.40/hour on-time which was similar to the Montrose area mean of 41.50/hour.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 7.0 to 14.1 inches, with a mean length of 9.0 inches.  Of the catchable largemouth bass (larger than 8 inches), the proportion larger than 12 inches was 7%.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grand Lake is a general development lake located two miles south of Rockville in southeastern Stearns County.  It is of moderate size (655 acres) and depth (34 feet).  Dissolved oxygen was measured at 4.8 ppm at 19 feet (mid-August) and vegetation was growing at 17 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation species, coontail and muskgrass, were widespread and common.  Wild rice was also found in 60% of vegetation transects, but was considered rare in abundance.  Thirty-five other plant species were found in or around the lake. Curly leaf pondweed covered 43.8 acres, 6.7% of the lake's surface at the time of peak abundance.  Management has consisted of alternate year walleye fingerling stocking.  This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of walleye declined from 1998, but was still near the average for similar lakes.  Overall, walleye ranged from 12 to 30 inches, with an average length and weight of 17 inches and two pounds.  Walleye grew fast and by age two reached 14.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in gill nets at a rate similar to that of 1998.  Fish ranged from 10 to 37 inches, and averaged 22 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Growth was similar to statewide averages. Female northern pike reached 22 inches in four years, whereas males reached 21 inches in four years. Twenty-six percent of northern pike were 24 inches or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 65 largemouth bass were collected by night-electrofishing on May 19, 2008. Fish ranged in length from 9 to 18 inches and averaged 13 inches.  Of the catchable largemouth bass (larger than 8 inches), the proportion larger than 12 inches was 75%.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of yellow perch was very low at 11 total fish from gill nets and trap nets.  Average size was also small at six inches and less than a tenth of a pound. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of bluegill was modest at 10/net, similar to 1998.  Bluegill ranged in length from three to eight inches and averaged 4.5 inches.  Growth was above average for similar lakes. Bluegill reached six inches in five years. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie were taken more readily in gill nets (4.8/lift) than trap nets. Overall, black crappie ranged in length from five to thirteen inches, with an average length and weight of nine inches and 0.4 of a pound.  Black crappie reached nine inches in three years which was faster than similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom an angling standpoint, anglers could expect good fishing for small northern pike and bluegill.  Above average size walleye will occasionally be present in the creel; and fast-growing black crappie will also be above average size. <br> \n <br> \nSensitive minnow species were sampled during shoreline seining were: banded killifish, blackchin and blacknose shiners.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on June 22-23, 2015 by IBI Program Staff.  Backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine was completed at each of 14 sampling sites which were evenly spaced around the lake. Nearshore sampling captured several species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, and Iowa Darter) and 3 tolerant species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish).  Despite high shoreline development, surveyors noted large diverse stands of submersed vegetation in many of the nearshore areas sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data from an August 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Grand Lake is above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes.  Of note were the high number of vegetation-dwelling species sampled and high proportion of intolerant fish sampled in the nearshore gears.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Grand Lake is located in the Sauk River Watershed.  A review of stressor information found 51% watershed disturbance in the contributing watershed (47% Agriculture, 4% Residential - NLCD 2011 data) and a 2015 Score the Shore Survey assessed the shoreline habitat as poor; there are approximately 26 docks/km of shoreline. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Walleye catch has declined significantly from 1981 and is down from 1975 as well. The Walleye catch remains close to state and local medians. Growth is average with 72 percent of the sample from the 1982 fingerling stocking. No netted fish were from blank stocking years indicating poor to no natural reproduction. Northern Pike have significantly decreased from 1981 when catch was 12.3/ gill net. Age 4 fish comprised 50% of the catch with fish ranging in length from 14 to 31 inches and averaging 2.5 pounds each. Largemouth Bass appear abundant. Growth is average and sample consisted primarily of ages 1 and 2 year old fish. Bluegill Pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish have increased dramatically from previous survey. The Bluegill catch is three times the local median and six times the statewide median. Past surveys have historically indicated low abundance. They are slow growing with 72% consisting of ages 3 and 4. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were both caught in numbers six times the local average. Black Crappie are present in numbers equal to the local median which is an increase from the low abundance found in previous years. Growth is below average through the second year and then becomes above average. Forage species, Yellow Perch and White Sucker were found in average abundance. White Sucker numbers remained similar to previous surveys while Yellow Perch have decreased significantly from previous high catches in 1981, 1975, and 1949. The Yellow Bullhead catch was high at four times the local average. Those numbers have increased from 1981 when the catch was 1.0/trap net. Fish ranged in length from 6 to 13 inches and average 0.6 pounds each.</p>",
