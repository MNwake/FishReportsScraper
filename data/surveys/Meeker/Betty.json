                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Betty/Betsy Lake in 2007.  Betty is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie.   \n\nThe lake's watershed was dominated by agriculture.  Sediments and nutrients were both negatively affecting water quality at Betty Lake.  Bank erosion was noted, on the Clearwater River, between the public access and Betty Lake.  Much of the shoreline remains undeveloped with approximately 1/3 of it being residential homes.  Only12 aquatic plant species were sampled and all were classified as being rare.  The secchi disk reading in late July was just 1 foot, due to an intense algal bloom.  Silt was abundant, sand and marl were common, while detritus and rubble were ranked as rare shoalwater substrates.  A drought occurred in the summer 2007 and the water level was low.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 7 feet were low by late July, thus reducing available fish habitat.  Shoreland owners are encouraged to protect emergent aquatic plants.  Cattails provide food and cover for many fish and wildlife species, improve water clarity, reduce erosion, and improve aesthetics.\n\nA total of 10 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 1.7/net, indicating a small population to be present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 3.8/net.  In 2007, walleye were 15.7-26.5 inches long averaging 21.9 inches.  A 28.3 inch walleye was captured in a trap net.  Walleye were 2-10 years old with 7 year-classes present.  The current population was self-sustaining, and walleye were last stocked in 1992.\n\nA total of 63 northern pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 10.5/net, indicating a large population.  The catch rate in 2002 was 6.8/net.  Catch rates have been increasing since the 1997 netting.  In 2007, northern pike were 13.9-27.9 inches long averaging 21.9 inches.  Northern pike were 1-5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 3 fish accounted for 43% of the gill net sample.\n\nA total of 2 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 0.3/net  The catch rate in 2002 was 7.5/net.  In 2007, gill netted yellow perch were 5.4-7.4 inches long averaging 6.4 inches.  Trap nets sampled yellow perch up to 8.7 inches in length.  Yellow perch were 1-5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  \n\nA total of 32 channel catfish were gill netted for a catch rate of 5.3/net, indicating a moderate population.  The catch rate in 2002 was similar at 5.2/net.  Gill net catch rates have been increasing since the 1986 assessment.  In 2007, channel catfish were 7.7-24.7 inches long averaging 13.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled few (7) channel catfish, but maximum length was slightly higher at 26.3 inches.  Approximately 66% of the gill net sample was less than 11 inches in length.  A pectoral spine was removed for age estimation.  Channel catfish were 2-15 years old with 10 year-classes present.  Approximately 53% of those fish were age 2.  A one time stocking of channel catfish occurred in 1983, thus indicating that a self sustaining population was present at this time.  \n\nA total of 90 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 10.0/net.  The catch rate in 2002 was 19.3/net.  In 2007, trap netted black crappie were 4.4-11.6 inches long averaging  8.3 inches.  Approximately 23% of the trap net sample was 9 inches or longer.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.3-11.8 inches long.  Black crappie were 1-6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 58% of the trap net catch and 55% of the gill net catch indicating a stronger year-class.  Gill and trap net catches indicated a moderate population to be present.    \n\nA total of 22 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 2.4/net, indicating that the population size was small.  The catch rate in 2002 was 13.9/net.  In 2007, bluegill were 3.3-6.6 inches long averaging 5.6 inches.  Bluegill were 1-4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Poor water quality and the lack of submergent vegetation makes Betty a marginal bluegill lake most years.\n\nA total of 4 black bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.4/net.  The catch rate in 2002 was 4.1/net.  In 2007, black bullhead were 9.9-10.8 inches long averaging 10.4 inches.  The gill net catch rate  was 33.7/net with fish averaging 10.0 inches in length.\n\nA total of 8 carp were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.9/net.  The catch rate in 2002 was 1.0/net.  In 2007, carp were 24.1-30.4 inches long averaging 26.5 inches.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (3) of carp in 2007.\n\nA total of 12 largemouth bass were collected during spring night-time electrofishing, for a catch rate of 10.5/hour.  A similar assessment conducted in 1997 failed to sample any largemouth bass.  In 2007, electrofished largemouth bass were 8.5-16.2 inches long averaging 11.4 inches.  Trap nets sampled 5 largemouth bass ranging in length from 12.3-17.4 inches and averaging 15.0 inches.  Largemouth bass were 2-5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Poor water quality and the lack of submergent vegetation make Betty a marginal largemouth bass lake most years.\n\nA total of 9 different varieties of fish were sampled during shoreline seining.  Young-of-the-year were collected for black crappie (19), bluegill (127), largemouth bass (37), northern pike (2), and yellow perch (11).  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Betty Lake in 2012 to monitor the fish population.  Submergent vegetation was noted as being moderate to dense around much of the shoreline in 2012.  In contrast, the 2007 point/transect vegetation sampling that was conducted ranked every species as being rare.  This showed that submergent aquatic vegetation density can be highly variable in Betty Lake.  In 2012, a total of 12 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Betty Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie, while walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, and channel catfish are listed as secondary species in the lake management plan.  The notation (n=13) refers to the number of times the lake was netted over the stated time period, and catch rates were calculated.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (20) of northern pike for a catch rate of 3.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  This catch rate indicated that recruitment was low, in 2012.  The 2007 catch rate was 10.5/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were variable ranging from 0.7 to 10.5/net with an average of 4.2.  Northern pike were 17.7 to 36.1 inches long with an average of 21.5.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1993 and the current population is entirely maintained by natural reproduction.  Two-out-of-three of the highest catch rates ever measured at Betty Lake occurred in 2002 and 2007, long after stocking had ceased. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (25) of black crappie for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was 10.0/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were highly variable ranging from 2.8 to 299.7/net with an average of 33.5 and median (middle most catch rate) of 8.0.  Trap netted black crappie were 4.6 to 12.5 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Approximately 46% of the trap net catch was 10.5 inches or longer.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (8) of black crappie for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the second lowest catch rate ever measured at Betty.  Gill netted black crappie were 7.3 to 12.0 inches long with two of the fish reaching 12 inches in length.  These quality sized fish should appeal to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of walleye for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The last time the catch rate was this low was 1994 (0.3/net).  The 2007 catch rate was 1.7/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 6.3/net with an average of 2.1.  The gill netted walleye were 18.9 and 20.9 inches long.  Walleye were last stocked in 1992.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2012 (n=5) ranged from 0.3 to 3.8/net with an average of 1.4, with three of those catch rates being below the normal range.  The last three assessments indicated a decreasing trend in walleye catch rates at Betty Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (77) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 12.8/net.  Channel catfish were introduced into Betty Lake in 1983 and catch rates (n=7) have been increasing since they were first sampled in 1986.  In 2012, channel catfish were 14.9 to 24.1 inches long with an average of 19.3.  Almost 99% of the gill net catch was 17 inches or longer.  The trap net catch rate was also high (8.2/net).  Trap net sampled channel catfish ranged from 9.1 to 23.9 inches in length with an average of 18.2.  Channel catfish were the most abundant fish sampled in both gill and trap nets.  High numbers and quality sized fish should appeal to catfish anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (29) of bluegill for a catch rate of 3.2/net which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was similar at 2.4/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) ranged from 0.8 to 88.7/net, with an average of13.9 and median of 4.1.  In 2012, trap netted bluegill were 3.3 to 6.6 inches long with an average of 5.6.  Although gill nets were not the standard gear for sampling bluegill, the catch (8.2/net) was impressive.  Gill netted bluegill were 5.3 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 7.9.  A total of 43 fish were 7 inches or longer, 28 fish were 8 inches or longer and 3 fish were 9 inches or longer.  The 2012 survey and several past assessments (1951, 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1989) showed that Betty was capable of producing bluegill that were 8 inches or longer.  The 2002 assessment showed that moderate numbers of 7 inch bluegill were trap netted.  This data indicated that Betty Lake was, at least occasionally, capable of producing a quality bluegill population.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (3) of largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Largemouth bass were 4.1 to 18.2 inches long and it was likely that three different year-classes were present.  Spring night-time electrofishing, the standard sampling method for largemouth bass, was not conducted in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was identical at 0.3/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2012 (n=13) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 13.8/net with an average of 3.5.  Both yellow perch were 6.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets (1 fish) and trap nets (4 fish) sampled low numbers of carp, in 2012.  Gill net and trap net catch rates, from 1997 to 2012 (n=4), both showed decreasing trends for carp.  In 2012, low numbers of black bullhead were gill netted (55 fish) and trap netted (15 fish).  Gill net catch rates for the last three assessments (2002, 2007, and 2012) showed a decreasing trend for black bullhead.  Additional species sampled in the standard gear included white sucker, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Betty Lake, also known as Betsy the week of July 31, 2017 to monitor the fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the 2013 Walleye stocking regime.  Gear included gill nets and trap nets.  The 2013 lake management plan listed Northern Pike and Black Crappie as primary management species, while Walleye, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were compared to similar lakes across the state.  Dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 2 mg/L at a depth of 8 feet on 7/31/17, indicating that much of the lake was not suitable for fish to use that time of the year.  Water clarity was limited, with a secchi disk reading of 3.3 feet, due to an algae bloom.  With the public access on the Clearwater River, Betty (0.3 miles downstream) can be difficult to access at times (low water conditions and dangerous ice conditions during the winter).  A small parking area at the boat ramp also limits access.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native, invasive submersed aquatic plant, can reach nuisance levels in May and June. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (36) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 3.3/net.  Historical catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) were variable ranging from 0.7 to 10.5/net with an average of 4.3.  In 2017, gill netted Northern Pike were 18.7 to 26.8 inches long with an average of 21.5.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 34.8 inches in length, showing that quality sized fish were present.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1993, indicating that the current population was the result of natural reproduction.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (47) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 5.2/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) were highly variable ranging from 2.8 to 299.7/net with an average of 31.5.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.5 to 11.4 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Approximately 33% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets also sampled moderate numbers (73) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 12.2/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 gill net catch rate was much lower at 1.3/net.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 61.7/net with an average of 13.9.  Gill netted fish were 4.3 to 15.2 inches long with an average of 10.4.  Approximately 70% of the gill net sample was 10 inches or longer.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present and that a high quality population was available to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (24) of Walleye for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 0.3/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 6.3/net with an average of 2.3.  Different stocking regimes and periods of no stocking occurred during these 66 years.  In 2017, the gill netted Walleye were 16.7 to 24.3 inches long with an average of 19.7.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1992 and resumed in 2013 (45,000 fry every other year) to create more fishing opportunity.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2013, 2015, and 2017.  Catch rates from 2002 to 2012 (n=3), when no stocking was occurring, ranged from 0.3 to 3.8/net with an average of 1.9.  The 2017 catch rate (4.0/net) was very similar to the maximum catch rate during recent non-stocked years (3.8/net).  Walleye, from both gears, were age-2 to age-11 with eight year classes present.  Non-stocked year classes accounted for 71% of the gill net aged fish, indicating that the most the fry stockings could have contributed to the catch was 29%.  It was undetermined if that 29% resulted from the fry stocking, natural reproduction, immigration from Clear Lake, or some combination of the fore mentioned.  Of interest, the three strongest year classes in Betty Lake were also the three strongest year classes in the 2017 Clear Lake (Watkins) standard survey, possibly indicating that Walleye were moving out of Clear and down to Betty, probably during high rainfall/flow events.  Growth for age-2, age-3 and age-4 fish was considered fast, when compared to statewide averages.  Preliminary results may indicate that this stocking regime was having a minimal impact on Walleye abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (106) of Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 17.7/net, which was the highest ever recorded at Betty Lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 12.8/net.  Channel Catfish were introduced into Betty in 1983 (one-time stocking) and catch rates (n=8) have been steadily increasing since they were first sampled in 1986.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 17.7/net with an average of 3.4.  In 2017, gill netted Channel Catfish were 17.2 to 24.4 inches long with an average of 21.2.  Approximately 92% of the gill net sample was 19 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Channel Catfish were the most abundant fish sampled in the 2017 gill nets.  The population was totally sustained by natural reproduction, but size distributions did not indicate consistent reproduction.   <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (28) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 3.1/net which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was very similar at 3.2/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) were highly variable, but mostly low.  They ranged from 0.8 to 88.7/net, with an average of 13.2.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 3.5 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 5.1.  Approximately 7% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present, but many were weak.  Although gill nets are not the standard gear for sampling Bluegill, they did catch 8 fish that were 8.5 inches or longer, with a maximum length of 9.7 inches, indicating that quality sized fish were present.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (4) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  Spring night-time electrofishing was not conducted, due to Largemouth Bass only being listed as a secondary management species at Betty Lake.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 7.1 to 15.6 inches long and it was likely that three different year classes were present.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was almost identical at 0.3/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 13.8/net with an average of 3.2.  The 2017 Yellow Perch was 7.9 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample Common Carp in 2017.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=14) from 1951 to 2017 ranged from 0.0 to 4.8/net with an average of 1.1.  The last five catch rates (1997 to 2017) indicated a decreasing trend at Betty, at least for this time of year.  Numbers may increase in the fall/winter with fish seeking deeper water to over-winter.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (2) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic trap net catch rates (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 4.5/net with an average of 1.3.  In 2017, the Common Carp were 27.3 and 27.9 inches long.   <br> \n     <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 112.3/net with an average of 23.7.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 10.3 and 13.2 inches long.  Gill net catch rates for the last four assessments (2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017) showed a decreasing trend for Black Bullhead.  In 2017, trap nets sampled 1 Black Bullhead (0.1/net), and that fish was 13.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included White Sucker, Bowfin, and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Betty is a small lake along the Clearwater River chain.  A Public Access is located approximately one-quarter mile upstream along the River.  A fisheries population assessment conducted on Lake Betty in 1994 included the use of lake survey gillnets, trapnets, shoreline seining and electrofishing.Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, largemouthbass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  Non-game or forage fish species sampled included golden shiner and whitesucker.The black crappie gillnet catch rate was near the lake class average.  The trapnet catch was below the lake class average, but within the normal range.  Several year classes of black crappie were present, indicating consistent reproduction.  Average length of age three black crappie was 8.8 inches.  Past surveys have documented black crappie numbers within the normal range.The bluegill trapnet catch was below the normal range for this lake class.  Fisheries assessments in 1986 and 1989 documented similar catches.  Age two and three bluegill accounted for 85% of the catch.  Bluegill average length was 6.5 inches.  Shoreline seining sampled young-of-year (YOY) bluegill, indicating natural reproduction occurred.Gillnets sampled twelve channel catfish for a catch rate of 2.0 per net.  No lake class averages have been calculated for channel catfish.  No channel catfish were sampled in trapnets.  Most channel catfish sampled were age four.  Channel catfish ranged in length from 12.8 to 16.9 inches with an average length of 14.4 inches.  Channel catfish have not been stocked in Lake Betty since 1983.  It is uncertain if channel catfish reproduce in Lake Betty or the Clearwater River, or if they migrate from other lakes along the River.Eight largemouth bass were sampled in trapnets during the survey.  All were age 0 (YOY).  The catch rate of 0.9 per net was above the normal range for this lake class.  Shoreline seining during the survey captured 66 largemouth bass YOY.  Only one 12.2 inch largemouth bass was sampled while night electrofishing.The northern pike gillnet catch was above the lake class average but within the normal range for this lake class.  Several age classes of northern pike were present in the sample.  Northern pike sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 19.7 to 30.7 inches with an average length of 24.4 inches.  Growth was good and northern pike numbers and size should interest anglers.Two walleye were taken in gillnets for a catch of 0.3 per net.  This is below the normal range for this lake class and it is uncertain if walleye stocking contributes to the population.The yellow perch gillnet catch was slightly above the lake class average.  Average length of yellow perch was 6.3 inches.  Nearly 80% of the yellow perch were age two and may attract anglers as they grow.</p>",

The public access to Betty Lake is on the Clearwater River which flows East approximately 1/3 of a mile before opening up to the lake.  Changing river conditions can limit access to the lake, with a canoe being an excellent choice for those wishing to fish the lake.  Good numbers of northern pike from 19 to 25 inches were sampled, averaging 2.3 pounds.  Almost six times as many walleye were sampled in 2002 when compared to the 1997 catch rate.  The current walleye population is a result of natural reproduction, since walleye stocking last occurred in 1992 and the oldest walleye aged in 2002 came from the 1996 year class.  Most of the walleye sampled were 18 to 24 inches long, averaging 3.4 pounds.  Channel catfish were abundant in Betty Lake, with good numbers of fish in the 18 to 23 inch range averaging 2.9 pounds.  Good numbers of black crappie were also sampled.  Almost 33% of the black crappie sampled were 9 inches or longer, with the longest fish being 12.1 inches.  Fair numbers of bluegill were netted, with almost 25% of them being 7 inches or longer.  The longest bluegill sampled was 7.8 inches.  Anglers who make the extra effort accessing Betty Lake should have good opportunities for a variety of fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNorthern pike and walleye numbers are below local, regional, and state medians.  Reproduction of northern pike is poor, and limited spawning area, in conjunction with low water levels, limits production of young fish.  Walleye numbers are maintained by stocking of walleye fingerlings every other year.  Numbers of northern pike and walleye netted did not allow for conclusions about growth rate or year class strength.  Survey data, based on gill net and trap net catches is inadequate to evaluate the largemouth bass population.  Shoreline seining indicates poor natural reproduction except for 1984.  Lack of spawning areas and good escape cover are possible reasons.  The present population of channel catfish was established by a stocking of 51,840 fingerlings in 1983. These 6 year old fish average 3.3 lbs. per fish.  Trap net catches for bluegill and black crappie are below regional and local medians.  Both species show erratic net catch rates during the last 10 years.  A possible explanation might be the erratic spawning success of these two species.  Bluegill were only represented by age groups 1, 2, and 3.  Growth for age group 1 was fast.  The predominant black crappie age groups were 1, 3, 5, and 6.  Growth is fast for age groups 1 and 3, while growth for age groups 5 and 6 exhibit average growth.  Numbers of white suckers and carp are above local, regional and state medians.  As steady migration of fish from Clearwater River may explain this.  Catch rates for these two species have remained relatively constant for 10 years.  Yearly removal of these fish by commercial fishermen may account for this.  Black bullhead numbers are low to average for this area.  Average catch rates for the last 10 years are 12.4/trap net lift and 27.0/gill net lift.  Yellow perch numbers are above state, regional, and local medians.  Their numbers were historically low until 1986.  Over the last 10 years, shoreline seining showed little or no natural reproduction.  Rise in yellow perch numbers may be related to drops in the population of walleye, northern pike and black crappie.  The minnow population is not diverse for a lake connected to a river system.  Fathead minnow are the dominant minnow species, but have shown erratic representation in shoreline seining.  Small numbers of Johnny darters and sand shiners are also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Betty, also known as Betsy, is a small-sized lake (154 acres) located southeast of the City of Kimball in Meeker County. A small state-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the Clearwater River, about half a mile west of the lake. Betty has two miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 29 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Betty is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Manuella in Meeker County. Curlyleaf pondweed can be abundant in the shallows in May and June at Betty Lake. Low water levels on the Clearwater River can make it difficult for bigger boats to access the lake. Accessing the lake during winter months can be dangerous due to the thin ice caused by flowing river water. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low to moderate abundance in 2022, with fish averaging 21 inches in length. The longest Walleye sampled was 27 inches. Approximately 95% of the catch was 16 inches and longer. Walleye were age-1 to age-15 with seven year classes being present. Naturally reproduced Walleye contributed substantially to the 2022 catch. Few (3 of 21) of the Walleye aged in the 2022 survey matched up with years when fry were stocked. Because of natural reproduction and the connection to the Clearwater River, walleye fry stocking at Betty Lake will be discontinued.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate to high numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 23 inches in length. Approximately 24% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer, showing fair numbers of nice-sized fish present. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone where Betty Lake is found, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike. <br> \n <br> \nModerate to high numbers of Black Crappie were netted in 2022. Approximately 22% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer. The longest Black Crappie sampled was just over 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were netted and most were small but they provide important forage for the lake's predator species. Moderate numbers of Channel Catfish were captured with fish averaging 21 inches in length and maxing out at almost 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Golden Shiner, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Betsy, Meeker County, is a 147.5 acre lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet. A lake survey conducted in 1997 sampled 14 species of fish.  Lake Betsy may bedescribed as a hard-water lake of good fertility and moderate water quality.  Waterclarity as measured by secchi disk depth ranges from 2.2 to 4.2 feet in mid summer.Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 12 feet.  It has a relativelylow diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake.Lake Betsy is managed primarily as a panfish and largemouth bass fishery.  Samplesof the fish population were taken in mid summer using gill nets, trap nets,shoreline seines and boat electrofishing.  Game fish catches were generally withinthe expected range for this type of lake.A total of 22 northern pike were sampled in gillnets, for a catch rate of 3.7 perlift.  This was within the normal range for this type of lake, and exceeds catchrates from recent surveys.  Trapnets sampled 15 pike, for a catch rate of 1.7,consistent with past catches.  Northern pike ranged in size from 14 to 29 inches,averaging about 21.5 inches long.  Of adults sampled, 69.7% were at least 21inches, and 37.5 were at least 28 inches long.Trapnets sampled black crappies at the rate of 6.4 per set and gillnets sampled atthe rate of 3.3 per lift.  Both rates were within the normal range.  In pastsurveys, catch rates have generally ranged above the lake class average.  Crappiesranged in size from 4 to 13 inches, and averaged about 7.5 inches in length.  Ofadults sampled, 44.4% were 8 inches or longer, and 11.1% were at least 10 incheslong.  Trapnets sampled 37 bluegills, for a catch rate of 4.1 per set, below thenormal range.  Bluegills ranged from 4 to 6.5 inches long, with about half at 5.5inches.Walleyes were also sampled from Lake Betsy during the 1997 survey, although theyseemed to be less abundant than in previous surveys.  Both the gillnet catch rateof 0.7 per lift and the trapnet catch of 0.4 per set were within the normal rangefor this type of lake.  All of the adult walleye sampled were at least 15 incheslong, and 37.5% were at least 20 inches long.  Walleye fingerlingswere last stocked into Betsy in 1992.  Walleye probably migrate into Lake Betsyfrom other lakes in the chain via the Clearwater River.Channel catfish were also abundant in net catches of both gear types.  Gillnetssampled 22 channel catfish for a catch rate of 3.7 per lift, while trapnets sampled14, for a catch rate of 1.6 per set.  Catch rates have increased over past surveys;gillnet catches were 2.0, 0.8 and 0.3 per lift in 1994, 1989 and 1986,respectively.  Gillnetted catfish ranged from 14 to 20 inches, while trapnettedfish were 14 to 21 inches long.  Of a total of 36 channel catfish, 77% were atleast 16 inches in length.</p>",

There are excellent populations of black crappies (32.5/trapnet lift) and bluegills (42.25/trapnet lift).  The crappie averaged about 7 inches, with the bluegills averaging slightly smaller at 5 inches.  Walleye were netted at 0.5/gillnet lift.  They dropped from 1.7/gillnet lift in 1983.  The walleye averaged 17\" to 21\" in length.  Perch are present at 0.83/gillnet lift.  Carp and bullhead do not appear to be overly abundant, though a commercial fishermen working this area has taken many thousands of pounds of carp through seining operations.</p>",

Their ages are fairly well distributed between one and five years.  There are also quite a few Walleyes, but they are mostly of older age groups (V and VI). There are also good populations of panfish, especially Bluegills and Black Crappies.  There are good numbers of Carp and bullheads, as was evident during survey, and by the large number of Carp taken during contract seining in the summer of 1975.  \n\n\n</p>",
