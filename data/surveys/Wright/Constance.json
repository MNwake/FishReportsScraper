                "narrative": "<p>Lake Constance is a 161-acre recreational development lake located two and a half miles northwest of the city of Buffalo in central Wright County.  The lake has poor water quality and has experienced summerkills and winterkills in the past.  Lake Constance has a public access located along the NW side of the lake off of 44th Street NE.  The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and northern pike.  Walleye stocking has been attempted in the past with little success and was discontinued after 1990.  This was the first survey since 2001.\n\nCurled pondweed was surveyed on June 8, 2011 and found growing at or near the surface on 20% of the lake surface area.  Emergent and sub-mergent aquatic plants were surveyed on August 8, 2011.  Sixteen species of aquatic plants were sampled during the survey.  Coontail and Canada waterweed were the most common species.  Rooted vegetation grew to a maximum depth of 9.5 feet.\n\nThe catch of northern pike was low and below the expected values for similar lakes.  Only three northern pike were sampled and ranged from 17 - 32 inches.  Northern pike abundance has decreased each survey since 1990.\n\nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May 2011.  The catch rate was greater than reported in 2001 and double the Montrose area day time average.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5 - 19 inches.  Growth of largemouth bass was slow.  Largemouth bass reached 12 inches in 5 years.\n\nYellow perch abundance was similar to 2001 and near the low end of expected values for similar lakes.  Yellow perch abundance was at or above average from 1979 \u0013 1990, but the catch in both 2001 and 2011 were significantly lower than 1990.  Growth of yellow perch was fast.  Yellow perch reached 7.7 inches in 3 years.  Since northern pike numbers are low and walleye are absent, yellow perch abundance may increase over the next few years.\n\nThe catch of black crappie was low, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappie abundance was at or above average in four of the past five surveys.  This was the lowest catch on record.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4 - 11 inches and averaged 8 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Twenty-seven percent of black crappies were larger than 9 inches.  The largest black crappie was 11 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Black crappie growth was slow.  Black crappie reached 9 inches in 7 years.\n\nThe bluegill catch was lower than 2001, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill averaged 6 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Thirty-five percent of the bluegills were larger than 7 inches.  The largest bluegill was 8.7 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Bluegill growth was average.  Bluegill reached 7 inches in 5 years.\n\nOther species sampled during the survey included: bowfin (dogfish), brook stickleback, brown bullhead, central mudminnow, fathead minnow, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Constance Lake is located in central Wright County, northwest of Buffalo.  It is moderately-sized (161 acres) and relatively shallow (23 feet).  A public access is located at the lake's northwest corner, with limited parking available.  Fisheries staff have managed Constance Lake primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass.  Walleye fry have been stocked occasionally in the past, but not since 1990.  A survey of Constance Lake in 2001 included electrofishing, gillnetting, trapnetting, water quality testing, and a vegetation survey.Water quality testing indicated that the lake is eutrophic or hypereutrophic.  Both summerkill and winterkill events have been reported in the past, and this is often related to high nutrient levels.  Also, curled pondweed grows to nuisance levels in spring, and leads to algal blooms as it decays in summer.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2001 was close to the average for lakes like Constance.  While this was a significant decrease from 1990, average size of pike remained high (3.8 pounds in 2001).  Pike sampled by gill nets in 2001 ranged in length from 19 inches to over 34 inches, with an average of 25 inches.  Only two walleye were captured by gill nets in 2001, and these individuals did not appear to come from years when stocking occurred.  Yellow perch numbers also appeared low in 2001, and down from 1990.  With low numbers of perch, walleye survival is often limited and growth is poor.Forty-three largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing.  This was similar to sampling done in 1990 on Constance Lake, and similar to the average for Montrose area lakes.  Most bass were in the 10-12 inch range, but some were over 18 inches.  Black crappie abundance and average size (0.3 lbs) appeared similar in 2001 to the 1990 survey, and within the expected range for lakes similar to Constance.  Crappie close to 10 inches were sampled in 2001, and the majority of individuals were larger than 8 inches.  The 1995 and 1996 year classes appeared particularly strong, with mean lengths of 9.5 and 8.9 inches, respectively.  Like the black crappie, the bluegill population appeared similar in 2001 to 1990.  These catch rates were high for lakes like Constance, while the mean weight was near the average.  Most of the bluegill sampled by trap nets in 2001 were 5.5-6.5 inches.Constance Lake contains black, brown and yellow bullheads.  In 2001, far more yellow bullheads than black bullheads were caught.  This is surprising, since usually the opposite is true for eutrophic lakes.  Also, the average size of bullheads was high for both species, which is generally an indication of a stable population.  As water quality is degraded, there is often an increase in numbers of small bullheads.  Other species sampled in 2001 included bowfin, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, and white sucker.</p>",

Northern Pike abundance (11.5/gill net) increased significantly from 1984 (3.2/gill net).  The catch was above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Constance.  Fish ranged in size from 16-33 inches and the average length was 23 inches.  Growth was good for all ages and age 4 were the most common.  Yellow Perch were caught at a rate of 10.5/gill net, similar to 1984.  The average length group was 8.0-8.4 inches.  Walleye were scarce (0.8/gill net) - three Walleye were caught, ranging in size from 20-22 inches.  \n\nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing on 5/21/90.  Thirty-seven were taken during 75 minutes of shocking (29.6 per hour).  Largemouth Bass were considered abundant.  Fish ranged in size from 4.5-17 inches and six age classes were represented in the sample.  \n\nYellow Bullhead, Bluegill and Black Crappie were important species caught in the trap nets.  Yellow Bullhead abundance (16.3/trap net) decreased from 1984 (46.8/trap net); however, this was above the range of expected values for similar lakes. The average length was 12 inches.  The Bluegill catch (57.8/trap net) increased from 1984 (13.4/trap net) to a level which above the expected range of values.  The average length group was 6.0-6.4 inches.  Growth was good for all ages and age 3 fish were most common in the sample.  Black Crappie (10.6/trap net) were abundant but less so than in 1984.  The average length group was 8.0-8.4 inches.  Growth was good for all ages and age 4 were most abundant in the sample.</p>",

Only six Walleye were captured and two of these appear to be survivors of a 1977 stocking. The remainder were apparently naturally produced. Black Crappie (33.4/trap net) are abundant, growth is slow, and only ages 4 and 5 were caught. Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead numbers all exceed local averages and are important components of the fishery. Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 6.4/electrofishing hour and seven fish were observed but not captured. Though sample size is small, growth appears good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Constance is a 161-acre recreational development lake located 2 miles northwest of the City of Buffalo in central Wright County. It has a small watershed with the primary land uses being agriculture, forest, and pasture. The lake has poor water quality and has experienced both summer and winterkills in the past. The lake has no outlet so water levels can fluctuate dramatically depending on ground water conditions. A public access is located along the NW side of the lake with room for up to four truck/trailer combos. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2021 to update fisheries data last collected in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been attempted in the past with little success and was discontinued after 1990. No walleyes have been caught over the past two surveys. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have an opportunity to catch quality-sized Northern Pike. The low numbers of pike in the lake has allowed them to achieve a larger size. Anglers are still encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help protect this larger size structure. Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 21 to 37 inches with an average length and weight of 29 inches and 6 pounds. Sixty-five percent of the pike caught were longer than 26 inches and 29% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass may also provide a great angling opportunity with many quality-sized fish in the lake. Two hundred thirty- eight bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May 2021. The catch was much higher than previous surveys and three times higher than the average daytime catch for Sauk Rapids Area lakes. Bass sampled ranged in length from 6 to 19 inches with an average length of 13 inches. Most of the bass were good-sized with 52% being longer than 12 inches and 23% longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch continues to be low. Only nine perch were caught and ranged in length from 6 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches. Since Northern Pike numbers are low and Walleye are absent, Yellow Perch abundance has the potential to increase over the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are another great asset to this lake. In 2021, trap net sampling was completed in the spring instead of summer for the first time. The goal was to capture a larger sample of crappie, but only one was caught. This was the lowest catch on record. However, crappie abundance appears to be good as the gill net catch was within the range of expected values for the lake class. Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 6 to 11 inches and averaged eight 8 inches. Sixty-seven percent of the crappie sampled were longer than 8 inches and 6% were longer than 10 inches. Bluegill catches showed a similar trend as the trap net catch was also the lowest on record, but the gill net catch was the highest. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 7 inches. Although some larger Bluegill were sampled, only 6% were over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. In 2016, Eurasian watermilfoil was identified in Lake Constance. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Sauk Rapids Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
