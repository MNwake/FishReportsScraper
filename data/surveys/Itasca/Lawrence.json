                "narrative": "<p>Lawrence Lake is 395 acres and is located 9 miles north of Taconite, MN.  The lake is part of the Prairie River system with the mainstem of the Prairie entering the lake at the north end.  The lake is bog stained with a low Sechi disk reading of 4.5 ft at the time of the survey.  Because Lawrence Lake is a riverine system it can experience large fluctuations in water levels.  The lake has a public access on the southwest shore and is managed primarily for walleye and black crappie.Walleye gill net catch was 1.8/set which was within the normal range for similar lakes and is similar to the historical range of values from previous assessments.  Walleye varied in length from 7 to 19 inches and averaged 14 inches in length.  Walleye growth was excellent with fish reaching 15 inches by their fourth year.  Walleye movement throughout the Prairie River can be extensive, thus walleye abundance likely fluctuates in Lawrence Lake during the spring and during periods of high water levels.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 1992 because stocking did not appear to contribute to the fishery.  This assessment sampled a period of no walleye stocking which resulted in a gill net catch of 1.8/set.  The previous 1991 assessment sampled a period when walleye fingerlings were stocked in three of the last five years and resulted in a gill net catch of 1.5/set.  Because Lawerence Lake a riverine system, walleye movement throughout the Prairie River system is extensive and previous walleye stocking does not appear to increase walleye abundance.Black crappie are difficult to sample in the summer because they often suspend over deep water.  With this caution in mind, the gill net catch was 5.6/set and the trap net catch was 3.6/set.  Both catch rates were similar to previous assessments.  Size structure was moderate with 31% of fish sampled over eight inches.Northern pike gill net catch was 5.7/set which was slightly less than the average for similar lakes.  This assessment, however, represents an increase over past assessments.  Size structure was generally poor with only 8% of fish sampled greater than 24 inches.Yellow perch gill net abundance was 4.8/set which was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Abundance declined slightly from previous assessments.  Size structure was poor with very few fish over 9 inches in length.  Bluegill trap net catch was 5.0/set which is lower than the average for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish reaching 8 inches.  Other species sampled include smallmouth bass, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tullibee, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and bowfin.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through fishing, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent lawn wastes and sediment from entering the lake.  In addition, if fertilizers must be used, lakeshore owners should consider a brand containing no phosphorous.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lawrence Lake is a 395 acre lake located 9 miles north of Taconite, MN.  The lake is part of the Prairie River system and can experience large fluctuations in water levels.  The lake has a state-owned public access on the southwest shore.  Most of the shoreline is in private ownership and is relatively developed. <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last updated in 2011.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were considered primary management species and Walleye were considered secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2022 to update information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLawrence Lake has a history of producing relatively high numbers of small crappie.  Black Crappie were the most common fish sampled in the gill nets.  The catch of 6.8/net was average for the lake and similar type lakes.  Lengths were similar to previous surveys and ranged from 4.3 to 9.8 inches with an average of 6.9 inches.  Ages 1 through 8 were represented in the sample, with age-1 and -2 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth was considered slow with crappie averaging 8.0 inches after 5 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a catch rate of 2.1/gill net.  This catch was below average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Lower catch rates are desirable because they may contribute to faster growth and better size structure.  Pike lengths resembled the previous survey ranging from 18.3 to 26.6 inches with an average of 22.4 inches.  Four year-classes were represented in the sample (ages 3-5, and 7) with average growth.   Pike averaged 22.5 inches after 5 years of growth.  Pike exceeding 28 inches were sampled in historical surveys but not in recent years.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger Northern Pike to improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at 0.8/gill net.  This catch was below average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Walleye gill-net catches have generally been low in Lawrence, only exceeding 2/net twice in seven surveys.  Lengths from the seven sampled fish ranged from 15.6 to 20.3 inches with an average of 17.1 inches.  Meaningful evaluations of size structure and growth cannot be drawn from such a small sample size.  Due to connectivity with the Prairie River system, Walleye abundance in Lawrence Lake likely fluctuates on a seasonal basis. <br> \n <br> \nLawrence Lake has typically produced Bluegill in low numbers with moderate size structure.  The trap-net catch of 5.9/net was average for the lake.  Size structure was very poor. Only 6% of the sample exceeded 6 inches.  Sampled fish ranged from 3.0 to 8.0 inches, but averaged only 3.8 inches.  The sample was dominated by age-1 and -2 fish less than 4 inches long.  Angling opportunities for Bluegill should improve as these fish grow to more acceptable sizes for anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 3.3/gill net.  This is below the expected range for similar type lakes and a historic low catch for the lake.  A comparable decline in perch catches has occurred in many lakes around the state.  Perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers, ranging from 3.7 to 7.8 inches and averaging 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed, and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.   <br> \n</p>",

The lake is part of the Prairie River system and can experience large fluctuations in water levels.  The lake has a public access on the southwest shore and is managed primarily for walleye and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch in 2010 was 2.4/net, which is higher than any previous assessment and above the lake management plan goal of 2.0/net.  Sampled walleye ranged from 7.5 to 22.0 inches, with a mean length of 12.6 inches.  Walleye recruitment appeared consistent, with ages 1 through 6, and 8 represented in the sample.  Mean length-at-age was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Walleye reached 15.8 inches in 4 years.  No walleye stocking has occurred since 1992, so all fish are the result of natural reproduction or migration within the system.  Due to the connectivity with Prairie River system, walleye abundance in Lawrence Lake likely fluctuates on a seasonal basis.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for black crappie were 3.4/gill net and 3.2/trap net.  The gill-net catch was below the management plan goal of 6.0/net, but both catch rates are within the expected ranges for this lake class and similar to previous surveys.  Gill-net sampled crappie ranged from 5.8 to 10.4 inches with a mean length of 7.8 inches.  Recruitment was somewhat inconsistent, with 68% of the sample attributed to one year class (2006).  Mean length-at-age was below the statewide average for ages 2 and 3, and similar to the statewide average for all other ages.  Black crappie took 6 years to reach 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch declined from 5.9/net in the previous assessment to 3.0/net in 2010.  This catch rate is below the expected range for similar lakes and below the lake management plan goal of 4.0/net.  Size structure also declined from the previous assessment with no fish over 25 inches captured.  Ages 1 through 6 were represented, though age 3 fish made up 42% of the sample.  Mean length-at-age for northern pike was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern pike reached 24.3 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nAs in previous assessments, the bluegill trap-net catch rate remained near the lake class first quartile at 4.9/net.  Size structure was moderate.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 4.7 to 9.1 inches, with a mean length of 6.9 inches.  Ages 3 through 7 were represented, with ages 4 and 5 making up 64% of the sample.  Mean length-at-age was above the lake class average for all ages.  Bluegill reached 8.2 inches in 6 years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for yellow perch was near the lake class median at 10.7/net, up from 4.8/net in the previous assessment.  Size structure was poor with no fish over 8 inches in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in test nets included bowfin, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, tullibee and white sucker. Near-shore IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling with a small-mesh seine and back-pack electrofishing was conducted in 2010 in an attempt to capture smaller fishes not normally encountered with standard sampling gear.  Additional species captured in near-shore sampling included blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, creek chub, golden shiner, sand shiner, spottail shiner, logperch, Iowa darter, johnny darter, tadpole madtom, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.   <br> \n</p>",
