Moonshine Park provides shorefishing opportunities and a place to launch a canoe or kayak.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  Lemay Lake has an aeration system maintained by the City of Eagan to prevent winterkill and protect the gamefish community.  Bluegill and Largemouth Bass have been stocked periodically between 2002 and 2005 and again in 2014 to create a fishable centrarchid community.  Water clarity has fluctuated from 1.5 feet in 2004, 4.0 feet in 2009 and back down to 3.5 feet in 2014.  For more information about Lemay Lake and other Eagan lakes, go to http://www.ci.eagan.mn.us/live/page.asp?menu=2664. <br> \n <br> \nThe winter of 2013/2014 induced winter kill conditions in LeMay Lake in spite of winter aeration efforts. The 2014 population assessment consisted of trapnetting and electrofishing only. Gillnets were not used in this survey. The 2014 results reveal how winter kill can affect a small lake. <br> \n <br> \n Electrofishing revealed LeMay's Largemouth Bass population has declined substantially since the 2009 survey.  No Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2014 by electrofishing and only one 5-inch fish was seen in the trapnets. <br> \nAt this time, panfish abundance is not good due to winter kill.  Of the eight Bluegills sampled using trap nets, all were adult fish stocked earlier this spring by MN DNR.  Black Crappie abundance was low, with only eleven Black Crappie observed and only one exceeding  7.0 inches in length. Varying numbers of Green Sunfish (n=2) and Hybrid Sunfish (n=18) were sampled in assessment. Black Bullhead numbers are down considerably from the 2004 initial survey.  The Black Bullhead population is roughly unchanged from 2009 when 2.40 Black Bullhead were sampled per trapnet. A total of twenty six Black Bullhead were observed in this survey. Other fish sampled were 3 medium sized Golden Shiners.      <br> \n</p>",

Moonshine Park provides shorefishing opportunities and a great place to launch a canoe to fish Lemay\u0019s quality bass population.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Lemay Lake has an aeration system maintained by the city of Eagan to prevent winterkill and protect the sportfish community.  Bluegill and largemouth bass were stocked between 2002 and 2005 to create a fishable bass/panfish community.  Water clarity has increased from 1.5 feet in 2004 to 4.0 feet in 2009.  For more information about Lemay Lake and other Eagan lakes, go to http://www.ci.eagan.mn.us/live/page.asp?menu=2664. <br> \n   <br> \nElectrofishing revealed Lemay\u0019s largemouth bass numbers have doubled since the 2004 survey.  Additionally, nearly 72% of the bass sampled exceeded 15.0 inches.  The 2002 year class was the dominant year class in both the 2004 and 2009 assessments.      <br> \n <br> \nAlthough few panfish exceeded 7.0 inches, numbers were good.  Of the 224 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 81% were below 6.0 inches with no fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  Black crappies were plentiful with only one crappie exceeding 7.0 inches.  Varying numbers of pumpkinseeds, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were sampled in assessment.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads numbers are down considerably from the 2004 initial survey.  Gill net catches went from 142.5/gill net in 2004 to 14.0/gill net in 2009.         <br> \n</p>",
