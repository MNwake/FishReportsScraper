                "narrative": "<p>Big Moose Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large and shallow, and have soft (unmineralized) and turbid (bog-stained) water.  The Secchi water clarity of 12 ft on 6/16/2003 was higher than the average of 6 ft in previous investigations and also higher than the lake class average of 5.6 ft.Big Moose Lake was partially thermally stratified on 06/16/2003 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 65 F.  Good oxygen (6.8 ppm) was retained to the bottom on this date.  Big Moose Lake has several inlets draining local wetlands.  The outlet to the Moose River has rocky areas and shallow falls that limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 75% boulder, 14% muck, 6% sand, and 5% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common aquatic plant is watershield. The 2003 fish population assessment consisted of 6 standard gillnets set in mid June.  It did not include trapnets due to the difficult access, and did not include the standard number of gillnet sets for a lake of this size (12 sets) to limit unnecessary walleye mortality.  The purpose of the assessment was to determine if natural reproduction could maintain the walleye population at desired levels and if the apparent reduction in forage fish populations was affecting walleye growth.  Five previous gillnet assessments, dating back to 1982, consisted of 3-6 gillnet sets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2003 of 24 fish/gillnet (36 lb/gillnet) was near the first quartile for this lake class.  Walleye were introduced to this lake in 1983 and the total catch of fish in this lake has gradually declined from the initial investigation in 1982, which captured 93 fish/gillnet (62 lb/gillnet), most of which were perch and sucker.  Lake Class 16 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The introduction of walleye from 1983 through 1991 was accompanied by the decline in numbers of perch, sucker, and northern pike.  Rock bass and smallmouth bass numbers have remained relatively stable over time.Walleye numbers peaked in 1991 at 15/gillnet and gradually declined to their abundance in 2003 of 8.0/gillnet, which was at the median for this lake class.  Walleye sizes in 2003 averaged 14.8\" (1.3 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 14.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2003 was 28.4\" (6.9 lb).  Ageing of walleye scales collected in 2003 was judged to be difficult, but walleye appeared to be present from 11 different year classes, only one of which (1991) was stocked with walleye.  Growth of two year old walleye captured in 2003 was normal by area standards, while growth of all older year classes was slower than normal.  Few age one or age three walleye were captured in 2003, which may have helped the growth of the two year olds.  Growth of older walleye seemed especially slow.  Most walleye stomachs that were examined were empty.No yellow perch were captured in 2003.  Perch numbers in 1982, prior to the introduction of walleye in 1983, were very high (54/gillnet).  Perch numbers declined abruptly to 10/gillnet in 1986, then gradually declined to zero in the 2003 investigation.  Perch sizes increased during this period, from an average of 8\" in 1982 to an average of 10\" in 1998. White sucker numbers also declined over time, from 30/gillnet in 1982 to 8/gillnet in the 2003 investigation.  Sucker sizes increased, from an average of 13\" in 1982 to an average of 16\" in 2003.Northern pike numbers declined from 4.8/gillnet in 1982 to 1.7/gillnet in 2003.  Pike sizes in 2003 averaged 22.8\" (2.9 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to their sizes in previous investigations.  Pike scales were difficult to read, but only four year classes appeared to be represented in the gillnet catch.  Pike growth appeared to be average by area standards.Rock bass numbers in 2003 were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet (range: 0.6-2.8/gillnet) in previous investigations on this lake.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2003 (3.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.7/gillnet (range: 0.5-2.7/gillnet) in previous investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth sizes in 2003 averaged 13.5\", which was similar to previous investigations.  Growth of smallmouth captured in 2003 was faster than normal by area standards.</p>",

This scenic lake has rugged, rocky shorelines with large boulders and broken ledgerock being common. The landscape is covered by abundant red pines. <br> \n <br> \nThe most common access is via the Moose River in a southerly direction off the Echo Trail (CR116). There are two portages along this route. The first is 160 rods in length and the second is 60 rods. Water levels on the river between these portages can fluctuate seasonally and are influenced by beaver activity. There are 5 designated USFS campsites surrounding the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2014 (10.0/gill net) were slightly higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average walleye sampled was 16.6 inches long and about 4 years old. Twenty-five percent of the walleye aged were older than 10 years and the oldest walleye aged was 27 years old which is the oldest walleye recorded in the area. The largest walleye sampled was 26.8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance in 2014 (6.9/gill net) was about three times higher when compared to past assessments on this lake. Smallmouth averaged 15.6 inches long and about 8 or 9 years old. Sixty-six percent of the smallmouth aged were older than 10 years. The largest smallmouth sampled was 18.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (8.4/gill net) were much higher than the long term average of 1.5/gill net for all assessments on this lake. The average pike sampled was 23.6 inches long and the largest pike was 28.2 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass, yellow perch and white sucker were also sampled in 2014. Rock bass numbers in 2014 (4.6/gill net) were higher than the long term average. The largest rock bass sampled was 13.2 inches long. Perch and sucker numbers were below average.</p>",

Also present were rock bass, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.  No trapnets were set due to inaccessibility.Northern pike sizes were small.  Some large walleye (27\"), and yellow perch (13\") were present.  The walleye population was dominated by a strong 1988 year-class, 48 percent of the walleye catch was comprised of these six year old fish.  Most of the remainder were evenly spread among ages three through five.  Walleye growth (12.4\" at annulus IV) is slower than average for the area.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Moose Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large and shallow, and have soft (unmineralized) and turbid (bog stained) water.Big Lake partially stratifies thermally in midsummer, with bottom temperatures less than 10 F cooler than surface temperatures.  Good oxygen (more than 2 ppm) is retained to within a foot or two of the bottom.  There are several small inlets draining local wetlands.  The outlet to the Moose River has rocks and shallow falls that limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 75% boulder, 14% muck, 6% sand, and 5% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common plant is watershield.The 1998 fish population assessment was not standard in that it did not include trapnets due to the difficult access, and had fewer than the recommended number of gillnets.  The purpose of the assessment was to determine if natural walleye reproduction was maintaining the population at desired levels, and if the apparent decline in populations of forage fish species (yellow perch and white sucker) was affecting walleye growth.   Because this was a special assessment, lake class quartiles were not printed on the assessment.  Previously, four special gillnet assessments were conducted on Big Moose Lake, dating back to 1982.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 31 fish/net was lower than normal for this lake class.  The total catch of fish captured in gillnets in Big Moose Lake had declined by 300 percent because walleye introduced in 1983 and stocked through 1991 have decimated the once abundant yellow perch population.  The total catch by weight in 1998 of 55 lb/gillnet was higher than normal for this lake class and was similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  The added weight of the walleye catch has offset the reduced weight of perch and other species.  Lake Class 16 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of the number and weight of fish in gillnet catches.Fish populations in 1998 were dominated by white sucker and walleye.  Sucker numbers in 1998 (17/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, but have declined from a high of 30/gillnet in 1982 to the low of 17/gillnet in 1998.  Sucker sizes have increased, from an average size of 13\" in early assessments to an average of 17\" in 1998.Walleye were absent in the initial assessment in 1982, and walleye fry were stocked in five of the nine years from 1983 through 1991.  Walleye numbers have been quite stable since their introduction, averaging 11/gillnet.  The 1998 walleye catch of 10/gillnet was normal for this lake class.  Walleye sizes in 1998 averaged 14\"; the largest walleye was 28\".  Growth of walleye captured in 1998 (14\" at age five) was somewhat slow by area standards, and has slowed since the 1991 assessment (16\" at age five).  Seven walleye year classes were represented in the 1998 gillnet catch.Low numbers of northern pike, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch were also captured in 1998.  All of these populations except for rock bass appear to have declined over time in Big Moose Lake.  Perch numbers declined from 54/gillnet in 1982 to 1/gillnet in 1998, and northern pike numbers declined from 5/gillnet in 1982 to 1/gillnet in 1998.  Some large perch (up to 12\") were present in 1998 and in previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Moose Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large and shallow and have soft (low mineral content), bog-stained water.  Secchi water clarity measured 11 feet on 06/15/2009; higher than the average of 6 feet in previous investigations on this lake and higher than the lake class average of 5.6 feet.  The 2009 Secchi water clarity is consistent with recent measurements in 1994 (9 feet) and 2003 (12 feet).   <br> \n <br> \nBig Moose Lake was partially thermally stratified on 06/15/2009 with a surface temperature of 65.8?F and a bottom temperature of 59.7?F.  Good oxygen (10.2 ppm) was maintained to the bottom.  Big Moose Lake has several inlets draining local wetlands.  The outlet to the Moose River has rocky areas and shallow falls that limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 75% boulder, 14% muck, 6% sand, and 5% ledge rock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 4 ft; the most common aquatic plant is watershield. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 fish population assessment consisted of 12 standard gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been used on Big Moose Lake due to the difficult access.  Six previous population assessments, dating back to 1982, consisted of 3-6 gillnet sets.  Twelve is the standard number of recommended gillnet sets for a lake of this size.  The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate whether natural reproduction is sustaining the walleye abundance at desired levels, monitor walleye growth, and monitor the composition of other species in the lake population.  Walleye growth in recent surveys has been slower than normal by area standards, coincident with a decrease in forage species. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2009 was 8.1 fish/gillnet (9.1 lbs/gillnet), which was lower than normal for this lake class and lower than the 2003 catch of 24.2 fish/gillnet (36.5 lbs/gillnet).  Walleye were introduced to this lake in 1983 and the total catch of fish has gradually declined from the initial investigation in 1982, which captured 92.6 fish/gillnet (61.9 lbs/gillnet) composed mostly of yellow perch and white sucker.   Walleye stocking from 1983 to 1991 was accompanied by a decline in numbers of yellow perch, white sucker, and northern pike.  Rock bass and smallmouth bass numbers have remained relatively stable over time.  Lake class 16 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota; in terms of gillnet catches of fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers peaked in 1991 at 15.0 fish/gillnet and have decreased during every subsequent assessment to the 2009 survey catch rate of 2.4 fish/gillnet.  The 2009 catch rate was below normal for Lake Class 16 and lower than the 2003 catch rate of 8.0 fish/gillnet.  Walleye sizes in 2009 averaged 16.1 inches (1.4 lbs), which is in the fourth quartile for Lake Class 16 and larger than the mean for all investigations on this lake (14.5 inches).  Aging of walleye scales revealed the presence of 8 different age classes in 2009.  Growth of age 2 through age 6 walleye was normal by area standards, but growth of age 7 and older year classes was slower than normal growth by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one yellow perch was captured in 2009, resulting in a catch rate of 0.08 fish/gillnet.  Yellow perch numbers in 1982, prior to the introduction of walleye in 1983, were very high (54 fish/gillnet).  The yellow perch catch rate declined abruptly to 10 fish/gillnet in 1986, then gradually declined to zero in the 2003 investigation.  Perch sizes increased during this period, from an average of 8 inches in 1982 to an average of ten inches in 1998.  The lone yellow perch captured in 2009 was 10.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers numbers also declined over time from 30 fish/gillnet in 1982 to 8.5 fish/gillnet in 2003 to 1.0 fish/gillnet in 2009.  Sucker sizes increased from an average of 13 inches in 1982 to an average of 15 inches in 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers declined from 4.8 fish/gillnet in 1982 to 0.6 fish /gillnet in 2009.  Pike sizes in 2009 averaged 20.0 inches (1.5 lbs), which was normal for Lake Class 16 and smaller than the mean length of 23.2 inches for all investigations on Big Moose Lake.  Only 7 pike were caught in 2009 and aging revealed 3 age classes (ages 2-4 years old).  Pike growth appeared to be normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers in 2009 (2.0 fish/gillnet) were higher than normal for Lake Class 16 and identical to the median number per net across all Big Moose Lake investigations.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers in 2009 (2.0 fish/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and comparable to the median catch of 1.8 fish/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Similar to previous assessments, smallmouth sizes in 2009 averaged 14.2 inches.  Aging of smallmouth bass scales indicated the presence of 5 year classes and growth was faster than normal by area standards.        <br> \n   <br> \n <br> \n           <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
