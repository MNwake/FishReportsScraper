The aerators on Long Tom Lake were started on January 4, 2019.  By mid-January, dissolved oxygen was less than 1 ppm in most of the water column and it continued to drop in subsequent measurements.  Winterkill was suspected.  <br> \n <br> \nHundreds of dead fish were observed at ice-out on Long Tom and North Long Tom lakes.  Common Carp were most abundant; Black Crappies and Black Bullheads were also present.  The most recent fish assessment in 2017 indicated quality Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie populations.  On 4/16/19, one standard lake survey gill net was set to determine the presence of gamefish and stocking needs.  The catch included 199 Black Bullheads, four White Suckers and one Walleye.  The Walleye had very likely migrated downstream during spring from Thielke Lake, which did not winterkill.  A substantial winterkill of gamefish had likely occurred.  Walleye and Yellow Perch were stocked into Long Tom in 2019. <br> \nThe last substantial winterkill occurred the in 2012-13, which was followed with stockings of Black Crappies, Northern Pike, Walleyes, and Yellow Perch.  </p>",

The lake is managed to provide angling opportunities for black crappie, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find that black crappie is the main game fish available in Long Tom Lake.  The abundance of crappie has increased since 2005 and most fish were 6.5-8.5 inches long.  However, crappie up to 12 long were sampled.  Black crappies will likely continue to be abundant, as natural reproduction was successful in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fishing will be difficult in Long Tom Lake.  An abundant 2008 year class of walleyes exists, but it will likely be 2-3 more years before fish are large enough to keep.   <br> \nBluegill were more abundant in 2008 than in 2005, but abundance was still low.  Anglers can expect bluegill to be three years old and 5.5-7.5 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have always been in low abundance in Long Tom Lake, and this survey sampled no pike.  Therefore, in the winter of 2008, 134 pike approximately 1.4 pounds each were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish sampled in low abundance were yellow perch and orangespotted sunfish.  Black bullhead, white sucker, and common carp were abundant non-game fish observed.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom Lake is a 133-acre reservoir located three miles east and two miles north of Ortonville in Big Stone County.  The lake is primarily managed for walleyes. A fishing pier and boat launch are located on the north side of the lake.  A winterkill occurred during the winter of 2018-2019 even though an aeration system was being used.  Poor success with aeration had also occurred during previous winters and therefore it was discontinued as a management tool at Long Tom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLow water, drought, early ice and a thick snowpack resulted in low oxygen and winterkill in Long Tom Lake during the winter of 2022-2023.  Almost no measurable oxygen was present by mid February of 2023.  Thousands of dead fish were observed during ice-out.  Walleye fry were stocked during spring and black crappie and yellow perch will be stocked when available. <br> \n <br> \nThis standard survey revealed that although the winterkill was severe, it wasn't complete.  Standard sampling using a gill net and trap nets captured black bullheads and common carp during spring.  Small mesh trap nets were used to assess natural reproduction in late summer.  The catch primarily consisted of fathead minnows, black bullheads and common carp, however two young-of-year walleyes were also caught.  The fishery will require some time to recover from the winterkill and good fishing will likely be at least two years into the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom is a 133 acre lake located three miles east and two miles north of Ortonville in Big Stone County.  Primary game fish include black crappie, walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.  An aeration system is typically operated during the winter and anglers should use caution when traveling on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing had been good in recent years until a substantial winterkill occurred the winter of 2012-13.  Although the aeration system was in operation, it was unable to maintain adequate oxygen levels given the severe conditions and almost all game fish perished.  The lake was restocked with game fish during 2013 and 2014 including black crappie, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low during 2014.  Although some natural reproduction had occurred, the population will require some additional time to recover. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant in 2014, with fish measuring from 7-18 inches.  Walleye stocking has worked well, and anglers reported some success during the winter of 2014-15.  Small walleye were abundant during the fall of 2014.  Although fry had been stocked into Long Tom, many of the young walleye had migrated into the lake from upstream walleye rearing ponds.  With good survival and growth, anglers may expect to see better numbers of walleye from 12-14 inches available by the winter of 2015-16. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of northern pike were sampled in 2014.  Most pike belonged to the 2013 year class and measured 15-19 inches.  These pike resulted from natural reproduction by winter rescue pike that had been stocked in early spring of 2013.  Pike were experiencing fast growth and they can be expected to measure 20-25 inches during 2015. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of yellow perch were present during 2014.  The vast majority were from the 2013 year class and measured 5-7 inches.  They can be expected to be close to ten inches by late 2015. <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen remained adequate during the winter of 2014-15 and anglers can expect the fishery to continue to improve during 2015.  Management activities will include additional stockings as appropriate, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen, winter fishing pressure counts and a 2017 population assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom Lake is managed primarily for black crappie and walleye and secondarily for northern pike and yellow perch.  Annual monitoring has indicated that oxygen levels can decline to the point of winterkill.  The Save a Lake Aeration organization installs a pump and baffle aeration system in winters when deemed necessary.     Black crappie were abundant in 1999 with catch rates greatly exceeding those of past assessments.  Crappie had fast growth rates, with fish up to 13 inches and age 8 collected.  The vast majority (98%) were age 3 and less and ranged from 4-9 inches.  If fast growth continues and overharvest does not become a factor, a quality black crappie fishery should develop in the next few years.  Few young-of-year fish were caught during the assessment, indicating poor reproduction.        Approximately 99,000 walleye fry are stocked into Long Tom in odd numbered years.  Typically, strong year classes  correspond to stocked years, indicating that stocking is primarily responsible for maintaining a walleye fishery.  In 1999, walleye were present in moderate numbers.  The majority (64%) were age 2 and ranged in size from 12-15 inches.  Individuals up to 10 years old and 26 inches were also observed.  Growth rates were relatively fast.     Northern pike were found in low abundance in 1999 and were substantially lower than what was found in 1996.  The dam on Long Tom failed during the spring flood of 1997 and was not repaired until the fall of 1998.  The extended period of low water limited natural reproduction by decreasing available spawning habitat.  Reported high angler success during the summer and winter of 1997 also contributed to the decrease in northern pike abundance.      Yellow perch were present in moderate numbers with most fish measuring 5-8 inches.     Abundant populations of black bullhead, carp and white sucker were present in 1999.  The majority of black bullhead were less than 8 inches long.  Carp were not present before 1997, when they migrated in from Stoney Run Creek after the dam failed.  Although no young-of-year carp were indicated in the assessment, it is likely that a reproducing population will become established. Future increases in carp abundance could be detrimental to other fish species.     Fisheries management plans for Long Tom Lake include continued walleye stocking in odd numbered years, winter DO monitoring, stabilizing eroding shorelines and a complete lake survey in 2002.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom Lake is managed primarily for black crappie and walleye, with northern pike and yellow perch receiving secondary emphasis.  A substantial crappie population existed in the lake in the 1970's according to area residents, until a freeze-out occurred the winter of 1978-79.  Black crappie were re-introduced in 1992 when about 300 adults were stocked.  These fish spawned successfully and numerous young black crappie were noted during 1992 and 1993.  Black crappie appear to be well on their way to becoming reestablished.  Walleye were present in moderate numbers during the 1993 survey and the majority of the fish were two year olds which ranged in size from 13 to 17 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked during odd numbered years and strong walleye year classes have usually corresponded to years of stocking.  Self-sustaining yellow perch and northern pike populations of moderate abundances were noted during 1993.  A fair number of eight inch or larger yellow perch were sampled and anglers have reported successful catches of this species at times.  Northern pike appeared to be absent following the 1978-79 winterkill until low numbers were noted during a 1987 investigation.  Considering the amount of available spawning/nursery habitat upstream, northern pike have the potential to replace walleye as the dominant predator in Long Tom Lake.   Although introductory stockings of largemouth bass and bluegill were made in the 1980s, very low numbers of these species appear to exist.</p>",

Primary game fish species managed include black crappie, walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch. <br> \n     Crappie fishing had been good in recent years.  However, the severe winter of 2010-11 resulted in a substantial winterkill at Long Tom Lake.  Although an aeration system was in operation, the excessively long winter and deep snow resulted in conditions so severe that the aeration system struggled to maintain adequate oxygen levels.  The winterkill wasn't complete and adequate numbers of black crappie and yellow perch survived and they are expected to reestablish their populations to fishable numbers.  Few adult walleye or northern pike survived.  Walleye fry were stocked during the spring of 2011 and numerous young of year walleye were noted during fall electrofishing.  Northern pike may be stocked if sufficient forage exists and pike become available. <br> \n    Anglers should expect slow fishing for game fish until 2013.  However, black bullhead and common carp were abundant and can provide alternative angling opportunities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom is a 133-acre reservoir located three miles east and two miles north of Ortonville in Big Stone County.  Winter anglers should use caution when traveling on the lake because an aeration system creating thin ice and open water is frequently operated. <br> \n <br> \nA winterkill occurred during the winter of 2012-13.  Although the aeration system was in operation, it was unable to maintain adequate oxygen levels given the severe conditions and almost all game fish perished.  The lake was restocked with Black crappies, Northern pike, Walleyes, and Yellow perch.  Winter dissolved oxygen levels have remained adequate since 2013.  This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Long Tom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were abundant during 2017.  Stocking and natural reproduction have allowed the population to rebound to a pre-winterkill level.  The majority of crappies were 8.5 to 10 inches.  Walleye stocking has worked well and many walleyes from 12-15 inches were present.  Anglers have reported some good catches of Walleyes in recent years.  Although Northern Pike were abundant in the previous survey (2014), zero were caught in 2017.  Pike have not been stocked since 2013 and it appears no natural reproduction has occurred recently.  Moderate numbers of Yellow Perch were present in 2017 with some up to 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities may include additional stocking as needed, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen, winter fishing pressure counts and fish surveys. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>WAE IS THE PRIMARY SPECIES MANAGED IN THE LAKE. THE POPULATION HAS BEEN SUSTAINED BY FRY STOCKING ON AN EVERY OTHER YEAR BASIS SINCE 1985.  WAE AGE CLASSES FROM 1+ THROUGH 9+ ARE REPRESENTED IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES CORRESPOND TO STOCKED YEARS EXCEPT FOR 1986, WHICH WAS A HIGH WATER YEAR AND A STRONG YEAR FOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  GILLNET NUMBERS INCREASED FROM 3.0 TO 20.0 PER LIFT AND POUNDS PER GILLNET SET HAVE INCREASED FROM 2.9 TO 38.5 POUNDS SINCE THE 1987 ASSESSMENT.  MEAN LENGTH OF WAE HAS INCREASED FROM 15.3 TO 16.4 INCHES AND MEAN WEIGHT FROM 1.4 TO 1.9 POUNDS SINCE 1987.  OVERALL GROWTH RATE OF WAE IS FAST.  GILLNET NUMBERS AND POUNDS PER SET ARE 7 AND 22 22 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, RESPECTIVELY. NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS HAVE SAMPLED (YOY) WAE IN BOTH STOCKED AND NON-STOCKED YEARS.  WAE YOY FROM SHORELINE SEINING RANGED FROM A HIGH OF 22 IN 1983 TO 4 IN 1986.  SEINING WAS DISCONTINUED IN 1989 DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF USING THIS SAMPLING METHOD ON THIS PARTICULAR LAKE.  QUARTER INCH TRAPNETS WERE SUBSTITUTED AND FOUR YOU WAE, 4.1 TO 6.0 INCHES WERE SAMPLED.  ELECTROFISHING WAS ALSO USED IN 1989 AND 20 YOY WAE, 4.3 TO 8.2 INCHES IN LENGTH WERE SAMPLED.  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED IN THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT. NOP NUMBERS IN GILLNETS HAVE INCREASED FROM 0.2 TO 4.2 SINCE 1987.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF THE FISH IS 18.5 INCHES AND 1.8 POUNDS RESPECTIVELY.  THE PIKE COMPRISE THREE AGE CLASSES, 1+ TO 3+ AND 79% WERE YEARLINGS (AGE 1+).  IN THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT PIKE EXHIBITED A FAST RATE OF GROWTH.  GILLNET NUMBERS AND POUNDS PER SET ARE 4.2 AND 2.8 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN RESPECTIVELY.  THIS POPULATION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY LOCAL STOCKING AND/OR MIGRATION IF FISH INTO THE LAKE.  THE LAST STOCKING OF NOP WAS IN 1974, FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE LAST WINTERKILL ON THE LAKE.  NO NOP WERE SAMPLED IN THE INITIAL SURVEY IN 1983.  ONE NOP YOY WAS SAMPLED BY SEINING IN 1986.  TWENTY YOY RANGING FROM 6.6 TO 7.7 INCHES WERE SAMPLED BY 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS IN 1989.  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED IN THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT.  YEP NUMBERS IN GILLNETS HAVE DECREASED FORM 89 TO 46 PER SET SINCE 1987, AND POUNDS PER SET HAVE DECREASED FORM 42.4 TO 7.4. MEAN LENGTH OF PERCH HAS DECLINED FROM 9.2 INCHES IN 1987 TO 6.0 INCHES IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  THE PRESENT POPULATION CONSISTS OF THREE AGE CLASSES, 1+ TO 3+, WITH 77% YEARLINGS.  THE PERCH EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  GILLNET NUMBERS AND POUNDS AND POUNDS PER SET ARE 4.6 AND 6.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  BLG ADULTS AND LMB FINGERLINGS ARE THE ONLY OTHER SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN STOCKED SINCE THE LAKE WINTERKILLED IN 1979.  LMB FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1986 AND 1988 IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A FISHABLE POPULATION.  NO ADULTS HAVE EVER BEEN SAMPLED.  IN 1989, 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS AND ELECTROFISHING EACH CAPTURED ONE YOY BASS.  IN THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT THREE YOY BASS RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 3.8 TO 4.4 INCHES WERE SAMPLED BY 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS.  FOUR HUNDRED ADULT BLG WERE STOCKED IN 1980.  NUMBERS OF BLG PER TRAPNET SET HAVE RANGED FROM 3.8 IN 1983 TO 1.0 IN 1987.  THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT AVERAGED 1.1 PER SET.  NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE AGED FISH WERE YEARLINGS. THOSE FISH WERE PRIMARILY CAUGHT IN 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS.  MEAN LENGTH OF BLG IS 4.5 INCHES. THESE FISH EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  TRAPNET NUMBERS AND POUNDS PER SET ARE 4.4 AND 7 TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIANS, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE NUMBERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL BLG POPULATION.  THE LAKE DROPS OFF VERY RAPIDLY FROM THE SHORELINE, MAKING TRAPNETTING VERY DIFFICULT AND THE BLG MAY HAVE BEEN UNDERSAMPLED.  NUMEROUS YOY BLGS ARE SAMPLED IN EVERY NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK.  BLB NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED FROM 3.9 TO 222 FISH PER GILLNET SET SINCE 1987.  MEAN LENGTH HAS DECREASED FROM 9.2 TO 7.9 INCHES.  GILLNET CATCHES ARE 13.7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE WTS POPULATION HAS REMAINED STABLE AT ABOUT 8.0 FISH AND 18 POUNDS PER GILLNET SET.  GILLNET CATCHES ARE 12.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN THE LAKE ARE ORANGESPOTTED SUNFISH, FATHEAD MINNOW, IOWA DARTER AND JOHNNY DARTER.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom is a 133 acre lake located near Ortonville in Big Stone County.  It is primarily managed for black crappie and walleye, with secondary emphasis on northern pike and yellow perch.  Annual monitoring has indicated that winter dissolved oxygen has occasionally declined to the point of winterkill.  Save-a-Lake and Odessa Sportmen's Club operate an aeration system when necessary.  An extensive winterkill has not been documented in the last 10 years.  Low oxygen was again detected during the winter of 2005/2006 and an ice-out investigation will be conducted in 2006 to evaluate potential winterkill.     In 2005, test nets indicated an abundant black crappie population.  Sampled crappie measured up to 11 inches long, with most measuring 7-8 inches.  Although growth rates were slower than expected for Long Tom Lake, anglers should expect good numbers of 8-10 inch to be available in 2006 and 2007.  Slow growth was attributed to a lack of small forage fish.  However, with a limited food supply, crappies may more readily bite.     Walleye numbers were down considerably in 2005 when compared to recent assessments.  Reasons for the declines are unclear.  Poor walleye reproduction and fry survival were noted in assessments conducted in 2002-2004.  However, to compensate for these year classes, walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in 2003 and 2004.  According to the 2005 assessment, neither of these stockings appeared to have recruited into the fishery.  Walleye adults were again stocked in the fall of 2005.  Contribution of this stocking to the walleye population will be evaluated by future assessments.     Northern pike were moderately abundant in 2005 and ranged from 22-33 inches in length.  Historically, northern pike abundance has correlated to spring water levels.  Assessments following high water springs have generally found increased abundance of northern pike.  Northern pike require flooded grass and marshy areas for spawning.  These areas are enhanced in Long Tom Lake in years with high water levels and result in increased northern pike reproductive success.     The yellow perch population was at a historic low for Long Tom Lake.  As with northern pike, yellow perch generally have increased reproductive success during high water springs.  Low spring water levels have occurred recently and limited reproduction has occurred.  In addition, yellow perch are one of the primary food source for walleye and northern pike, and predation has likely reduced the abundance of adult perch.       Bluegill and largemouth bass were sampled in low to moderate numbers in test nets or during fall electrofishing.  Although individual bluegill measured 7 inches, most measured less than 5 inches.  Most largemouth were young-of-year, measuring less than 5 inches.  Bluegill and largemouth bass are among the more vulnerable species to low oxygen concentrations and may have suffered from conditions found during the winter of 2005/2006.       Black bullhead and common carp were abundant in 2005.  Most bullhead measured near 7 inches.  Common carp abundance has increased since they first entered the lake in 1997 and has resulted in poorer water quality and gamefish habitat.     Future management activities for Long Tom Lake include a winterkill investigation in 2006, annual fall electrofishing to assess young-of-year walleye abundance, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and angling pressure, stocking as needed, and a fisheries population assessment in 2008.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom is a 133 acre lake located in Big Stone County near the city of Ortonville.  It is primarily managed for black crappie and walleye, with secondary empasis on northern pike and yellow perch.  Monitoring has indicated that winter dissolved oxygen has occasionally declined to the point of winterkill.  The Save-a-Lake and Odessa Sportsmen Club operate an aeration system on Long Tom Lake when necessary.  Extensive winterkill has not been documented on Long Tom Lake in the past 10 years.       Anglers have had fairly consistant success for black crappie in recent years, particularily during the winter and spring.  In 2002, black crappie were abundant with catch rates nearly four times higher than the expected range.  Although the majority of crappie measured 8 inches or less, a good number of 9-12 inch fish were also sampled.  Growth was slightly slower than normal for Long Tom Lake.  Slow growth can likely be attributed to increased competition for a limited food source.  Even with slightly slower growth, a quality crappie fishery should persist.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 2002.  All walleye sampled were from the 2001 year class and measured 7-11 inches.  With normal growth rates, many of these walleye will measure 14-15 inches by the winter of 2004.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2001.  Prior to stocking, fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of yearling walleye for OTC marks revealed the fry stocking accounted for 46 percent and natural reproduction 54 percent of the 2001 year class.  High spring water levels in 2001 enhanced walleye spawning habitat and allowed for increased spawning success.     Northern pike were abundant and most measured 18-21 inches.  All but one pike sampled belonged to the 2001 year class.  High spring water levels in 2001 allowed for exceptional natural reproduction of northern pike.  North Long Tom Lake and upstream wetlands are primary spawning areas for Long Tom Lake.      Yellow perch were moderately abundant.  The largest perch sampled was 10.3 inches, however the vast majority measured less than 8 inches.  Perch are growing at rates normal for Long Tom Lake.  Although abundant predator fish present will likely limit the survival of small perch, a good number of 8-10 inch fish should be available over the next couple of years.     Low numbers of bluegill and largemouth bass were sampled.  Bluegill measured mainly 6-7 inches, although one individual was caught that measured 10.3 inches.  Two largemouth were sampled with the largest measuring 11.6 inches.  Numerous young-of-year bass were observed while electrofishing.       Black bullhead, carp and white sucker were abundant.  Most black bullhead measured less than 5 inches and would not draw much angler interest.  Carp first entered the lake during the flood of 1997 and their population continues to expand to the detriment of habitat and water quality of Long Tom Lake.     Future management activities for Long Tom Lake include annual fall electrofishing to evaluate young-of-year walleye abundance, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and angling pressure, walleye fry stocking in 2003, and fisheries population assessment in 2005.</p>",

It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 133 acres.  A public concrete boat ramp, parking area, and fishing pier are located along Long Tom's northern bay. <br> \n     Long Tom Lake has provided good fishing for black crappie, walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and bullhead.  However, a severe winterkill during early 2011 substantially reduced the game fish population.  Long Tom was restocked with walleye in 2011, and black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and walleye in 2012.  This 2012 population assessment revealed the game fish population was beginning to recover with moderate numbers of black crappie, walleye and yellow perch present.  Unfortunately the winter of 2012-13, which had begun relatively mild, became extended with substantial late season snowfalls.  Oxygen levels declined dramatically during February even with an aeration system operating, and a severe winterkill likely occurred again.  Prior to the 2011 and 2013 winterkills the last substantial winterkill had occurred in 1979. <br> \n     Long Tom will be restocked with game fish during 2013 to begin reestablishment of the fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom is a 133-acre reservoir located three miles east and two miles north of Ortonville in Big Stone County.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleyes and Yellow Perch.  A fishing pier and boat launch are located on the north side of the lake.  A winterkill occurred during the winter of 2018-2019 even though an aeration system was being used.  Poor success with aeration had also occurred during previous winters and therefore it will no longer be used as a management tool at Long Tom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLong Tom Lake was restocked with Walleyes and Yellow Perch following the winterkill.  Winter dissolved oxygen levels have remained adequate since then.  This 2020 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect fish population data using gill nets and small-mesh trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted survey data from Long Tom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant from 10-14 inches, with fish up to 18 inches caught.  These Walleyes resulted from stocking fry, yearlings and adults in 2019-20.  Although 1,500 Yellow Perch adults were stocked in 2019, low numbers were caught in this survey.  Most perch were less than nine inches.  Young-of-year Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets, indicating that some natural reproduction had occurred.  Black Bullheads, Common Carp, Fathead Minnows and White Suckers were caught in moderate to high numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities will include additional game fish stocking as needed, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fish surveys. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Tom Lake is managed primarily for black crappie and walleye, with northern pike and yellow perch receiving secondary emphasis.  Crappie were abundant in the 1970s according to area residents, until they froze-out during the winter of 1978-79.  Black crappie were reintroduced in 1992 when 300 adults were stocked.  These fish have successfully established a naturally reproducing population.  Anglers caught many black crappie in early 1996 measuring from 7-9 inches.  However, black crappie have not become overly abundant, probably due to predation by northern pike and walleye.     Northern pike have become extremely abundant during the 1990s.  This has probably occurred due to increased spawning habitat created by high spring water levels.  In 1996 25.3 northern pike were caught per gill net, which is six times the average catch for lakes similar to Long Tom Lake, and almost ten times the 1993 catch of 2.8 per gill net.  These fish measured from 16-28 inches and were from 1-3 years old.  Larger northern pike have also been observed in the lake.  Northern pike has replaced walleye as the dominant predator species in Long Tom Lake.     Walleye were present in moderate numbers in 1996.  The majority of them were from the 1993 year class and they measured about 18 inches.  A lack of smaller fish was apparent; no walleye were caught less than 15 inches long.  Walleye fry have been stocked during odd numbered years and strong year classes have usually corresponded to years of stocking, however a 1995 fry stocking apparently failed.  Yellow perch were also present in moderate numbers with sizes mainly from 5-6 inches.</p>",
