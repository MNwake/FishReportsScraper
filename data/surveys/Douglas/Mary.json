                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides ample quality habitatfor centrarchids.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 22 feet.  Hardstem bulrush and commoncattail are common in shoreline areas.  Firm bottom substrates consisting of sand, gravel, and rubbleare common throughout the lake.  Water quality and clarity were desirable in 1993.  Indices exceed the90th percentile of mean values for lakes within the North Central Hardwood Forests ecoregion. Accelerated shoreland development and increases in Aquatic Plant Management permits have raised someconcerns about the loss of emergent vegetation and aquatic habitat.  Walleye catches averaged 10.2 fish/gillnet in 1993 which exceeds the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics.  Size structure of the walleyepopulation is indicative of a quality fishery.  Average weight of fish captured was 2.3 pounds.  Mostfish ranged from 15 to 22 inches in length.  An extensive research project conducted from 1986 -1991demonstrated that high density walleye fingerling stockings did not increase walleye abundance orimprove angler catch rates.  Strong, consistent natural reproduction is primarily responsible forwalleye abundance in Lake Mary.  Northern pike gillnet catch rates increased from 4.2 fish/net in 1991to 9.3 fish/gillnet in 1993.   The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 3.0 - 8.2fish/gillnet.  Size structure of the northern pike population has improved, despite the apparentincrease in abundance.  Average weight of fish captured in 1993 was 1.8 pounds.  The recent increasein northern pike is likely due to increased natural reproduction with the return of normal to highwater levels.  Largemouth bass are abundant and should provide quality angling opportunities.  Electrofishing yielded 52 fish per hour in 1993.  Average weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds. Bluegill catches averaged 19.1 fish/trapnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates forthis lake type.  Fifty percent of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however no fishexceeded 8 inches.  Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 2.1 fish/trapnet.  Black crappie populationsare not adequately sampled in survey gear during summer months.  The normal range of mean catch ratesfrom similar lakes is 0.2 - 1.5 fish/trapnet.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.3 yellow perch/net in 1993. The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 8.1 - 50.5 fish/net.  High densities ofnorthern pike and walleye are likely suppressing yellow perch abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary is a 2,450-acre, fertile basin located southwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  This lake is relatively shallow with a mean and maximum depth of 17.0 and 40.0 feet, respectively.  Shallow, productive lakes are often popular \"early season\" lakes.  Fishing pressure can be high on this basin, especially during the Walleye opener.  Residential development is considered moderate and numerous resort businesses are present.  Thus, this lake is often a busy one throughout the open water season.  Winter angling is also popular.  Two public accesses are available.  One is located along the northern shoreline where the lake is relatively shallow.  During periods of low water levels, launching larger boats at this access can be problematic.  The other access is located in a large bay, commonly referred to as \"Little Mary Lake\", in the southwest corner of the lake.  Boaters using this access should be aware of the \"no wake zone\" that is posted in the channel connecting this bay to the larger basin.  The posted area is a narrow, relatively shallow channel between stands of emergent vegetation. \n \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2017 to assess the fish community of Lake Mary.  Survey results indicated an abundant Walleye population, which is typical for this lake.  Gill net catches are often considered high when compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Walleyes up to age 15 were sampled but majority of this population was comprised of younger, smaller fish.  The 2015 year class was especially strong.  Mean size of Walleyes captured in gill nets was 14.3 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Some annually inconsistent natural Walleye reproduction occurs on Lake Mary.  Thus, Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement this population.  Additional fingerlings and yearlings have been stocked by the Lake Mary Association.  Black Crappies continue to be abundant but catches have declined from the record-high levels observed during the 2013 survey.  Size structure of this population was excellent.  Mean length was close to 9.0 inches and the largest crappie sampled was 12.4 inches.  The Bluegill population exhibited moderate abundance and size structure.  Plenty of sunnies exceeding 6.0 inches were sampled, but very few were longer than 8.0 inches in length.  The Largemouth Bass population can also be described as moderate in terms of abundance and size structure.  Bass tend to grow slowly in this basin.  Electrofishing results have indicated that very few bass ever exceed 17.0 inches in length.  Similar to previous surveys, Northern Pike were moderately abundant.  Small \"hammer handle\" pike comprised the majority of the population sample.  Mean size in 2017 was just 20.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these small pike to help keep this population in check.  Yellow Perch abundance has increased slightly since the record-low level documented in 2013, but survey catches were considered low for this type of lake.  Most perch sampled were small, but a few were of harvestable size. \n         \nOther species sampled during the 2017 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2021.\n       \nLake Mary is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2013.  Water clarity during the 2017 survey was higher than recent preceding surveys.  Similar to other Minnesota lakes infested with this aquatic invasive species, further increases in water clarity are likely.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary (2,450 acres) is located five miles southwest of Alexandria.  Water clarity is moderate (5.0 feet) and aquatic plants are common in shallow areas.  Average depth is 17.0 feet with a maximum depth of 40.0 feet.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie are common.  Lake Mary has two public accesses.  One is located on the southern shoreline off Lake Mary Circle SW.  An additional access is located off Minnesota State Highway 27 on the northern shoreline.  \n\nWalleye are abundant (13.3/gill net) in Lake Mary.  Average size was 15.7 inches, but the largest exceeded 26.0 inches.  Twelve age classes were present in the 2021 survey.  Three-year-old Walleye were the most common and accounted for 56% of the gill net catch.  Growth rates were rapid.  Walleye averaged 15.2 inches at age 3 in the August survey.  Walleye fry are stocked on alternate years to maintain the fishery.  Recent young-of-year surveys documented strong numbers of juvenile Walleye.  Good fishing opportunities will continue into the coming years.  \n\nNorthern Pike remain abundant (7.9/gill net).  Over 76% of all pike collected were less than 22.0 inches.  An over-abundance of small pike likely has a negative effect on other fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the liberalized pike harvest regulation (anglers are able to keep up to 10 pike with no more than two fish longer than 26 inches; all fish from 22-26 inches must be released).  Abundant aquatic vegetation in Lake Mary provides nearly ideal Largemouth Bass habitat.  Average size was 14.3 inches, but large bass are present.  Bluegill are common.  Average length was 6.0 inches with a maximum length of 8.9 inches.  Despite having rapid initial growth, few Bluegill exceed 8.0 inches.  Reduced growth and a modest maximum length may be related to competition with other Bluegill for resources.  Increased harvest on moderate-sized Bluegill (6.0-7.0 inches) would likely improve growth rates.  Black Crappie are common (5.8/gill net) in Lake Mary.  Crappie averaged 10.0 inches, with some individuals surpassing 12.0 inches.  Strong numbers of age-1 and -5 crappie were present and will likely provide good fishing opportunities for the coming years.  Yellow Perch are common (2.8/gill net), but numbers of harvestable individuals is low.\n\nOther species recorded in the 2021 lake survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2025.  \n\nZebra mussels, an aquatic invasive species, are present in Lake Mary.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment and remove aquatic vegetation prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mary Lake was conducted over several days between July 1-15, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 22 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including six that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and four that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The relative abundance of these species has significantly changed since the 1974 survey but are near levels indicated by the survey conducted in 1955. Recent supplemental stockings of Northern Pike, 1979 and 1978 may have contributed to the significant increase in numbers of Northern pike sampled. The median size of the Northern Pike has remained the same. Comparisons of the median size from the 1955, 1974 and 1982 surveys indicates no change. Trapnet indices indicate a decrease in abundance of the Bullhead species and a relative increase in numbers of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance has remained unchanged.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary is a large, popular fishing lake located four miles southwest of Alexandria.  It has a surface area of 2,450 acres and shoreline length of 11.7 miles.  Maximum depth is 40.0 feet.  Average depth is 17.0.  Water transparency has declined over the past two decades to average 6.2 feet during summer months.  Algae blooms are common and can be anticipated after strong winds.  Fortunately, such blooms are short-lived.  Fish habitat conditions are changing to favor less vegetation-dependent gamefishes such as walleye and black crappie, but Lake Mary continues to support a well-rounded fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mary is well known for quality walleye fishing.  Walleyes are abundant.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate-year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  Gillnet catches during the 2013 survey averaged 10.0 walleyes/net.  The population has a broad age distribution.  Captures ranged from 8.0 to 27.4 inches in length, but averaged only 13.9 inches due to the relatively high proportion of young fish making up the population sample.  On average, young walleyes grow to exceed 15.0 inches by age 4 and quickly recruit to the harvestable segment of the population. <br> \n <br> \nRecord black crappie catches occurred during the 2013 survey.  Lengths of captures ranged from 3.7 to 12.2 inches.  Multiple age groups were represented in the catch.  Elevated catches were mostly attributable to establishment of a very strong year class in 2010.  These three-year-old fish made up 90% of all crappies captured in trapnets.  Average length at capture was 8.6 inches.  Cohorts of this year class will grow to approach 10.0 inches in late 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill populations can be described as \"moderate densities of medium-sized fish\".  Largemouth bass averaged 14.3 inches in length at capture.  Thirty-seven percent of the electrofishing catch was 15.0 inches and larger.  No 18.0-inch or larger bass were measured.  Northern pike catches averaged a healthy 6.0 fish/gillnet.  Length at capture ranged from 14.7 to 30.0 inches and averaged 20.4 inches.  Most pike were young fish between three- and five-years-old. Six percent of the gillnet catch exceeded 28.0 inches.  Size structure of the bluegill population sample was strongly influenced by establishment of a very strong year class in 2008.  These age-5 captures comprised 67% of bluegill catch.  Average size of captures was 6.8 inches.  In contrast to preceding survey records, no sampled bluegill exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Based on past age and growth information, bluegills have potential to grow larger, but they face significant harvest pressure before reaching eight years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nNotes: <br> \nZebra mussels were found in Lake Mary in 2013.  Please drain all water from your boat and other containers to prevent transfer of this and other aquatic invasive species to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTwo public accesses are available.  The access located on the north shore is relatively shallow and is not conducive to launching larger boats, especially during years with lower water levels. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary is a heavily developed recreational lake located approximately five miles southwest of Alexandria.  Water quality and aquatic habitat remain good and support a quality fishery.  Submergent vegetation grows at depths up to twenty feet.  Hardstem bulrush and cattail are common in shoreline areas.  This aquatic vegetation provides spawning and nursery areas for bass, sunfish, and northern pike.  Firm bottom substrate consisting of sand, gravel, and rock are common throughout the lake.  A large rock, gravel bar located on the north end of the lake is the preferred spawning area for walleye.  Protection of these areas is critical to maintaining a healthy fish community.  Lake Mary is a popular fishing destination for area residents and tourists.  It is well known for its quality walleye fishery.  Gill net catches averaged 19.3 fish per net in 2001.  The average weight of fish captured was 1.2 pounds.  One and two year old fish were abundant.  Walleye fry are stocked in even numbered years to supplement natural reproduction.  One year old fish correspond to a fry stocking in 2000 and two year old fish are totally the result of natural reproduction.  Fall sampling for age-0 walleye with electrofishing indicated another strong natural year class was produced in 2001.  Stocking evaluations dating back to the 1950's have determined that natural reproduction is primarily responsible for walleye abundance in Lake Mary.  Lake Mary also provides all around fishing opportunities.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are abundant.  Currently, the average size of both species is relatively small.  Northern pike averaged about 1.7 pounds and largemouth bass averaged 1.0 pounds.  Bluegill and black crappie are likely abundant, however their numbers are not reflected in the current catch rates.  Trap nets may be less effective for these species in August when the water temperatures are the warmest.  Approximately ten resorts operate on Lake Mary.  An estimated 75% of anglers interviewed during six years of creel research were patrons of a resort.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on August 7, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 stations with five sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 17 stations and conditions prevented the use of seines at seven sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 22 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and three tolerant species (Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Mary Lake based on this survey is just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes due to high catches of tolerant species.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Walleye gillnet indices have increased to 18.0 Walleyes/gillnet up from the 1985 catch of 16.2 Walleyes/gillnet. The mean size has decreased from 1.61 lbs. To 1.49 lbs. These changes are probably the result of an exceptionally strong 1984 year class. This year class was created by a massive fingerling stocking. The 1983 and 1982 year-classes, which are good year-classes were created by natural reproduction and the 1981 year-class was probably a combination of fry stocking and natural reproduction. Growth rates on Walleyes were excellent for the first three years and then it slowed down, so very little growth was seen in ages 4 through 7. Northern Pike numbers were still high with 12.5 Northern Pike/gillnet. The mean size of Northern Pike continued to be very small with a mean size of 1.3/northern. Yellow Perch abundance were characterized by a gillnet index of 2.0 perch/gillnet. This number was very similar to the 1985 assessment. The large Walleye and Northern Pike population probably keep the Yellow Perch abundance very low. Bluegill abundance decreased slightly from 38.6 Bluegills/trapnet in 1985 to 33.7 Bluegills/trapnet in the 1986 assessment. However, the mean size increased from 0.13 lb. To 0.19 lb. The percent of Bluegills over 6.5 inches increased from 14% in 1985 to 27% in 1986. Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were also present. The Bullhead population had good size distribution with the largest Black Bullhead being 15</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides quality habitat forbass, sunfish, and northern pike.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 22 feet.  Hardstem bulrushand common cattail are common in shoreline areas.  Firm bottom substrates consisting of sand, gravel,and rubble are common throughout the lake.  Walleye catches averaged 13.3 fish/gillnet in 1997.  Gillnet catches ranged from 10.0 to 23.3 fish/netin previous surveys dating back to 1982.  These catch rates all exceed the normal range of mean catchrates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet).  Sixtyseven percent of the fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater and ten percent exceeded 20inches.  Walleye fingerling stocking was proven to be ineffective in increasing walleye abundance orangler catch rates in an extensive research project conducted from 1986-1991.  The study found thatnatural reproduction was primarily responsible for walleye abundance in Lake Mary.  Stockingevaluations based on lake surveys dating back to the 1950's reached similar conclusions.  A ten yearalternate year fry stocking evaluation was initiated in 1992.  Annual fall electrofishing is being usedto measure year class strength, in addition to age class distributions of fish captured during regularlake surveys.  Preliminary results suggest that strong year classes have developed in years of frystocking, especially in 1994 and 1996.  Northern pike catches averaged 6.1 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been relatively consistent inrecent years; ranging from 4.7 to 9.3 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1988.  The normal range ofmean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet.  Size structure of the northern pikepopulation is poor.  Approximately one-fourth of the fish were 21 inches or greater in length, and nofish exceeded 25 inches in total length.  Largemouth bass abundance may have decreased since 1993. Early morning electrofishing yielded 24.7 stock-size fish per hour in 1997; compared to a early eveningcatch rate of 50.0 per hour in 1993.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds in 1997, compared to1.0 pounds in 1993.   The decrease in catch rate and shift in size structure may be related to poorreproductive success during the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Cohorts from these yearclasses, especially 1992, were poorly represented in the age class distribution.  Bluegill catchesdecreased from 19.1 fish/trapnet in 1993 to 10.1 fish/trapnet in 1997.  Trapnet catches averaged 20.8,31.6, and 23.7 fish/net in 1991, 1990, and 1989, respectively.  About one-half of the fish capturedwere 6 inches in length or greater, however few exceeded 8 inches.  Poor reproductive success in 1992is evident in the age class distribution of bluegill.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled withstandard survey gear during summer months.  Black crappie catches averaged 1.3 fish/gillnet and 1.0fish/trapnet.  Age-1 fish comprised 20% and age-2 fish comprised 68% of the fish captured in bothgears.  Yellow perch catches averaged 9.7 fish/gillnet in 1997.  Gillnet catches have been consistentin recent surveys; ranging from 7.3 to 14.8 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 4.5 to 9.1 inches in totallength. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Walleye population in Lake Mary is excellent. Not only is there a lot of Walleyes they also have good size natural reproduction would appear to be very successful. The age 2, 3, 5, and 6 all come from natural reproduction, the age 4 are probably the result of natural reproduction and a fry stocking and the 1 year old fish from natural reproduction and a fingerling stocking. The 4 year old Walleyes appear to have grown slower than the other years, this may be the result of planting fry on top of successful natural reproduction,   a thus creating a stunted year class. The fingerling stockings of 1984 and 1985 should be watched to see if future growth is slower for those year classes. Northern Pike numbers are still high and the Northern Pike are very small. None of the Northern Pike aged were over 3 years old. The Yellow Perch population appears to be very low. These low numbers are probably due to the high numbers of Walleye and Northern Pike in the lake. The Bluegill population is very similar to the 1982 survey. The Bluegill population consists of large numbers of small fish with only 14% of the Bluegills being over 6.5 Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass, although not adequately sampled should contribute to the fishery. Yellow Bullheads are also present in numbers and a sizes to provide a quality fishery for those willing to pursue them.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary is a heavily developed recreational lake located southwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Numerous resorts attract many tourists to the lake during summer months.  It is also a popular destination for local anglers.  Two public accesses are operable.  However, the access located on the north shore is relatively shallow and is not conducive to launching larger boats, especially during years with lower water levels.  Water quality and aquatic habitat remain good and support a diverse fish community.  Submergent vegetation is common throughout the basin and grows at depths up to twenty feet.  Extensive areas of emergent vegetation are also present.  This aquatic vegetation provides spawning and nursery areas for many gamefish species.  Firm bottom substrate consisting of sand, gravel, and rock are common throughout the lake.  A large rock, gravel bar located on the north end of the lake is the preferred spawning area for walleye.  Protection of these critical habitats is essential to maintaining a healthy fish community.Lake Mary is primarily managed for walleye with bass, panfish, and northern pike being species of secondary management importance.  It is well known as a quality walleye fishery.  Gill net catches averaged 13.5 walleye/net in 2005.  Although walleye abundance has declined since the 2001 survey it remains above abundance levels expected for this type of lake.  Fall electrofishing surveys indicated extremely strong year classes were produced in 2002 and 2004.  In fact, the 2004 year class was the strongest year class produced in Lake Mary since the initiation of fall electrofishing surveys in 1990.  Walleye numbers are expected to increase in future years as this year class recruits to the fishery.  Size structure of the walleye population is well balanced.  Many small fish are present but good numbers of medium- to large-sized individuals also exist.  Walleye growth rates are moderate to good with most fish exceeding 15.0 inches between their third and fourth growing season.  Walleye spawning habitat is abundant and the population is primarily maintained via natural reproduction.  However, walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  A spring electrofishing survey indicated that largemouth bass are moderately abundant but the majority of this population is comprised of smaller individuals.  Bluegill and black crappie are also an important component of the sport fishery.  However, these species are difficult to sample with trap nets during late summer and survey data does not accurately reflect population abundance or size structure.  Northern pike numbers have decreased in recent years and similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, size structure of this population is poor.  Mean length of fish captured in gill nets was less than 21.0 inches.  Yellow perch abundance is currently low and most fish are relatively small.  Other species collected during the 2005 survey include bowfin (dogfish), tullibee, common carp, white sucker, bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mary is a large, heavily developed recreational lake located southwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The excellent fishery and numerous resorts attract many tourists to the lake during summer months.  It is also a popular destination for local anglers.  Two public accesses are available.  The access located on the north shore is relatively shallow and is not conducive to launching larger boats, especially during years with lower water levels.  <br> \n <br> \n Water quality and aquatic habitat remain good and support a diverse fish community.  Submergent vegetation is common throughout the basin and grows at depths up to twelve feet.  Extensive areas of emergent vegetation are also present.  Aquatic vegetation provides spawning, nursery, and feeding habitat for many gamefish species.  Firm bottom substrate consisting of sand, gravel, and rock are common throughout the lake.  A large rock and gravel bar located on the north end of the lake is the preferred spawning area for walleye.  Protection of these critical habitats is essential to maintaining a healthy fish community. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mary is well known as a quality walleye fishery.    Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  Gill net catches averaged 17.7 walleye/net in 2009, which is well above expectations for this type of lake.   Fall electrofishing surveys and age structure analyses indicated consecutive strong year classes were produced from 2006-2008.  Thus, walleye abundance will continue into the near future.  Size structure of the walleye population is well balanced.  Many small fish are present but good numbers of medium- to large-sized individuals also exist.  Mean size in 2009 was 14.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye grow fast in this basin with most fish exceeding 15.0 inches between their third and fourth growing season.    <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey indicated that largemouth bass are moderately abundant, but the majority of this population is comprised of smaller individuals.  Bluegill and black crappie are also an important component of the sport fishery.  Survey results indicated bluegill were moderately abundant with an average size of 6.6 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Black crappie abundance was much higher than expected for this type of lake due to an extremely strong 2005 year class.  Most fish were larger individuals.  Mean size was 9.4 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Northern pike abundance and size structure have increased in recent years.  Large pike are present but similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, this population is dominated by smaller fish.  Yellow perch abundance and size structure have also increased in recent years.   Most perch are small but harvestable size fish are available.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected during the 2009 survey include black, brown, and yellow bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2013. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
