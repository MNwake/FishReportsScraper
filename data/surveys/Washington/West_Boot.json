The small size of the fish is a result of a winterkill thatoccurred in the winter of 1989-1990.  One larger crappie and some average (2 lb each) northern pike were the onlyfish sampled that would interest most anglers.     Winterkill events and the lack of a designated public access continue to be the major factors limitingfishing on this lake.</p>",
