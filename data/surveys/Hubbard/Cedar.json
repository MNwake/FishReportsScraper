Walleye fry have been stocked with no success.  Northern pike abundance has varied considerably since 1961.  Northern pike numbers are now low and have inconsistent recruitment, but have good average size of 3.7 pounds and 25.0 inches.  Largemouth bass were stocked in 1984 and 1986 and were well sampled with standard gear in 1988, however only one largemouth bass was sampled during 1993 so it is not possible to evaluate the present largemouth bass abundance or size structure.  Black crappies were sampled for the first time in 1993 with the sample containing two year classes.  One year class is in the 6.0 inch range and the other in the 12.0 inch range.  Black crappies should establish a fishable population in the future.  The yellow perch size structure should be a fishable population if the numbers are high enough.  Their recruitment is also inconsistent. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is located ten miles north of Park Rapids on the Hubbard and Becker county line.  Cedar Lake has a surface area of 97 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the south shore of the lake.  Cedar Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Cedar Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Tenth Crow Wing, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Palmer, and Spirit.Anglers can expect to find a low to moderate northern pike population composed of medium to quality sized fish.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 24.2 to 31.0 inches and had an average weight of 4.4 pounds.  Cedar Lake supports an abundant panfish population dominated by small, slow growing, \"stunted\" fish.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 5 - 6 inch range are common with a few fish over 7 inches.  Black crappie numbers are also very high with the population dominated by crappie in the 6-inch range.  The black crappie population in Cedar is limited by very slow growth rates.  Age analysis found that black crappie growth rates were some of the slowest in the area and statewide.  Cedar Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time in 2003 and good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled (68 bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of 12.0 inches with bass measured up to 18.9 inches.  The numbers of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was good when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Cedar Lake.  Other species sampled included yellow perch, black and brown bullhead, and golden shiner.</p>",

Future stocking of northern pike may be necessary if the fishing pressure becomes greater as the survey does no indicate natural reproduction at this time.  Stocking, if undertaken, should be one pound per littoral acre.</p>",

Shoal water soils are mainly sand with about 13 percent rubble and 2 percent gravel.  Only about 3 percent of the lakes surface is covered with emergent vegetation.  Fish taken in test nets were common suckers and yellow perch.  Shoreline seining produced blacknose shiners and a pumpkinseed.  This lake is fished very little at the present time and the only fish harvested was perch.  At the time of the survey there was only one boat on the lake and no cabins or other development.Fish Stocking:Pending furthern winter oxygen tests, this lake could be a good location for experimental muskellunge or catfish plants.  At the present time (1961) northern pike weren't taken in test nets and therefore wouldn't present competition for the muskellunge.  Catfish might be more tolerant to low oxygen and make a good fishery in a lake of this type.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tCedar Lake is located ten miles north of Park Rapids, on the border of Becker and Hubbard Counties. Cedar has a surface area of 103 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet. There is a state owned access on the south shore of the lake, off of County Road 41. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Cedar is in lake class 29. Class 29 lakes generally have a high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet) with a regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Palmer, Spirit and Tenth Crow Wing. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike were sampled in comparable numbers to similar lakes, and the high end of past surveys in Cedar Lake. Pike ranged from 15 inches to 37 inches in length, with a large average size of 23 inches and 3 pounds. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass were first sampled in Cedar Lake in 1988. In 2015 they were sampled by spring electrofishing in low numbers compared to the previous survey in 2003. The average size was good at 14.4 inches, with fish sampled up to 16 inches. <br> \n\tAngling opportunities for panfish include Bluegill, Pumpkinseed and Black Crappies. Bluegills were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes and past surveys, but had a small average size of 4.6 inches. Pumpkinseeds were sampled in high numbers compared to similar lakes and average size of 5.6 inches. Black Crappies were sampled in good numbers, with most fish 6-9 inches. <br> \n\tYellow Perch are important forage for Northern Pike, and numbers in 2015 were high compared to past surveys and similar lakes. Perch covered all sizes, with an average size of 6.9 inches. The largest fish approached 10 inches, with a fair number of fish 8-10 inches.  <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Cedar. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",
