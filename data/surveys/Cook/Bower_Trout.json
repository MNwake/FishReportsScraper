HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF GILLNETS USED, THIS MAY NOT INDI- CATE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN WALLEYE ABUNDANCE. SEVERAL WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, BUT NONE WERE STRONG. NO WALLEYE UNDER 12 INCHES IN LENGTH OR 3 YEARS OF AGE WERE SAMPLED. THIS MAY INDICATE POOR REPRODUCTION OR RECRUITMENT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. WALLEYE GROWTH WAS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS ASSESSMENT. THEY WERE PRESENT IN SUFFI- CIENT NUMBERS AND SIZE TO PROVIDE A FISHERY. SMALLMOUTH BASS GROWTH WAS FAST BY  COOK COUNTY STANDARDS.</p>",
