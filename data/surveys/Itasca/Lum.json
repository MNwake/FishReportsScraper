                "narrative": "<p>Lemonade Lake is a 66-acre lake in Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Lemonade Lake is approximately 6 miles south of Calumet, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 21 ft and 46 littoral acres.  A public access is located on the west shore.  Sand Creek flows through the lake eventually draining into the Swan River.  The influence of the surrounding watershed leads to bog-stained water and poor water clarity with a Secchi disk reading of 4 ft.  Local anglers often refer to this lake as Lemmon Aide Lake or Lammonade Lake.Northern pike gill-net catch was 5.7/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 4.3/net in the previous assessment in 1980.  Size structure was poor with only two fish exceeding 24 inches in the gill net sampled fish.  However, a 38-inch fish was sampled in the trap nets.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 24 inches in 4 years.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 8.0/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in the 1980 assessment was 1.0/trap net.  Size structure was good with fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth for ages one through eight was similar to the statewide average, except ages five and six were slightly faster than the statewide average.  Bluegill reached preferred length of 8 inches in 6 years.  Because it takes 6 years for bluegill to reach acceptable size, anglers should consider releasing larger bluegill to maintain a quality fishery.  Black crappie trap-net catch was 0.6/net, which was slightly lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in the 1980 assessment was 0.5/trap net.  Although abundance was low, size structure was good with fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to statewide averages with fish reaching 8 inches in 3 years.    Yellow perch gill-net catch was 0.7/net, which was below the expected range.  No yellow perch were sampled in the 1980 assessment.  Yellow perch are a preferred prey item for northern pike and may partially explain their poor size structure.  Other species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  Rock bass and largemouth bass were sampled in the 1980 assessment.</p>",
