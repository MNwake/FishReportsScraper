Both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass were present. Walleye numbers were low. Bluegill were the most abundant panfish caught and the population level was close to the statewide average. Eighty percent of Bluegill were age 2 and 3. Growth was good. White Crappie were of average abundance for area lakes. Ages 2, 4, and 5 were sampled; 85% were age 4. Growth was slow. Black Crappie were caught in average numbers. Ages 2-4 were about equally represented in the sample and showed good growth. Silver Redhorse was the most abundant sucker species at 5.5/trap net. Other species taken in low numbers were Black and Yellow Bullheads, White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse and Yellow Perch. Yellow Perch numbers have declined since 1982.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a small, 98 acre lake located in northern Wright County near the City of Clearwater.  It has a maximum depth of 38 feet and a large watershed dominated by agriculture and forest.  Fish Creek runs through the lake and connects to the Mississippi River; water quality is poor.  A small public access is located on the north end of the lake.  The previous lake survey was in 2004 and the lake continues to support a fishery for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nYellow waterlily and cattail are common plants, but invasive Eurasian watermilfoil and curly leaf pondweed are also present.  Fish lake is also designated as infested with zebra mussels due to the Mississippi River connection (where zebra mussels are present), although none have been found yet in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch and size were very similar to 2004; average length (25.4 inches) and weight (3.7 pounds) remained relatively high.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 18.4 to 34.4 inches and 59% were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by boat electrofishing in the spring and the catch rate was below the Montrose Area average.  Lengths ranged from 4.3 to 18.8 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches.  However, good numbers of larger fish were caught; 38% of catchable size (greater than 8 inches) Largemouth Bass were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked in Fish Lake, but were found in low numbers in 2014 (six fish) and in some previous surveys.  Walleye were large; average length and weight were 22.1 inches and 3.8 pounds.  Natural reproduction is unlikely in the lake; Walleye and other riverine species probably immigrate from the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were caught in low numbers in 2014; net catches were below the expected range for lakes similar to Fish, but have been higher in some past surveys.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 7.0 9.6 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and 0.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate in 2014 was higher than 2004, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were below the expected range and lower than 2004; catch rates from past surveys have usually been higher.  Yellow Perch lengths were between 5.8 and 6.9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in low numbers included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Golden Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   The low number of bullheads was remarkable for the area (only two Black Bullheads total); historical catches were usually much higher.  Channel Catfish were first caught in 2004 and may lower bullhead abundance, even in low numbers (only five Channel Catfish were caught in 2014). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a small (98 acres), eutrophic lake located three miles southeast of Clearwater in Wright County.  There is a public access with limited parking located on the north end of the lake off Gowan Avenue.  The lake is connected to the Mississippi River by a short stream, and high water on the river often causes the level of Fish Lake to rise.  The connection also allows fish species such as walleye, smallmouth bass, and redhorse to enter the lake.  In June of 2004, a lake survey was conducted which included spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Fish Lake.  Results were also compared to past surveys to look for changes in the fish community.  Shoreline seining was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction of prominent game fish.  Watershed mapping and aquatic plant surveys were also part of the evaluation.Historically, the abundance of walleye in Fish Lake has been low.  In 2004, only two walleye were sampled during the summer netting; however, 12 walleye were sampled during spring electrofishing.  Walleye are not stocked in Fish Lake, but instead can migrate from the Mississippi River through Fish Creek.  Most of the walleye were small (11-12 inches), with the largest being 21.8 inches.  The northern pike catch rate in 2004 (5.3/net) decreased significantly from the 1993 survey (10.8/net), but was in the range typical of lakes similar to Fish.  The average size of northern pike caught in 2004 was 3.7 pounds, with the largest pike sampled at 36 inches.  The majority of the northern pike were between 20 and 25 inches in length.The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in Fish Lake (3.8/net) decreased significantly from the previous survey (43.8/net), but were within the expected range for lakes similar to Fish.  The yellow perch sampled were small, between 5.0 and 6.4 inches in length.  Forty-one largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in spring, at a rate lower than the median for lakes in the Montrose management area.  Of the catchable size largemouth bass (greater than 8 inches), 25 percent were greater than 12 inches.  The largest largemouth bass sampled in 2004 was 20.7 inches.  Four smallmouth bass were also sampled in Fish Lake ranging in size from 11.3 to 17.7 inches.The catch rate of black crappie decreased from 2.7/net in 1993, to 1.3/net in 2004, and was below the expected range for lakes similar to Fish.  The average size of crappie sampled was 7.5 inches, and most were 2 years old.  A few white crappie were also sampled during the survey.  The trap net catch of bluegill in Fish Lake (15.9/net) decreased from 1993 (36.3/net), and was within the expected range for lakes similar to Fish.  The majority of bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 5.0 to 7.0 inches with a maximum of 8.5 inches. Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were all sampled in low numbers in 2004.  Other species sampled at low densities included channel catfish, bigmouth buffalo, carp, and silver redhorse.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The catch rates for a number of species significantly increased from the 1988 population assessment.  Northern Pike were caught in gill nets (10.8/lift) at about twice the state average for lakes like Fish and reached the highest level reported so far.  The average size Northern Pike weighed 2.7 pounds, which was slightly above the state average (2.6 lbs).  Growth rates for pike were fast for the first 4 years and average for the rest.  In addition to the Northern Pike, Yellow Perch catch rate in gill nets (43.8/gill net) also increased significantly from 1988 (0.3/gill net).  A strong year class (3 year olds) made up the majority of this increase in catch.  Other important species caught during the survey included: White Crappie, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. Catch rate of White Crappie in gill nets appeared to increase from 3.8 to 14.5 per lift in 1993.  The majority of this increase appears to come from a strong year class of 2 year old fish.  White Crappies caught ranged in length from 5.4-10.4 inches and averaged 6.5 inches long.The Black Crappie catch rate decreased slightly from 12.8 to 4.5 per gill net in 1993, but numbers did still remain within expected values for lakes of this type.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.6-8.5 inches and averaged 0.2 lbs (state average).  Growth rates for Black Crappie were average.Bluegill catch in trap nets in 1993 (81.8/net) was the highest reported so far, about 3 times the state average.  Bluegill ranged in size from 3.7-6.6 inches and averaged 5.2 inches.  Growth rates of Bluegill were average.Largemouth Bass were caught by spring electrofishing.  Only 8 Largemouth Bass were captured, at a rate of 2.8 fish/hour of sampling and ranged in size from 5.9-18.1 inches with an average of 12.6 inches.  Since Fish Lake has a direct connection to the Mississippi River, Smallmouth Bass have been reported caught by anglers.  However, none were captured in this survey. Young-of-year Smallmouth Bass were observed near the inlet on the south end of the lake, showing that some spawning was occurring within the lake.</p>",
