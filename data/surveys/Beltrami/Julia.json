                "narrative": "<p>Julia Lake is in class 31 which is a group of lakes distributed throughout north-central Minnesota.  The fish community in Julia is compared with other lakes in the class including Black, Deer, Whitefish, Little Wolf and Upper LaSalle in the Bemidji area.    Walleye fry are stocked in Julia two of three consecutive years and come from Red River watershed genetics.  Sampling in 1996 found walleye abundance far above the average in comparable lakes.  It is also above any previous assessment level found on Julia.  A mean weight of 1.3 pounds is within the normal range but lower than during any previous assessment.  The low average weight is caused by the large percentage of fish from the 1994-1996 year classes.  Nearly half of the walleye examined had Neascus (black spot), a parasite.  Though unsightly, the fish are edible.  The largest walleye was 25.6 inches long and the average length was 14.7 inches.    Northern pike are near the average abundance found in the lake class.  A mean weight of 2.4 pounds is also near average.   The largest pike captured was 36.7 inches long and weighed 10.6 pounds.     Yellow perch are abundant though some previous assessments have found them at even higher levels.  The average weight of 0.4 pounds in 1996 is the highest since 1986 but lower than weights recorded in many earlier assessments.  An average length of 9.0 inches and weight of 0.4 pounds make them attractive to anglers.  The parasites Neascus (black spot) and yellow grubs are common in perch from Julia, but they do not affect eating quality.    The only panfish species found in Julia are rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Rock bass are above the normal range in abundance.  An average weight of 0.3 pounds is in the normal range.  Pumpkinseed are within but near the low end of the normal range in abundance and weight.  With an average length of four inches they are not attractive to most anglers.    Black and brown bullheads have been abundant but the 1996 assessment did not sample black bullheads.  Brown bullheads although present within normal ranges are below the abundance found in most previous assessments.    Previous assessments have also noted white suckers and burbot (eelpout), but none were sampled in 1996.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Julia is a 450-acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet.  The lake is located about 10 miles north of Bemidji in central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the north end of the lake off of county road 26.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Julia is in lake class 31.  Other lakes in the same lake class include Black, Deer, Sand, Whitefish, Little Wolf and Upper LaSalle Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are hardwater lakes with regular shaped shorelines.  The DNR manages the lake for walleye, northern pike and yellow perch.Since 1975 walleye fry have been stocked roughly two out of every three years.  In the 2003 assessment, however, there was evidence that natural reproduction was also contributing walleye to the fishery.  The 1996 and 2003 abundance ratings for walleye were the highest recorded out of 11 assessments since 1970.  In 2003 the size of walleye improved from 1996.  In 2003 the average length and weight was 17.0 inches and and 1.9 pounds.In the past northern pike were stocked 12 times between 1954 and 1981 from winter rescue operations on nearby Puposky Lake.  There has been no noticeable decline in pike abundance since stocking was discontinued.  The 2003 pike catch rate was comparable to other lake class 31 lakes.  There appears to be migration to and from Lake Puposky which is a large shallow lake containing abundant prime pike spawning habitat.  Its ability to produce pike has been documented by the volume of pike removed in winter rescue operations.  Additional areas of prime spawning habitat that are available by connections are Crane and Strand Lakes to the east.  In 2003 there has been a reduction in the size of pike from previous assessments.  Only 12% of the pike were greater than 22 inches in length.In 2003 bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass all were sampled for the first time.  Though unauthorized transportation and stocking of fish is illegal, it continues to occur.  These species, being native to many surrounding lakes, appear to be harmless introductions.  But once populations become fully established, they will certainly be displacing production of other desirable fish species.  The most serious outcome of transporting aquatic species of any kind is the possibility of inadvertently transporting one of many exotic species invading waters through out the country.  Introductions of some exotic species can cause irreversible environmental damage.  We will continue to monitor these three recent introductions to see where their populations will eventually stabilize, and their affect on the rest of the fish community.  Bluegill, because of their recent introduction, are still quite small with only ages 1 - 3 sampled.  No bluegill sampled were over 6.5 inches long.  They are growing fast and acceptable size bluegill will be present in the future.  Members of the sunfish family that are native to Lake Julia sampled in past assessments were rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.  In 2003 pumpkinseed sunfish were still the most abundant sunfish sampled and made up 68% of all sunfish sampled.  They ranged in length from 3.3 to 7.4 inches.Yellow perch are abundant in Lake Julia and provide anglers with quality fish as well as food for predator fish such as northern pike and walleye.  Perch had a diverse size structure ranging from 5 to 13 inches.Another species sampled is black bullhead.  Their abundance was well above what you would typically find in a lake class 31 lake.  They ranged in length from 5 to 14 inches with an average of nine inches.  Their abundance and size provides an excellent bullhead fishery for anglers that appreciate the species.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Julia is a 511-acre lake, located 15 miles north of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. A targeted survey was completed on Lake Julia by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2023 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing, and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 11 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites. A total of 16 species were sampled, which included 5 species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2023 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lake Julia. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nIn coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Upper/Lower Red Lake Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Julia is a 511-acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet located 15 miles north of the city of Bemidji in Beltrami County. There is a public water access located on the north shore of the lake with a concrete ramp and parking for 12 trucks/trailers. Lake Julia is managed for Walleye, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nLake Julia is stocked with Walleye fry on a two out of three year rotation. Fry stocking has provided a consistent Walleye fishery throughout much of the lake's management history. Natural reproduction has also been documented intermittently. Walleye numbers have improved slightly since the last assessment in 2018. The 2023 Walleye gill-net catch rate was over 8 fish per net and is well above the typical range of catch rates from similar lakes. Walleye captured had an average length of over 18 inches with fish just short of 30 inches measured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are relatively new species in Lake Julia. It is unknown how they were introduced but were first recorded in the 2003 population assessment. All three species have been expanding ever since. The 2023 Black Crappie catch of only 4 fish total was well below expectations but they were all between 10 and 11 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are now well established with a trap net catch rate of almost 12 fish per net and fish up to 9.5 inches in length were captured in the 2023 survey. Bluegill growth rates exceed those found in most other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Northern Pike catch rate of 12 fish per net was on the upper end of the range of catch rates for similar lakes. Pike over 32 inches in length were captured in this assessment and nearly 20% exceeded the 22-26 inch protected slot that is part of the North-Central pike zone regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for gamefish. Julia has been known as a good perch lake in the past, although abundance and maximum size of perch captured has declined over the past few assessments. Yellow Perch captured in 2023 had an average size of almost 7 inches with fish just under 9 inches in length measured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the 2023 survey included Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Julia is a 450 acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet and water clarity around 6.5 feet.  The public access has a dock and concrete ramp and is on the north side of the lake off of County Road 26.  There is room for about 8 trucks with trailers; however, the state of the ramp makes launching a large boat challenging but still possible.  The nearest town is Puposky which is about 10 miles north of Bemidji just west of County Hwy 15.  Shoreline development primarily consists of a moderate number of private homes and lake cabins.  The Mud River flows in from Crane Lake and exits on the north side into Puposky Lake and eventually makes its way north to Lower Red Lake.  Historically, minor algal blooms are common in the summer giving the water a light green color; however, healthy oxygen levels are generally only reduced beyond depths of 18 feet by the end of summer.  Lake Julia is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily managed for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking records for Lake Julia go back to 1908 when Brown Trout, Black Crappie, Lake Trout, Sunfish, and Walleye were introduced to enhance the resident fish community.  Northern Pike were stocked sporadically from the 1950's through the late 1970's alongside Walleye.  However, since 1982 only Walleye fry have been stocked at a frequency of 2 out of 3 years and most recently at a rate of 1,500 fry/littoral-acre.  Currently, the fish community in Lake Julia consists of Black and Brown Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, and most notably Walleye.  Lake Julia is becoming an ever more popular Walleye lake because of the abundance of \"eater\" sized fish with plenty of opportunity to catch one much larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is doing well with the average fish weighing about 2.2 lbs at a length of 17.7 inches.  Gillnet catch rates were down from 11.9 fish/net in 2003 to 9.9 fish/net in 2013 but average size has increased.  It appears that the majority of the Walleye population is dependent on supplemental stocking but the presence of year classes from non-stocked years indicate a notable amount of natural reproduction is occurring.  In fact, the most recent strong year classes observed were 2009, 2010, and 2011(2010 was not a stocking year).   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population in Lake Julia is expanding.  In 2013, gillnets caught 13.7 fish/net, the highest catch rate since 1983.  Even though catch rate is up, average size has remained at 21.3 inches in length and 2.1 lbs with the majority of pike falling in the 18-24 inch range.  Successful spawning is attributed to Mud Creek connecting to Crane and Puposky, shallow lakes with dense aquatic vegetation and abundant prey species, ideal for Northern Pike recruitment.  The small size structure is likely attributed to harvest since comparable lakes with protective size regulations have measurably better size distributions.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are very abundant with over 600 captured during the 2013 assessment and sizes ranging from 5 to 12.5 inches.  Average length is around 7.25 inches but larger fish are abundant and easily targeted.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are also noteworthy with over 65 captured and sizes reaching 8.5 inches.  They were first recorded in Lake Julia in 2003 so it is believed that both their abundance and size structure are still expanding.  Black Crappies were also first discovered in the early 2000's and were captured with lengths recorded over 11 inches in 2013.  While these new arrivals may add diversity to the fishery, new species introductions may have unintended consequences.  The simple fish community dominated by Walleye, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike has responded exceptionally well to Walleye fry stocking for decades.  As these new species continue to expand they may alter the conditions that made that management action so effective.  Hopefully Walleye will remain as the primary managed species as long as fry stocking continues to produce a healthy, fast growing, and well-structured population.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Julia is a 511-acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet located 15 miles north of the city of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a public water access located on the north shore of the lake with a concrete ramp and parking for 12 trucks/trailers.  Lake Julia is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Julia is stocked with Walleye fry on a two out of three-year rotation. Fry stocking  has provided a consistent Walleye fishery through much of its history.  Walleye numbers have declined over the past few assessments, but the 2018 Walleye gill net catch rate of 6.33 fish per net was still above the range of catch rates from similar lakes (1.33 to 5.0 fish per net).  Walleye captured had a good average size of 18.50 inches with fish up to 29.33 inches in length captured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are relatively new species in Lake Julia.  It is unknown how they were introduced but were first sampled in the 2003 population assessment.  All three species have been expanding ever since. The 2018 Black Crappie trap net catch rate (0.44 fish per net) was below the range of catch rates found in similar lakes (0.67 to 3.38 fish per net).   Black Crappie up to 12.99 inches in length were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are now well established with a trap net catch rate of 12.89 fish per net which was within the range found in similar lakes (6.14 to 46.60 fish per net).  Bluegill up to 8.82 inches in length were captured. Special electrofishing sampled multiple age classes of Largemouth Bass confirming that species is well established as well.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile these new species have added to the diversity of the fishery it is not clear how they may ultimately effect the rest of the fish community.  Walleye fry stocking tends to be most effective in simple yellow perch dominated lakes.  High abundance of centrarchid species like sunfish, crappie and bass tend to dampen the success of Walleye fry stocking.   Hopefully the decline in Walleye abundance is not a continuing trend.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate of 9.44 fish per net was near the upper end of the range of catch rates for similar lakes (10.50 fish per net).  Pike up to 31.30 inches in length were captured in this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage species for the lake's gamefish.  Julia has been known as a good perch lake although the average and maximum size of perch captured has declined over the past few assessments.  Yellow Perch captured in 2018 had an average size of 7.33 inches with fish up to 10.51 inches in length captured.  Fifteen percent of perch captured were greater than 9 inches in length.    <br> \n</p>",
