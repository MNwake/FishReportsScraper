                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of Walleye (1.50 fish/gill net and 5.55 lbs/gill net) were within the normal ranges for lake class 39 of the Schupp classification system.  Mean weight of the three Walleye sampled was 3.70 lbs.  No Walleye were caught in the previous survey and no Walleye are currently stocked in Peysenski.  Number of Northern Pike sampled (9.50 fish/gill net) was within the normal range, while 26.75 lbs/gill net was above the third quartile.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 2.82 lbs.  The number and size of Northern Pike have decreased since 1982, when catch rates were above the third quartile and the mean weight was 5.57 lbs.  The present Proportional Stock Density (PSD of 72) and Proportional Stock Density-Preferred (PSD-P of 17) indicate a good size structure with a fair proportion of the population attaining lengths preferred by anglers.  Northern Pike exhibit slow growth the first 2 years and then again after age 5.  Mean length at age 4 is 18.16 inches, however, there is a lot of variability within and among year classes.  Largemouth Bass trap net catch, Black Crappie trap net catch and Yellow Perch gill net catches all fell below the first quartile for lakes of this classification.  Gill net catches of Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were within the normal ranges.  The same situation occurred in 1982 for these two species.  Yellow Perch abundance has decreased sharply since 1982.  Catch rates of Rock Bass and Bluegill were within the normal ranges, increasing over the 1982 figures.  Bluegill growth rates are some- what slow, but reasonable, for this area, averaging 3.63 inches at age 3.  Size structure of Bluegill (PSD of 32) and Pumpkinseed (PSD of 12) are small.  This is apparent in the Pumpkinseed catch rates.  Number per trap net (30.60) was well above the third quartile, but 3.68 lbs/trap net was only slightly above the third quartile.  Pumpkinseed abundance shows a strong increase since 1982.  Pumpkinseed exhibit a growth pattern similar to Bluegill and average 3.67 inches at age 3.  White Sucker catch rates have generally remained within the normal ranges for lakes of this class since 1982.  Black Bullhead were first sampled in 1991 when their abundance was greatly above the third quartile.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peysenski Lake is located in Hubbard County, five miles east of Park Rapids.  Peysenski is a shallow, 195 acre lake with a maximum depth of 14.0 feet.  Due to its shallow depth, Peysenski has occasionally suffered from partial winterkill.  The last partial winterkill took place in 1992.  There is no public access on Peysenski.  Peysenski provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Peysenski is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: First Crow Wing, Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hart, Hennepin, Hungryman, Minnie, Paine, Portage, Rice, Shallow, Stocking, Upper Twin, and Wolf.Northern pike abundance (9.0 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled NOP had an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.3 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other class 39 lakes.  Peysenski Lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that help to support a healthy largemouth bass and panfish population.  Good numbers of 12 to 16 inch bass and 6-8 inch bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled.  Black crappie abundance was down from past surveys, at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Age analysis showed average bluegill growth rates, while black crappie growth rates were faster than other class 39 lakes.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of black bullhead and rock bass, and low numbers of white sucker and golden shiners.</p>",
