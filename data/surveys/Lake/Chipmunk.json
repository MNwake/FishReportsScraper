The lake has a maximum depth of 5 feet and access is fairly difficult, requiring a 100-yard hike across a wet bog. Most of the lake is bordered by a wet bog and the shoreline is undeveloped and in a wild state. Previous fish assessments were conducted in 1961 and 1986. The fish community in Chipmunk Lake is comprised of northern pike and yellow perch. The 2006 assessment sampled northern pike in above average numbers, although the catch was not as high as in 1986. Northern pike averaged 2.2 pounds/fish in this assessment with fish up to 29.1 inches (4.9 pounds) collected; approximately one half the northern pike collected were between 22 and 25 inches. Growth of northern pike collected in 2006 was average compared to similar lakes in this class. The northern pike population in Chipmunk Lake is maintained through natural reproduction and does not require stocking. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in fairly high numbers in 2006; however, the size of most of the fish were too small to interest anglers. Approximately one fourth of the yellow perch were larger than 8.0 inches (8.9 inch maximum length).  <br> \n</p>",
