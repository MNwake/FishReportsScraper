The one walleye taken had apparently been produced naturally.  Northern pike were fairly abundant, but most were small (under 20 inches).  Northern pike growth rates were slow.   This is a small shallow lake, with limited forage for game fish.  Although (as the 2007 assessment demonstrated), the lake can produce an occasional trophy, those will be very rare. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
