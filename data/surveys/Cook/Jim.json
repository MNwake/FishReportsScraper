The lake trout population was probably native - the only recorded stocking had been done in 1977, and lake trout     were collected prior to that time.  White sucker were very abundant, but generally small.  They may have been providing some forage for     lake trout.  The Jim Lake lake trout population could be very vulnerable to overharvest due to the small size of the lake, and the     marginal conditions under which lake trout in the lake survive.  Anglers fishing the lake should limit their harvest of adult fish, and     any measures aimed at improving access to this lake should be opposed, due to this vulnerability.</p>",
