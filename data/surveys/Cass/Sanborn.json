                "narrative": "<p>Sanborn Lake is a 220-acre lake with 2.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 48 feet located east of Backus, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Sanborn Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Bowen, Child, Five Point, Little Webb and Widow. The shoreline of Sanborn is heavily developed with many lake homes. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Bluegill, and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch. A 10 Sunfish possession limit was implemented in 1996 to improve size structure. This regulation was converted to a 5 Sunfish daily limit (statewide possession limit still applies) in 2022 after initial improvements from the 10 fish limit were not sustained over time. <br> \nSanborn Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. Black Crappie abundance was above the management goal and lengths ranged from 6 to 13 inches. Bluegill were caught in numbers below the management goal and lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches. Largemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers with fish from 6 to 15 inches sampled. Management goals for Largemouth Bass are based spring electrofishing which was not conducted in 2022. Northern Pike abundance met the management goal and lengths ranged from 10 to 34 inches. Northern Pike size goals were partially met in 2022. Walleye were caught in numbers meeting the management goal with lengths ranging from 10 to 24 inches. Yellow Perch were caught in moderate numbers not meeting the management goal with lengths ranging from 6 to 12 inches.    <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Sanborn Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sanborn Lake is a 220 acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota that has 2.46 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 48 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Sanborn Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Widow.  In 1997, an experimental regulation reduced the sunfish possession limit to 10 fish. The objective of this regulation was to improve the size structure of the population and increase the number of bluegills 8 inches or greater. There is a state owned public access on the north shore. <br> \n <br> \nSanborn Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. The lake has historically been known for its bass and panfish along with good numbers of Northern Pike.  Sampling specifically targeting Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass has not been performed in recent years but a few were caught using standard sampling gear during the 2013 survey.  The average length of the black crappie caught was 11 inches and sizes ranged from 5 to 13 inches long.  Northern Pike numbers have increased from the previous year's sampling but the average length has decreased to just over 17 inches.  Bluegill numbers are currently below long-range management goals but the average length of Bluegill in Sanborn Lake has steadily increased since the reduced possession limit regulation was implemented in 1997.  Average length of bluegill caught in the 2013 sample was 7 inches with fish up to 10 inches being caught.  Walleye numbers have remained low despite repeated stockings.  Gill net catch rates of Walleye were below the management goals and average range for similar lakes in this class, but will provide anglers an occasional catch and harvest opportunity.  Yellow perch numbers are below management goals and are slightly above the average catch rate for similar lakes in the area.   The average length of walleye (18 inches) and yellow perch (8 inches) have been consistent throughout the survey history.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish that are available for anglers to catch include; Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently there are no aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Sanborn Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sanburn is a 223-acre lake located in northern Cass County.  The lake is about 0.8 miles long and has a maximumdepth of 48 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43different lake types based on their physical and chemical characteristics.  Sanburn is in lake class 31.  Otherarea lakes in this same class include Child (9 miles northeast of Sanburn), Five Point (3 miles north), Ox Yoke(2 miles north), and Widow (8 miles northeast).  There is a DNR-owned access on the north end of Sanburn.  SanburnLake has excellent water quality with a diverse community of aquatic plants.  Netting surveys have been done fivetimes on Sanburn from 1967 to 1994.  A survey of anglers, also known as a \"creel survey\", was done in 1994.1994 Creel Survey Results The creel survey of anglers extended from May 14, 1994, (opening day of walleye and northern pike fishing) throughSeptember 5, 1994 (Labor Day).  Preliminary findings of the 1994 creel survey estimated that 8291 angler-hours(35.6 angler-hours per acre) were spent fishing on Sanburn during this 115-day period.  Of the anglers that weretargeting a particular species, almost three-fourths indicated that they were angling for black crappie,largemouth bass, or some type of sunfish.  Estimated numbers of fish kept included 634 black crappie, 4644bluegill, 127 pumpkinseed sunfish, 325 largemouth bass, 41 northern pike, 140 rock bass, and 467 yellow perch. No walleye were kept by interviewed anglers, though it was estimated that 39 walleye were caught and released fromopening day through Labor Day.1994 Netting Survey Results Walleye catch during the 1994 survey was 1.5 fish/experimental gill net, which is similar to other lakes of thesame type and similar to numbers caught in several earlier Sanburn Lake surveys.  Sampled walleye were ofexcellent size with an average length of 19.4 inches and average weight of 2.45 pounds.  Ageing informationindicates that natural reproduction of walleye has occurred in Sanburn and has contributed to the walleyepopulation.  Northern pike were abundant.  They were generally small in size although good-sized fish (up to 33 inches) werepresent. Bluegill were abundant; the catch of bluegill in 1994 (103.8 fish/trap net lift) was well above the middle rangeof catch rates for lakes of this type.  Though there were a few bluegills over 7 and 8 inches in 1994, a lowerpercentage of large fish were sampled in recent years than were sampled in the 1967 Sanburn Lake survey.  Bluegillgrowth rates in Sanburn appeared to be slow: the average length of a bluegill when it reached age 5 was just 4.3inches.The apparent decline in average size of BLG and slow growth rates are factors that prompted DNR fisheriesbiologists to include Sanburn in a BLG research project. This project is investigating regulations designed toincrease the harvest of BLG greater than eight inches.  The three types of regulations being considered are:     1)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size        limit of BLG.     2)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size        limit of large predators that feed on BLG.     3)   Regulations using a combination of both 1 and 2.Pre-regulation data was be collected in 1994 and will be collected in 1995.  If acceptable to the public, newregulations will be implemented during 1996.  Monitoring will continue until the year 2001.  Data will then beanalyzed and results will be used to help manage BLG in Minnesota. The 88 largemouth bass captured by electrofishing ranged in length from 6.6 to 14.7 inches, with an average lengthof 10.5 inches.  Of the sampled bass 8 inches or longer, about one out of five were 12 inches or more.  Adequatelargemouth bass spawning habitat exists in the lake.Very little shoreline is undeveloped on Sanburn.  To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on this lake,lake shore residents and other users of the lake should protect fish habitat by preserving natural aquaticvegetation.  Lake shore residents can also help preserve Sanburn's water quality by such actions as having aproperly built and maintained septic system; by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; andby establishing a buffer strip of natural vegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishingquality by practicing catch and release of larger fish.It is important therefore to protect our aquatic plants. other species of fish need aquatic plants for protection, food, and spawning. Aquatic plants also help preventerosion and pollution of our lakes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sanburn Lake is located 1.5 miles northeast of Backus in northern Cass County.  There is a Minnesota DNR public access on the north end of the lake off of State Highway 87.  Sanburn Lake has an area of 223 acres with a maximum depth of 48 feet.  The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on chemical and physical characteristics.  Sanburn Lake is in lake class 31.  Lakes in this lake class are typically smaller and have moderate depths, and moderate water clarity.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Child, Five Point, Ox Yoke, Widow, and Welsh Lakes.  Sanburn Lake anglers have good luck fishing for black crappie, largemouth bass, and sunfish. The lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and northern pike.  There were three years of creel survey conducted on Sanburn Lake to determine fishing pressure.  Fishing pressure was typical of other lake class 31 lakes.In 1996, an experimental regulation was initiated to increase the harvest of 8 inch and larger bluegill.  Anglers may keep no more than 10 sunfish.  The quality of the bluegill sampled in 1999 was the best seen since 1967.  Such an increase in the quality of bluegill populations has also been observed in other area lakes where there is no experimental regulation.  In many lakes the 1992 and 1993 year classes of bluegill are not abundant due to poor spawning success during those years.  Those summers were cold.  Fish from these years in many lakes would not yet be 8 inches long.  If the increase in quality of bluegill from Sanburn Lake is maintained it will be a better indicator that the experimental regulation is accomplishing the objective.  Bluegill grow slowly in Sanburn Lake.  A five year old bluegill in Sanburn was only 3.9 inches long compared to the state average of 5.6 inches.Other panfish present include black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch.Northern pike are abundant in Sanburn.  Though they are generally small, there are some quality size northern pike in the lake.  The growth rate of northern pike was slower than other area lake class 31 lakes.Walleye abundance is unchanged from previous surveys.  Stocking by the DNR or by private parties under a permit has had little impact on increasing the numbers of walleye in Sanburn Lake.  Abundance of walleye in 1999 was typical of a lake class 31 lake.  There were eight different age classes present in the sample.  Five of these age classes were from years when no stocking occurred indicating they were the result of natural reproduction.Yellow perch numbers were low compared with other lakes in this lake class.  Yellow perch are common food fish for walleye and other predator fish.Other species sampled include brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.Most of the shoreline around the lake is privately owned.  In 1967, there were 48 lakehomes.  By 1994, the number of lakehomes had increased to 77.  That translates to a lakehome for every 158 feet of shoreline.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sanborn Lake is a 233-acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota that has 2.46 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 48 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Sanborn Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Widow.  In 1997, an experimental regulation setting a 10 sunfish bag/possession limit was initiated. The objective of this regulation was to improve the size structure of the population and increase the number of bluegills 8 inches or greater. There is a state-owned public access on the north shore.   <br> \n  <br> \nSanborn Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. The lake is known for its bass and panfish along with good numbers of northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nEven though largemouth bass were not sampled in this survey, Sanborn Lake is known to have good bass fishing. Electrofishing, which is a better tool to sample largemouth bass populations, was not conducted in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance is above average for Lake Class 31 lakes. Fish sampled in 2006 averaged 20.75 inches in length, and fish over 30 inches in length are present.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sampled in the summer had a mean length was 4.95 inches with a range from 2.6 to 8.2 inches. Since the experimental regulation went into effect, spring trap netting results indicate that the number of fish greater than or equal to 7 inches in length has increased when compared to pre-regulation data from 1995 and 1996. Similarly, the number of fish greater than or equal to 8 inches in length has also increased when compared to the pre-regulation years previously mentioned. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is less than average for Lake Class 31 lakes. Fish sampled averaged 9.2 inches in length and ranged from 7.5 to 12.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch greater than 9 inches in length were sampled in this survey. The average length was 7.5 inches and ranged from 4.9 to 11.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species available to anglers are pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, walleye, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Sanborn Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sanborn Lake is a 220 acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota that has 2.46 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 48 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Sanborn Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Widow. In 1996, an experimental regulation reduced the sunfish possession limit to 10 fish. The objective of this regulation was to improve the size structure of the population and increase the number of Bluegills 8 inches or greater. There is a state owned public access on the north shore. The purpose of this survey was to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie population using spring trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSanborn Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. The lake has historically been known for its bass and panfish along with good numbers of Northern Pike. No Black Crappie were sampled from spring trap nets in 2017. Bluegill from spring sampling averaged 5 inches long and lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches.  Approximately six percent of the Bluegill were at least 8 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish that are available for anglers to catch include Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently there are no aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Sanborn Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sanborn Lake was conducted on July 21, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing  and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Sanborn Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

THIS PARALLELS AN INCREASE IN THE GILLNET CPUE FOR NORTHERN PIKE.THE WALLEYE GILLNET CPUE OF 1.8 IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 1.0 TO 3.3/GN.  EXAMINING YEAR CLASSES PRESENT IN THIS ASSESSMENT AND PAST ASSESSMENTS WITH STOCKING RECORDS, THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT WALLEYE STOCKING IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE FISHERY.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OR ALL OF THE WALLEYE POPULATION PRESENT IN SANBURN LAKE.</p>",
