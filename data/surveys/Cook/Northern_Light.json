                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net catch in this assessment was low for the lake class, and it was one of the lower catches observed in this lake, historically.  Mean weight for walleye collected in 2000 was high compared to similar lakes, although it was not unusually high for this lake.  Virtually all of the walleye collected in 2000 had been produced naturally, with strong year classes in 1995 and 1991.  Year class strength was not consistent, and there appeared to have been some weak years, including 1998, 1997, 1996, and 1994.  Poor 1997 and 1996 year classes accounted for the low catch in 2000; normally age-3 and age-4 fish account for a substantial portion of the catches in walleye lakes in this area.  Walleye growth had been about average for the area. The northern pike gill net catch was high for the lake class, but not unusually high for this lake historically.  The catch included several strong year class, including fish as old as nine years of age (older than usually seen in this area).  The catch included much higher numbers of fish larger than 25 inches than normally seen in this area.  Northern pike growth had been about average for the area.The yellow perch gill net catch was high for this lake class, but not for this lake.  Some of the yellow perch taken would have been large enough to have interested anglers, but about 90% of the gill net catch was under 9 in.  The mean weight for yellow perch collected in gill nets in 2000 was the lowest ever observed in this lake, at 0.22 lb/fish.The smallmouth bass catch in gill nets was low for the lake class, but similar to past catches in this lake.  As usual, average size of the fish collected was excellent, well above the normal for the lake class.  Growth rates appeared to have been fairly fast.Unusually high number of pumpkinseed sunfish were taken in trap nets; however, most of the fish collected were small.  Only a few were larger than six inches.</p>",

The walleye population was supported by natural reproduction, although stocking in the 1980's may have contributed to some of the older year classes.  Northern pike were abundant, and many large fish were collected.  Northern pike reproduction appeared to have been consistently good.  Yellow perch were also abundant and large, and provided an excellent forage base for the walleye and northern pike, as well as some angling opportunities.  Fair numbers of smallmouth bass were present, with a good proportion of large fish in the population.</p>",

All walleye taken in 2007 had been produced naturally, but there had been no strong year classes recently.  Walleye growth rates had been good, thanks largely to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were fairly abundant in 2007, and some larger fish were present.  Most of the fish taken were two years of age, with none older than five years of age.  Northern pike growth had also been good. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and northern pike fisheries were supplemented by smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and panfish fishing opportunities in 2007.  Smallmouth bass were present in typical numbers for this lake.  As has usually been the case in Northern Light Lake, most of the smallmouth bass collected were large.  Yellow perch abundance was lower than has been seen in the past in this lake, but it was still high for a lake of this type.  The lake supported a high-quality perch population, with many fish larger than eight inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also fairly abundant, and while most were small, fish as large as 7.6 inches were seen.   <br> \n <br> \nTravel down the Brule River to Northern Light Lake was very difficult in 2007, due to low water and heavy vegetation.  Only canoes were able to get through with any ease, and use of an outboard in the channel was nearly impossible by the end of the summer.  Higher water from heavy rains in fall 2007 may ease that situation for 2008. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Light Lake is a medium-sized, very shallow lake lying on the Brule River, in the Lake Superior North watershed.  For many decades a log dam at its outlet maintained a slightly elevated water level; however, in 2009 that dam was found to have been partially washed out.  Northern Light Lake has been managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, although it has also supported Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch fisheries.  The current (2019) lake management plan (LMP) established a long range goal for Walleye consisting of a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/net, with some fish over 20 inches.  The long range goal for Northern Pike established in that plan was also a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/net, with some fish over 25 inches.  No goals were established for Smallmouth Bass or Yellow Perch.  This was the first of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2019 LMP to determine whether goals for Walleye and Northern Pike could be met without any management intervention, and to determine whether replacement of the dam was needed to maintain fisheries in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were apparently fairly abundant in 2021, and for the most part were above-average in size. The catch fell within the normal range for a lake of this type, and was similar to most catches seen in the past on this lake.  Walleye taken in gill nets in 2021 ranged in length from 9.6 to 24.1 inches,  with most over 16 inches in length.  Twelve year classes (fish 2 to 20 years of age) contributed to the catch.  All had been naturally produced, although only the 2016 year class appeared to have been strong.  Growth had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 15.4 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 15.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant in 2021, and some larger fish were present.  The gill net catch was above the normal range for a lake of this type, and was one of the higher catches seen in this lake historically.  Northern Pike collected in 2021 ranged in length from 11.0 to 38.0 inches, with several fish larger than 25 inches included in the catch.  No Northern Pike were aged in this survey, but it was clear from their lengths that several natural year classes had contributed to the catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass also appeared to have been abundant in 2021, and many larger fish were seen.  The gill net catch was within the normal range for this type of lake, but was the highest seen in this lake, historically.  Bass taken in gill nets ranged in length from 5.8 to 19.8 inches, with most over 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were apparently abundant, but small, in 2021.  The gill net catch was above-normal for the lake type, but not for this lake, where high perch numbers have been common.  Only about eight percent of Yellow Perch taken in this survey were over eight inches in length.  Although hardly satisfying to perch anglers, the population seen in 2021 would have provided an excellent forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets are not the preferred sampling gear for sunfish.  However, the 2021 Pumpkinseed catch seemed quite high, and some of those fish would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nWater levels in Northern Light Lake were unusually low in 2021, due to a local, and fairly severe, drought and probably due as well to the loss of the dam.  Nevertheless, the lake continued to support fish populations capable of meeting management goals and driving high-quality fisheries.  Unfortunately, at low water levels travel from the public access on the Brule River down to the lake can be very difficult, if not impossible, for motorized craft due to rocks and shoals, and heavy vegetation.  Travel upstream back to the access is even more difficult.  Our survey crew could only reach the lake by canoe in 2021, and so was not able to use the trap nets that would normally have been a part of any survey of this lake.  Anglers wishing to try this lake should probably do so in the spring, when travel down the river is easier, or plan on bringing a canoe. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

SEVER- AL YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE YOUNGER YEAR CLASSES APPEARED TO BE WEAK OR MISSING. GROWTH WAS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. NATURAL REPRODUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST 57% OF THE WALLEYE SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT, HOWEVER NEITHER NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR FRY STOCKING APPEARED TO BE CONSISTANTLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING STRONG YEAR CLASSES. THE NATURAL YEAR CLASSES OF 1988 AND 1984, AND THE STOCKED YEAR CLASSES OF 1987 AND 1985 APPEARED TO BE WEAK OR MISSING. THE APPARENT WEAKNESS OF SO MANY WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES MAY NOT BE A CAUSE FOR ALARM ON THIS LAKE. LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS IN EVERY ASSESSMENT SINCE 1969 HAVE SHOWN GOOD NUMBERS OF LARGER WALLEYE AND FEW SMALL FISH. DURING THIS TIME WALLEYE NET CATCHES HAVE FLUCTUATED WITH NO CLEAR TREND. IT APPEARS THAT ALTHOUGH FEW YOUNGER WALL- EYE ARE SAMPLED, RECRUITMENT HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN ADEQUATE. YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE WAS VERY HIGH ALTHOUGH MOST WERE SMALL, THERE WERE FAIR NUMBERS OF YELLOW PERCH OVER 10 IN, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE SOME ANGLING POTENTIAL. SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT; ONLY THE 1985 YEAR CLASS APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT WEAK. GROWTH IS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. YELLOW PERCH PROVIED AN EXCELLENT FOR- AGE BASE FOR WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE. NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE WAS FAIR, BUT AVERAGE SIZE WAS SMALL. NORTHERN LIGHT LAKE HAS, HOWEVER, PRO- DUCED SOME LARGE NORTHERN PIKE. FEW SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED, BUT SOME LARGE INDIVIDUALS WERE PRESENT. ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE, BUT SOME LARGE INDIVIDUALS WERE PRESENT. ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS SMALL, IT APPEARED THAT THE 1985 AND 1984 YEAR CLASSES MAY BE WEAK OR MISSING. GORWTH WAS GOOD BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. LARGE NUMBERS OF PUMPKINSEED WERE SAMPLED. MANY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO BE OF INTEREST TO ANGLERS, WITH 50% OVER 6 IN. THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY LARGER PUMPKINSEED WAS DUE IN PART TO A VERY STRONG 1984 YEAR CLASS. THERE WERE ALSO STRONG 1987 AND 1986 YEAR CLASSES PRESENT. GROWTH WAS GOOD BY STATE STANDARDS.</p>",
