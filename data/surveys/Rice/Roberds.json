                "narrative": "<p>Roberds Lake is a 625-acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 ft located northwest of Faribault in Rice County.  A fishery survey was conducted on Roberds Lake in 2003 to monitor the fish community and lake habitat.  Walleye ranged in size from 9 to 20 inches.  Walleye abundance appears to be at a low to moderate level.  Channel catfish ranged from 20 to 30 inches with an average weight of 6 lbs.  Many more bluegills greater than 7 inches were found in 2003 compared to the previous survey done in 1998.  In 2003, 45% of bluegill were greater than 8 inches with the largest over 9 inches in length.  Most of the 8-inch range bluegill appeared to be from a strong 1997 year-class.  Black crappie median size has consistently increased over the last three surveys (1993: 7.3 inches, 1998: 7.7, 2003: 8.7).  In 2003, most black crappie were between 7.9 and 9.8 inches.  Northern pike abundance is low, although a 36.5 inch fish was captured in the test netting.  Other species present in Roberds Lake include black bullhead, bowfin, carp, freshwater drum, pumpkinseed sunfish, white crappie, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Aquatic vegetation is generally rare in Roberds Lake in mid-summer.  The east, south, and west bays have some sumbergent plants.  In early summer, curly leaf pondweed can be abundant.  Algae is often abundant resulting in low water clarity.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roberds Lake is a 625-acre lake located approximately 2 miles northwest of the town of Faribault in Rice County. It has a maximum depth of 43 feet with 63% of the area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lake's overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" Much of the shoreline has been altered to the detriment of lake water quality and nearshore habitat. A tornado in the fall of 2019 destroyed much of the shoreline habitat (trees/brush) along the south shoreline. Many trees were thrown into the lake. Most debris was later cleaned up, but some remains creating fish habitat.  Invasive Curly-leaf Pondweed is common in the lake and chemical treatments are used to improve recreation. A DNR-owned concrete ramp is located on the west side of the lake off County Road 69. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The latest management plan revised in 2017 calls for stocking 393,000 Walleye fry in even years. Before 2017, annual stocking of fingerlings was prescribed. Some combination of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked annually during the last ten years. <br> \nA targeted survey was completed in 2020 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic made it necessary to forgo trap nets to maintain social distancing requirements. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 7 gill nets and 61 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. Results from this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys since standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 13 Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was the lowest on record and indicated low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2017 was 2.3/net. Historically, catch rates have been highly variable with a range of 1.9/net to 205.9/net and an average of 39.6/net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 4.9 to 13.5 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. Approximately 71% of the population was larger than 10 inches. Fish were 1 to 8 years old with 7 year old fish accounting for 31% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most commonly sampled species with trap nets in 2017 with a total of 72 caught for a catch rate of 6.6/net, which indicated low numbers were present. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 protocols only one trap net was used in the 2020 survey. Historically, Bluegill have been abundant with catch rates ranging from 2.8/net to 94.4/net and an average of 24.7/net. Gill nets do not sample Bluegills particularly well however, 25 fish were sampled with a catch rate of 3.6/ gill net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 8.1 to 10.1 inches with an average of 9.5 inches. Fish were 1 to 7 years old with 84% of the sample age 4 or older. <br> \n <br> \nDue to The Covid-19 Pandemic, boat electrofishing was not conducted at the optimum time when bass are in the shallows. A total of 7 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing. The previous two catch rates were 90.2/hour in 2017 and 24.0/hour in 2013. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 12.2 to 17.2 inches with an average of 14.7 inches. Largemouth Bass were aged using otoliths in 2020. These fish ranged in age from 3 to 10 years of age. The 2017 year class was the largest including four individuals. <br> \n <br> \nA surprising sight in the 2020 survey was Muskellunge. Three Muskellunge were sampled using gill nets. These fish ranged in size from 41.3 inches to 50.5 inches. Although this seems like a high number of fish being sampled, it is likely that the fish were concentrated due to high water temperatures and low oxygen levels. It is safe to assume the Muskellunge population in Roberds Lake is low. While most people target muskellunge on French Lake, there are a few people that regularly try Roberds Lake as well. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in 2020 at a rate of 3.6/ gill net. This was an increase from just 1.1/net in 2017. Aside from 2013, Northern Pike have been sampled in low numbers with an average of just 1.2/net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 22.4 to 32.4 inches and averaged 26.2 inches. Approximately 60% of fish were of 24 inches in total length. Roberds Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 6 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which indicated low numbers were present. Since 1988, catch rates have ranged from 0.4/net to 4.2/net with an average of 1.9/net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 14.9 to 21.5 inches with an average of 18.7 inches. Approximately 80% of the sample exceeded 18 inches in length. Fish ranged from 2 to 6 years old with 4 year classes present. Six-year old fish accounted for 50% of the sample. Walleyes average 17.9 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in gill nets with a catch rate of 3.3/net, which indicated low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2017 was 12.8/net. Historically, Yellow Perch numbers have been high with an average catch rate of 25.3/net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 5.9 to 9.6 inches with an average of 8.1 inches. Ages ranged from 3 to 4 years. Nearly 80% were 4 years old. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained low in Roberds Lake. Two fish 21.7 and 25.5 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which indicated low numbers were present. <br> \n <br> \nFive Black Bullhead were sampled in 2020 with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was the second lowest on record. The average catch rate from 1986 to 1998 was 66.1/net. Since then, catch rates have dropped in every survey to an average of just 4.3/net. Conversely, Yellow Bullhead have become slightly more common over the years. A total of 13 were sampled in 2017 with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.2/net. Over time, it appears as though Roberds Lake has become more suitable for Yellow Bullhead and less suitable for Black Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2020 include Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), and White Bass <br> \n. <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. Water quality parameters ranged from 84.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 13.7 ppm at the surface to 59.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 35 feet. A thermocline was detected between 5 and 10 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 11 feet. <br> \n <br> \nRoberds Lake has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A total of 22 age-0 Walleyes averaging 7.5 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 20.0/hour on-time. In five surveys from 2017 to 2021, this was the first time any age-0 Walleyes were sampled. Past Walleye management has failed to produce a significant catch (> 4.0/net) in survey gill nets despite almost annually receiving a heavy stocking of fingerling and mixed-age adult Walleyes. In 2018, the management strategy switched to fry stocking during even years (except in 2020 due to COVID which was made up in 2021). The 2021 catch rate offers some hope that fry stocking could produce what previous stocking strategies have not in Roberds Lake.</p>",

BLACK CRAPPIES SAMPLED WERE REPRE- SENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 1 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. THE AGE DISTRIBUTION IS SIMILAR TO 1986, WITH AGES 1-4 WELL REPRESENTED. WHITE CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN GOOD NUMBERS, AVERAGING 15.00/TRAP NET AND 9.67/GILL NET COM- PARED TO 3.75/TRAP NET AND 17.50/GILL NET IN 1986. WHITE CRAPPIES SHOW FAST GROWTH WITH AGES 1-5 SAMPLED WITH 1 AND 3 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. THE BLUEGILL CATCH RATE DECLINED FROM 21.75/TRAP NET IN 1986 TO 14.12/TRAP NET IN 1988. BLUEGILL LENGTH FREQUENCIES AGE STRUCTURE HAVE SHOWN LITTLE CHANGE FROM THE 1986 NETTING, WITH AGES 1-5 SAMPLED. THE WALLEYE CATCH RATE HAS DECLINED FROM 16.75/ GILL NET IN 1986 TO 4.17/GILL NET IN 1988. SIX AGE GROUPS WERE SAMPLED COMPARED TO THE 10 AGE GROUPS SAMPLED IN THE 1986 ASSESSMENT. LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS IN 1988 ARE SIMILAR TO LENGTH FREQUENCIES FOUND IN THE 1986 NETTING. YEAR CLASS- ES SAMPLED FOLLOW PAST STOCKING FAIRLY CLOSELY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A STRONG AGE 7 GROUP WHICH DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO PAST FINGERLING STOCKING, OR THEY MAY BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE SHOWN AN INCREASE FROM ONLY 3 FISH SAMPLED IN 1986 TO 0.75/GILL NET AND 1.87/ TRAP NET IN 1988. NORTHERNS SAMPLED ARE REPRESEN- TED BY 1 AND 2 YEAR OLDS. THE YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATE HAS DECLINED FROM 89.50/GILL NET IN 1986 TO 19.42/GILL NET IN 1988. PERCH ARE NOW REPRESENTED AGES 2-5 COMPARED TO THE AGES 1-4 SAMPLED IN 1986. WHITE BASS WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN 1988 WITH 4 TAKEN IN GILL NETS, AND IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THEY MAY HAVE MIGRATED IN FROM FRENCH LAKE. BLACK BULLHEAD CATCH RATES HAVE SHOWN A LARGE INCREASE FROM 2.75/ TRAP NET IN 1986 TO 163.25/TRAP NET IN 1988. BULLHEADS APPEAR TO BE REPRESENTED BY A DOMINANT AGE GROUP OF 5.0-7.0 INCH FISH WITH A FEW OLDER 10.0-12.0 INCH BULLHEADS SAMPLED. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED WHICH HAVE SHOWN LITTLE CHANGE AND ARE PRESENT IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE WHITE SUCKER, CARP, LARGEMOUTH BASS, FRESHWATER DRUM, YELLOW BULLHEAD, AND PUMPKINSEED.</p>",

THEY ARE OF ACCEPTABLE SIZE TO THE FISHERMEN, WITH 8.0 - 8.4 TL BEING THE MODAL LENGTH. EVEN THOUGH THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE WAS LOWER THAN THE LAST SURVEY IT IS STILL TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE STATE MEDIAN. WHITE CRAPPIES APPEAR TO HAVE A HIGHER RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THIS ASSESSMENT THAN THE LAST SURVEY. WHITE CRAPPIES ARE DOMINATED BY A 1984 YEAR CLASS AND HAVE A MODAL LENGTH OF 5.5-5.9 TL. BLUEGILLS HAVE A MUCH LOWER RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THIS ASSESSMENT THAN IN THE LAST SURVEY, YET IT IS STILL ALMOST TWO TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN OF 11.67/TRAPNET. THEY SHOW A FAIRLY EVEN YEAR CLASS DISTRIBUTION RANGING FROM 1981 TO 1985. BLUEGILLS HAVE A MODAL LENGTH OF 8.0 -8.4 TL. WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE FISHERMEN. THE YELLOW PERCH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS HIGHER. PERCH ARE REPRESENTED BY A STRONG 1983 YEAR CLASS AND HAVE A MODAL LENGTH OF 6.5- 6.9 TL. WALLEYES HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RELATIVE ABUNDANCE NOW THAN IN 1983. THIS HIGHER ABUNDANCE COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE STOCKING PROGRAM-YET THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES OF 1980 AND 1984 APPEAR TO BE NATURAL REPRODUCTION. POSSIBLY WE ARE READING THE SCALES INCORRECTLY AND THE 80' YEAR CLASS MAY BE THE '79 YEAR CLASS FISH, WHICH SHOWED UP STRONGLY IN THE 1983 SURVEY. THE 1983 SURVEY INDICATES A STRONG '79 AND '82 AGE CLASSES, WHICH BOTH CORRESPOND TO FINGERLING STOCKINGS. THE LAST WALLEYE STOCKING IN THE FALL OF 1985 CONFUSES THINGS BECAUSE FISH WERE STOCKED FROM 5 DIFFERENT REARING PONDS AND THEY VARIED IN AGE; SOME OF THESE FISH MAY HAVE BEEN CONFUSED FOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION, THE 1984 AGE CLASS. THEY HAVE A GOOD FORAGE BASE AND APPEAR TO BE OF CATCHABLE SIZE TO THE FISHERMEN WITH MOST FISH BETWEEN 12 ABUNDANCE APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER IN THIS ASSESSMENT IN 83 VERSUS 0.75/GILLNET IN 86 THAN IN 1983 SURVEY. THE N.P.S.A. HAS BEEN OPERATED EVERY YEAR (EXCEPT 81) SINCE THE WINTERKILL IN 1976-77, YET THE NUMBERS ARE LOW. A POSSIBLE HYPOTHESIS OF LOW NORTHERN NUMBERS, WITH A NPSA PRESENT THAT APPEARS TO BE PRODUCING WELL, IT MAY- BE NORTHERNS ARE MIGRATING TO FRENCH LAKE THAT SHARES THE UNNAMED CREEK AT ITS OUTLET THAT THE SPAWNING AREA IS DRAINED INTO AND ALSO SERVES AS AN INLET FOR ROBERDS LAKE. FRENCH LAKE HAS EXPER- ENCED LARGE NORTHERN POPULATIONS IN RECENT YEARS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESS- MENT AS THEY WERE IN THE 1983 SURVEY. THE COMMERCIAL FISH POPUALTION APPEARS TO BE LOW.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roberds Lake is a 625 acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet.  It is located northwest of Faribault in Rice County.  A DNR owned public access is located on the west side of the lake next to Winjum's Resort and Campgrounds, just off Rice County Road 69.  Roberds Lake is managed to provide a bluegill, crappie, and largemouth bass fishery with secondary opportunities for northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nRoberds Lake was surveyed the week of July 8th, 2013 to monitor the fish community.  Black crappie were well represented in the catch, and were the most abundant fish sampled in the survey.  Black crappie were sampled at a rate of 10.0 fish/trap net and 24.0 fish/gill net.  The abundance of black crappie in both trap and gill nets during 2013 were above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average weights for black crappie were normal for this lake type.   Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 inches among gear types with most black crappie falling within the 7.0 to 8.0 inch range, which is typically acceptable to most anglers.  Two white crappies were also captured during this assessment which was similar to the catch of white crappie during the most recent survey in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and yellow perch abundance remained similar to the most recent survey in 2008 or declined slightly.  Bluegill catch rates decreased slightly since the 2008 survey; however, lengths were similar and ranged from 3.0 to 8.5 inches.  The overall mean length for bluegills caught in both trap and gill nets was 6.6 inches.  Although abundance of bluegill was below average for this lake type, the average weights were higher than what is considered normal in similar Minnesota lakes.   Yellow perch abundance remained stable since last survey and was within the normal range at 12.8 fish/gill net.  Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 10.0 inches, with the majority of yellow perch falling into the 7.0 to 9.0 inch category; which is generally acceptable to most anglers.  This survey illustrated an overall panfish population capable of producing quality angling. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary predators in Roberds Lake included northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.  Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 7.4 fish/gill net, which was above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  In fact, the 2013 catch of northern pike was the highest ever observed in Roberds Lake.   Northern pike lengths ranged from 18.4 to 36.4 inches in gill nets with an overall average of nearly 24.0 inches.  Average weights were also above what is considered normal for this lake type.  Largemouth bass were sampled during late May with a Smith-Root electrofishing boat.  This species was not sampled effectively with nets; therefore electrofishing was the most reliable way to estimate abundance.  A total of 24 largemouth bass were captured per hour of on time (a modest decrease since 2008) with lengths from 7.6 to 20.7 inches.  The sampled population consisted of individuals with ages ranging from 2 to 8 years.  The walleye gill net catch rate increased to above average levels for this lake type, and in 2013 was the highest observed since 1988.  Age estimation revealed a fairly young population with individuals of 1 to 5 years of age; lengths ranged from 10.4 to 23.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were sampled at record low gill net rates for this lake.  Other fish caught during the survey include bowfin (dogfish), channel catfish, common carp, freshwater drum, white bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, and golden shiner.  Roberds Lake looks to provide ample opportunities for anglers targeting panfish, bass, walleye, and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Roberds Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural, undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.   <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork, Fisheries Specialist. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roberds Lake is a 625 acre lake located approximately 2 miles northwest of the town of Faribault in Rice County. It has a maximum depth of 43 feet with 63% of the area less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lake's overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" Much of the shoreline has been altered to the detriment of lake water quality and nearshore habitat. Invasive Curly-leaf Pondweed is common in the lake and chemical treatments are used to improve recreation. A DNR owned concrete ramp is located on the west side of the lake off County Road 69. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The latest management plan revised in 2017 calls for stocking 393,000 Walleye fry in even years. Before 2017, annual stocking of fingerlings was prescribed. Some combination of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked annually during the last ten years.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 8 gill nets, 11 trap nets, and 81 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 31 Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was the lowest on record and indicated low to moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2013 was 10.0/net. Historically, catch rates have been highly variable with a range of 2.8/net to 205.9/net and an average of 39.6/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 8.0 to 12.8 inches with an average of 10.8 inches. Approximately 81% of the population was larger than 10 inches. An additional 39 fish ranging from 9.3 to 13.4 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish were 3 to 6 years old with 4 year old fish accounting for 59% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most commonly sampled species with trap nets with a total of 72 caught for a catch rate of 6.6/net, which indicated low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2013 was 6.8/net. Historically, Bluegills have been abundant with catch rates ranging from 2.8/net to 94.4/net and an average of 24.7/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 3.0 to 9.8 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Approximately 34% of the population exceeded 8 inches in length. An additional 25 fish ranging from 5.8 to 9.8 inches were sampled with gill nets. Fish were 2 to 6 years old with 2 and 3 year old fish making up the majority of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 90 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 66.7/hour, which was the highest of the 3 catch rates on record. The previous two catch rates were 32.0/hour in 2008 and 24.0/hour in 2013. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 6.4 to 19.0 inches with an average of 11.8 inches. Only 5% of the population exceeded 15 inches in length. An additional 3 fish ranging from 7.7 to 13.3 inches were sampled with trap nets. Largemouth Bass were not aged in 2017 but the length frequency distribution suggested the presence of multiple strong year classes and consistent recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nFew Northern Pike were sampled in 2017 with a total of 9 caught with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.1/net, which indicated low numbers were present. This was a significant decline from the all-time high of 7.4/net in 2013. Aside from 2013, Northern Pike have been sampled in low numbers with an average of just 1.2/net. Fish were mostly large in 2017 with a range of 25.8 to 41.3 inches and an average of 31.0 inches. Although not common, Roberds Lake offers anglers a chance at larger Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 19 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. Since 1988, catch rates have ranged from 0.4/net to 4.2/net with an average of 1.9/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 12.4 to 16.7 inches with an average of 14.3 inches. Approximately 32% of the sample exceeded 15 inches in length. One additional fish measuring 16.9 inches was sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 4 years old with 3 year classes present. Three year old fish accounted for 65% of the sample. All fish were aged to years in which fingerlings or adult fish were stocked. Growth was slow to moderate relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most commonly sampled fish in the gill nets with a total of 120 caught at a rate of 15.0/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2013 was 12.8/net. Historically, Yellow Perch numbers have been high with an average catch rate of 25.3/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 5.4 to 10.7 with an average of 8.2 inches. Only 4% of the population was larger than 10 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years. Most were 2 years old. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained low in Roberds Lake. Three fish ranging from 22.4 to 28.4 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which indicated low numbers were present. Historically, catch rates have ranged from 0.3/net to 4.5/net with a mean of 1.6/net. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 1 Black Bullhead was sampled in 2017 with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was the lowest on record. The average catch rate from 1986 to 1998 was 66.1/net. Since then, catch rates have dropped in every survey to an average of just 4.3/net. Conversely, Yellow Bullhead have become slightly more common over the years. A total of 13 were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.2/net. Over time, it appears as though Roberds Lake has become more suitable for Yellow Bullhead and less suitable for Black Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, and White Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. They ranged from 68.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 5.0 ppm at the surface to 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.1 ppm at 33 feet. A thermocline was detected between 27 and 30 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 30 feet. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

The numbers of bluegills and black crappies seen in this survey, 12.4 and 19.8/gill net, respectively, seem low in light of the good angling observed in recent years.  Many of the bluegills caught were 8-9 inches in length, and good numbers of 9-11 inch black crappies were observed.  Walleye have declined from the high of 16.8/gill net seen seven years ago to a low 1.0/gill net.  Northern pike are present in fair numbers and are of average size at 3-4 pounds.  Channel catfish have taken off in Roberds Lake with all sizes present and good numbers of 5-6 pound fish.  Channel catfish were stocked once in 1981.  Reproduction has been good with five year classes sampled.</p>",

The majority of these fish are between 7 to 8? inches and around a quarter of a pound.  Bluegill numbers also remain strong with 1993 being the dominant year class.  The average bluegill is around 6.3 inches and 0.2 pounds, respectively.  Both species should provide some good angling in the next year.  Other species present in lower abundance include northern pike, walleye, channel catfish and yellow perch.  Black bullhead numbers remain elevated with the average size being a respectable 10 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Water quality remains below average with a secchi disc reading of 1.5 feet.  Aquatic vegetation consists mainly of narrowleaf pondweed and curled pondweed.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roberds Lake is a 625-acre lake located approximately 2 miles northwest of the town of Faribault in Rice County. Roberds has a maximum depth of 43 feet with 63% less than 15 feet deep. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the lakes overall water quality condition as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" Much of the shoreline has been altered to suit the desires of homeowners to the detriment of lake water quality and nearshore habitat. Invasive Curly-leaf Pondweed is common in the lake and chemical treatments are used to improve recreation. A DNR owned concrete ramp is located on the west side of the lake off County Road 69. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. The latest management plan revised in 2017 calls for stocking 393,000 Walleye fry in even years. Before 2017, annual stocking of fingerlings was prescribed. Some combination of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked annually during the last ten years. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 8 gill nets, 1 trap net, and 61 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic social distancing protocols, it was determined trap nets were not feasible and were dropped from the 2020 survey. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net, which was the lowest on record. Trap net catch rates since 1993 have been variable with a range of 2.4/net to 46.8/net and an average of 13.6/net. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 3.9 to 14.3 inches and averaged 8.5 inches, indicating good size structure. Black Crappie were aged using both otoliths and scales. Numerous year classes were present including fish as old as 12 years.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 72 Bluegill for a catch rate of 9.0/net. Bluegill catch rates since 1993 ranged from 2.8/net to 44.0/net with a mean of 14.5/net. Bluegill in 2023 ranged from 3.3 to 8.3 inches with an average of 5.9 inches. An additional 26 fish ranging from 4.1 to 10.4 inches were sampled with gill nets. Fish from both gears were aged using otoliths and ranged from age-1 to age-11 with 8 year classes present. Most of the sample was age-3 or age-4. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 51 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 59.9/hour. The previous two catch rates were 66.7/hour in 2017 and 24.0/hour in 2013. Lengths in 2023 ranged from 6.5 to 18.4 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. Largemouth Bass were not aged in 2023 but the length frequency distribution suggested the presence of multiple strong year classes and consistent recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in 2023 at a rate of 4.0/ gill net - slightly less than the 4.9/gill net sampled in 2020. Northern Pike have been sampled in low numbers since 1993 with an average of just 3.1/net. Northern Pike in 2023 ranged in size from 20.8 to 32.8 inches and an average of 24.3 inches. Exactly 50 percent of fish were over the 24 inch minimum length requirement for harvest compared to 62% in 2020. Northern Pike were not aged. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 11 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which was greater than the lake class first quartile (1.2/net). Catch rates since 1993 have ranged from 0.0/net to 3.0/net with an average of 1.4/net. Walleye in 2023 ranged from 12.6 to 25.2 inches with an average of 16.4 inches. Walleye were aged using otoliths and ranged from age-2 to age-8 with 3 year classes present. Age-2 fish accounted for 82% of the sample. Ten of the 11 fish were aged to years in which fry were stocked including 9 fish from the first Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) fry stocking in 2021. The previous management strategy of fingerling stocking had failed to result in a meaningful increase in abundance and the change to less expensive fry stocking (LMS strain) will be continue in the future. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in the gill nets at a rate of 6.0/net. The catch rate in 2020 was 3.3/net. Yellow Perch numbers since 1993 have been high with an average catch rate of 12.1/net. Yellow Perch in 2023 ranged from 6.0 to 9.4 inches with an average of 8.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained low in Roberds Lake. Two fish, 18.2 and 28.0 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net. Catch rates since 1993 have ranged from 0.3/net to 4.5/net with an average of 1.5/net. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Yellow Bullhead, and White Bass. <br> \n <br> \nRoberds Lake has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

Zero age-0 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 0.0/hour on-time. Catch rates have averaged 3.1/hour on-time during 7 surveys since 2017. During that period non-stocked years (n = 4) yielded no age-0 walleyes. Past walleye management has failed to produce a significant catch (> 4.0/net) in survey gill nets despite almost annual heavy stocking of fingerling and mixed-age adult Walleyes. The management strategy switched in 2018 to fry stocking during even years (except in 2020 due to COVID which was made up in 2021). The 2021 and 2022 catch rates offer some hope, albeit limited, that fry stocking could produce what previous stocking strategies haven't in Roberds Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tRoberds Lake in Rice County is a 625 acre lake northwest of Faribault. A DNR owned public access is on the west side of the lake next to Winjum\u0019s Resort and Campgrounds off Rice county road 69.  <br> \n\tRoberds Lake was surveyed the week of July 7th, 2008 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. Black crappie were well represented in the catch. Black crappie were netted at a rate of 20.8 fish per trap net and 13.6 fish per gill net. Black crappies ranged in size from 4 to 10 inches. Two white crappies were captured in the survey, down from 13 in the 2003 survey. Bluegill size structure waned since the 2003 survey; size ranged from 4 to 8 inches with a combined gear mean size of 6.2 inches.  <br> \n\tYellow perch abundance is around the median at 12.3 fish per gill net lift. Perch range from 6 to 9 inches. Northern pike abundance is also around the median at 3.6 fish per gill net lift. Pike ranged from 21 to 33 inches. Channel catfish were netted at an all time high. Catfish were netted at a rate of 4.4 catfish per gill net and 1 catfish per trap net lift. Channel catfish ranged in size from 16 to 26 inches.  <br> \n\tLargemouth bass were sampled in mid-May with a Smith-Root electrofishing boat. Bass do not net well and electrofishing is the most reliable way to estimate abundance. 32 bass were caught per hour of on time. Largemouth bass were distributed bimodally around 10 and 16 inches.  <br> \n\tOne 44.5 inch muskellunge was caught in a gill net and successfully released. Anecdotal occasional muskellunge catches have been reported, and during high water periods, the outlet from French Lake\u0019s southeast side can run into Roberds Lakes\u0019 southern lagoon. French Lake is annually stocked with muskellunge. Other fish caught during the survey include bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead, black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Roberds Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Just 2 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 2.0/hour. In 6 surveys since 2017, catch rates have averaged 3.7/hour. During that period, non-stocked years yielded no age-0 walleyes. Past walleye management has failed to produce a significant catch (> 4.0/net) in survey gill nets despite almost annual heavy stocking of fingerling and mixed-age adult Walleyes. In 2018, the management strategy switched to fry stocking during even years (except in 2020 due to COVID which was made up in 2021). The 2021 and 2022 catch rates offer some hope, albeit limited, that fry stocking could produce what previous stocking strategies haven't in Roberds Lake.</p>",
