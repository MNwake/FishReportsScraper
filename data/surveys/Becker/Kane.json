                "narrative": "<p>Kane (Hemphill) Lake is located in eastern Becker County, seventeen miles northwest of Park Rapids.  Kane Lake has a surface area of 24 acres and a maximum depth of 52 feet.  There is a county-owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Kane Lake has limited shallow water habitat, dropping off quickly into deep water from the shoreline.  This limited amount of shallow water habitat along with stratification of the water column limits the productivity of this lake.  While Kane Lake is 53 feet deep, the lake stratifies during the summer months and no oxygen is found below 25 feet.  The low numbers of gamefish and the high numbers of black bullhead sampled in 2000 suggest that Kane Lake may have suffered a partial winterkill in recent years.  Kane Lake provides a limited fishery, mainly for northern pike and occasionally for black crappie.  Due to it's small size and low productivity, Kane Lake is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest or catch and release if they want to improve the fishery in Kane Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Kane Lake is in class 33.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Bass, Ingram, and Little Long.Moderate numbers of northern pike were sampled (4.5 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  Most of the sampled northern pike were in the 16 to 20 inch size range, however, larger pike are present with fish measured up to 39.5 inches.  Kane Lake is probably only capable of supporting limited numbers of large northern pike.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike (> 28 inches) in Kane Lake.Pumpkinseed are abundant in Kane Lake, however, the fish are very small with few fish of an acceptable size for angling.  Bluegill were sampled in low numbers, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance has been higher in past surveys, just within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie were not sampled in 2000 but have been sampled in past surveys.Black bullhead were abundant (38.0 black bullhead/trapnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black bullhead abundance in past surveys has been lower, below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  High black bullhead abundance is typically not found in lakes in this area unless they have suffered partial winterkill.Other species sampled include moderate numbers of yellow perch and white sucker, and low numbers of yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kane (Hemphill) Lake is located in eastern Becker County, seventeen miles northwest of Park Rapids.  Kane Lake has a surface area of 24 acres and a maximum depth of 52 feet.  There is a county-owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Kane Lake has limited shallow water habitat, dropping off quickly into deep water from the shoreline.  This limited amount of shallow water habitat along with stratification of the water column limits the productivity of this lake.  While Kane Lake is 53 feet deep, the lake stratifies during the summer months and little oxygen is found below 25 feet.  Kane Lake provides angling opportunities for northern pike and panfish.  Due to its small size and low productivity, Kane Lake is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest or catch and release if they want to improve the fishery in Kane Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Kane Lake is in lake class 33.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Bass, Ingram, and Little Long. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of northern pike were sampled (6.0 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has been lower, fluctuating from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find pike in the 18-22 inch size range, however, larger pike are present with fish measured up to 33.7 inches.  Kane Lake is only capable of supporting limited numbers of large northern pike.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike (>28 inches) in Kane Lake. <br> \n <br> \nKane Lake provides a limited panfish fishery to the angler.  Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (2.6 bluegill/trapnet), below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown the bluegill population to fluctuate from very low to moderate numbers.    Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Present and past surveys have shown that the pumpkinseed population is dominated by very small fish, less than 6 inches in length.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Black crappie up to 10.0 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch abundance (23.0 perch/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.   Yellow perch were generally not of an acceptable size for angling.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  Largemouth bass had not been sampled in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included hybrid sunfish, golden shiner, and common shiner. <br> \n</p>",
