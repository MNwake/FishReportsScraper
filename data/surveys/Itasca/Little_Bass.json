Northern pike were introduced in 1983 to provide a potential trophy fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled within the expected range for lakes similar to Little Bass Lake, however it was less than the previous assessment.  Size structure was poor indicated by an average length of about 18 inches being sampled in gill nets.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for young ages.  Northern pike abundance and size may be limited due to decreased prey abundance. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a relatively low abundance in trap nets when compared to similar lakes.  No bluegill were sampled in the previous two assessments.  The average length was almost 5 inches for trap net sampled fish, however one preferred length bluegill was sampled in the gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish was the most abundant fish sampled in trap nets within the expected range for similar lakes.
