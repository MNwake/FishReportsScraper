                "narrative": "<p>THE 1989 WALLEYE CPUE OF 2.0 FISH PER GILL NET FALLS WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTILE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN WALLEYE. THE 1984 CPUE ALSO WAS 2.0 FISH PER GILL NET. THE MEAN SIZE OF THE WALLEYE APPEARS TO HAVE INCREASED, HOWEVER; IN 1989 THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 3.00 PDS AND IN 1984 IT WAS 1.65 PDS. THE FOUR WALLEYE CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS WERE AGE THREE, FOUR, FIVE AND SIX. ALL WALLEYE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY WERE 17.0 INCHES IN LENGTH OR LONGER. THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT WALLEYE HAVE SPAWNED NATURALLY IN SECOND FULDA. ALTHOUGH 141,369 WALLEYE FRY WERE STOCKED IN 1988, NO REPRESENTATIVES OF THAT COHORT WERE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CPUE OF 72.20 FISH PER TRAP NET IS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED DURING A LAKE SURVEY IN THE WINDOM AREA. THE 1989 CPUE IS 1.6 TIMES THE 1984 CPUE. MEAN WEIGHTS FROM THE TWO SURVEYS WERE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME. THE PRESENT BLACK CRAPPIE STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE TWO STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE TWO FISH. AGE THREE AND FOUR FISH MAKE UP MOST OF THE REMAINING STOCK. BLACK CRAPPIE GROWTH RATES EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE EARLY IN LIFE BUT ONCE THE FISH ATTAIN A LENGTH OF APPROXI- MATELY FIVE INCHES OR LONGER GROWTH DROPS BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE. ALL FISH CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE BLUEGILL CPUE OF 5.00 FISH PER TRAP NET IS 12.5 TIMES THE 1984 CPUE. THE MEAN WEIGHT FOR BLUEGILL CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS IN 1989 WAS 0.41 AND IN 1984 IT WAS 0.45. THE PRESENT BLUEGILL STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE TWO FISH WITH AGES THREE, FOUR AND FIVE MAKING UP THE REMAINDER OF THE STOCK. SECOND FULDA BLUEGILL GROWTH RATES EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE UP UNTIL THE FISH ATTAIN A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 6.8 INCHES, FROM THEN ON GROWTH APPROXIMATES THE STATE AVERAGE. ALL BLUE- GILL CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY APPEAR TO BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE OF 2.00 FISH PER GILL NET IS TWICE THE CPUE RECORDED IN 1984. ALL NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY WERE BETWEEN 19.0 AND 26.0 INCHES IN LENGTH. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.25 PDS AND, ALTHOUGH NO CONDITION FACTOR WAS CALCULATED, THE NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY APPEARED TO BE LEAN GIVEN THEIR LENGTHS. ALL FOUR FISH CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A 1985 FINGERLING STOCKING. THE NORTHERN PIKE GROWTH RATE EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE EARLY IN LIFE BUT, ONCE THE FISH ATTAIN A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 13 INCHES, GROWTH RATES FROP BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE 1984 YELLOW PERCH CPUE WAS 54.0 FISH PER GILL NET, ONLY TWO PERCH WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 SURVEY. THE BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE OF 690.80 FISH PER TRAP NET IS THE THIRD HIGHEST INDEX EVER RECORDED IN THE WINDOM AREA. THE 1989 CPUE IS 32.9 TIMES THE 1984 CPUE. THE MEAN WEIGHT IN 1984 WAS 0.44 PDS AND IN 1989 IT WAS 0.08 PDS. NO CARP WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 SURVEY. THE WHITE SUCKER CPUE OF 2.5 FISH PER GILL NET IS 50% OF THE CPUE RECORDED IN 1984. THE MEAN WHITE SUCKER WEIGHT IN 1984 WAS 1.00 PD AND IN 1989 IT WAS 2.49 PDS. THE YELLOW BULLHEAD CPUE OF 1.6 FISH PER TRAP NET FALLS WITH- IN THE FOURTH QUARITLE OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES THAT CONTAIN YELLOW BULLHEAD. NO YELLOW BULLHEAD WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1984 SURVEY.</p>",

YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE IS ABOUT 7 TIMES STATE AVG AND ARE MOST- LY II ANNULUS FISH, WITH SOME III'S AND IV'S RE- PRESENTED. BLACK BULLHEAD NUMBERS WERE MUCH HIGHER HERE THAN IN FIRST FULDA IN GILLNET CATCHES, AND THE AVG SIZE IS SOMEWHAT SMALLER, THOUGH STILL VERY ACCEPTABLE TO ANGLERS. CARP AND WHITE SUCKERS WERE ALSO TAKEN IN THE SURVEY. PUMPKINSEED, GREEN SUNFISH, ORANGESPOTTED SUNFISH, AND YELLOW BULL- HEADS WERE TAKEN IN FIRST FULDA, BUT NOT IN SECOND BIGMOUTH BUFFALO WERE NOT TAKEN IN SURVEY NETS IN EITHER LAKE, BUT ARE USUALLY CAUGHT DURING COMMER- CIAL FISHING ACTIVITIES.</p>",
