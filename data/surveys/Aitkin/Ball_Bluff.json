Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 2 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including 5 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2011 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Ball Bluff Lake is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Bluff Lake is located in northern Aitkin County, just south of Jacobson.  Although the lake is within Savanna State Forest, riparian ownership is private except for a small public water access on the west side of the lake.  The shoreline consists mainly of gently sloping mixed forests.  Residential development is light with about 10 dwellings per mile of shore, ranging from seasonal recreational properties to permanent homes.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the lake is only 159 acres, it has steep drop-offs and reaches a maximum depth of 78 feet.  Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles are collected regularly to monitor the amount of habitat available for cold water species such as tullibee (northern cisco).  The tullibee catch was the highest since 1977 at 1.8 per gill net, but survey data suggest just three year-classes have been produced over the last decade. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking was discontinued after 2000 due to lack of success, but anglers may still hook into an occasional fish.  The walleye catch of 0.8 fish per gill net was similar to the six previous surveys dating back to 1952.  Interestingly, eight of the ten walleye collected were from stocked year classes, while two fish were the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was conducted in June to survey the abundance and size structure of the largemouth bass population.  The catch rate of 18 fish per hour of sampling, the highest of the three surveys since 1991, suggests anglers targeting this popular and sometimes acrobatic species should have plenty of opportunities.  Size ranged from 5.3 to 16.9 inches and averaged 11.6 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike in Ball Bluff Lake were near average for the type of lake, and although some larger fish were present, the number over 24 inches was only about 7% of our catch.  Recycling of large pike is the best way to maximize enjoyment of a limited resource of quality individuals. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers visiting the lake will discover an abundant bluegill population.  Fish caught during the 2011 survey averaged 5.5 inches, but fish up to 8.6 inches were sampled.  While bluegills greater than 7 inches, accounted for 14% of the catch, the slow growth rate in Ball Bluff suggests anglers should use restraint when harvesting this species.  Black crappie might be harder to locate, but the small population that persists in the lake provides some opportunity for this popular species. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the standard survey work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2011.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the general fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health.  Combining all sampling gear, eighteen species of fish were collected during the 2011 survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ball Bluff Lake was conducted on June 21, 2021, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample one station, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Cisco, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Ball Bluff Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 7 degrees C, which is considered good for Tullibee survival. While water from the surface to about 16 feet was fairly warm, overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate for Tullibee from the surface to about 30 feet deep providing some habitat for Tullibee. Comparing profiles collected from 2009-2019, the least amount of available Tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, while all other years had better conditions. The lake provides \"good\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area monitored for Tullibee habitat. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Bluff Lake is a moderately fertile 159 acre lake located in northeastern Aitkin County just south of the town of Jacobson.  A small proportion of the lake's surface area makes up shallow water areas less than 15 feet in depth.  Consequently, food production and available spawning habitat is limited and fish growth of many fish species is restricted.  Land use along the lake margin is primarily mixed hardwoods covering gentle to moderately rolling hills interspersed with lake homes or seasonal cabins along the west and northeast shores, while small areas of marshland exist along the north and south ends of the lake.  The lake's fishery is managed primarily for walleye with largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.The evaluation portion of the current management plan called for a population assessment in 2001 to evaluate walleye fry stocking success from 1995-1997 and to monitor other fish populations.  During the open water season of 2001, spring night electrofishing followed by summer gill and trap netting were utilized for the evaluation.  Walleye abundance was below normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 2.9 pounds, was within a normal range.  Since 1952, five out of six sampling surveys found below normal walleye abundance.  Only the 1993 assessment reported abundance within the normal range.  The 4 walleye in 2001 ranged from 18.8 to 22.9 inches in length.  The year classes represented in the sample were 1995, 1992, and 1990 and their growth was normal at all ages.  According to historical records, walleye stocking occurred in 1995 and 1992 with fry and fingerlings, respectively.  It appears that stocking success for the fry stocking period from 1995-1997 was minimal as indicated by the 2 walleye represented during this time.  One other walleye was represented during a stocked year (1992).  During non-stocked years, a single fish was represented.  The presence of a year class during a non-stocked year indicates that some limited natural reproduction has occurred; however, fish represented during stocked years may have resulted from either stocking or natural reproduction.  Survival of stocked walleye fingerlings has been historically variable and may be limited by the abundance of predator fish, such as northern pike, and low numbers of forage species for pike, such as yellow perch and tullibee.  Spring night electrofishing found low numbers of largemouth bass while trap nets found abundance at a normal level.  Bass lengths ranged from 5.2 to 21.8 inches.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were found to be at a normal level for this type of lake.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.9 inches with 52% of the sample ranging from 5.5 to 7.0 inches.  Bluegill were found to grow slow from ages 2-6.  Northern pike numbers were above normal while the average size was on the small side.  Pike numbers and size were similar to the 1997 survey.  The above normal abundance of northern pike experienced in 1997 and 2001 may have been the result of increased spawning area around the lake margin caused by high water levels flooding shoreline vegetation from the early 1990s to the fall of 2000.  Northern pike lengths extended from 10.4 to 34.5 inches with 50% of the sample between 18.0 and 22.0 inches.  Black crappie were found at normal abundance levels and their lengths ranged from 7.1 to 12.4 inches. The 2001 crappie catch rate was the highest ever recorded by DNR Fisheries assessments.  The sampled fish community was also made up of dog fish, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  In addition to the above species, the least darter (Etheostoma microperca), a species of special concern, was sampled during a county biological survey in 2001. An angler fishing Ball Bluff Lake may encounter an occasional nice sized walleye or largemouth bass, an abundance of smaller northern pike with an occasional memorable sized fish, or a fair number of panfish.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or improve the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding land users within the watershed can maintain or improve the lake's water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline; re-establishing buffer strips of native plant species along the developed shoreline; updating outdated or failing septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 12 C, which is considered good for tullibee survival. While water from the surface to about 15 feet was fairly warm, overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate for tullibee from about 15 to 29 feet deep, providing some habitat for tullibee. Comparing profiles collected from 2009-2016, the least amount of available tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, while all other years had better conditions. The lake provides \"good\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area monitored for tullibee habitat. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

Only one walleye was captured in the gill nets, and that walleye did not come from a year that was supplemented with walleye fry. Northern pike are more abundant than average for this type of lake and tend to grow slowly. Most of the northern pike were between 16 and 20 inches long, however a few were over 30 inches long. Anglers may expect good catch rates of smaller northern pike and an occasional larger northern pike. We encourage catch and release of larger pike, which can probably keep smaller northerns in check by preying on them. The nets caught very few forage fishes, including yellow perch and tulibees. The many northern pike in Ball Bluff Lake probably restrict survival of forage fishes, including stocked small walleyes. Only 20 percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less and much of the lake is greater than 30 feet deep. Lack of shallow water cover and space for food production restricts growth for many species in the lake and leads to intense predation from northern pike.</p>",

The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 6 degrees C, which is considered good for tullibee survival. While water from the surface to about 16 feet was fairly warm, overall oxy-thermal habitat was adequate for tullibee from the surface to about 27 feet deep providing some habitat for tullibee. Comparing profiles collected from 2009-2018, the least amount of available tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, while all other years had better conditions. The lake provides \"good\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area monitored for tullibee habitat. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Bluff Lake is located in northern Aitkin County, just south of Jacobson.  Although the lake is within Savanna State Forest, riparian ownership is private except for a small public water access on the west side of the lake.  The shoreline consists mainly of gently sloping mixed forests.  Residential development is light with about 10 dwellings per mile of shore, ranging from seasonal recreational properties to permanent homes.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the lake is only 159 acres, it has steep drop-offs and reaches a maximum depth of 78 feet.  Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles are collected regularly to monitor the amount of habitat available for cold water species such as Tullibee (Northern Cisco).  The Tullibee catch was the highest since 1977 at 3.8 per gill net and survey data suggests that at least five year-classes were present in the population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance hasn't changed much since 2011 and was at 4.0/gill net in 2021. Size ranged from 15.9 to 38.8 inches and averaged 24.3 inches and 3.6 lbs.  The size structure is favorable with a good mixture of sizes within and above the protected slot limit. Thirty-three percent were 22-26 inches and 26 percent were longer than 26 inches.  Recycling of large pike is the best way to maximize enjoyment of a limited resource of quality individuals. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 trap net catch rate for Bluegill of 15.4/ net was down from the 2011 survey and is the long term median for all surveys at Ball Bluff Lake. Sizes ranged from 3.2 to 8.3 inches and averaged 5.2 inches long with 13% of fish reaching 7 inches or more.  The slow growth rate in Ball Bluff suggests anglers should use restraint when harvesting this species in order to maintain a quality component in their fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie might be harder to locate than Bluegill, but the small population that persists in the lake provides some opportunity for this popular species. <br> \n <br> \nStandard gill nets caught Bass at 2.0/net, which was the highest catch rate for all historical surveys indicating they may be increasing in this lake as they are in many lakes across Minnesota. Spring night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not done in 2021, but it has been conducted a few times in the past with generally lower catch rates, ranging between 9 and 15.2/hr. Anglers targeting this popular and sometimes acrobatic species should have plenty of opportunities.  Sizes ranged from 8.9 to 15.9 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking was discontinued after 2000 due to lack of success, but anglers may still hook into an occasional fish.  Only one larger Walleye was caught in 2021 that was 25.2 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nAlso worth mentioning is the Tullibee, a cold-water forage species that was caught in the gill net at a rate of 3.8/net and ranged in size from 7.8 to 17.7 inches.  The 2021 catch rate of 3.8/net is the highest catch dating back to 1977 when 18/net were caught, which was the highest recorded for the lake.  Tullibee provide excellent forage for predator species such as Northern Pike but can also provide winter angling opportunities in some waters. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on July 31, 2023, to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for Tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 6.4 degrees C and occurred at 31 feet, which is considered good for Tullibee survival. From just below the surface to around 48 feet the oxy-thermal habitat was above the critical threshold for tullibee, and was one of the better conditions measured in recent surveys. Comparing profiles collected from 2009-2023, the least amount of available Tullibee habitat occurred in 2012, while all other years had better conditions. The lake provides \"good\" habitat compared to other lakes in Aitkin area monitored for Tullibee habitat. Because the area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Bluff Lake is a marl lake, with mostly sand, silt and muck substrate. Hardstem bulrush and muskgrass are abundant in the shoal waters. There are lily pad-filled bays on the north and south endsof the lake. The lake is composed mostly of deep (>20 feet) and shallow (<5 feet) water, and there is very little area with intermediate depths.This survey revealed that anglers have a variety of fishes to pursue on Ball Bluff Lake, including walleyes, northern pike, largemouth bass and bluegills. The northern pike grow slowly and the population is average for lakes of this type. Most northern pike were between 18 and 21 inches long.Bluegills also grow slowly when they are young, and are rather abundant. Though most are less than 6 inches long, about 5% of the trapnetted bluegills were 8.0 to 9.0 inches long. Few black crappies wereaught in this survey or in past surveys. High catches of largemouth bass in trap nets in 1993 and electrofishing in 1991 both indicate a substantial population. The abundance of largemouth bass has increased since the 1988 survey. Most of the bass in this survey and in the 1991 electrofishing sample were less than 12 inches long. Northern pike and walleyes may be preying on the bass and keeping them from building up an abundance of larger fish.Walleyes have been stocked regularly since 1969. The walleye population, at 1.7 fish per gillnet set in 1993, appears to have increased to respectable levels as a result of the stocking efforts. Most of the walleyes caught in 1993 were from the 1989 year class, which was supplemented with both fingerlings and yearlings. These fish were 16 to 18 inches long in this survey.The abundance of larger prey, in the form of 8 inch or longer fish, is limited in Ball Bluff Lake.Yellow perch have been scarce, and though the numbers have increased since the 1988 assessment, the perch are all smaller than 8 inches. Large northern pike will likely continue to grow more slowly than normal in Ball Bluff Lake because of the low numbers of larger forage fishes.Walleye spawning habitat is limited to a small gravel and rubble bar on the northeast side of the lake. Potential bluegill and largemouth bass spawning areas are abundant, and the fish are producing substantial populations from these areas. Much of the lake is too deep for plant growth. The shallow water plants, and particularly the bulrushes, need to be protected to maintain the lake's preyproductivity and to provide consistent reproduction of panfishes and gamefishes.</p>",
