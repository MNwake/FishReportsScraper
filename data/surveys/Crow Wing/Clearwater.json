                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is an 880 acre lake located 4 miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the outlet on the north side of the lake.  Clearwater reaches depths of 54 feet, with 29% of the lake 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 18 feet.  Much of Clearwater's shoreline is undeveloped including a DNR Fisheries conservation easement AMA (aquatic management area), which protects almost a mile of shoreline.  Protecting the undeveloped shoreline and the adjacent emergent and submergent vegetation will allow Clearwater to maintain good water quality into the future.  Protection of the shoreline will also protect essential spawning habitat for many of the lakes fish species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in Clearwater every third year, with the last stocking taking place in 2011.  There is also limited natural reproduction of walleyes in Clearwater.   The walleye gillnet catch of 4.9/net was average compared to other lakes.   Average size was 16.2 inches and 1.7 lbs. Walleyes up to 28.2 inches were sampled.   Growth was good compared to area lakes.  Past gillnet catches have ranged from 0.2/net (1982) to 6.8/net (2001).   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 4.8/net was average.  Past gillnet catches have ranged from 1.6/net (1991) to 5.5/net (2001).  Average size was decent at 23.0 inches and 3.0 lbs, with northern pike up to 35.4 inches sampled.  Northern pike 24 inches and larger made up 29% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured during spring electrofishing at a rate of 44.9/ hr. run-time.  Lengths ranged from 4.0-17.7 inches, with an average of 10.0 inches.  Fish less than eight inches made up 37% of the catch.  Largemouth bass were also captured by gillnets in above average numbers at 2.8/net. Average size in gillnets was 12.3 inches, and 1.1 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were also captured during spring electrofishing at a rate of 24.0/hr. run-time.  Lengths ranged from 5.6-19.4 inches with an average of 11.7 inches.  Smallmouth were also captured in above average numbers in gillnets at a rate of 2.8/net.  Average size from smallmouth captured in gillnets was 15.0 inches and 2.0 lbs.  Clearwater Lake is one of a handful of lakes in the Brainerd area with a quality smallmouth bass fishery.    Selective harvest and voluntary catch and release will be needed to sustain this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill catches in 2013 were the lowest to date on Clearwater.  Black crappie size was good, but bluegill were small with only 10% measuring at least 7 inches.   <br> \nClearwater Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of Eurasian watermilfoil.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 905 acre lake located 4 miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the outlet on the north side of the lake.  Clearwater reaches depths of 54', with 29% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 11'.  Much of Clearwater's shoreline is undeveloped including a DNR Fisheries conservation easement AMA (aquatic management area), which protects almost a mile of shoreline.  Protecting the undeveloped shoreline and the adjacent emergent and aquatic vegetation will allow Clearwater to maintain good water quality into the future.  Protection of the shoreline will also protect essential spawning habitat for many of the lake's fish species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in Clearwater every third year, with the last stocking taking place in 2017.  The walleye catch of 4.1/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes.   Average length was 18.7\", with fish up to 27.8\" sampled.  Past gill net catches have ranged from 0.2/net (1982) to 6.8/net (2001).   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 3.8/gill net was average.  Average size was nice at 25.2\" and 3.6 lbs, with northern pike up to 33.5\" sampled.  Northern pike in the protected 22\"-26\" slot made up 33% of the catch, with fish 26.0\" and larger making up an additional 47%.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured during spring electrofishing at a good rate of 66.2/ hr. run-time.  Average length was 13.4\", with 77% at least 12.0\" in length.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 1.1/net.  Average length was 14.3\".  Smallmouth bass were sampled during the spring electrofishing survey at a high rate of 76.7/hr. run-time.  Average length was 13.0\", with 63% at least 12.0\" in length.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets at 9.6/net.  Average length was 14.0\", with 78% measuring at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in low numbers in gill nets at 0.3/net.  Average length was 10.4\".  The trap net catch of 0.6/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 9.3\".  For both gears combined 73% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 8.7/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 4.6\".  Only 5% were at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nClearwater Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of Eurasian watermilfoil.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.  Rusty crayfish, a regulated invasive species, is also present in the lake.  Search MNDNR.gov for more information. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater is an 880 acre lake located about four miles south of Deerwood.  There is a public access located in the outlet just north of the lake.  Maximum depth is 54 feet and about 29% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  The lake has moderately-hard water with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is typical of lakes in this area.  Shallow water soils are a combination of rubble and boulder sized rock, sand, marl and muck and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent plants like bulrush enhance water quality and improve the quality of spawning habitat for largemouth bass and panfish, while plants like wild rice often improve the quality of spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submergent species are important to a wide variety of aquatic species because they provide vital food and protective cover.Periodic walleye stocking has been done in Clearwater Lake since 1986.  The test netting done in 1996 showed walleyes were present in \"average\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  The majority of walleyes aged were from years when stocking was done.  Walleye growth remained in the \"good\" category.  Walleyes averaged 19 inches and 2.7 lbs..Northern pike numbers were in the \"low\" category in 1991 but rebounded back into the \"average\" category in '96, which is more characteristic of previous netting results.  Several year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Pike averaged 21 inches and 2.5 lbs. in '96.Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers in '96.  several year classes were sampled, each in relatively low numbers.  Smallmouth bass were caught in \"high\" numbers in '96 after being present in \"low\" numbers in '91.  Several age classes were sampled and growth was good.Bluegills were present in \"average\" numbers in '96.  Many year classes were present and growth bordered on slow.  Only about 4% of bluegills sampled in trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length, similar to 1991 results of 2% being that size.  Black crappies were caught in \"high\" numbers but only two year classes were sampled, not an uncommon situation with this species.  Crappie growth was good.Important forage fish sampled in 1996 included yellow perch, tullibees and white suckers.  Perch were caught in higher numbers than in previous nettings but remained in the \"low\" category compared to similar type lakes.  Several year classes were found and growth rate was good.  The tullibee catch was lower than in 1991 but remained in the \"average\" category.  The typical tullibee was 12 inches long in '96.  White suckers were caught in \"low\" numbers in '96 but the catch was similar to that seen in previous nettings.Other fish species sampled in '96 included: bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

Median length rose from 20\" to 29\" and 3.54 lbs.  Ages 2-5 were sampled and had good growth.  A statistically significant increase in walleye abundance was also seen.  Catch rose from 1.75 to 3.88/gillnet but remained lake class.  Average size decreased from 3.69 lb (large) to 1.80 lb (average).  Median lengths dropped from 20 (range = 10.0-22) in 1986 and 1989 showed strongly in the catch, comprising 81% of the aged sample.  Walleye growth appeared to be good.  Bluegill catch was average for the lake class and similar to 1986.  Average size remained at 0.10 lb (average).  Median length dropped from 5.0 to 4.5 netted fish at least 7.0 rose to 8.4% if gillnetted fish were included (4.9% in 1986).  The largemouth bass sample was small for both trapnets and gillnets compared to 1986.  Four age classes were sampled compared to five in 1986. Smallmouth bass continued to be sampled in low numbers.  The only smallmouth bass captured was trapnetted in 1991.  Yellow perch abundance (0.5/gillnet) remained low.  Both median length and size range were similar in 1986 and '91.  Cisco abundance rose from 1.25 to 4.63/ gillnet but remained from 0.29 (small) to 0.73 lb (average) and median size increased from 8.0 to 12 were apparent from length frequency distributions, similar to 1986.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is 880 acres and is located about four miles south of Deerwood in Crow Wing County.  Maximum depth is 54' and 28.6% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is a combination of rubble and boulder sized rock, sand, marl, gravel, and muck.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 21 species present.  Emergent and floating leaf plants such as bulrush, wild rice, and water lillies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality and provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass, and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and othe aquatic species.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly since 1986.  The 2001 walleye catch of 6.8/gill net was the highest to date and is considered average when compared to similar lakes.  Most walleyes were from years when stocking was done.  Average length and weight were 18.9\" and 2.5lbs, respectively.Northern pike abundance was 5.5/gill net, which is average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length and weight were 21.8\" and 2.6lbs, respectively.Smallmouth bass abundance is above average for the lake class at 2.1/gill net and was similar to the 1996 catch of 1.9/gill net.  Eight year classes were sampled.  Growth was average through the first four years and relatively slow thereafter.  Average weight was 2.1lbs and 86.2% of all smallmouth bass measured were 12\" or larger compared to 69.4% in 1996.  Largemouth bass were caught in relatively high numbers in 2001 and abundance is the highest since 1982.  Average weight was 0.5lbs and 14.8% of all largemouth bass were 12\" or larger. The 2001 bluegill catch of 7.0/trap net was the lowest of to date, but remained in the \"average\" range for the lake class.  Bluegill growth was relatively slow.  Seven percent of bluegills sampled by trap net measured 7\" or larger compared to 4% in 1996 and 2% in 1991.  Black crappies were caught in above average numbers for the second straight netting.  About 52% were from the 1998 year class.  Growth was average and 20.6% of all crappies measured were 8\" or larger.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibees are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch and white sucker abundance remained below average when compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee were caught in average numbers and had an average length of 11.8\".    </p>",

Maximum depth is 54 feet and 29 % of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. Bottom substrate varies from rubble- boulder areas, to sandy areas stretching lake ward.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with a minimum of 29 species present.    Emergent plants like bulrush, and wild rice and floating leaf plants such as water lilies are abundant in areas of little or no shoreline development.  The large areas of undeveloped shoreline and diverse aquatic habitat make this lake unique for the Brainerd area and these qualities have helped maintain water quality, and provide essential spawning, and cover habitat for northern pike, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and panfish species.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye management plan calls for fingerling stocking every third year and has been completed since 1989, except for the year 2004 when the rotation was moved back one year and stocking took place in 2004.  The 2007 walleye catch of 3.8/gill net is down from the previous two surveys, but comparable to the average catch rate for this lake. Sizes ranged from 15.0 to 23.5 inches and averaged 19.8 inches. The majority of the fish captured were from years of stocking, and 66% were from the age six-year class and from the 2001 stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers of 3.92/gillnet is comparable to past surveys on this lake.  Fish varied in size from 12.9 to 32.2 inches and averaged 21.8 inches in the gillnets.  The size structure is similar to past surveys. Largemouth and smallmouth bass were observed in moderate numbers in spring electro fishing and in summer net catches.  As in past surveys largemouth bass numbers were very good and size structure usually composed of fish less than 16.0 inches. Smallmouth numbers were good with all sizes present.  Special consideration should be taken when fishing smallmouth bass in this lake because of the fact so few lakes in the Brainerd area have smallmouth bass fishing populations large enough to maintain a quality fishery for this species. Hopefully anglers will use discretion and practice voluntary catch and release. Black crappie catch rates were good and comparable to past nettings on this lake. Critical to the crappies future is to maintain the bulrush stands.  Angling pressure has increased substantially on this lake in recent years and maintaining a quality fishery will depend on protecting the undeveloped shoreline habitat and lakeshore homeowners will have to show restraint when developing lake frontage.    <br> \n</p>",
