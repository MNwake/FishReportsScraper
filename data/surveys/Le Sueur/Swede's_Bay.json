A fishery survey was conducted on Swede's Bay in August 2002 to assess the fish community and lake characteristics.  Black bullhead were abundant in Swede's Bay, but bluegill, yellow perch, and black crappie were also common.  Black crappie up to 12 inches were present, although most were around 8 to 9 inches long.  Bluegill were up to 8 inches long.  Largemouth bass and walleye were also present and may offer good angling opportunities.There is no public access on Swede's Bay, but the lake can be accessed through the shallow channel from East Jefferson Lake.  </p>",
