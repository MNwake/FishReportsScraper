The brown bog-stained water has scattered beds of aquatic vegetation near shore on mostly muck/detritus substrate.  The outlet is a tributary to the Manitou River, a designated trout stream.  Access is gained of off U.S. Forest Service Road #172, on unmarked logging roads.  Some anglers access the lake from the Tomahawk Snowmobile Trail at the southwest corner of the lake through a carry-in trail down a steep hill. <br> \n <br> \nThe special lake assessment on August 26, 2013 profiled the temperature/dissolved oxygen level throughout the water column in the deepest basin of the lake.  The depth at the water quality station was 14.5 feet.  While this assessment showed unfavorable temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels, Brook Trout are in Crosscut Lake by probably locating small spring fed flowages in the lake that provide thermal and oxygen refuge.  The quality of the brook trout fishing in Crosscut Lake varies yearly depending on the length of thermal and oxygen stresses that brook trout undergo.   <br> \n</p>",

Crosscut Lake has had a history of low dissolved oxygen levels in the deeper water in late summer.  Low dissolved oxygen has been measured in winter investigations also.

Size of trout ranged from 11.2 to 13.4\" with an average of about 0.71 pounds. These fish likely grew a small amount while in the lake as the fish stocked in the spring averaged about 0.57 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is managed for Brook Trout and the current plan calls for catchable sized yearling fish to be stocking annually in the spring. Habitat in the lake is sufficient to support trout through the summer season consistently, but few fish survive the winter. Therefore, the size structure of trout available to anglers during the summer is highly influence by the size of the fish stocked in the spring.

Unfortunately no brook trout were sampled during this assessment, even though recent stockings had occurred.  While it is dificult to determine exactly why no brook trout were captured it is suspected that the fish perished during the winter of 2002-2003 due to low oxygen levels.  Under normal conditions winterkill does not occur in this lake; however, this past winter had little snow, and cold temperatures resulted in greater ice thickness than would normally occur.  This most likely created unsuitable oxygen conditions for brook trout during the long ice covered period.</p>",
