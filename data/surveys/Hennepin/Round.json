Round is located within the city of Eden Prairie, which owns parkland surrounding the entire lake.  In addition to a boat ramp, there is a fishing pier for anglers.  Boaters may use electric motors only.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish are the dominant species in Round Lake, comprising 93% of fish sampled during this assessment.  The average length of bluegill sampled was 7.3 inches.  Eighty three percent of bluegill were greater than 7 inches in length, with the largest measuring 8.5 inches.  The average weight of bluegill was about 1/3 lb.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were less abundant than the bluegill; however, they were of good size.  Only 1.8% of the catch was crappie, and their length ranged between 9.0 and 10.8 inches.  The average weight for crappie was about 0.5 lb. <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing revealed a marginal largemouth bass fishery, with the largest fish measuring 12.3 inches.  Only 8.7% of the bass sampled were over 12 inches, and the average-sized bass was about 7 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nAlso sampled in lower numbers were pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfishes, as well as black bullhead.  In the past, a variety of fish had been stocked into Round, including walleye, rainbow trout, brook trout, and hybrid (tiger) muskellunge.  Because these fish have not appeared in any sampling since 2000, it is assumed that none remain.  No fish stocking has occurred since 1992.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The city owns park land which surrounds the entire lake, which includes a boat ramp and a fishing pier for public use.  Many species have been stocked over the years (starting in 1979), the most recent being tiger muskellunge in 1988 and 1992.  No stocking of any species has occurred since. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were found to be the dominant species within Round Lake, consistent with previous surveys.  With a mean length of 6.56 inches, 87% of the bluegills sampled were greater than 6.0 inches.  Bluegills of this survey represented 92% of the total catch from both gillnets and trapnets.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie comprised about 3% of species sampled in trapnets, ranging in length from 5.0-10.0 inches in length.  About 93% of the black crappie sampled were larger than 7.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were seen in about average numbers, but with above-average weights.  They ranged in length from 5.0-7.5 inches, evenly distributed.   <br> \n <br> \nGreen and hybrid sunfish are present in Round Lake, in comparable numbers to the last survey.  Together, they totaled about 4% of the catch/ net, and ranged in length from 5.0-7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were also found, and while their numbers are average this lake, their weights were found to be well above average.  Black bullheads represent about 2% of the total catch for this survey. <br> \n</p>",

Other panfish species present include pumpkinseed, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and black crappie.Largemouth bass remain the most abundant game fish in the lake. The average size bass sampled was just ove 12 inches in length and 0.9 pounds per fish. Hybrid Muskellunge and walleye were also captured during this assessment, but in relatively low numbers. Black bullhead averaging over 11.0 inches in length were also observed in the catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a small (33 acre) lake located within the city limits of Eden Prarie.  The city owns park land which surrounds the entire lake.  In addition to a boat ramp, there is a fishing pier for anglers to use.  The lake contains a large number of small panfish, mainly bluegills.  Average size is 5.7 inches, and only 3% are over 7 inches.  Black crappie appear in densities typical of this type of lake, and their average size is 8.6 inches.  Many small largemouth bass were sampled in the most recent survey, although a 17.1 inch individual was also captured.  Tiger muskellunge are stocked every third year, although none were captured in the most recent survey.  Two large walleye, remnants from stockings in 1985-86, were also captured.  Also present are pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish, as well as black bullhead.  Pumpkinseed abundance is higher than is typical in this type of lake, while other species have more normal abundances.</p>",

TRAPNET SAMPLING WAS 29.3 AND 20.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET, RESPECTIVELY.  BLG WERE ALSO SAMPLED ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  TRAPNET SAMPLED BLG EXHIBITED AN AVERAGE RATE OF 6.24 FISH PER POUND AND A CALCULATED PSD=41.5% (6.27/LB. AND 38.5% FOR COMBINED GEAR TYPES).  OVER 2,000 BLG WERE CAPTURED IN ONE SHORT SEINE HAUL SOUTH OF THE SWIMMING BEACH NEAR THE FISHING PIER. NO LMB WERE SAMPLED OVER THE 16 OF THE GEAR TYPES.  LMB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR ABUNDANCE AND POUNDS PER SET FOR BOTH PASSIVE GEAR TYPE.  ELECTROFISHING CPUE WAS UP FROM 1990 AND NEAR AVERAGE FOR THE OVERALL STUDY. A PSD=38.2% WAS DETERMINED FROM THE ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE (40.0% FROM THE OTHER SAMPLING GEARS). GROWTH RATE IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR LMB AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR BLGS.  HSF WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS AND PMK WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAPNETS.  GSF WERE PRESENT IN THE SEINE SAMPLING.  BLC WERE SAMPLED BELOW ALL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR BOTH GEAR TYPES.  BUT AVERAGE 3.0 FISH PER POUND.  BLB WERE SAMPLED BELOW TRAPNET MEDIAN LEVELS, BUT ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILLNETS EXCEPT THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR NUMBER PER SET. SAMPLED BULLHEADS AVERAGE 1.47 FISH PER POUND. WAE WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS, AND ABOVE ALL GILL NET MEDIANS EXCEPT FOR THE STATEWIDE ABUNDANCE PER SET.  ALL WAE SAMPLED WERE 16.0 RSD =33.3%.  WAE GROWTH RATE IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE.  THREE TME WERE CAPTURED FROM THE 1988 YEAR CLASS.  TWO OF THESE FISH EXHIBITED EXPECTED AVERAGE SIZE OF THEIR AGE, WHILE THE THIRD FISH WAS 8 WERE CAPTURED IN THE SEINE SAMPLE.</p>",

Round is located within the city of Eden Prairie, which owns parkland surrounding the entire lake.  In addition to a boat ramp, there is a fishing pier for anglers.  Boaters may use electric motors only.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill Sunfish are the dominant species in Round Lake, comprising 79% of fish sampled during this survey.  The average length of Bluegill sampled was 6.2 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of Bluegill were greater than 6 inches in length, with the largest measuring 7.3 inches.  The average weight of Bluegill was 0.17 lb.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 2.0 per gill net.  Mean size of the fish was 7.6 inches and 0.21 lb.  All fish ranged between 6.1 and 8.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAlso sampled in lower numbers were Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfishes, as well as Black Bullhead.  In the past, a variety of fish had been stocked into Round, including Walleye, Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout, and Tiger Muskellunge.  Because these fish have not appeared in any sampling since 2000, it is assumed that none remain.  No fish stocking has occurred since 1992.   <br> \n</p>",
