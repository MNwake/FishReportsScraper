Access is possible through the channel from Little Grand (69-513) Lake or by permission across private property.  Black bullhead, northern pike, black crappie and bluegill make up the majority of the fish seen in the lake.     Black bullhead were plentiful in the 1997 lake survey.  Northern pike captured in this survey averaged 17.1 inches in length and showed slow growth.  Black crappie and bluegill numbers in Baby Grand were below the average abundance levels found in similar types of lakes.  Average lengths were 8.9 and 6.3 inches respectively.     Other species seen at low numbers in this survey included:  largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Baby Grand is a 65 acre lake with 65 acres (100%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  The lake is located 2 miles southeast of Saginaw, MN.  Access is possible through the channel with Little Grand Lake (69-0513).  Baby Grand has been previously investigated by DNR Fisheries in 1964 and 1997.  Gillnets were not used to help evaluate the fish community in 1997.  Baby Grand was assessed during the summer of 2014 to update information about fish populations after acquisition of public access through Aquatic Management Area (AMA) property on Little Grand Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 27 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  Bass electrofishing was not attempted in previous investigations.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 27.9 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.3 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2011 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 10.6 per trapnet lift was up from 1997 (2.0) and is above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.2 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was fairly consistent with one missing year-class (2007) from 2006 to 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 23.8 per trapnet lift was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up significantly from 1997 (0.5).  Average size was 6.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2013 were represented with a strong 2011 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 8.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up from 1964 (4.0).  Average size was 21.7 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 2.0 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up from 1964 (0.0).  Average length of perch was small at 5.9 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, golden shiner and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",
