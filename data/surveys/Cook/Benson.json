Although most of the yellow perch collected were small, some fish as large as 11 inches were taken, and the lake offered some angling potential for those interested in fast yellow perch action.  No game fish and no panfish were collected.  Habitat in the lake was not well suited to panfish, and the only game fish species that might be found in the lake (a remote possibility) would be brook trout from the Kimball Creek system.</p>",
