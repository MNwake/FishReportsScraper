                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on August 2, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 1 station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including 6 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and 2 that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Little Rabbit Lake is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and is indicative of a healthy fish community.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Rabbit Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rabbit is a 170 acre lake located near Riverton in Crow Wing County.  The maximum depth is 30', with areas 15' deep or less covering 47% of the lake.  A public access is located on the eastern shore of the south basin.  Another access is located on the northern shore of the south basin.  A navigable channel also provides access from the Mississippi River.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 7.7/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 22.0\", with 29% at least 24\" in length.  Selective harvest of these larger pike will help maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in high numbers in gillnets (9.0/net), and average numbers in trapnets (3.6/net).  Average length was 7.0\" for gillnets, and 6.8\" in trapnets.  For both gears combined 31% were at least 8.0\" in length.  It takes 5-6 years of growth to produce a 10\" crappie in this lake.  Bluegills were captured in average numbers in trapnets at 19.3/net.  Average length was 6.3\", with 37% at least 7.0\" in length.  It takes 8-10 years to grow an 8\" bluegill in Little Rabbit. <br> \n <br> \nA spring nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted to sample largemouth bass.  Bass were caught at a rate of 41.2/ hr. of run time.  Average length was 12.4\", with largemouth bass over 12\" making up 54% of the catch.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers in gillnets at 1.3/net.  Average length was 13.4\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were sampled in Little Rabbit for the first time.   Catfish migrated to Little Rabbit from the Mississippi River where they are getting more numerous all the time.  Average length on the two fish sampled was 20.6\". <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Little Rabbit.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rabbit is a 170 acre lake located near Riverton in Crow Wing County.  There are public accesses located on the east and west sides of the lake.  Development is moderate, with about 9.5 homes/cabin per shoreline mile.  The lake has a maximum depth of 30 feet and about 47% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity, at 9.0 feet in '98, was typical for the area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sand and gravel.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of 12 feet in 1998.  Healthy aquatic plant communities are important.  Emergent species such as bulrush and cattail help regulate nutrient levels and often provide quality spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish species.  Submergent plant species provide food sources and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Little Rabbit was netted in 1998.  Catches were \"average,\" compared to similar type lakes, for most fish species.  Previous nettings were done in 1967 and 1982.  Northern pike is the primary gamefish present.  The catch rate in '98 was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Most pike sampled were from the 1996 year class and growth was good.  Only one largemough bass was captured in the '98 netting.  Bluegill was the most abundant panfish sampled.  The catch rate was in the \"average\" category.  Bluegills ranged in size from 3.0-10.4 inches and about 49% were at least 7.0 inches long.  Of the nine year classes sampled, the strongest was from 1994.  Growth was good.  Black crappie numbers were in the \"low\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Five crappies were caught and four age classes were represented.  Yellow perch is an important food source for the lake's gamefish.  The 1993 catch was in the \"low\" category when compared to similar type lakes but was similar to past catches in this lake.  Another forage species available to gamefish is the tullibee.  Tullibees were present in \"average\" numbers, ranged from 9-19 inches and averaged 15 inches and 1.5 lbs. in size.  A variety of other species were also sampled in '98 including white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, silver redhorse, bowfin, yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Rabbit Lake is a 172 acre lake located near Riverton in Crow Wing County.  Little Rabbit is part of the Mississippi River-Brainerd watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 30'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on 17 August 2016, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at five stations.  Five stations had heavy vegetation which would not allow for seining.  In total 24 species were sampled including Iowa Darter, blacknose shiner, blackchin shiner, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 07-12 July 2016 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Little Rabbit Lake.  <br> \n</p>",
