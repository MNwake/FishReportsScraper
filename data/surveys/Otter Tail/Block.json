Bluegill numbers are below both sets of medians. Northern pike numbers are above state net median and slightly below the local median. Northern pike sizes are desirable at this time with an average weight of 3 lbs.  Bluegill catch per net has declined dramatically since the 1976 survey with an increase in average weight per fish. Yellow perch numbers have significantly declined since 1976, but are still maintaining an adequate forage base. Walleye catch per net has increased and average weight per fish has decreased since 1976, which is probably due to the large percentage of age-I+ and II+ fish being sampled.  Walleyes have an extremely fast growth rate with an average length of 8.1 age II+.  Limited evidence of natural reproduction exists.</p>",

The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 23 feet; however, 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.0 to 9.8 feet.  Water clarity can diminish on this lake during the summer months due to algae blooms.   <br> \n     Shoreline development on Block Lake is moderate.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 6 along the north shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in various locations throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch and length data indicate that a moderately abundant Black Crappie population with a quality size structure exists in Block Lake.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 3.4 to 12.9 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches.  Forty percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length and 8% were 12.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch larger fish in the future.  <br> \n     Block Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n</p>",

Other area lakes in this class include: Buchanan, Elbow, Sand and Round. <br> \n     Test-netting data from this survey suggests that a partial winterkill may have occurred between 1986 and 1991. <br> \n     Northern pike were not sampled, even though the 1986 survey had 4.8 pike per gill net lift and showed consistent recruitment.  Also, 209 pounds of pike were stocked in 1989-1990.   <br> \n     Black bullhead abundance increased substantially from 25.8 per gill net lift in 1986 to 133.0, greatly exceeding the upper limit of the normal range for this lake class.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased slightly to 2.5 per trap net lift, but remains below the normal range.  All bluegills sampled were greater than seven inches in length.  There was no evidence of recent recruitment as the 1986 (age 5) year class was the youngest sampled.  Bluegill growth was average compared to statewide means.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance decreased from 5.2 per trap net lift in 1986 to 2.3, but remains in the normal range.  Crappie recruitment appears to be inconsistent as the 1988 (age 3) year class composed 82% of the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined dramatically from 51.5 per gill net lift in 1986 to 6.0, which is in the lower end of the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 8.8 per gill net lift in 1986 to 3.3, remaining within the normal range.  Average weight of individual walleye increased from 0.8 pounds in 1986 to 1.9 pounds.  Walleye growth rates are average compared to statewide means and recruitment appears to be consistent.  There is strong evidence of natural reproduction as walleyes from the 1986 and 1988 year classes were sampled, which corresponds to skip years in the stocking sequence.   <br> \n      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Block Lake is a 263-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles west of Parkers Prairie, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 23 feet; however, 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the2015 lake survey was 9.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.0 to 7.5 feet.  Water clarity can sometimes diminish on this lake during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.   <br> \n     Shoreline development on Block Lake is moderate.  A DNR owned public water access is located off of County Road 6 along the north shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent in various locations throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Block Lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill ; therefore, the fish populations have historically experienced large fluctuations in abundance.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 26.1 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The 2013 year class is strong and should provide good Walleye angling in the future.   <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.4 to 29.9 inches with an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      The Yellow Perch population is very abundant and has a good size structure.  Seventy-three percent of the perch were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     The Black Crappie population is also abundant and possesses a good size structure.  The 2011 year class is strong and should provide good angling for several years.  Crappies ranged in length from 9.8 to 11.1 inches with an average length and weight of 10.5 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at four years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Block Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch larger fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Block Lake is a 263-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 23 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Block lake is subject to winterkill during severe winters.  The shoreline length is 3.0 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 5.8 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 2.0 to 7.5 feet in previous lake surveys.  A DNR owned public water access is located on the north shoreline of the lake.     Development is low to moderate on Block Lake.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and you local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.     Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Some emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are prevalent at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.       A gill net assessment was conducted to evaluate the walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch populations.  A spring trapnetting assessment was also conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  These assessments documented good populations of walleye and black crappie in Block Lake.       The DNR stocks walleye fry into Block Lake on a biennial basis.  Age and catch data indicate that walleye fry stocking is producing good year classes.  The 1997 and 1999 year classes appear to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  The average length and weight of walleye was 16.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.     Suitable spawning habitat exists for black crappie to produce good year classes.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  The average length and weight of black crappie was 9.4 inches and 0.6 pound.     Northern pike are present; however, abundance appears to be low. Yellow perch and black bullheads are very abundant.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Block Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish in the future and provide anglers with opportunities to catch large fish.    </p>",
