                "narrative": "<p>Lake Beltrami (D.O.W. # 04-0135-00) is a 726-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located 10 miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for about 10 trucks/trailers located on the south shore of the lake off of HWY 71 on Lake Beltrami Road.  Lake Beltrami is managed for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Walleye and Northern Pike.  A special regulation for Northern Pike consisting of a protected slot limit from 24 to 36 inches and 1 fish allowed over 36 inches in the daily possession limit of 3 fish is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity).    Lake Beltrami is in lake class 25.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Beltrami and other class 25 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Turtle River Lake, Pimushe Lake and Lake Itasca. <br> \n <br> \nWhile Lake Beltrami has always been known as a good Largemouth Bass fishing lake, Smallmouth Bass have become well established over the past 20 years and now provide a good fishery as well.  Electrofishing conducted as part of the 2016 assessment resulted in similar catch rates for both species with Largemouth Bass up to 17.9 inches and Smallmouth Bass up to 19.4 inches in length captured.  Lake Beltrami currently provides a unique angling opportunity as one of the only lakes in the Bemidji area with a fishable Smallmouth Bass population.  However the species is now expanding and will likely eventually become established through the entire Turtle River and Cass Lake Chains of lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate of 16.44/trap net was similar to the median catch rate for class 25 lakes (17.25/trap net).  Bluegill were on the small side, with an average length of 5.47 inches.  Few fish over 8 inches in length were captured in this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was 1.33/gill net, which was lower than expected.  Walleye up to 24.21 inches were captured, with an average size of 17.67 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 2.89/gill net.  Northern Pike had a good average size of 24.07 inches and 2.91 lbs/fish, with pike up to 29.41 inches in length captured in the assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Perch and Bullhead species.  Although not captured, Muskellunge are known to inhabit the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 22.5 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 17.3?C (63.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1988-2013 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2006. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beltrami Lake is located about 8 miles northeast of Bemidji and is part of the Turtle River chain of lakes.  It is quite clear and has a well developed plant community and an irregular shoreline.  Walleye fry are stocked every third year.  Beltrami Lake was added to a group of lakes in the accelerated walleye program in 1999 to determine if a more aggressive stocking regime might improve the walleye population.  Natural reproduction for bass and panfish appears to have been highly successful in 1997 and 1998.Bluegill were sampled at the highest recorded catch rate since 1969, but still within the normal range for this lake type.  Average size is small but some quality size fish are available for anglers willing to search them out.The largemouth bass catch rate was the highest ever recorded also.  The average length sampled in 3 gear types was about 9.5 inches.  Clear water conditions may limit angling opportunities to dawn and dusk periods.Black crappie catch rate was about average for this lake type, but they can still be hard for anglers to target.  The 2000 catch rate was higher than in any previous survey, but the catch was composed primarily of crappies not yet recruited to the fishery.  The average size is small but some quality size fish are present.  They may be available seasonally to anglers willing to search for them.Though walleye fry (300,000) are stocked every third year (1997, 2000, 2003. . .) there appears to be substantial contribution from natural reproduction during most years.  The 2000 assessment captured walleye at well above the normal rate for this lake type, and at more than double the previous high.  Catch rate was also more than double the management plan goal.  Average weight has fluctuated, but has generally been close to a pound.  Average length of walleye was 14.8 inches with 11% of the sample more than 20 inches long.  Night-time electrofishing captured walleye at a catch rate of 61.5 per hour of on time.  Half of the walleye captured were young-of-the year which may have resulted from fry stocking, but most of the remaining sample appeared to be naturally reproduced yearlings.  Additional electrofishing is planned for 2001 and 2002 to further monitor natural reproductive success.Northern pike were sampled at the normal level for this lake type, but at the highest catch rate in the Beltrami Lake assessment history.  The average weight of 3.1 pounds in 2000 was above normal, but below the 1988 assessment average weight of 3.5 pounds.  About 6% of the pike captured in the gill nets were more than 30 inches long with the largest 35.6 inches.  The quality size of northern pike is unique in comparison to the majority of lakes in this area.  Of some concern is the decline in tullibee abundance.  Tullibee are a primary prey for large northern pike.  Hopefully, this is normal variability of dominant year classes and not a long-term declining trend in the tullibee population.  Beltrami Lake is open to gill net harvest of whitefish and tullibee, but the extent of harvest has never been documented.Yellow perch catch rate reached an all time high in Lake Beltrami but was only slightly above the normal level for this lake type.  Perch catch rates have fluctuated over the assessment history.  About 7% of the sample was more than eight inches long.  Some of the perch examined had Neascus.Brown and yellow bullheads were captured but were not abundant.  Dogfish and rock bass were common.Overall Beltrami Lake appears to be a very well balanced fish community, with quality sizes of fish from a variety of species available.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beltrami Lake is a 726-acre lake, located 10 miles north of Bemidji, MN. A targeted survey was completed on Beltrami Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during August of 2021 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 11 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites. A total of 21 species of fish were sampled, which included eight species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2021 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Beltrami Lake. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Beltrami Lake is in exceptional health with a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is located north of Bemidji and connected to the Turtle River chain in central Beltrami County.  Public access is located on the south shore of the lake at the end of Lake Beltrami Road Northeast. Lake Beltrami is managed primarily for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass with Walleye and Northern Pike managed as secondary species.  Special regulations are in effect for sunfish (daily limit of 5 fish) and Northern Pike (check the regulation booklet and/or signs at the public water access for the current regulation).  Statewide regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass were captured in strong numbers via night electrofishing. Both catch rates showed improvement from the previous survey. Largemouth Bass over 18 inches were measured and average size was just under 12 inches. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was just over 19 inches long. Both bass species appear to be thriving in Beltrami. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are abundant in Lake Beltrami with 192 captured during the survey.  Fish sizes appeared to improve slightly since the previous survey but would still be considered undersized by many anglers. There is a special regulation of five fish per day for Bluegills on Lake Beltrami. This is part of the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative which is aimed at preserving and potentially improving size structure of panfish populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 survey showed that Walleyes are currently at a low population density, although this remains consistent over the past decade. Walleye captured in 2021 had an average size of 20 inches in length and nearly three pounds. The largest fish captured was just under 26 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Northern Pike catch rate of about 6 fish per net was very close to average for Lake Beltrami. . Pike over 35 inches in length were captured and the average length was nearly 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were found in strong numbers with most of the catch less than 10 inches in length. The largest crappie in the survey was 12.8 inches. Crappies are generally not captured in high numbers during a standard lake survey. The smaller sizes and relatively high catch indicates a fairly young and robust population is present. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are present but none were captured during the 2021 survey. Angler reports suggest that the muskie population is doing well. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Beltrami is a 722-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located ten miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Lake Beltrami is one of eleven connected lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  There is a single lane, concrete boat ramp located on the south shore of the lake.  Most of the shoreline of the lake is privately owned and developed with a moderate number of lake homes and cabins.  The fish community of Lake Beltrami consists of panfish (including black crappie), northern pike, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, redhorse/sucker and bullhead species.  Beltrami, along with many of the lakes in the Turtle River chain, is managed with a special regulation for northern pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot limit).  The regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and improve the size structure of the population.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nLake Beltrami is a good multi-species fishery that has recently seen the addition of two newcomers: smallmouth bass and muskellunge.  These populations were likely introduced by members of the public, as they have not been captured in population assessments of other closely connected waters in the Turtle River chain.  DNR Fisheries would like to remind members of the public that transporting and stocking fish into public waters of the state is illegal.  Nevertheless, these species are now established and they have not gone unnoticed by local anglers and lakeshore residents.  An electrofishing assessment targeting smallmouth bass was conducted in May of 2011.  Fish over 18 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 13.4 inches.  Eight consecutive year classes of smallmouth bass were identified, indicating consistent natural reproduction.  Lake Beltrami is one of only two lakes in the area that contain a fishable population of smallmouth bass.  Despite Lake Beltrami's connectivity with the Turtle River chain, smallmouth bass have not been confirmed in other closely connected waters, although the potential for immigration into other lakes in the chain exists.  A 43-inch muskellunge was also captured in the 2011 population assessment, marking the first confirmed catch of muskellunge in Lake Beltrami, although reports from local anglers suggest that muskellunge have been present in Beltrami for some time. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rates declined to 1.1/GN in the 2011 assessment, which is below the first quartile value for lake class 25.  Fish up to 19 inches were captured.   A majority of walleye captured were from the 2007 year class (age-4), and these fish averaged 13.2 inches in length.  Hopefully recent walleye fry stockings will successfully recruit to the population and bolster numbers in the near future.  Walleye catch rates for Lake Beltrami have never been considered high for its lake class, but the lake has provided consistent walleye fishing opportunities over much of its management history. Lake Beltrami contains good walleye habitat in the form of shoreline points, steep drop-offs, and offshore humps and rock piles. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured in gill nets at 7.8/GN, which approaches the upper quartile value for class 25 lakes.  Average size was good at 23.1 inches and 2.8 lbs/fish.  Lake Beltrami has seen an improvement in the size structure of the pike population since the last assessment (2000).  The proportion of pike greater than 30 inches in length increased considerably, with pike up to 37 inches in length captured in the 2011 assessment.  Northern pike utilize a wide variety of habitat depending on the time of year, and Lake Beltrami contains good pike habitat such as deep basin areas, extensive aquatic vegetation and bulrush stands. <br> \n <br> \nAs with many lakes in the Turtle River chain, the bluegill population of Lake Beltrami has expanded over the course of historical assessments.  The 2011 bluegill trap net catch rate of 31.4/TN is well above the median value for class 25 lakes.  The bluegill catch was dominated by small and medium-size fish, and shows potential for providing some quality bluegill fishing in the near future.  Bluegill from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 year classes (ages 4-6) were well represented.  Age and growth data shows that Beltrami bluegill reach 8 inches in length at age-8.  In addition to bluegill, the 2011 population assessment yielded black crappie from 4 different year classes, which describes a rather diverse population for the Bemidji area.  Black crappie up to 11.3 inches were present.  As with bluegill, the 2011 black crappie sample was dominated by smaller fish.  The 2010 year class of black crappie (age-1), which were sampled in good numbers in other area lakes, were also very prevalent in Lake Beltrami.  These fish will grow to over 10 inches in length by age-5. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are a popular species on Lake Beltrami as well, but are not sampled effectively in standard population assessments and were not very catchable during the 2011 smallmouth bass assessment, which occurred prior to the peak of largemouth bass activity in the shallows.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beltrami lake is compared with other area class 25 lakes including: Turtle River lake, Movil, Pimushe, Big Moose, Gilstead and Itasca.    The northern pike population is high and the size range is good, with about half the pike between 17 and 21 inches in length. The largest pike captured was 34 inches in length. There appears to be good natural reproduction each year.    Walleye fry have been stocked into the lake during previous years including 1987, 1988, and 1992, however aging of these walleye suggests that natural reproduction may be occuring annually. The largest walleye sampled was 20.4 inches in length, but most walleye are between 13 and 19 inches in length. The population is slightly below average, when compared with the lakes listed above.   Largemouth bass have increased in numbers during the past few years, and the size is not bad, with the largest bass captured being about 15.5 inches and the average was 11.7 inches.    Black crappie have remained about the same size, as in previous surveys but we did not sample them in very high numbers. The largest crappie sampled was 10.0 inches and the average was 8.5 inches.    Bluegill have decreased somewhat from the previous assessment and are below average in numbers when compared to the other lakes, but the size is about average. The largest bluegill sampled was 8.4 inches and the average is 5.8 inches. The pumpkinseed population is low, but the fish are about the same size as bluegill. Rock bass are abundant, though the size is small, with an average of 5.0 inches.   Yellow perch were captured in low numbersand the weight is generally below average, however perch as large as 10.9 inches were sampled.   Tullibee capture rates are considerably below previous assessments.  </p>",
