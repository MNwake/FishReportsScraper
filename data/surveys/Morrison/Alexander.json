Night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring walleye fry stocking and determine the need for fry stocking the following spring.  If year class failure is evident from the fall electrofishing results, fry will again be stocked, otherwise a one year gap will be maintained between the stocked years.  The lake has a long history of walleye stocking with fingerlings being the primary source before the fry stocking began.  In 1995, the fish stocking method was switched to fry which occurs in odd numbered years and has proven to be an inexpensive way of providing a walleye fishery in the lake.  In the 2007 fall electrofishing effort, 386 young of the year walleye were netted for a catch rate of 702/hour which was by far the highest recorded since fry stocking began.  Many more young of the year walleye were observed but were unable to be netted.  A new electrofishing boat was used for the check which was likely more efficient than the previous boat. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing efforts in 2005 produced a catch of 75/hour but many more young of the year were also observed without begin netted.  The results was enough to satisfy the management stocking goal and fry stocking the following spring was not necessary.  Catch rates of 125/hour, 159/hour, and 104/hour were produced in 2003, 2001, and 1999, respectively.  Fall night electrofishing was also used in 1996 and 1994 to check for natural reproduction in Lake Alexander.  Walleye netted during those efforts came from stocked years suggesting that little or no natural reproduction was occurring in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSeventeen adult walleye along with two 17-inch muskellunge were also netted during the 2007 fall electrofishing.  The walleye ranged from 11 to 15 inches in length.  The two muskies were clipped which indicated they came from recent stocking.   Other fish species observed during the sampling effort were young of year yellow perch, spottail shiners, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and sunfish.</p>",

Fall night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring walleye fry stocking as well as natural reproduction.   Fry stocking every odd numbered year began in 1995 on Lake Alexander.  Night electrofishing was conducted 1994 and 1996 to check for the presence of natural reproduction and showed none.  Lake Alexander has extensive shoalwater habitat that appears to be suitable walleye spawning substrate but little natural reproduction has been documented.  The lake has a long history of walleye stocking with fingerlings as the primary source before fry stocking was initiated in 1995.  The current stocking regime is fry stocking two of three years. <br> \n <br> \nA new electrofishing boat obtained in 2007 has proven to be more efficient than the previous boat resulting in higher catch rates over-all.   Three electrofishing runs were completed in 2012 on mostly sand substrates for a total of 1.25 hours of on-time.  A total of 99 young of year walleye were captured for a catch rate of 78.4/hour.  This was well below the 165/hour in 2011, 388/hour in 2009, and 702/hour in 2007.     Prior to 2007, catch rates ranged from 20.7/hour (1997) to 159/hour (2001); however, fry survival has an influence on the catch rate as does boat efficiency.   <br> \n <br> \nSixteen adult walleye between 9.8 and 17.6 inches were also netted during the 2012 electrofishing effort.   Over half were between 11.0 and 12.5 inches (n=9) in length and likely from the 2011 fry stocking although none of the adult fish were aged.  Two smallmouth bass, 17.3-inches and 19.7-inches in length, were also netted and measured in the 2012 electrofishing runs.  Other fish species observed while electrofishing included yellow perch, sunfish, largemouth bass, rock bass, and shiners.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan for Lake Alexander was updated to stock fry in two out of three years.   In the past, if a year class failure was evident from the electrofishing results, fry would be stocked the following spring, otherwise a one year gap will be maintained between the stocked years.  No extra spring fry stocking has occurred following the results from any of the fall electrofishing in the past.   <br> \n <br> \nThese high electrofishing catch rates have not translated into correspondingly high gill net catch rates, though anglers have noted the presence of strong year classes of walleye matching the stocking efforts.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A spring Muskellunge assessment was conducted in early May using large-frame trap nets on Lake Alexander to evaluate both the Muskellunge and Northern Pike populations.  A Muskellunge population estimate was desired to help plan for future management.   Lake Alexander has a pike regulation that prohibits harvest of fish between 24 and 36 inches in length while allowing one over 36 inches in possession.  Twelve trap nets were set in the lake over a two day period due to ice and strong winds.  Two of the net locations were new while the remaining ten sets were in historical locations.  Strong winds, shifting ice, and floating bog created issues several days and affected the catchability of some nets by knocking them down.  A total of 162 set days were recorded with the twelve nets over a sixteen day period. <br> \n <br> \nAll Muskellunge were measured with most also weighed the first week to check condition.  Scales were collected from Muskellunge under 38\" (to check for natural reproduction) as well as Northern Pike.  Both esocid species were given fin clips to aid in identifying recaptures and help facilitate the calculation of a population estimate for the Muskellunge.   Recaptured Muskellunge and pike were re-measured and sexed but not included in the length frequency distribution.  Thirteen Muskellunge were captured more than once along with 25 Northern Pike.  There was an additional three days of electrofishing after the nets were pulled to increase  the sample size for the population estimate. <br> \n <br> \nA summer gill net survey was scheduled for Alexander in August of 2014. No aging structures were taken from Walleye during the Muskellunge assessment since they typically are sampled adequately in summer gillnets and otoliths can be extracted for more accurate aging.  All gamefish were measured in the Muskellunge assessment along with Black Crappie and Bluegill.         <br> \n <br> \nA total of 107 Muskellunge were captured in the 2014 spring assessment compared to 194 muskellunge in 2010. The 2008 assessment netted only 81 muskellunge while 163 muskellunge were caught in the 2004 assessment.   The highest catch came in the 2001 spring assessment when 260 fish were netted.  One hundred eight (108) Muskellunge were caught in 1998 while earlier assessments in 1996 and 1994, when adult fish were few, had catches of 80 and nine, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing was conducted over a three day period four days after the trap net assessment concluded.   Few Muskellunge were caught on any one day and a larger sample was desired for a population estimate.   A total of 22 fish were caught over the time period which ranged from 31 to 47.5 inches in length.  Eight of the fish had been marked during the trap net assessment.  The population estimate of adult Muskellunge over 30 inches for 2014 was 361 fish using the modified Schnabel Estimate (95% CL = 248 - 611).   The estimate was below the lake management goal of an adult population between 400 and 500 fish.  Population estimates in both 2010 (n=642) and 2001 (n=571) were above the management goal while the 2004 estimate of 492 adult fish was within the goal.   See (Table 1: Alexander MUE Assessments) <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2014 assessment show that the proportion and number of Muskellunge exceeding 40 inches, 48 inches, and 50 inches has been increasing.   The proportion of females exceeding 45 inches in the last three assessments, 2014 (83%; n=25), 2010 (75%; n=44), 2008 (70%; n=14) were all more than twice the lake management goal of having at least 30% of the females in a spring assessment more than 45 inches in length.  The first fifty-inch Muskellunge (6.5%; n=4) were recorded in the 2004 spring assessment.  Another one was not caught until the 2010 assessment, while in 2014, eleven (37%) of the fish were more than 50 inches in length.  The presence of fish over 50 inches has made Lake Alexander a destination lake for anglers looking for trophy size fish. Legal size was raised Statewide to 54 inches in 2015.     <br> \n <br> \nScales were collected from eight Muskellunge 40 inches or less in length.   One fish was Age six, six Age eight, and one Age nine.  All age groups corresponded with fingerling or yearling stocking years although half the fish had no discernible stocking clip.  Several of the larger Muskellunge also had no discernible stocking clip suggesting some natural reproduction may be occurring.      <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in the 2014 spring assessment totaled 440 fish between 13.2 and 35.1 inches in length with a mean length of 21.1 inches.  The 2014 sample size structure displayed a decline in quality when compared to the 2010 results.   In the 2010 spring assessment, 265 Northern Pike between 11.1 and 39.4 inches were netted.   Not only did two of the pike exceed 36 inches in length, there was a much higher mean length for the total sample, 26 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches comprised only 20% (n=88) of the 2014 catch while in 2010 it was 63% (n=166).  Fish more than 30 inches in length accounted for 6% (n=26) of the 2014 sample compared to 18% (n=49) in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nThe intent of the Northern Pike regulation was to increase the pike population size structure quality.  Goals of the regulation was to have a spring pike catch where 50% of the fish exceeded 24 inches with at least 5% of the fish exceeding 36 inches.  Results from the 2010 spring assessment suggested that twenty-four inch goal was attainable and pike exceeding 36 inches were present as two (0.7%) 36-inch plus fish were sampled in the assessment.  Intensive netting on many regulation lakes indicated 5% of pike exceeding 36 inches is unrealistic. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to the 2003 regulation implementation six spring assessments had been conducted, however, the highest pike catch was 198 fish in 1996.   Northern Pike exceeding 24 inches comprised significant portions of the pre-regulation catches.   Percentages of 24-inch plus pike ranged from 26% to as much as 51% of the catches.   Additionally, there were 36-inch plus fish sampled prior to the regulation; the largest at 43-inches.  While the regulation does not appear to have increased the number of Northern Pike exceeding 36 inches, there does appear to be more fish over 30 inches in the population since the regulation was enacted.    See (Table 2: Alexander - NOP   (Muskellunge and Spring community assessments) <br> \n <br> \nAges two through ten were represented in the 2014 Muskellunge assessment pike catch suggesting consistent recruitment.   Three year classes made significant contributes to the pike sample, 2011 (24%), 2010 (29%), and 2009 (27%).  Female pike grew an average of 2.1 to 6 inches longer than males of the same age. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye was the most abundant species caught in the 2014 spring assessment; however, the fish were not marked for identification so some were likely recaptures.  A total of 916 Walleye; a record high; were caught that ranged from 13.8 to 29.7 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 19.9 inches with a modal length of 17 - 18 inches.  As indicative to the time of year, medium and large fish comprised most of the catch.  Walleye between 17 and 20 inches accounted for 42% (n=381) of the sample while an additional 42% (n=384) of the fish were more than 20 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther spring assessment Walleye catches have ranged from 45 fish in 1995 to 574 fish in 2010.   Assessments using the large frame trap nets were generally more effective at sampling Walleye compared to the standard lake survey trap nets.  Large frame trap net catches averaged 447 Walleye compared to 222 for the smaller trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile the 2014 summer gill nets did not catch as many Walleye as the 2014 spring assessment, the gill net catch was a significant increase in numbers when compared to the 2010 gill net catch.  The 7.9/gill net catch (n=119) in 2014 was a significant increase from the 2010 Walleye catch of 4.7/gill net (n=71).  The 2014 summer gill net catch remained within lake class interquartiles of 4 - 9.6/gill net and was at the lake management goal of a gill net catch from 8 to 12 Walleye per gill net.    <br> \n <br> \nCaught in the 2014 summer survey were Walleye between 11.8 and 27.1 inches of length with a mean length of 18.1 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 16 - 17 inches.  Fish between 12 and 20 inches of length accounted for 68% (n=81) of the sample which surpassed the management goal of at least 30 to 40% of the summer gill net catch between 12 and 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring Muskellunge or ice-out assessments can provide an excellent opportunity to collect additional data on Black Crappie populations in a lake.  The 2014 Muskellunge assessment sampled 284 crappie between 4.6 and 14.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 10.9 inches with a modal length of 12 - 13 inches.  Netting results suggest that Lake Alexander has a quality crappie fishery as 73% (n=209) of the fish caught exceeded ten inches in length with 35% (n=99) more than twelve inches.   Black Crappie catches have ranged from 16 to 496 fish in the nine spring assessments for Muskellunge and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill have also been observed in the early spring assessments with the highest catch of 1,686 fish in April 2010.  The 2014 Muskellunge assessment netted 237 Bluegill ranging from 3.4 to 8.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the 2014 sample was 6.3 inches and modal length 7.5 - 8 inches.  Thirty-nine percent (n=93) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 5% (n=13) more than eight inches in length.  Lengths in the 2010 spring assessment were a subsample due to the high catch.  Despite the high numbers, mean length for sample was 6.7 inches.  Modal length in 2010 was slightly shorter, 7 - 7.5 inches, when compared to 2014, but an estimated 45% (n=752) of the fish exceeded seven inches with about 2% (n=40) more than eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass were caught in the 2014 Muskellunge assessment.  Largemouth Bass was the more abundant of the two species with 26 caught compared to only six Smallmouth Bass.  Fish up 17.4 inches were measured in the Largemouth Bass sample while Smallmouth Bass up 18.2 inches were measured.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species caught in the 2014 Muskellunge assessment included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Common Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.   Rock Bass were the most abundant of the non-target species with 523 fish netted.  Several Yellow Perch were measured to document the range of sizes.  The majority of perch were between 5.5 and 7 inches in length. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. The lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 64 feet, and a littoral area of 842 acres. It has been primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge. Night electrofishing in fall has been used to evaluate the success of spring Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n  <br> \nThe lake has a long history of Walleye stocking primarily with fingerlings until 1995, when fry stocking was initiated. Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 in Lake Alexander.  Fry stocking occurred in odd numbered years from 1995 to 2011. The management plan changed in 2014 to annual fry stocking at alternating rates.  In even number years the lake has been stocked with 2,500,000 fry and in odd number years 1,250,000 fry.  No Walleye were stocked in 2020 due to work restrictions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. <br> \n  <br> \nSix electrofishing stations were sampled to evaluate Walleye natural reproduction. Three new stations were added as part of a research study to examine the impacts of Zebra Mussels on juvenile Walleye.   A total of 49 young of year (YOY) Walleye were captured in two hours of on-time for a catch rate of 24.5 fish/hour.  The catch rate from the three historical stations was 46 per hour.  YOY Walleye ranged from 5.71 to 7.64 inches in length and averaged 6.85 inches.  The 2020 catch rate was lower than most previous efforts following fry stocking efforts, although similar to the 42 per hour observed in 2019.  It is hoped that these modest year classes and natural reproduction provide significant contributions to the fishery. These results indicate further analysis of natural reproduction should be initiated by adjusting stocking schedules and continuing fall electrofishing assessments in both stocked and non-stocked years.  Historically, fall electrofishing catch rates of YWAE have been a good predictor of future year classes in summer gillnet surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThirteen yearling and adult Walleye were also netted during the electrofishing runs. These Walleye ranged from 9.69 to 17.95 inches with a mean length of 13.47 inches. Three Muskellunge were sampled ranging from 17.68 to 26.38 inches.  Two were yearlings stocked as fingerlings in 2019 and one was stocked as a three year old in 2017.  All three fish retained PIT tags implanted at time of stocking. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is one of the most popular lakes in Morrison County.  Besides being a scenic, clear-water lake, the lake has some excellent fish populations both in numbers and size.  Alexander has abundant offshore structure and a reputation for better angling success at night or on overcast days.  Aquatic vegetation grow out to depths of 20 feet with coontail, northern water milfoil, and bushy pondweed being the most common species.  The lake supports three resorts and has three public accesses.  Thoroughfare Creek connects Alexander to Fish Trap Lake.     Walleye numbers were average when compared to lakes similar to Alexander, but showed a decline from the last survey and fell below management goals.  Good numbers of 14 - 16 inch walleyes should be available to anglers with some fish over ten pounds present.  Lake Alexander's northern pike population displayed twodesirable characteristics, low numbers and above average size.  Low pike abundance ensures a healthy fish community, promotes fast growth rates and potential for trophy size fish.  Muskellunge were first stocked in Alexander in 1988 and have since become increasingly popular as a species sought by anglers.  Some of the earliest stocked fish are now over 44 inches and 25 pounds.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in good numbers.  While the average size was nine to twelve inches, some trophy size bass are present.       An important component of the fish community is the yellow perch population.  Perch abundance has increased significantly since 1994 which may be a response to the lower walleye and northern pike numbers.  As a principal prey species for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge, yellow perch are important for maintaining good growth rates of gamefish.       Panfish species in Lake Alexander include black crappies, bluegills, and pumpkinseeds.  Most of the panfish tend to be small by anglers standards, but some sunfish over seven inches and crappies over ten inches can be found.  Crappies provide a popular winter and spring fishery on the lake.  Northern cisco ortullibee numbers were low when compared to lakes similar to Alexander, while white sucker abundance appeared normal for the lake.  Tullibee and suckers provide an additional food source for large predators.  Other species in the fish community included yellow and brown bullheads, bowfin, and rock bass.     Releasing larger northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye is encouraged to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Proper land use practices are also encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and improve the water quality in Lake Alexander.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Lake Alexander July 11-13 of 2018 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted August 20-24.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 24 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.   Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.   The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.  Alexander Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 2 for comparative scoring and evaluation.  FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 70, above both the impairment threshold of 45 and the excellent threshold of 64 for FIBI Tool 2.   These results indicate that Lake Alexander is in exceptional health based on the FIBI score which is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  Ten of these species are considered intolerant of habitat disturbance and three (3) are considered tolerant.  Spottail Shiners and Bluntnose Minnows were the most abundant species captured in nearshore sampling.   Bluegill were the most abundant species in the gill nets followed by Yellow Perch.  Walleye and Smallmouth Bass were the two species accounting for the most biomass in the gill nets.  Bluegill were the most numerous species in the trap nets and also comprised the highest proportion of the biomass. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>BOWFIN were present at above average catch rates.  NORTHERN CISCO catches were low.  NORTHERN PIKE have increased 1.75 times the 1980 catch rate due to high water creating more spawning sites.  The average size of 2.7 pounds is unchanged from the 1980 survey.  The 5.73 northerns per gillnet lift is below local averages and at a good level.  WHITE SUCKERS are present at less than one-half state averages for gillnets and trapnets.  YELLOW BULLHEADS are the dominant bullheads and are present at nearly 14 times the statewide average for gillnets and average over 3/4 pound each.  Trapnet catches were less dramatic (1.3 X statewide average).  BLACK and BROWN BULLHEADS are low in number and large in size.  ROCK BASS numbers are above the state average, but are average when compared to previous surveys on the lake.  HYBRID SUNFISH are present in low numbers.  GREEN SUNFISH are present.  PUMPKINSEEDS are common and of average size.  BLUEGILLS are 3.6 times the state average number and below average in size.  SMALLMOUTH BASS are present at over 5 times the statewide average number but only 3 times the average size (average length was 8.5\").  LARGEMOUTH BASS are present at twice the statewide average and are of above average size.  BLACK CRAPPIES are present in above average numbers and size.  YELLOW PERCH abundance was low in the gillnet catches compared to previous years, but they were abundant in the natural reproduction checks.  WALLEYE are present at over twice the number and three times the weight compared to statewide averages.  In six years of trying, not one naturally reproduced walleye has been found.  Stocking was changed to 2 pounds per littoral acre (1,700 pounds) in 1983 with a minimum number of 20,000 walleyes stocked annually.  The largest walleyes available in sufficient numbers are used to stock this lake each year.  67,475 walleyes were stocked between 1980 and 1984 compared to 258,625 walleyes stocked between 1975 and 1979.  The size of the walleyes stocked in the most recent 5 year period was much larger than in the past.  So with no natural reproduction, the addition of a large new public access and considerable new shoreland development, it was surprising to see an increase in the catch per gillnet lift (6.60 in 1980 to 7.67 in 1985).  This may show the effectiveness of larger fingerlings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A muskellunge assessment was conducted in early April of 2010.  The assessment was moved up a year to coincide with a summer population assessment and obtain a muskellunge population estimate.  The last muskellunge assessment in 2008 lasted only a week due to late ice-out and produced low catches of both muskellunge and other gamefish.  Ten (10) large 5'x6' frame trap nets were set in historical muskellunge capture locations.  The 2010 assessment had 156 LTN lifts which was similar to the 2004 assessment (151 LTN lifts) while the 2008 assessment had 44 LTN lifts.  Ice-out on the lake was April 1 and nets were set by April 5.  Northern pike were also targeted in an effort to gather data to evaluate the Experimental Regulation for the species.  The regulation, implemented in 2003, requires the release of all pike between 24\" and 36\" with one over 36\" allowed in possession.  Length frequency information was also desired for walleye to evaluate the adult population.  All adult muskellunge (n=187) were marked using a partial clip of the left pectoral fin to facilitate the calculation of a population estimate.  Electrofishing was used as the recapture method.  Muskellunge recaptured during the netting period were not included in the length frequency reporting.  A total of 26 muskellunge were recaptured during the netting period (18 males and 8 females). \t <br> \n <br> \nScales were taken from muskellunge under 38\" to check for natural reproduction.  Scales and anal spines were collected from a subsample of 50 male and 50 female northern pike since summer gillnets sometimes produce lower than desired aging samples.  A summer gill net survey was scheduled for Alexander in August of 2010.  No aging structures were taken from walleye during the muskellunge assessment since they typically are sampled adequately in summer gillnets and otoliths can be extracted for more accurate aging.  All gamefish were measured in the muskellunge assessment along with the majority of black crappie.  Bluegill were subsampled due to their large sample size.  \t <br> \n <br> \nA total of 194 muskellunge were captured in the 2010 muskellunge assessment or 1.2/LTN.  The 2008 assessment netted only 81 muskellunge (1.8/LTN) while the 2004 assessment sampled 163 muskellunge (1.1/LTN).  The highest muskellunge catch was in 2001 when 260 fish were netted for a catch rate of 6.5/TN.  One hundred eight (108) muskellunge were caught in 1998 (1.1/LTN) while earlier assessments in 1996 and 1994, when adult fish were few, had catches of 80 and nine, respectively.  The population estimate of adult muskellunge over 30 inches for 2010 was 642 fish which was above the lake management goal of an adult population between 400 and 500 fish.  The population estimate for 2001 (n=571) was also above the management goal while the 2004 estimate of 492 adult fish was within the management goal.  The number of muskunge per acre in 2010 was ~0.23 adults/acre compared to ~0.25 adults/acre in native muskellunge lakes. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2010 assessment show that the proportion and number of muskellunge exceeding 40 inches and 48 inches has been increasing.  The proportion of females exceeding 45 inches in 2010 was more than twice the lake management goal of having at least 30% of the females in the spring assessment more than 45 inches in length.  The presence of fish over 48 inches makes Lake Alexander a destination lake for anglers looking for legal size fish. <br> \n <br> \nAges 2, 3, and 6 through 10 were represented in the aged muskellunge sample.  Several of the fish appear to be from natural reproduction as they correspond with non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nTwo hundred sixty-six (266) northern pike were netted in the 2010 muskellunge assessment.  The 2008 assessment captured 160 pike while the 2004 assessment captured 1054 northern pike.  The sample size structure in the 2010 assessment was the most desirable of the three assessments.  The pike measured from 11.1 to 39.4 inches in length with a mean length of 26 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 63% (n=168) of the catch with 18% (n=49) more than 30 inches and 0.7% (n=2) over 36 inches in length.  Pike in the 2008 assessment were up to 33.9 inches in length with a mean length of 23 inches.  In the 2004 assessment, fish up to 34.7 inches were measured and mean length was only 21 inches.  Thirty-nine percent (n=62) of the 2008 sample exceeded 24 inches with 4% (n=6) over 30 inches.  Only 17% (n=177) of the pike in the 2004 assessment were more than 24 inches in length and one fish exceeded 30 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe female pike outnumbered the males three to one in the 2010 assessment.  In 2008, the males outnumbered the females 1.2 to one and in 2004 the females outnumbered the males almost two to one.  The results from the 2010 assessment met the lake management and regulation goal of having at least 50% of the spring trap net catch exceeding 24 inches but was short of the goal of at least 5% of the sample over 36 inches in length.  The 2010 assessment was the first assessment since the implementation of the regulation and since a northern pike assessment in 1995 to capture pike exceeding 36 inches in length.  Spring trap nets show a possible effect of the experimental regulations with the increase in mean size,  the increase of fish in the slot, and the increase in fish over 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAges 2 through 11 were represented in the 2010 female pike sample and ages 3 through 10 in the male sample.  Females age 2 through 6 and 8 displayed fast growth and age 7 normal growth while males age 3 through 5 and 7 displayed normal growth and ages 6 and 8 slow growth.  The female northern pike grew from 2 to 8 inches longer than males of the same age.  A strong year class from 2005 accounted for 22% of the northern pike total catch while two year classes from 2006 and 2007 accounted for 18% and 15%, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 summer survey gill nets sampled 49 northern pike between 15 and 31.5 inches in length.  The gill net catch (3.3/GN) was a significant increase from the 2006 catch rate of 1.7/GN (26/GN) and fell within the lake class 22 interquartile range of 3 - 7.9/GN.   When compared to the earlier spring results, the gill net catch was unimpressive.  The fish measured from 15 to 31.5 inches in length with a mean length of 22.7 inches.  About a third (33%) of the pike (n=16) exceeded 24 inches but only 8% (n=4) were more than 30 inches in length.  The size structure of the 2006 gill net catch was more desirable.  The twenty-six pike caught measured from 13.7 to 34.7 inches in length with a mean length of 24 inches.  Fifty percent (50%) of the fish (n=13) exceeded 24 inches in length and 15% (n=4) were over 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 muskellunge assessment caught a record number of walleye (n=574).  The 2004 assessment also caught over 500 walleye (n=525) while the short netting period in 2008 produced a catch of only 59 walleye.  Medium size fish dominated the catch as more than half (56%; n=321) of the walleye in the 2010 catch were between 15 and 21 inches in length.  With fish up 29.6 inches measured, mean length was 20.8 inches and modal length 17 - 18 inches.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 49% (n=283) of the sample.  The muskellunge assessment in 2004 also measured walleye over 29 inches in length but mean length was 22.2 inches and modal length 23 - 24 inches.  Seventy percent (70%) of the walleye (n=366) were more than 20 inches in length.  Walleye in the 2008 assessment measured up to 27.5 inches with a mean length of 21 inches.  Modal length was 23 - 24 inches and 64% (n=38) of the fish were over 20 inches.  The male walleye outnumbered the females 1.3 to one in 2010, 1.2 to one in 2008, while in 2004 the females outnumbered the males 1.4 to one. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch (4.7/GN) in 2010 was comparable to the 2006 gill net catch (4.9/GN) and within the lake class interquartile range of 4 - 9.6/GN.  The 2010 catch rate was rather disappointing after having a record catch of walleye in the spring muskellunge assessment.  The lake management goal was to have a gill net catch between 8 to 12 walleye per gill net.  The 2010 catch rate was also the lowest catch to date since the record catch of 21.9/GN in 1957.  The fish in the 2010 summer survey measured from 7.4 to 28.4 inches in length with a mean length of 17.7 inches.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 34% (n=24) of the sample.  Medium size fish dominated the catch as 65% (n=46) of the fish were between 12 and 20 inches which surpassed the lake management goal of having 30 - 40% of the gill net fish between 12 and 20 inches.  Medium size fish also dominated the 2006 walleye sample.  Fish up to 28.8 inches were measured but the mean length was 16.7 inches.  Just over half of the fish (51%; n=37) were between 12 and 20 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 muskellunge assessment provided a good sample size of black crappie and strong evidence that the lake continues to support a high quality crappie population.  A total of 266 black crappie between 4.4 and 15.6 inches were netted.  Mean length was 10.7 inches and modal length 11 - 11.5 inches.  Seventy-two percent (72%) of the fish (n=190) were more than ten inches in length and 26% (n=68) were over 12 inches.  The short period in 2008 caught only 84 black crappie.  The size structure of the sample was impressive.  Crappie up to 14.2 inches were measured with a mean length of 11.1 inches.  Modal length was 12 - 13 inches and 69% (n=58) were more than ten inches with 48% (n=40) over 12 inches in length.  The muskellunge assessment in 2004 caught the most black crappie, 498 fish between 4.4 and 14.1 inches in length.  The mean length was small at 9.7 inches, but the modal length was 12 - 13 inches.  Crappies over ten inches accounted for 49% (n=245) of the sample with 26% (n=131) more than 12 inches in length.  Although the proportion of crappie over ten inches was smaller in the 2004 muskellunge assessment, due to the sample size, there was a greater number of larger fish than in the other two assessments.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskie assessments have also provided some good catches of bluegill.  Almost 1700 (n=1686) bluegill were netted in the 2010 muskellunge assessment.  Due to the large sample size, only 37% of the fish were measured.  The bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 6.7 inches.  Based on the fish that were measured, 45% of the bluegill were more than seven inches in length possibly indicating improvement in size structure.  The bluegill catch in the 2008 muskellunge assessment was much lower, with 203 fish being caught.  The fish ranged from 3.7 to 7.8 inches in length with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  Smaller bluegill dominated the sample as only 25% of the fish were more than seven inches.  The 2004 muskellunge assessment also caught numerous bluegill (n=967) which were from 3.4 to 7.7 inches in length.  Size structure of the sample was disappointing considering the time of year.  Mean length was 5.8 inches and 10% (n=54) of the 550 bluegill measured were more than seven inches in length.  The largest bluegill caught in the 2010 summer survey was about eight inches, but the mean length was closer to five inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catches have been variable in the muskellunge assessments.  The 2010 assessment netted 53 bass between 8.4 and 17.1 inches with a mean length of 14.6 inches.  The assessments in 2008 and 2004 had catches of 11 and 168 bass, respectively.   Mean length of the bass in 2008 was 13.8 inches, while in 2004 the mean length was 12.2 inches.  The 2010 assessment had one of the better catches of smallmouth bass with 18 fish.  No smallmouth bass were caught in 2008, while the 2004 assessment netted 15 bass.  Mean length was about 15 inches in both 2010 and 2004. <br> \n <br> \nConditions were right in the 2010 assessment to catch panfish as record numbers of pumpkinseed (n=649), rock bass (n=789), and hybrid sunfish (n=472) were caught.  Other fish species netted in the 2010 assessment included bowfin, green sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nWeather and water temperature have been major factors in the length of the netting period.  In 2010, the water temperature warmed steadily throughout the assessment and no cold snaps occurred.  The nets were pulled when the muskellunge catch dropped and ripe/spent females were being caught.  2008 was a year with late ice-out due to a colder than normal spring.  The ice went out a week before fishing opener which shortened the netting period.  Ice went out early in 2004, but cold fronts and strong winds slowed fish movement.  In 2001, the weather was warm with light winds and it took less than a week to catch 260 muskellunge.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,730-acre lake located in northwestern Morrison County near the village of Cushing. It's one of the most popular lakes in the area due to its size, clear water and scenic surroundings. The lake supports a diverse fish community and offers angling opportunities for a variety of gamefish. Walleye is the primary species of management, with secondary species Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass . Angler reports of catching trophy-sized fish in a variety of species is not uncommon. Recent and past surveys confirm the presence of Walleyes over 28 inches, Muskellunge over 50 inches and Smallmouth Bass up to 20 inches. A special Northern Pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which requires the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession. The objective of the regulation is to improve the pike population size structure. State-owned, concrete public accesses are available on the east and west ends of the lake with.  A third public access owned by the township is located on the south side of the lake. Residential development is modest to heavy although there are several stretches of shoreline that are still natural, free of human development. Eurasian watermilfoil, an invasive aquatic plant is present in the lake making watercraft inspection extra critical when leaving your access point. Additionally, two Zebra mussels were discovered in 2018. An official listing as an infested water is likely forthcoming.    <br> \n   <br> \nStandardized surveys are designed to provide a representative picture of the fish community. Data from our 2018 survey, can be compared to past surveys in order to draw a reasonably accurate picture of the overall fishery. We observed a Walleye population that is stable, having changed very little in the past 20 years., The population is consistently comprised of fish in the 15-25 inch range. From an angling standpoint, Alexander has abundant underwater structure and a reputation for good Walleye fishing, particularly at night. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is low, which is beneficial to the entire fish community. Because pike are voracious predators and opportunistic spawners, they can overpopulate which is detrimental to prey species abundance. Lake Alexander demonstrates the ability to grow large pike, with a healthy forage base of Yellow Perch and Ciscoes. There may be the potential to produce a high quality pike fishery, if angler compliance with the special regulation is high. We will continue to monitor pike to determine if the regulation is achieving the outcome for which it was intended. <br> \n <br> \nWhen it comes to Smallmouth Bass, Alexander is better than average compared to other Todd and Morrison County lakes similar in character. Surveys consistently sample good numbers of Smallmouth ranging in the 16-18 inch range. Largemouth Bass size-quality is similar and with clear water and diverse plant communities, shallow bay-areas and steep weedlines provide numerous opportunities for various angling presentations.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge fingerling stocking is completed annually on Lake Alexander. Netting for adult fish occurs every four years in the spring soon after ice-out.  At this time, it appears that the proportion of the fishery measuring from 42-50 inches is increasing. This is good news for muskie anglers as it indicates a strong potential for continued recruitment of fish to trophy-size.  <br> \n <br> \nCiscoes are coldwater fish present in Lake Alexander. They're an indicator species since they're usually found in lakes with high water quality. Ciscoes are declining in many lakes due to climate change and nutrient runoff. The greatest period of stress occurs in late summer when oxy-thermal habitat is most limited. Summer oxy-thermal habitat is found at mid-lake depths where the temperature is below 70 degrees and dissolved oxygen is adequately present. Hotter, longer summers coupled with high nutrient runoff can put the squeeze on this deeper layer of oxy-thermal habitat Ciscoes depend on.  Since Ciscoes demonstrate some resilience to warmer water temperatures, farmers, lakeshore residents, townships, counties and other stakeholders are encouraged  to minimize nutrient runoff by not using fertilizers and adopt shoreline vegetative buffer strips or cover crops as the situation pertains. In the end, water quality and fish habitat can be maintained for Ciscoes and other species if we work together.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. The lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 64 feet, and a littoral area of 842 acres. The primary management species is Walleye. Secondary management species include Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. The Walleye population on Lake Alexander is managed through annual stocking of 2,500,000 fry. This stocking strategy has maintained a population that sustains a very good recreational fishery. Recent documentation of a significant natural year class (2020) when no stocking occurred due to COVID19 shutdowns may lead to future adjustments to stocking strategies to allow assessment of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing in the fall has been used to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance from spring fry stocking or natural reproduction since 1994. Fall electrofishing in 2023 was completed on September 19, to assess Walleye fry stocking survival. For the first time, electrofishing efforts failed to document the presence of young of the year Walleye following a fry stocking. Prior to 2023, the 2022 fall electrofishing catch rate (8.5/hour) of young of the year Walleye was the lowest rate observed on Lake Alexander in a fry stocked year. Catch rates in prior fall assessments ranged from 21.4/hour (1997) to 733.1/hour (2007) with a median catch rate of 114.0/hour. Catch rates in the last four fall assessments have been at or below the 1st quartile (34.0/hour) established from previous assessments on the lake. The fall 2020 catch of young of the year Walleye (24.5/hour) was the highest catch rate observed for naturally produced fish. These results indicate further analysis of natural reproduction should be continued by adjusting stocking schedules and continuing fall electrofishing assessments in both stocked and non-stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, fall electrofishing catch rates of juvenile Walleye have been a good predictor of future year class strength in summer gill net surveys. Analysis of fall electrofishing catches showed that, in general, high fall catch rates have typically corresponded with higher catches in future gill net surveys. Low fall catch rates, however, do not always signify poor year classes as represented by future gill net catches. Fall catch rates as low as 21.0/hour have been well represented in future gill net surveys above the third quartile (2.3/net). Other years with low fall electrofishing catch rates produced significant year classes of more than 1.5/gill net. Due to low catch rates in the last four fall young of the year assessments a decision was made to stock 10,943 Walleye fingerlings (981 pounds). Mixing fry and fingerling stocking in 2023 will confound analysis of future gill net catches of this year class although it will probably be assumed, right or wrong, that fish came from fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNine Walleyes were sampled during the survey ranging from 9.7 to 17.8 inches in total length. Seven yearlings were sampled and averaged 10.4 inches in total length. Catch rate of yearling Walleye was 5.6/hour. Juvenile and adult Yellow Perch were present in good numbers as were Shiner species.  Various sunfish species were abundant at some sites and some Bluegill approaching 8 inches were observed. Largemouth, Smallmouth, and Rock Bass were also common.  A few Northern Pike and adult White Suckers were observed. The electrofishing crew observed that electrofishing stations appeared to contain good habitat conditions for juvenile Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on selective net catch data and ecological lake classification, the fish population of Lake Alexander can be characterized as follows:The WALLEYE population is high and mean size is large at 2.18 pounds.  The population shows no \"real\" increase since the previous assessment in 1985 and mean size has not changed.  Age groups I through IX are represented by aging data and all groups display normal growth rates.  The lake is stocked annually with fingerlings resulting in the consistent year classes present.  Intensive natural reproduction checks were conducted in 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1990.  These efforts failed to show young of the year walleye.  1982 was a blank stocking year.NORTHERN PIKE numbers have remained stable since 1985.  The population is average in numbers and mean size is large at 3.43 pounds.  Mean size in 1985 was 2.73 pounds.  All age groups I through VIII are present. Growth rates are normal for age groups III through VIII, while fast growth is evident in age groups I and II.The LARGEMOUTH BASS net catch is the highest recorded in any survey and has increased five-fold since 1985.  Mean size is small at only 0.18 pounds and the median length group is 6.0-6.4 inches.  Age group I comprised 82% of the catch resulting in the small average size.  Normal growth is characteristic of all age groups present (I through V).  Small fish also dominated the catch in 1985 as mean weight was 0.54 pounds, the median length group was 8.0-8.4 inches.  The selective gear (trapnet) for this species often fails to adequately sample all sizes present.  Additional methods such as electrofishing may be necessary to sample all age groups.The gillnet catch of SMALLMOUTH BASS is also the highest on record in the survey file and is four times higher than the 1985 catch.  The population is characterized by high numbers and small average size (0.84 pounds).  Average size in 1985 was lower at 0.54 pounds.  All age groups I through VII are present in the sample with the exception of age group V.  Age groups II and III make up 81% of the net catch.  Fish range in length from 5.0 to 18.9 inches and grow at normal rates.BLUEGILL net catches show high numbers and small average size at 0.10 pounds.  Bluegill numbers have invariably been high in past surveys going back to 1970.  Average weight has also been quite stable since 1970 (0.10-0.15 pounds).  Age groups II through VIII were sampled and all displayed slow growth.  Fish ranged in length from 3.0 to 9.4 inches.  The BLACK CRAPPIE trapnet catch of two fish is low and has declined from the 27 fish caught in 1985.  Eighteen fish were captured in the gillnets and ranged in size from 4.5 to 11.9  inches in length.  Mean weight of these fish was 0.58 pounds indicating a large average size.  Age groups I through IV were found in the sample.  Aging data shows normal growth for age I through III fish and fast growth for age group IV.YELLOW PERCH numbers show no \"real\" change since 1985.  The population is average both in numbers and mean size.  Mean size of fish is also unchanged from 1985.  Fish captured ranged in length from 5.0 to 10.4 inches and were of ages II through V.  Age group III comprised 64% of the catch.  Growth rates appear normal.  The natural reproduction checks showed good numbers of  YOY fish.Several additional centrarchid species were sampled in survey nets including: ROCK BASS, PUMPKINSEED, GREEN SUNFISH, and HYBRID SUNFISH.  Pumpkinseed and rock bass were found in average numbers and normal mean sizes.  Green sunfish numbers were high and average size small.A single MUSKELLUNGE was caught in a gillnet.  The fish was 25.4 inches long and two years old.  In 1988, a total of 850 fingerlings were stocked.  In addition to the gillnetted fish, four muskies from 24 to 28 inches in length were caught in a fishing contest during September of 1990.  All of these fish can be attributed to the 1988 stocking.The WHITE SUCKER net catch remains low while average size remains high at 3.11 pounds.  White sucker numbers have historically been low, below 1.75 per gillnet.  A few small fish (6-7 inches) were captured in the trapnets.All three species of BULLHEAD: YELLOW, BROWN, and BLACK are present in low numbers.  A commercial fisherman removed 3,100 pounds of bullheads from the lake in 1990 under a class \"B\" permit.BOWFIN are present in average numbers and large average size.Two gillnets were set in the lake in late November to assess the TULLIBEE population.  A total of 51 tullibee were captured ranging in length from 14 to 19 inches.  No tullibee were caught during the summer lake survey.</p>",

Night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring walleye fry stocking and determine the need for fry stocking the following spring.  According to our management plan for Lake Alexander, if year class failure is evident from the fall electrofishing results, fry will again be stocked, otherwise a one year gap will be maintained between the stocked years.  The lake has a long history of walleye stocking with fingerlings being the primary source before the fry stocking began.  In 1995, fry stocking was used and has occurred in odd numbered years since then.  Due to the success, fry stocking has been an inexpensive way of providing a walleye fishery in the lake.  In the 2009 fall electrofishing effort, 470 young of the year walleye were netted for a catch rate of 388.1/hour.  This was the second highest catch rate for the lake after the 702/hour rate in 2007.  There were other young of the year walleye observed that avoided being netted.  A new electrofishing boat was used for both the 2007 and 2009 checks and proved to more efficient than the previous boat.   <br> \n       Catch rates of 75/hour, 125/hour, 159/hour, and 104/hour were recorded with the previous electrofishing boat in 2005, 2003, 2001, and 1999, respectively.  Fall night electrofishing was also used in 1996 and 1994 to check for natural reproduction in Lake Alexander.  Walleye caught during those early efforts appeared to come from stocked years, suggesting little or no natural reproduction was occurring in the lake.   <br> \n       Twenty-two adult walleye were also netted during the 2009 fall electrofishing runs.  Adult fish ranged from 10 to 25 inches in length with most (n=15) between 11.5 and 14.5 inches.  Three of the walleye were from the 2008 year class and one from the 2006 year class which would have come from natural reproduction.   Previous electrofishing results also documented one or two fish from natural reproduction.   A fin-clipped 28-inch muskellunge was captured and measured.  Two other muskies and numerous adult walleye were also observed in the electrofishing effort.  Other species present included both adults and young of the year yellow perch, spottail shiner, black crappie, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, and northern pike.</p>",

Fall night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring Walleye fry stocking.  The stocking strategy was recently changed for Lake Alexander to stocking on an annual basis with 1500 fry/littoral acre in odd years and 3000/littoral acre in even years.  Despite having extensive shoal water habitat that appears to be suitable Walleye spawning substrate, little natural reproduction has been documented in Lake Alexander.  The lake has a long history of Walleye stocking with fingerlings as the primary source before fry stocking was initiated in 1995. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 fall night electrofishing netted 153 young of year Walleye for a catch rate of 141/hour.  A new electrofishing boat was obtained in 2007 which has generally increased catch rates for most species.  Walleye young of year catch rate was 184/hour in 2014, with 78/hour in 2012, 165/hour in 2011, 388/hour in 2009, and 702/hour in 2007.  Prior to 2007 catch rates varied from 20.7/hour (1997) to 159/hour (2001); however, fry survival has an influence on the catch rate as does boat efficiency. <br> \n <br> \nAn additional eighteen adult Walleye up to nineteen inches in length were netted during the 2015 fall Walleye electrofishing assessment.  Seventeen of the fish were yearlings and ranged from nine to twelve inches in length.  Other fish species observed during the electrofishing effort included a few Northern Pike, none of which were over twenty-five inches in length.  All sizes of Yellow Perch were common, Bluegill were abundant although mostly small, and Smallmouth Bass and Rock Bass were common.  Shiners, Common and Spottail, were abundant.   <br> \n <br> \nThe previous stocking regime was fry stocking two out of three years.  In the past, if a year class failure was evident from electrofishing results, fry would be stocked the following spring, otherwise a one year gap would be maintained between the stocked years.  The current strategy of variable fry stocking will be tested to see if the half quota years will produce a viable year class compared to full quota years.  Next spring, the full complement of Walleye fry will be stocked in Lake Alexander.  Results from the future fall night electrofishing will be compared to 2015.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gamefish catches were disappointing this year in Lake Alexander, likely due to the colder than normal spring, late ice-out on the lake, and the short netting period.  There was still some ice on the east side of the lake when the nets were set the Sunday before fishing opener.  Ten large-frame trapnets were set over the six-day period for a total of 44 set-days.   The ice prevented three of the nets from being set on the first day.  Since Lake Alexander has heavy fishing pressure on the opener, it was decided that the nets would be pulled from the lake on Friday as a safety precaution.  Sampling goals in the past have been to collect scales and lengths from 100 muskies of both sexes to get a reliable population size structure picture and population estimate.  Weather and water temperatures have been major factors in the length of the netting period.  In 2001, the weather was warm with light winds and it took less than a week to catch 260 muskies.  The 2004 assessment was spread over 17 days with cold fronts and strong winds that slowed fish movement, collapsed nets, and hindered lifting efforts.  Anal fin rays were collected from the muskies in 2008 to see if they were more accurate and easier to read than scales.  It was found that once the fish reached about 10 years of age, the fin rays were difficult to read on the outer edge. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 81 muskies between 19 and 48.7 inches were netted in the 2008 assessment for a catch rate of 1.8/lift.  All but one of the muskies was more than 36 inches in length with 68% (n=55) exceeding 40 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 41.3 inches with a modal length of 40 - 41 inches.  The 2004 assessment caught 163 muskies for a catch rate of 1.1/LTN while the 2001 assessment netted 260 muskies for a catch rate of 6.5/LTN.  Muskies measured from 17 - 50 inches in the 2004 assessment and 32 - 47 inches in the 2001 assessment.  Mean length was 40 inches in both the 2004 and 2001 assessments.  The modal length in 2004 was the same as in 2008 while the 2001 assessment had three length groups of equal number, one of which was also 40 - 41 inches.  The 2004 assessment also caught a fair number of immature muskies, seven that were between 17 and 25 inches in length.  Fish over 36 inches in length accounted for 91% (n=148) of the 2004 catch and 90% (n=235) of the 2001 catch.  Those more than 40 inches in length comprised 57% (n=93) of the 2004 sample while they were only 44% (n=115) of the 2001 catch.   A lake management goal is to have at least 30% of the females in a spring assessment exceed 45 inches in length.  The 2008 catch surpassed that goal with 70% (n=14) of the female muskies exceeding 45 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe muskie sex ratio for the 2008 sample was 3 males to 1 female, which was the same as in 2001.   In the 2004 assessment, the sex ratio was 1.8 males to 1 female.   Population estimates were also done in 2004 and 2001 using the Peterson Estimate with night electrofishing being used as the recapture method both years.  No population estimate was done in 2008.  The estimate of adult muskies or those over 32 inches in Lake Alexander in 2004 was 492 fish, which was less than the estimate of 571 fish in 2001.  Six of the male muskies and one female were estimated to under 10 years of age while 54 of the males and 19 of the females were estimated to be over 10 years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nThe majority of the northern pike caught in the 2008 muskie assessment were either ripe or spent and had likely spawned under the ice with the late spring conditions.  The 2008 catch of 160 pike was much less than the 1054 pike catch of 2004 but better than the 91 pike catch of 2001.  A protected-slot regulation from 24 - 36 inches was implemented in 2003.  The goal of the regulation was to produce a pike population where 50% of the pike captured during the spring assessment would exceed 24 inches in length with at least 5% more than 36 inches in length.  Pike in the 2008 catch measured from 12 to 34 inches in length with a mean length of 23 inches and modal length of 23 - 24 inches.   Thirty-nine percent (n=62) of the pike were more than 24 inches in length and 6% (n=6) exceeded 30 inches.  Few of the northern pike in the 2004 assessment, only 17% (n=117) were more than 24 inches in length and only one fish was over 30 inches.  In 1994, which was when the first muskie assessment was conducted, up to 50% of the 26 northern pike caught exceeded 24 inches in length.  Assessments in 1996 and 1998 had pike catches where around 38% of the fish were over 24 inches in length while in 2001 they made up 26% of the catch.  The sex ratio for the pike in the 2008 assessment was 1.2 males to one female. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 muskie assessment produced the lowest walleye catch to date with only 59 fish being caught, the second lowest was 77 walleye in 1998.  Concurrent netting for the  Mille Lacs tagging in 2008 also failed to catch many walleye.  The 2004 assessment caught the highest number of walleye, 525 fish between 14 and 30 inches in length.  Muskie assessments in Lake Alexander have produced some impressive walleye catches in relation to fish size.  Walleye in the 2008 netting measured from 13 to 28 inches in length.  Fish over 20 inches in length accounted for 64% (n=38) of the 2008 catch with more females (n=32) than males (n=26) being caught.  In 2004, despite the large sample size, 70% (n=366) of the walleye caught were more than 20 inches in length while in 2001, 64% (n=129) of the fish exceeded 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nUnlike the 2004 muskie assessment, which captured 168 largemouth bass between 5 and 18 inches, the 2008 assessment caught only 11 bass, which measured from 9 to 17 inches in length.  The 2001 assessment also had a low bass catch of only 14 fish while 40 were caught in 1998 and 61 in the 1996 assessment.  The lowest amount caught was 5 largemouth bass in 1994.  Largemouth bass up to 19 inches have been sampled in some of the assessments. <br> \n <br> \nSome impressive black crappie catche, in terms of fish size, have also been observed in the muskie assessments.  Only 84 black crappie were caught in the 2008 assessment compared to 498 in 2004, 271 in 2001, 472 in 1998, and 171 in 1996.  The 1994 assessment only netted 16 black crappie.  Fish in the 2008 assessment measured from 6 to 14 inches in length with 68% (n=57) of the fish exceeding 11 inches in length.  Up to 47% (n=232) of the crappie in the 2004 assessment were over 11 inches in length while only 19% (n=52) of the fish in the 2001 assessment exceeded 11 inches.  Mean length for the 2008 catch was 11.2 inches with a mean length of 9.7 inches in 2004 and 10.2 inches in 2001.  Modal length was the same in both 2008 and 2004 at 12 - 13 inches while it was 10 - 10.5 inches in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches have varied in the muskie assessments.  Both the 2008 and 2001 assessment had catches near 200, while the 2004 assessment caught 967 bluegill and the 1998 assessment caught 2,302 bluegill.  The length distribution has been about the same in the four assessments at 3 to 8 inches.  The 2008 assessment had the biggest portion of the sample of fish over 7 inches in length, 25% (n=51), while 10% of the measured fish in the 2004 assessment and 15% of the 2001 assessment were over 7 inches in length.  Mean length for the bluegill samples in the last three assessments was approximately 6 inches.  Modal length was 6.5 - 7 inches in 2008 while it was 6 - 6.5 inches both 2004 and 2001. <br> \n <br> \nThe low catches of all species was indicative of poor netting conditions and were likely weather related.  Additional species that were captured and counted in the 2008 muskie assessment included bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. The lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 64 feet, and a littoral area of 842 acres. It has been primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge. Night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n  <br> \nThe lake has a long history of Walleye stocking primarily with fingerlings until 1995, when fry stocking was initiated. Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 in Lake Alexander.  Fry stocking occurred in odd numbered years from 1995 to 2011. The management plan changed in 2014 to annual fry stocking at alternating rates.  In even number years the lake has been stocked with 2,500,000 fry and in odd number years 1,250,000 fry. <br> \n  <br> \nFall night electrofishing was conducted at three electrofishing stations around Lake Alexander totaling one hour of on-time.  These efforts were performed to evaluate success of annual alternate rate (1,500 fry/littoral area and 3,000 fry/littoral area) fry stocking.  The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 41 fish per hour. The length range was 5.39 to 6.85 inches and mean length of YOY Walleye was 6.12 inches.  The 2019 catch rate of 41 fish per hour was the second lowest in the last 22 years and the average catch rate over the last 10 years was 174 fish per hour.   These results appear to indicate a weaker year class of Walleye was generated in 2019 than has been typical. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-five yearling and adult Walleye were also netted during the electrofishing runs. The length range was 8.98 to 15.31 inches with a mean length of 10.93 inches. A Muskellunge that was 30.51 inches long was also measured.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is one of the most popular lakes in Morrison County.  Besides being a scenic, clear-water lake, the lake supports a diverse fish community that offers a variety of angling opportunities.  Alexander has abundant offshore structure and a reputation for better angling success at night or on overcast days.  Sand is the most common shallow water substrate around the lake.  Several resorts as well as three public accesses can be found on the lake.    Walleye are a much sought after species on Alexander and the 2002 survey did show an increase in numbers since the 1998 survey.  A strong year class of 14 - 16 inch fish was seen along with a varity of sizes up to 27 inches.  Walleye fry stocking has proven to be an inexpensive and viable method of sustaining the walleye population and meeting fishing pressure demands on the lake.  Northern pike numbers have declined which should improve walleye fingerling survival.  The steady decline in pike numbers since 1985 may reduce opportunities for pike anglers and spearers but should help ensure a more balanced fish community.  The size of the pike seen in the survey was rather disappointing as none of the fish were over 24 inches in length since Alexander has a reputation of having a quality pike population.  Anglers have reported catching nice pike, however.  New northern pike regulations are being implemented on Lake Alexander opening day of fishing season in 2003.  The regulation would require the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches of length back into the water.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the opportunity of catching a trophy size fish.     Muskellunge were introduced in Alexander in 1988 and have since become increasingly popular as a species targetted by anglers.  A muskie assessment in 2001 showed a good number of the fish are over 40 inches in length with some of the earliest stocked fish now over 47 inches and 30 pounds.  Yellow perch are an important component of the fish community and abundance appears to have declined since the last survey.  As a principal prey species for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge, yellow perch are important for maintaining good growth rates of gamefish.  Stomach analysis of walleye suggested that perch may have had good natural reproduction this spring as some of the fish were packed with young of the year perch.      Good numbers of both largemouth and smallmouth bass can be found in Lake Alexander and quality fish of both species have been documented.  Panfish species present include black crappies, bluegills, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds.  Most of the panfish tend to be small by angler's standards, but bluegills over 7 inches and crappies over 10 inches are present.  Crappies provide a popular winter and spring fishery on the lake.  Other fish species sampled in the survey include rock bass, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  Abundance appears low for both white suckers and yellow bullheads when compared to similar type lakes.  Lake Alexander once supported a good tullibee or cisco population that provided a popular late winter fishery.  Anglers report seeing few tullibee the last couple of years and netting efforts this fall also failed to locate fish.    Releasing larger northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye is encouraged to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Proper land use practices along the lakeshore and within the watershed to protect and improve the water quality in Lake Alexander.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Lake Alexander is one of the most popular lakes in Morrison County.  Besides being a scenic, clear-water lake, it supports a diverse fish community that offers a variety of angling opportunities.  Alexander has abundant offshore structure and has a reputation of better walleye angling success at night or on overcast days.  Several resorts as well as three public accesses can be found on the lake.  The Lake Alexander Preserve which is owned by the Nature Conservancy is located on the south shore of the lake and is open to hiking.  The fish management focus for the lake is primarily walleye with secondary management for northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  A northern pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which requires the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation was to improve the pike population size structure.  Lake Alexander is infested with Eurasian Watermilfoil, so anglers should be diligent about cleaning their boats and trailers when leaving the lake.  <br> \n      Lake Alexander provides the potential for anglers to catch trophy size fish of several different species.  Walleye are a much sought after species on Alexander and a variety of sizes were observed in both the summer survey and spring muskellunge assessment in 2010.  Although the summer survey catch was lower than the desired management goal, the catch rate was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Walleye fry stocking has proven to be an inexpensive and viable method of sustaining the walleye population and meeting fishing pressure demands on the lake.  Northern pike abundance appears to have gone up since the last survey in 2006.  Although summer survey results for northern pike were not that impressive, over half of the northern pike caught in the spring muskellunge assessment were over 24 inches with some over 36 inches measured.  Lake Alexander has also become a destination lake for muskellunge anglers, who regularly report catching fish over 50 inches. <br> \n      Good numbers of both largemouth and smallmouth bass can be found in Lake Alexander and quality fish of both species have been documented.  Panfish species present include black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Black crappie provide a popular winter and spring fishery with fish over 13 inches available.  Most of the panfish tend to be small by anglers' standards, but, bluegill and pumpkinseed over seven inches can be found.  Other fish species sampled in the survey included brown bullhead, tullibee or cisco, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Quality size bullhead up to 12 inches can be found of both species.  The lake once supported a good tullibee population that provided a popular lake winter fishery, but anglers and netting efforts indicate the population has been low for some time.   Tullibee were stocked in 2003 to supplement the population but that stocking appears to have had little effect on the population.  Yellow perch were one species to show a decline in abundance since the last survey, but, there were a range of sizes observed in the survey up to almost ten inches.   <br> \n      Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotics, several of which grow in Alexander.  While a large portion of the watershed is forested, much of the lakeshore itself is developed.  Good land use practices by landowners can play an important part to protect and improve the water quality of the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fry stocking has been effective in Lake Alexander.  Fall night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring walleye fry stocking as well as natural reproduction.   Fry stocking every odd numbered year began in 1995 on Lake Alexander.  Night electrofishing was conducted 1994 and 1996 to assess the presence of natural reproduction and showed none.  Lake Alexander has extensive shoalwater habitat that appears to be suitable walleye spawning substrate but little natural reproduction has been documented.  The lake has a long history of walleye stocking with fingerlings as the primary source before fry stocking was initiated in 1995.  The fry stocking has proven to be an inexpensive method of meeting management goals and providing a viable walleye fishery in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA new electrofishing boat obtained in 2007 has proven to be more efficient than the previous boat resulting in higher catch rates, although the 2011 catch rate was only slighter higher than the 2001 results.  A total of 168 young of year walleye were netted in 2011 for a catch rate of 165/hour.  This was well below the 388/hour in 2009 and 702/hour in 2007.   It was noted in 2011 that the effectiveness of the electrical field was questionable.  Prior to 2007, catch rates ranged from 20.7/hour (1997) to 159/hour (2001); however, fry survival also has an influence on the catch rate as does the boat efficiency.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-five adult walleye between 10 and 22 inches were also netted during the 2011 electrofishing effort.  The majority were between 11.5 and 14 inches (n=20) in length from the 2009 fry stocking.  One 5 year old stocked twenty-four inch muskellunge was captured and measured in the fall electrofishing effort.  Other fish species observed while electrofishing included yellow perch, sunfish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and shiners.  Scales were collected from the adult walleye and the majority of the fish (92%) were from the 2009 year class.  Two fish were from the 2007 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan for Lake Alexander has been updated to stock fry in two out of three years which would set up 2012 as the next spring stocking.   In the past, if a year class failure was evident from the electrofishing results, fry would be stocked the following spring, otherwise a one year gap will be maintained between the stocked years.  No extra spring fry stocking has occurred following the results from any of the fall electrofishing in the past.   <br> \n <br> \nThese consistently high electrofishing catch rates have not translated into correspondingly high gill net catch rates, though anglers have noted the presence of strong year classes of walleye matching the stocking efforts.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Lake Alexander is one of the most popular lakes in Morrison County. Besides being a scenic, clear-water lake, it supports a diverse fish community that offers a variety of angling opportunities. Alexander has abundant offshore structures and a reputation of better Walleye angling success at night or on overcast days. Three public accesses are located on the lake.  Sand was the most common shallow water substrate found during the survey.  The lake supports diverse vegetation beds that provide important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.  Some of the more common submergent plant species were clasping-leaf pondweed, coontail, and flat-stemmed pondweed. <br> \n      The fish management focus for the lake is primarily Walleye with secondary management for Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  A Northern Pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which requires the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession. The objective of the regulation is to improve the pike population size structure.  <br> \n      Lake Alexander provides the potential for anglers to catch trophy size fish of several different species. Walleye are a much sought after species on Alexander and a variety of sizes were observed in both the 2014 summer survey and spring Muskellunge assessment. Although the summer survey Walleye catch was lower than the desired management goal, the catch rate was an increase from the last survey, near the long term average for the lake, and within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes. Walleye fry stocking has proven to be an inexpensive and viable method of sustaining the Walleye population and meeting fishing pressure demands on the lake.     <br> \n      Lake Alexander has lower Northern Pike numbers than many lakes in the Little Falls Area.   Although summer survey results for Northern Pike were not that impressive, some nicer fish over five pounds were common in the spring Muskellunge assessment. Lake Alexander has also become a destination lake for Muskellunge anglers, who regularly report catching fish over 50 inches. The minimum size for Muskellunge was raised to 54 inches beginning with the 2015 season.  Good numbers of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in Lake Alexander and quality fish of both species have been documented. <br> \n      Panfish species present include Black Crappie, Bluegill, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. Black Crappie provide a popular winter and spring fishery with fish over 13 inches available. Most of panfish tend to be small by anglers' standards, but both Bluegill and Pumpkinseed over seven inches can be found.  <br> \n       Lake Alexander supports populations of all three bullhead species, however, Yellow Bullhead was the only species caught in the 2014 summer survey. Yellow Perch numbers continue to be low but Tullibee (Cisco) numbers appear to have improved and that species could be an important alternative prey species for game fish in the lake. <br> \n       Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotics.  Several exotics, including Eurasian Watermilfoil, grow in Lake Alexander. While a large portion of the watershed is forested, much of the lakeshore itself is developed. Good land use practices by landowners can play an important role to protect and improve the water quality of the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Alexander Lake (DOW# 49-0079; Lake Class 22) is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. There are two Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramps on the west and east shore. A township owned gravel boat ramp is located on the south shore. Alexander Lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 64 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge. The lake was initially surveyed in 1950 and 40 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016 (targeted survey for young of year Walleye). Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 in Alexander Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOne hour of fall night electrofishing was conducted on Alexander to evaluate success of annual alternate rate (1,500 fry/LA & 3,000 fry/LA) fry stocking. The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 128.00 fish per hour. This was lower than in 2016 (157.80 fish per hour), and the lowest catch rate since 2012. Historically, electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded with subsequent gill net catches at ages 3-6. Mean length of YOY Walleye was 6.00 inches. This was smaller than 2016 (6.12 inches), but similar to past surveys (5.98-7.05 inches). </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander can best be characterized as a \"big fish\" lake.  This title isearned due to an abundant prey base of yellow perch, northern cisco and whitesucker.  To maintain that big fish reputation, it is important that prey fishpopulations are not depleted by overstocking of predatory species.     The number of walleye is above average when compared to lakes similar toAlexander.  The current population exceeds management goals and is probablyresponsible for a significant decline in yellow perch abundance.  High walleye andreduced yellow perch numbers triggered excellent angling success throughout the1994 fishing season.  Being fairly deep and clear with abundant offshore structure,Alexander is normally a \"tough\" lake with fishing success best on overcast days orat night.  Angling success is likely to remain high for 1 to 3 pound walleyesduring the next few years due to the presence of a strong 1992 year class.  Trophyindividuals in excess of 10 pounds are also present.     Northern pike abundance was within the normal range when compared to lakessimilar to Alexander.  Maintaining northern pike at normal levels ensures a healthyfish community.  Northerns grow fast and good numbers of fish exceeding 24 inchesin length were present in 1994 assessments.  Prior surveys have documented fish inexcess of 20 pounds.  Due to fast growth rates and fairly low abundance, trophymanagement is a possibility.  Pike in Alexander would probably respond well to ahigh minimum size length limit.  At this time, we recommend anglers release allnorthern pike over 24 inches.  This should help preserve the quality aspect of thepopulation.  Directed sampling scheduled for the spring of 1995 should provideadditional information regarding population size and structure.     Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in good numbers makingAlexander a popular lake with tournament anglers and fishing clubs.  Largemouth andsmallmouth in excess of 5 pounds are frequently caught.  Releasing the majority ofmedium to large size bass of both species should ensure quality angling in thefuture.     A muskellunge fishery begun in 1988 is now producing legal size (> 40\") fish. Fish in the 30 inch range should be well represented in the population as well. Lake Alexander has excellent trophy potential with its abundant and diverse preybase and is reflected in muskies that are heavy for their length.  We recommendthat all muskies be released.     Yellow perch abundance declined significantly in 1994 probably due to highsurvival of heavily stocked walleye fingerlings.  Hopefully current gaps in thewalleye stocking schedule will allow perch to recover.  Yellow perch are extremelyimportant for maintaining good growth rates of gamefish.     Northern cisco and white sucker, also important prey fish, appear to bepresent in healthy numbers and provide an additional food source for largepredators.     Bluegills tend to be small with few individuals exceeding 7 inches.  Blackcrappies are normal in abundance and provide good winter and spring fishing foranglers in the know.</p>",

Alexander Lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 64 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge. The lake was initially surveyed in 1950 and 39 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2015 (targeted survey for young of year Walleye). Fall night electrofishing has be completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 in Alexander Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing was conducted on Alexander to evaluate success of fry stocking. The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 193.90 fish per hour. This was higher than in 2015 (157.80 fish per hour), and was the fourth highest catch rate since 2007. Historically, high electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded with gill net catches. Mean length of YOY Walleye was 6.12 inches. This was smaller than 2015 (6.35 inches), but similar to past surveys (5.98-7.05 inches).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. The lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 64 feet, and a littoral area of 842 acres. The primary management species is Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge. The Walleye population on Lake Alexander is managed through annual stocking of 2,500,000 fry. This stocking strategy has maintained a population that sustains a very good recreational fishery. Recent documentation of a significant natural year class (2020) when no stocking occurred due to COVID19 shutdowns may lead to future adjustments to stocking strategies to allow assessment of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing in the fall has been used to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance from spring fry stocking or natural reproduction since 1994.  Fall electrofishing in 2022 was completed on 20 September to assess Walleye fry stocking survival.  The catch per hour in two hours of effort at all stations was 8.5 fish per hour. Young of the year Walleye sampled ranged from 5.9 to 7.4 inches in total length and mean length was 6.8 inches.  The 2022 fall electrofishing catch rate was the lowest rate observed on Lake Alexander in a fry stocked year. Catch rates in prior fall assessments ranged from 21.4/hour (1997) to 733.1/hour (2007) with a median catch rate of 114.0/hour.   Catch rates in the last three fall assessments have been at or below the 1st quartile (34.0/hour). The fall 2020 catch of young of the year Walleye (24.5/hour) was the highest catch rate observed for naturally produced fish.  These results indicate further analysis of natural reproduction should be continued by adjusting stocking schedules and continuing fall electrofishing assessments in both stocked and non-stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, fall electrofishing catch rates of juvenile Walleye have been a good predictor of future year classes in summer gillnet surveys. Analysis of fall electrofishing catches showed that, in general, high fall catch rates have typically corresponded with higher catches in future gillnet surveys. Low fall catch rates, however, do not always signify poor year classes as represented by future gillnet catches. Fall catch rates as low as 21.0/hour have been well represented in future gillnet surveys above the third quartile (2.3/net). Other years with low fall electrofishing catch rates produced significant year classes of more than 1.5/gillnet. In summary, despite low fall electrofishing catches in recent years, future gillnet surveys will provide better clarity on the success of recent fry stockings or natural year classes. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two additional Walleye were sampled during the survey ranging from 10.9 to 24.1 inches in total length.  Eight yearlings were sampled and averaged 11.6 inches in total length.  Three Muskellunge were captured ranging from 21.5 to 33.5 inches.  All three fish retained PIT tags applied in previous assessments or at time of stocking. Juvenile and adult Yellow Perch were present in good numbers as were Shiner species.  Bluegill were abundant at some sites with a few approaching 8 inches.  Black Crappie were common and more abundant than in any similar electrofishing efforts performed in the fall, most were 10-12 inches.  Largemouth, Smallmouth, and Rock Bass were also common.  A few Northern Pike and adult White Suckers were observed.  Bullheads were conspicuously absent. A Mottled Sculpin was observed during the survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Alexander is a 2,708-acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. The lake has 16.26 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 64 feet, and a littoral area of 842 acres. The primary management species is Walleye.  Secondary management species include Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Muskellunge (MUE). This assessment was directed at evaluating the MUE population. Modern MUE management began in 1988 with a stocking of 850 fingerlings from direct Mississippi River brood stock. Subsequent stockings were primarily from Leech Lake brood stock. Initial stockings were somewhat intermittent, but eventually stocking occurred every other year with any age (fingerling, yearling or adult) fish through 2010. Beginning in 2012 annual stocking began with a preference to utilize yearling or older fish when available at a lower stocking rate to meet population goals. Beginning in 2016, all MUE stocked in Lake Alexander have been injected with PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tags. In addition, all untagged MUE captured in assessments of any kind on the lake have been PIT tagged. <br> \n <br> \nA spring MUE assessment was completed in May 3 through 20, 2022 using large-frame trap nets (LTNs) on Lake Alexander to evaluate the MUE population and obtain valuable size structure data on other gamefish species to compare to previous ice-out surveys. The Lake Management Plan goal for MUE is to maintain a population of 400 to 600 adult fish greater than 30 inches, therefore a population estimate was also obtained.  Lake Alexander also has a pike regulation that prohibits harvest of fish between 24 and 36 inches in length while allowing one over 36 inches in possession.  Twelve LTNs were set in the lake the first day of total ice-out in historical locations.  A total of 143 set days were recorded with the twelve nets over a seventeen day period. To increase MUE catch and aid in population estimation, four daytime electrofishing runs were conducted. <br> \n <br> \n A total of 93 MUE greater than 30 inches in total length were captured in LTNs and by electrofishing during the 2022 spring assessment. An additional 18 MUE less than 30 inches were captured, 17 by LTNs and one by electrofishing. Total catch rate of MUE captured in LTNs including recaptures and fish less than 30 inches was 0.69/set day (n=98). Discounting recaptures, large trapnets captured 91 MUE in 143 lifts for a catch rate of 0.64/set day. Catch rates from prior MUE assessments on Lake Alexander have ranged from 0.23/set day (n=20) in 1998 to 6.50/set day (n=260) in 2001. Catch rates from MUE assessments are quite variable based on weather patterns and days required to capture desired numbers of fish. In recent surveys, managers have established a goal to catch at least 100 Muskellunge. Consequently, catch rates are calculated but offer little benefit for making management decisions. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnetting and electrofishing captured 66 unique male and 18 female Muskellunge exceeding 30.0 inches in the 2022 assessment. The ratio of males to females was 3.7:1 which was similar to the last two assessments (2014=3.6:1, 2018=3.8:1). Male MUE ranged from 30.6 to 47.0 inches and averaged 41.1 inches in total length. Females captured ranged from 37.3 to 53.9 inches and averaged 47.7 inches in total length. The percent of females sampled greater than 45 and 50 inches was 78.9% and 26.3% respectively. The percent of females greater than 45 inches had been increasing from 18.2% in 2001 to a high of 85.7% in 2018 as the population matured. The percent of female MUE greater than 45 inches has exceeded the management goal (30%>45\") in every survey since 2004. The maximum observed length for females has also increased with the largest individual ever sampled captured in the 2022 assessment (53.9 inches). Females exceeding 50 inches have been captured since 2004 on Lake Alexander. The highest catch of 50+ inch fish occurred in 2014 when 11 were sampled. The presence of fish over 50 inches has made Lake Alexander a destination lake for anglers looking for trophy size fish. <br> \n <br> \nFour daytime electrofishing runs were conducted as an additional method of capture for a population estimate.  A total of 12 Muskellunge greater than 30 inches were sampled.   Two of the twelve MUE sampled were recaptures. The population estimate of adult Muskellunge over 30 inches for 2022 was 372 fish using the modified Schnabel Estimate. The estimate was slightly below the lake management goal of an adult population between 400 and 500 fish. Population estimates from the last three MUE assessments have been similar, 2014=361, 2018=351, and suggest the population has leveled off. Earlier population estimates in both 2010 (n=642) and 2001 (n=571) were above the management goal while the 2004 estimate of 492 adult fish was within the goal. <br> \n <br> \nJuvenile MUE less than 30 inches were also captured in LTNs (n=15) and in an EF run (n=1). Two juveniles were untagged suggesting potential natural reproduction or tag loss from stocked fish. This is the largest number of juvenile MUE captured in an assessment on Lake Alexander. Previous catches of fish under 30.0 inches ranged from zero in 2014 to 11 in 1996. It is unknown whether this indicates good survival of stocked fish in recent years or that juvenile fish were shallow and vulnerable to capture for some other reason. <br> \n <br> \nAdult MUE were first PIT tagged on Lake Alexander in the 2018 spring assessment. Seventeen MUE, 16 males and 1 female, tagged in 2018 were captured during the 2022 assessment. Length of males at time of tagging ranged from 39.0 to 46.4 inches and averaged 42.0 inches. The amount of growth observed over four growing seasons ranged from -0.5 to 2.8 inches with a mean increment of 1.2 inches. Negative growth for some males was unexpected but may be explained by fin erosion, declining condition of very old individuals, or measurement error due to a variety of factors. It appears growth rates for males slows significantly once they exceed 40 inches although some individuals have attained lengths up to 47 inches in Lake Alexander. The female fish recaptured grew 3.4 inches from 48.1 to 51.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWeights were obtained for 10 female and 39 male MUE captured during the 2022 assessment. Compared to 18 females and 64 males weighed in 2014, fish of both sexes weighed slightly less at any given length in 2022. The difference was more noticeable in males than in females. Older fish in the population may account for differences observed. In addition, lower sample sizes in 2022 may account for differences in female condition. In the past, Lake Alexander MUE condition has compared favorably with other well known MUE waters in Minnesota and there are no current concerns. In general, MUE caught by anglers will have a healthy appearance with the exception of some very old males that will appear skinny. <br> \n <br> \nLake Alexander has a protected slot limit regulation where all Northern Pike (NOP) between 24 and 36 inches must be released. One NOP greater than 36 inches is allowed in the bag of three fish. The intent of the NOP regulation was to increase population size structure quality. The NOP catch in the 2022 spring assessment totaled 449 fish between 10.9 and 35.5 inches in length with a mean length of 21.2 inches.  Females ranged from 13.9 to 35.5 inches with a mean length of 21.9 inches. Males averaged 18.9 inches and ranged from 10.9 to 25.0 inches in total length. Percent of all NOP exceeding 24, 30 and 36 inches was 16.7%, 2%, and 0% respectively. Size structure goals specified in the Lake Management Plan call for 50% of the sample to exceed 24 inches and 5% to exceed 30 inches. Surveys following implementation of the slot limit in 2008 and 2010 showed size structure improvement with individuals greater than 24 inches comprising 39% and 68% of the catch respectively. Spring surveys since 2014, however, have failed to meet management goals dropping to 20% in 2014, 27% in 2018, and to 16.7% in 2022. Percent of NOP exceeding 30 inches has met population goals in all surveys since 2010 but declined below goal in 2022. Since 2008, percent of NOP greater than 30 inches has ranged from 2.0% in 2022 to 18.5% in 2010. A potential confounding factor in the last three spring assessments has been late ice-out dates. Assessments in 2014, 2018 and 2022 all began in May. Many NOP captured in 2022 were already spent so sampling may have missed some of the larger individual NOP in the lake. Future spring assessments conducted during a more normal mid-April time frame may provide a better evaluation of the effectiveness of the protected slot limit. Future survey results and public input should determine whether managers keep the slot limit or return to the regular statewide regulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye (WAE) are the primary management species on Lake Alexander and were the most abundant gamefish species captured in LTNs. WAE captured in nets were given a left pelvic fin clip in order to keep track of recaptured individuals. A total of 634 unique WAE were captured in 2022, of which 113 were recaptured for a total catch of 747 which is the second highest catch ever recorded. Previous assessments did not keep track of recaptured individuals and total catches ranged from 59 in 2008 to 915 in 2014. The average number of WAE captured in spring assessments since LTNs have been used was 460. WAE captured in 2022 averaged 19.5 inches and ranged from 12.2 to 30.4 inches in total length. Modal length was 17.0-18.0 inches. The 2022 sample was comprised of 204 females, 419 males, and 11 of unknown sex. Females averaged 22.6 inches and ranged from 15.0 to 30.4 inches in total length. Males ranged from 13.4 to 25.4 inches and averaged 18.2 inches. Due to sampling during spawning, medium and large fish comprised most of the catch.  WAE between 16 and 20 inches accounted for 56.5% (n=422) of the sample while an additional 36.1% (n=270) of the fish were more than 20 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe WAE gillnet catch (2.87/set) in the Standard Survey conducted in August 2021 was the lowest ever recorded on Lake Alexander. Low gillnet catches occurred despite high fall electrofishing catch rates of young of the year WAE (YWAE) leading up to the 2021 Standard Survey. High catches of WAE in the 2022 MUE assessment suggest the 2021 gillnet catch may have given an inaccurate low estimate of population abundance. Zebra Mussels were first detected in Lake Alexander in 2019 and may be negatively impacting the WAE population. Fall electrofishing YWAE catch rates averaged 213.1/hour and ranged from 81.0 to 733.1/hour from 2001 through 2018. Since 2019, fall electrofishing catch rates of YWAE have been declining, averaging 27.0/hour and ranging from 8.5 to 40.9/hour. It is unknown whether these lower fall catch rates will correspond to weaker year classes in the future. Lake Alexander has been included in a research study to determine the impacts of Zebra Mussels on Walleye recruitment. In the coming years, fish managers and researchers will need to continue to study the impacts of Zebra Mussel infestation on Walleye population dynamics in the lake and determine if different management strategies will need to be employed to maintain Walleye population goals, or whether goals will need to be readjusted. <br> \n <br> \nSpring MUE assessments on Lake Alexander have provided an excellent opportunity to collect additional data on the Black Crappie population. The 2022 assessment sampled 613 crappie between 5.2 and 14.9 inches in length which was the highest catch recorded in a spring assessment.  Black Crappie catches have ranged from 16 to 513 fish in past spring assessments. Mean length for the sample in 2022 was 10.2 inches with a modal length of 10 - 11 inches.  Netting results suggest that Lake Alexander has a quality Crappie fishery as 65.4% (n=401) of fish captured exceeded ten inches in length and 10.6% (n=65) greater than twelve inches.  <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill have also been observed in the early spring assessments with the highest catch of 1,686 fish in April 2010.  The 2022 Muskellunge assessment netted 533 Bluegill ranging from 3.7 to 8.9 inches in length.  Mean length for the 2022 sample was 6.6 inches and modal length 7.0 - 7.5 inches.  Bluegill greater than 7.0 and 8.0 inches comprised 42.8% (n=228) and 4.1% (n=22) of the catch respectively. Bluegill greater than 8.0 inches are typically low in LTN catches on Lake Alexander and there appears to be no improving or declining trend in size structure. Anglers can expect to readily find keeper size fish in the 7 inch range with an occasional 8 inch fish in the bag. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth (n=92) and Smallmouth Bass (n=76) were caught in the 2022 MUE assessment. Largemouth Bass captured ranged from 6.6 to 14.9 inches and averaged 10.2 inches. Smallmouth Bass caught were typically larger, had a mean length of 15.6 inches, and ranged from 10.5 to 19.5 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species netted in the 2022 Muskellunge assessment included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.   Rock Bass were the most abundant species captured during the 2022 assessment with 1,472 fish netted. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey report is an update from the 2018 survey report. Gill nets were used to sample Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. In Lake Alexander, Smallmouth Bass are also sampled effectively with gill nets. Bluegill, Cisco, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie are usually seen to a lesser extent since they typically occupy different habitat than where gill nets are placed. Fifteen gill nets are used in Lake Alexander and the lake is typically surveyed the last full week of August. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the best way to understand fish sampling data from individual lake surveys is to look at them as a snapshot that estimates the current relative abundance and general size structure of the species discussed. Note that the data are only estimates and intended to provide a qualitative description of the fishery. More telling are data trends over the course of a fish generation (10-20 years). For example, the number of Northern Pike in \"Lake X\" (expressed as number per gill net) rising steadily in each survey from 2000 to 2020 would be much more telling than a single survey-year showing a major catch increase or decrease. Little Falls Area lakes with the highest recreational value are surveyed every four years; most of these lakes have at least 20-30 years of standardized surveys completed on them.  <br> \n   <br> \nThe 2021 survey of Lake Alexander caught a total 43 Walleyes in the gill nets or 2.9 fish/net. This is about half as many as in 2018 when a total of 92 Walleyes were caught and the catch rate was 6.1 fish/net. The average number of Walleyes caught since 2002 is 5.7 fish/net. Individual sizes ranged from 9-27 inches and the proportion of Walleyes less than 15 inches was as high as it's been since 2002. It's good to see a well-balanced population of Walleyes where adequate numbers of several different size-categories are sampled. However, we will be watching closely to see if the overall low number of Walleyes caught in this survey is just an outlier or a sign of something more concerning.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually in Lake Alexander and the current stocking strategy has provided several good years of fishing. Fall electrofishing surveys the past three years however have resulted in fewer young-of-year (juvenile) Walleye caught than we'd like to see. Lower electrofishing catch-rates don't always mean poor survival to catchable size, but our fall electrofishing in 2022 and the next gill net survey in 2024 will hopefully see a rebound in numbers caught. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to be present in low numbers which is ideal for other species such as Walleye and Muskellunge. The 2003 special regulation requiring the release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches is showing signs of success in increasing the number of larger pike. Early spring netting surveys have shown higher percentages of pike over 30 inches than before the regulation was enacted.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, a primary forage species for many game fish, seem to follow an up and down trend in Lake Alexander. Currently, there are adequate numbers of perch to sustain a prey base for Walleyes. Because pike abundance is low, perch abundance has not severely declined as can occur on other lakes where numbers of small pike have risen to nuisance levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass population in Lake Alexander remains healthy and we caught a nice range of sizes (5-19 inches). At this time, Smallmouth Bass may be the best quality fishery in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nAn early spring Muskellunge survey is planned for 2022. Updated information regarding this species will be available next year. For past Muskellunge netting results and status of the fishery, see the 2018 standard survey.  <br> \n</p>",
