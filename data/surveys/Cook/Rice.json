                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net catch in 2001 was well above the normal range for this lake type, but it was not unusually high for this lake.  The catch was dominated by strong 1996 and 1995 year classes, and it appeared that the 1997 - 1999 year classes had been weak.  The high catch of young-of-year (fingerling) walleye in 1/4-in-mesh trap nets may indicate that another good year class was produced in 2001.  Growth rates for walleye had been relatively slow compared to similar lakes in this area.The northern pike gill net catch was one of the lowest ever observed in this lake; however, it was much improved compared to 1996, when none were taken.  Most of the northern pike collected came from a modest 1999 year class, and it appeared that most other recent year classes had been weak.  Growth of two-year-old northern pike had been about average for the area.The yellow perch catch was high for a lake of this class, and for this lake historically.  Although no yellow perch were aged, it appeared from the length frequency distribution that there had been at least two exceptionally strong year classes produced.  Most of the yellow perch collected were large enough to have been of marginal interest to anglers.Although no smallmouth bass were collected in 2001, the species has been introduced in the watershed (Crescent Lake).  A local resort operator reported anglers catching smallmouth bass in Rice Lake in 2001.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill net catch in 2011 was one of the lowest seen to date in this lake, although it still fell within the normal range for a lake of this class.  The long range catch goal for walleye established in the 2002 LMP (a minimum of 10 fish/gill net set) was not met in 2011, but the size goal from that plan (some fish over 20 in present) was.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2011 catch.  Although natural reproduction had occurred consistently, no exceptionally strong year classes had been produced.   Walleye growth had been average for the area, with fish reaching an average length of 13.8 inches at the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and was similar to past catches in this lake.  The presence of a few older northern pike resulted in the highest mean weight for gill-net-caught fish seen to date, although most of the fish collected were four or less years old.  Growth had been average; three-year-old fish reached an average length of 17.1 inches by the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch was one of the lowest seen in this lake, but still fell within the normal range for the lake class.  Average size for yellow perch taken in gill nets was low for this lake historically, although a few fish larger than eight inches in length were present.   Yellow perch remained abundant enough to provide adequate forage for walleye and northern pike, but were mostly too small to offer much angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nA single muskellunge was taken in a gill net set - the first time that species has been found in this lake.  Crescent Lake, above Rice Lake in the Poplar River watershed, supports a natural muskellunge population, and was probably the source of that fish. <br> \n <br> \nNo smallmouth bass were collected in 2011 in any sampling gear.  Although they were likely present (they were sampled in 2006), their numbers may remain low.  It would be premature to link changes in walleye and yellow perch catches observed in this assessment to the presence of smallmouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rice Lake is a shallow, heavily vegetated lake that is the lowermost of the headwater lakes in the Poplar River watershed.  Despite a rough access, it reportedly sees a fair amount of angling use.  The lake is currently managed for Walleye, although it also supports minor fisheries for Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  Goals for the Walleye population, established in the 2011 lake management plan (LMP), are to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 10 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were present in fair numbers in 2021, although the Walleye gill net catch was the second-lowest seen to date in this lake.   Most of the fish taken fell within the 12 to 20-inch size range; larger fish were apparently scarce.  The 2021 Walleye catch fell within the normal range for a lake of this type, but was well short of the goal in the 2011 LMP, although the size goal was met.   All Walleye sampled in 2021 had been naturally produced (this lake has never been stocked), including a relatively large number of young-of-year (YOY) Walleye taken in 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets.  Ten year classes, including fish up to 26 years of age, were represented in the overall catch in 2021, with some indication that moderately strong 2012 and 2018 year classes were produced.  Growth of young Walleye had been average for the area, with fish reaching a mean length of 11.6 inches at the end of their third year.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were fairly abundant in 2021, but despite the capture of one large fish (42 inches), most were small.  The gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this type, and was similar to past catches in this lake.  No Northern Pike were aged in this survey; from their lengths it appeared that most were one or two years of age. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were apparently abundant in 2021, and enough larger fish were present to provide some angling opportunity.  The gill net catch was above the normal range for a lake of this type, but was not unusually high for this lake historically, where the species has generally been abundant.  About 34% of fish taken in gill nets were over eight inches in length (up to 11.3 inches).  Yellow Perch also provided an excellent forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike in 2021.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on Rice Lake might encounter an occasional Musky.  Although none were sampled in the 2021 survey, Muskellunge do sometimes make their way down to Rice Lake from Crescent Lake, where they are fairly abundant.  Muskellunge in this system tend to be small, since all are descended from stockings of Shoepack lake strain fish in the 1970s. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were present in fair numbers in Rice Lake in 2021, with fish up to 16 inches in length sampled.  Smallmouth Bass were first sampled in Rice Lake in 2006, after having been illegally introduced in Crescent Lake in the late 1990s.  The 2021 gill net catch fell just within the normal range for a Class 12 lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA few Pumpkinseed Sunfish were taken in the 2021 survey, marking the first time that species had been found in Rice Lake.  They were too few in numbers, and too small, to have been of much interest to anglers.  Johnny Darter and Longnose Dace were also collected for the first time in Rice Lake in 2021. <br> \n </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As has generally been the case in Rice Lake, walleye were abundant in 2006, and were present in a wide range of sizes, including a few fish as large as 26 inches.  This lake has never been stocked, so all walleye collected in 2006 were produced naturally.  Relatively strong year classes were apparently produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003.  Northern pike were also present in fairly high numbers, but due to slow growth and limited survival beyond five years of age, most were small.  Yellow perch were abundant, providing excellent forage for walleye and northern pike, but also providing some angling opportunities.  Smallmouth bass were found for the first time in this lake in 2006.  Their numbers were apparently low, perhaps indicating that the introduction was recent.  Smallmouth bass have been spreading through the Poplar River system for the past ten years, since first appearing in Crescent Lake.  They have now become established in every major lake in the upper watershed of that river.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SCALE SAMPLES HAS BEEN TRUNCATED IN THE 12 TO 14, AND 17 IN SIZE RANGES (IT HAS BEEN STANDARD POLICY TO ONLY TAKE FIVE SAMPLES FROM EACH SIZE RANGE AT THIS STATION), AND THE ACTUAL WAE CATCH WAS PROBABLY CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN 40.  SIX GILL NETS WERE TO HAVE BEEN USED IN THIS ASSESSMENT, SO THE WAE CPUE EXCEEDED 6.7 FISH/NET, A HIGH CATCH FOR LAKES OF THIS ECOLOGICAL CLASS.  MOST OF THE WAE COLLECTED RANGED FROM 12 TO 18 IN, WITH SOME OVER 20 IN.  WAE GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY.</p>",
