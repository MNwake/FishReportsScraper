                "narrative": "<p>Black Shadow Lake has no public access and probably has low fishing pressure.  The fish community in Black Shadow Lake has periodically been surveyed for comparison with other lakes in the area.  The lake has a total area of 16.75 acres and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  Only 36 percent of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shoal area is limited because of the rapid drop-off along most of the shoreline.  There is an inlet from Camp Lake located on the southwest shore, and an outlet to Carlson Lake on the northeast shoreline.  Fish species sampled included northern pike, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, black crappie, bowfin, and yellow and black bullheads.  The average number of northern pike caught in the gill nets was seven, which is above average for this lake type.  Northern pike in gill nets ranged in size from about 21.5 to 33.5 inches and averaged about 4.5 pounds.  The size structure for northern pike in this lake is of good quality.  Even though there is consistent natural reproduction stunting of northern pike has not occurred.  Lack of stunting in this lake may be due to the relatively high number of larger pike that prey on smaller pike, thus keeping the numbers of pike in this lake within balance of the prey base.  To help maintain a desirable size structure of northern pike and a balanced fish community, anglers fishing this lake should voluntarily release pike greater than 22 inches in length.  The abundance of black crappies was about eight crappies per trap net and catch rates averaged higher than in the previous survey.  Two strong year-classes (1997 and 1998) comprised two-thirds of the total catch in this lake.  These two and three-year-old crappies exhibited normal growth and by age three were 6.1 inches in length.  Crappies captured ranged in size between 5.3 and 10.6 inches in length and averaged about 7.0 inches.  Bluegill abundance increased from about 6.5 in 1990 to 35 fish per trap net in 2000.  This increase was due to strong year-classes in 1997 and 1998 representing 91 percent of the catch.  The strong year-classes for both bluegill and black crappies may have resulted from ideal conditions for survival of young-of-year panfish over the previous two mild winters.  Bluegills captured ranged in size from 3.3 to 8.5 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish also increased in abundance over the same period.  Bowfin had a trap net index just below the statewide average for this lake type.  Bowfin may be important control of smaller bluegills as they utilize the same habitats and are highly picivorous.  Bowfins are therefore beneficial in preventing bluegill stunting and should be returned to the lake if they are caught.  </p>",
