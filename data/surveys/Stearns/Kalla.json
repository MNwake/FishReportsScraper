Northern Pike abundance in Kalla Lake was average compared to lakes with similar characteristics. The gill net catch was 5.5/net, with year classes 2-6 represented. Growth was average and condition good. Northern Pike lengths were evenly distributed between 12 and 26 inches. The catch of Yellow Perch was similar to the local median. Size range was 5.0-7.4 inches in length with the modal length being 6.0-6.4 inches. Only two Walleyes were sampled during the survey and they probably migrated in from other lakes within the watershed. Bluegill abundance was below the local median. Modal length was 6.5 to 6.9 inches, and several individuals between 7.0 and 9.5 inches were captured. Six age classes were represented, with gaps at years 1 and 5, and dominance at years 3 and 4. Black Crappies appear abundant and were taken at a rate of 17.2/trap net. Year classes 3-5 were well represented with age 3 dominating. Growth rates appear to be below average for years 1 and 2, but increase to average thereafter. Other species captured were Black, Yellow and Brown Bullheads, Bowfin, White Sucker and Common Carp. All were present in average abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kalla Lake is a 103 acre lake with no public access located near the town of Avon in Stearns County.  The lake is situated within the 80 square mile Avon Hills area.  Land use in 2010 was estimated at 42% forest, 30% pasture and grassland, 5% developed and 2% marsh. Only seven houses have been built around the lake, primarily on the east side. The lake was first surveyed in 1987 and 2010 is the first resurvey. <br> \n  <br> \nMaximum depth was 48 feet. Approximately 40% of the 103 surface acres were less than 15 feet deep. Dissolved oxygen was sufficient to 18 feet. Water clarity improved from five feet in 1987 to11 feet in 2010. Cattail, coontail, muskgrass, and sago pondweed were found throughout the shoreline areas of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted for the first time in 2010 during day-time.  A total of 71 fish were collected at a rate that was double the 35.7/hour day-time average in the Montrose Area. The fish ranged in length from 3 to19 inches with an average length of nine inches.  Growth rates were similar to statewide averages. Largemouth bass grew to 10 inches in four years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch in 2010 was somewhat higher than in 1987, but both catches were average compared with similar lakes.  Fish ranged between 3 and 8 inches in length and were determined to be ages 3 through 6. Growth rates were similar to statewide averages. Bluegill grew to six inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 10 black crappie were caught in trap nets in 2010, and while the catch rate was still within the expected range, it was much lower than the 1987 catch.  The 2010 fish ranged from 5.5 to 10 inches in length. Growth was average; black crappie grew to nine inches by age five. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch in 2010 was similar to that of 1987. Both were within the range of expected values.  In 2010, northern pike ranged from 11 to 28.5 inches and were ages two through six.  Growth was average, except for three year old females.  These fish grew at a faster rate and reached 20 inches in length by the third year. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two yellow perch were caught in 2010 and were determined to be ages 2 and 3. Other fish sampled included black and brown bullhead; bowfin; hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish; and white sucker.   <br> \n</p>",
