There is no public access for Forsythe Lake.  The maximum depth from a past survey was listed as 10 ft, however, a deep hole of 17 ft was found during this assessment.  Forsythe Lake is generally shallow, with abundant vegetation and soft muck substrate. Bluegill abundance was moderate with a trap-net catch of 29.9/net, which is within the range of similar lakes.  Size structure of the bluegill population was excellent with a mean length of 8 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was 1.8/gill net, which is below the expected range for similar lakes.  No black crappie or rock bass were sampled.Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.0/gill net and was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was generally poor, however, a few fish were greater than 30 inches.  Two walleye were sampled in the assessment and are likely the result of a private stocking. Black bullhead abundance was 7.8/trap net.  Other fish sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, bowfin, and brown bullhead.  </p>",
