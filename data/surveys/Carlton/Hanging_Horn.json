                "narrative": "<p>Big Hanging Horn is a 408 acre lake with 86 (21%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  Big Hanging Horn is located just southeast of Barnum, MN off Highway #138.  Big Hanging Horn Lake has a City administered public access adjacent to the outlet.  Access can also be gained at the Highway #13 causeway on the north shore of the lake.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1999, 1997, 1995, 1993, 1991 and 1989.  Yearlings that were born in 1998 were stocked in 1999.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1951, 1960, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1983, 1990, 1996 and 2000.  Largemouth bass have been sampled with electrofishing in 1993, 1996 and 2000.  A tullibee removal project was conducted during the late fall of 1993, 1994 and 1995.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.6 per lift.  This index value was near average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of walleye was poor and growth was average.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 12.1 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 13.9 inches.  From a sample of aged walleye it was determined that 64% were born in years that walleye were stocked.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.7 per lift.  This index value was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of sampled northern pike was poor and growth was slow.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 20.8 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 19.6 inches.  From a sample of aged northern pike it was determined that every year class except 1995 was represented between 1992 and 2000.     Tullibee abundance indexed with assessment nets was 28.7 per lift.  This index value was much higher than average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of sampled tullibee was 9.4 inches.  From 1993 through 1995, a total of 14,475 tullibee weighing 7,304 pounds were removed from Big Hanging Horn Lake by DNR Fisheries crews.     Black crappie abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.9 per lift.  This index value was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of black crappie was good and growth was fast.  Mean length of sampled black crappie was 9.1 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 8.2 inches.  From a sample of aged black crappie it was determined that 1996 was a strong year class.     Bluegill abundance indexed with assessment nets was 9.2 per lift.  This index value was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of bluegill was good and growth was typical.  Mean length of sampled bluegill was 5.5 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 4.5 inches.  From a sample of aged bluegill it was determined that 1995 and 1998 were strong year classes.     Largemouth bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing assessment conducted on 5/23/2000.  A total of nine largemouth bass and two smallmouth bass were sampled.  Catch rate for largemouth bass was 13.4 per hour of electrofishing.  Size of largemouth bass was poor and growth was fast.  Mean length of sampled largemouth bass was 10.5 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 14.1 inches.  From a sample of aged largemouth bass it was determined that no bass were older than age IV.     Other fish species sampled included rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, white sucker, green sunfish, common shiner, johnny darter and logperch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging Horn Lake is a 408 acre lake located near Barnum, Minnesota with 21% (86 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 80 feet. There are two public accesses on Hanging Horn; a carry-in access located off County Road 13 at the culvert between Hanging Horn and Little Hanging Horn lakes and another city owned concrete back-in ramp is located off County Road 138, on the Moose Horn River.  Hanging Horn was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations and to assess the success of the lake trout stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking lake trout was postulated as one way to utilize the abundant tullibee population and add a unique angling opportunity to Hanging Horn Lake.  Stocking lake trout most likely would not reduce tullibee numbers to the point where walleye recruitment and survival would increase, but would provide an opportunity to catch lake trout within the Duluth Fisheries Management Area, which currently does not exist.  Lakes that are able to sustain a lake trout population generally have a significant volume of water where water temperatures remain below 55F and dissolved oxygen concentrations are 5 mg/L or greater throughout the summer.  According to temperature and dissolved oxygen data collected during the past four investigations, summer temperatures in the hypolimnion are suitable for lake trout survival; however, dissolved oxygen concentrations are slightly below the desired level for lake trout.  Similar physical properties exist in other lakes managed for lake trout in northeastern Minnesota and these lakes, although marginal lake trout fisheries, provide an environment suitable for lake trout survival and a unique angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout yearlings were stocked into Hanging Horn in the spring of 2007, 2009 and 2010.  Six special deep water gillnets were set targeting lake trout.  Two lake trout from the 2010 stocking event were captured with a mean length of 7.9 inches.  The lack of fish captured from the 2007 and 2009 stocking events indicate that Hanging Horn may be unsuitable for lake trout.  Lake trout likely are not surviving the warm summer months due to low dissolved oxygen and thermal stresses in the hypolimnion.   <br> \n <br> \nThe tullibee (cisco) gillnet abundance of 46.2 was down from 2005 (64.0) but still considerably higher than other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Tullibee mean length was 10.1 inches.  Hanging Horn currently supports a healthy tullibee population with individuals up to 13 inches and 23 years of age.  A total of 17 different age-classes of tullibee were present dating back to 1987. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (0.9) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 20.1 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Eight year-classes were present from 1995 to 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.4 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (2.7) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of northern pike was 23.4 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2008 were represented, except 2002. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.6 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (1.3) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.9 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area crappie populations.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 19.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (8.4) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill mean length was 5.3 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area bluegill populations.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.1 per gillnet lift was less than 2005 (0.7) and below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Only one perch was caught and it was 5.6 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance of 0.1 per gillnet lift was the same as 2005 and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Only one smallmouth bass was caught and it was 14.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include burbot, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed, rock bass, silver redhorse, yellow bullhead and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nHanging Horn Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging Horn was surveyed during the summer of 2020 to evaluate and update information about fish populations, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout stocking programs.   <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout and Brown Trout are the primary species of management for Hanging Horn Lake.  Just over 19,500 yearling Rainbow Trout were stocked into the lake in 2018 and 9,800 in 2019 and 2020. Approximately 1,800 Brown Trout have been stocked into the lake annually from 2017 to 2020.  No Rainbow Trout or Brown Trout were captured in 2020.  Twenty trap nets were set in October targeting Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout, but none were captured.  The lack of either species captured in the lake suggests that Hanging Horn is unsuitable for Rainbow Trout or Brown Trout management.  It is likely that both species are leaving the lake and remaining in the Moosehorn River. The Moosehorn River will be surveyed in 2021 to further investigate its suitability for trout survival.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Walleye average length was 14.6 inches. Several year-classes of young Walleye were evident in the sample suggesting angling for Walleye may improve in the next few years as these mature.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) abundance of 25.6 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Tullibee average length was 10.6 inches. Angling and/or sport netting opportunities for Tullibee are exceptional in Hanging Horn Lake.  Hanging Horn consistently has the highest abundance of Tullibee in the Duluth Area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was below average compared to similar Minnesota Lakes.  However, average size was good at 27.8 inches with fish up to 38.7 inches present.  Although Northern Pike are present in low abundance, quality size fish are available in Hanging Horn Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 4.1 per trapnet lift was above average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 9.2 inches with fish up to 11.6 inches sampled.  Bluegill abundance was average at 10.3 per trapnet lift with an average length of 6.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Many fish species are present with walleye and northern pike the major game fish and sucker, panfish and yellow perch the major prey species.     Walleye numbers were up slightly from the previous two investigations with the sample ranging in size from 7.2 to 17.1 inches.  Average size was 10.1 inches with many of these fish relating to the most recent fingerling stocking.  Northern pike numbers, while low, increased from the last survey.  Average length was 18.0 inches with a range of 13.2 to 24.5 inches.     Tullibee numbers remained high, yet show a decline from the previous two investigations.  See field notes.     Panfish (black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed) and yellow perch numbers remained low as they have been throughout the survey history.  Other species sampled in the 1996 survey included low numbers of chestnut lamprey, three species of redhorse and white sucker.</p>",

Regression analysis of tullibee (x) and walleye (y) abundance since 1951 is negative with an R-squared value of 0.84 indicating a strong (but unknown) relation exists to each other or in reaction to some other factors.  White sucker abundance is also above its third quartile range.  Northern pike and yellow perch abundance is low, below first quartile ranges of each species.  However, shoreline seining and 1/4 inch trapnets show a good year class (1990) of yellow perch.  Other species sampled are typical in abundance for this lake class.  Bluegill show slow growth with length at age IV only 4.3 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging Horn Lake is a 408 acre lake located near Barnum, Minnesota with 21% (86 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 80 feet.  There are two public accesses on Hanging Horn Lake; a carry-in access located off County Road 13 at the culvert between Hanging Horn and Little Hanging Horn lakes and another city owned concrete back-in ramp is located off County Road 138, just downstream on Moose Horn River.  Approximately 10,000 walleye fingerlings are currently stocked biennially to support a fishing population.       Walleye abundance of 0.9 fish/gillnet was below average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  Mean and maximum length of the eight fish captured was 19.8 and 28.0 inches, respectively.  Growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Five of the eight aged walleye correlated to stocking years and only one out of the seven most recent year classes had representative fish.         Black crappie abundance was 1.3 fish/trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 8.6 inches and growth was average for Minnesota lakes.  Only three year classes were represented in 2005.     Northern pike abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 2.7 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 24.3 inches; twenty-six percent were over 28 inches and one fish measured 41.0 inches.  Growth was fast for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike reproduction has been consistent.       Bluegill abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with an average of 8.4 fish/trapnet.  Mean length was 6.0 inches with 58% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 8.0 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent and growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes.     Tullibee exceeded the state average by over six fold in Hanging Horn Lake, with a value of 64.0 fish/gillnet.  The average length of tullibee was 9.3 inches.  The large size and population density of tullibee may be influencing the success of the walleye stocking program.  Walleye abundance has not improved even after doubling walleye fingerling stocking densities since 2001.  However, northern pike size structure has increased drastically and currently provides opportunities for trophy angling. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Hanging Horn Lake during the summer of 2015 to evaluate and update information about fish populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the Lake Trout stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout is the primary management species for Hanging Horn Lake.  Over 25,000 yearling Lake Trout have been stocked into the lake since 2007.  Zero Lake Trout were captured in 2015 for a gillnet abundance of 0.0 per lift.  Six special deep water gillnets were also set targeting Lake Trout.  No Lake Trout were captured in the deep gillnets either.  The 2010 assessment captured two Lake Trout for a deep gillnet abundance of 0.3 per lift, but both specimens were age-1 and had been recently stocked.  The lack of Lake Trout captured suggests that Hanging Horn is unsuitable for Lake Trout management.  Lake Trout likely are not surviving the warm summer months due to low dissolved oxygen levels and thermal stress in the deeper areas of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 1.1 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Walleye average length was 12.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Several year-classes of young walleye were evident in the sample suggesting angling for Walleye may improve in the next few years as these year-classes mature.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance of 36.1 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Tullibee gillnet average length was 10.6 inches.    Angling and/or sport netting opportunities for Tullibee are exceptional in Hanging Horn Lake.  Hanging Horn consistently has the highest abundance of Tullibee in the Duluth Area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  However, average size was good at 26.4 inches with fish up to 38.7 inches present.  Although Northern Pike are present in low abundance, quality size fish are available in Hanging Horn Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.7 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 8.1 inches with fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Bluegill abundance was average at 11.8 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 6.7 inches but only 12% exceeded 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOne Brook Trout was captured for a gillnet abundance of 0.1 per lift.  The fish was 13.7 inches in length and was from the 2011 year-class.  The origin of this fish is unknown but it likely emigrated from a cold water stream connected to the Moosehorn River which flows through Hanging Horn Lake.  Historically, one other Brook Trout was captured in Hanging Horn during an assessment in 1993.   <br> \n</p>",
