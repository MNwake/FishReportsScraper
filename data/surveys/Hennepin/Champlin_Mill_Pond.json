The pond is on the site of a historic mill and the old dam was replaced in 2016. Lower Champlin Mill Pond near the dam was dewatered and dredged to increase the maximum depth to 15 feet in the fall of 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nChamplin Mill Pond is reported as an important recreational fishing location to the surrounding community. A standard lake survey was conducted in June of 2017.     <br> \nEleven Northern Pike were sampled in gillnets, an abundance well-above the average for similar lakes.  Northern Pike in Champlin Mill Pond were small, averaging 1.6 pounds, a value below average in similar lakes.  The average length was 18.9 inches and Northern Pike ranged from 16.0 inches to 22.3 inches in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance and size in were below average compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill measured 4.8 inches on average and ranged from 2.9-8.3 inches. Some natural reproduction may be occurring in the lake as suggested by fish aged 1 and 2 years that were sampled.   Champlin Mill Pond was most recently stocked with Bluegill (150 fish) in spring 2014. <br> \n</p>",

The black crappie population is average for this type of a lake. The fish sampled had an average length of 7.2 inches and an average weight of 0.2 pounds. Only three bluegills were sampled during the survey. They had an average length of 6.2 inches. Black bullheads and white suckers were both very abundant. The white sucker population is considered above average for this lake. The Black bullheads were the most abundant fish sampled in the nets, but are still considered average when compared to similar lakes.Northern pike numbers were the highest since 1984. The average size of northern pike had a length of 21.7 inches and had an average weight of 2.5 pounds.Yellow perch, yellow bullheads, white crappies, and hybrid sunfish were all sampled in low abundance. This is the first survey since 1989 that yellow perch and yellow bullheads were sampled, and the first time overall that white crappies and hybrid sunfish were sampled.Bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, and carp were all sampled in average numbers for this type of lake.</p>",
