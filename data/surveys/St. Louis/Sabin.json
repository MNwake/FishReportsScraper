                "narrative": "<p>Sabin Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and shallow.  Sabin Lake is larger and deeper than normal for this lake class, has a more irregularly shaped shoreline, and has water that is more bog stained than usual.Sabin Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and in some years has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) below about 16 ft, while in other years (including 1996) has poor oxygen below about 26 ft.  The Embarrass River flows through Sabin Lake; the larger the amount of flow in a given summer, the more likely oxygen will be present to a greater depth.  Fish may move between Sabin and Wynne Lake downstream through a narrows that is navigable except for low flow periods.  There are no lakes upstream of Sabin Lake.Bottom substrates along the shoreline of Sabin Lake consist mostly of rubble, gravel, sand, and boulder.  Waterlilies, grasses, and burreeds are the most common aquatic plants, which grow to a maximum depth of 6 ft.Fish sampling in the 1996 survey consisted of shoreline seining, gillnets, and trapnets.  Six previous assessments have been conducted, dating back to 1973.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1996 (all fish species combined) of 21 fish/net (15 lb/net) was typical of this lake class and was similar to previous gillnet catches in this lake.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1996 of 19 fish/net (8 lb/net) was similar to previous trapnet catches in this lake.Fish populations in Sabin Lake in 1996 were dominated by white sucker, walleye, bluegill sunfish, and northern pike.  Fair numbers of yellow perch were present, as well as low numbers of black crappie, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and shorthead redhorse.  Several species of shiner minnows and a common type of darter minnow were also caught in the seine.  Cisco, present in most previous gillnet catches, were not captured in 1996.White sucker gillnet numbers in 1996 were higher than previous catches in this lake and were normal for this lake class.Walleye numbers in 1996 were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the long term average of 4.5/gillnet for this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged only 11\", which is small for this lake class, but similar to previous catches in this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 1996 was 23\".  Most walleye caught in 1996 were young fish from the 1995 and 1994 year classes.  Very few walleye were produced during the cold summers of 1993 and 1992 - something we have noted in many area lakes.  Walleye growth (10\" at age three, 12\" at age four) was somewhat slow by area standards.Bluegill numbers in 1996 were normal for this lake class and were higher than the long term average of 3.8/trapnet for this lake.  Bluegill sizes were nice, averaging 7.4\"; the largest was 9\".  Few bluegill were present from the cold summers of 1993 and 1992.  Bluegill growth (6\" at age four, 7\" at age five) was faster than normal for the area.Northern pike numbers in 1996 were normal for this lake class and similar to previous catches in this lake.  Pike sizes in 1996, as in previous surveys, were small; the largest pike was 24\".  Pike growth (15\" at age three, 17\" at age four) was slower than normal for the area.Perch numbers in 1996 were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the long term average of 8.9/gillnet for this lake.  The largest perch was 10\".  Perch growth (6.7\" at age five) was slower than normal for the area.About ten percent of the fish examined were infected with Neascus, except than most of the northern pike were infected and none of the crappie were.  Some rock bass and many yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (also known as black spot) and yellow grub are small parasites in or just undet the skin.  They are often removed by filleting; those remaining are killed by cooking.  Humans cannot be infected by these parasites.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sabin Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and shallow.  Sabin Lake is larger and deeper, has a more irregularly shaped shoreline, and has water that is more bog-stained than typical of lakes in this lake class.   <br> \n <br> \nSabin Lake was thermally stratified on 08/14/2006 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 19 feet, where the temperature was 69 F.  The Embarrass River flows through Sabin Lake with average flows of 100-500 cubic feet per second in midsummer, and the amount of flow in a given summer probably affects the thermal stratification.  Fish may move between Sabin Lake and Wynne Lake (downstream) through a narrows that is navigable by boat except in very low flow periods.  There are no lakes on the Embarrass River upstream of Sabin Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Sabin Lake consist mostly of rubble, gravel, sand, and boulder.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet; the most common plants are waterlilies and burreeds. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2006 fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnets and eight trapnets.  Seven previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1973, used 4-9 gillnets and 3-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining for small and young-of-year fish was done in 1996.   <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2006 of 25.4 fish/net (19.7 lb/net) was somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was similar to the median catch in all investigations on Sabin Lake of 25.5 fish/net (12.5 lb/net).   The gillnet catch in 2006 was very similar to previous investigations on Sabin Lake and was dominated by walleye, northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch.  A large (33.9 inches, 17.3 lb) channel catfish was also caught in the gillnets, the first appearance of this species in this lake.  Channel catfish are present in Embarrass Lake, downstream, and in the St. Louis River, into which the Embarrass River drains. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2006 of 21.9 fish/net (20.5 lb/net) was higher than the median trapnet catch in all investigations on Sabin Lake of 17.2 fish/net (10.0 lb/net) The trapnet catch in 2006 was dominated by white sucker and bluegill sunfish.  Some large (up to 11.8 inches) black crappie were also present in the trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2006 (4.9/gillnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median walleye catch of 5.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2006 averaged 12.5 inches (0.8 lb), which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class, but was larger than the average walleye size of 10.6 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2006 was 22.2 inches.  Walleye reproduction was fairly even from year-to-year.  Growth of walleye captured in 2006 was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (2.9/gillnet) were normal (near the median) for this lake class and were at the median value of 2.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2006 averaged 18.6 inches (1.5 lb), which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class, but was similar to the average pike size of 18.4 inches in all investigations on this lake.  Many of the pike captured in 2006 were age four.  Pike growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2006 (10.2/gillnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and were similar to the median perch catch of 10.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2006 averaged 6.8 inches (0.17 lb), which was somewhat larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was similar to the average perch size of 7.0 inches in all investigations on this lake.  Perch growth was normal (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2006 (7.2/trapnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class, and were higher than the median bluegill catch of 3.5/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2006 averaged 6.9 inches (0.30 lb), which was somewhat larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class, but was similar to the average bluegill size of 7.1 inches in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the fish examined in 2006 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the fish also had yellow grub.  One perch had some leeches attached to it, and one walleye had a growth under the skin.  Neascus, yellow grub, and leeches are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

There is a concrete boat ramp and dock located on the west side of the lake for public access.  <br> \n <br> \nSabin is the most upstream lake on the Embarrass River. Fish may move between Sabin Lake and Wynne Lake (downstream) through a narrows that is navigable by boat except in very low flow periods. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Sabin Lake consist mostly of rubble, gravel, sand, and boulder. Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 feet. The most common plants are waterlilies and burreeds. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2016 survey of Sabin Lake were similar to past assessments. Walleye were sampled in numbers slightly above average compared to other similar lakes in the area. Northern pike, bluegill and black crappie numbers indicate populations that are slightly below average by comparison to other similar area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2016 (4.1/gill net) were slightly below the historic average for Sabin Lake. Walleye in Sabin are very slow growing. An walleye  11 inches was typically about 4 years old. The largest walleye sampled was 22.2 inches long which was the only walleye over 16 inches sampled in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2016 (1.6/gill net) were below the historic average for Sabin Lake. The average pike sampled was 20 inches long and the largest pike was just over 31 inches. Only two pike over 24 inches were sampled in the gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2016 (3.8/trap net) was nearly identical to the historic average for this lake. The average bluegill sampled was 7.6 inches long and about 5 years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.2 inches long. Fifty percent ot the bluegill sampled in 2016 were 8 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2016 (2.2/trap net) were slightly below the historic average for Sabin Lake. The average crappie sampled was 9.4 inches long and the largest crappie was 11.6 inches. Thirty percent of the crappie sampled in 2016 were 10 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
