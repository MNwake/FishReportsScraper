Age 3 fish were predominant in the gill net catch. Growth of age 1 females was fast. Females age 2 and older and males of all ages showed good growth. Bluegill abundance was similar to 1983 abundance and the local average. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.6 inches with a modal length increment of 6.0-6.4 inches. Eleven Largemouth Bass from 6.5 to 17 inches in length were captured in spring by seining. Growth of these fish was slow during age 1 and good thereafter. Thirty-nine tournament caught bass ranging from 7 to 15 inches in length with a median length of 11 inches were sampled. Growth of these fish was good at all ages. Fourteen young-of-year Largemouth Bass were captured during shoreline seining. Yellow Bullhead catch decreased significantly from 1983 levels.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except two sites where dense vegetation prevented seining. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling captured 17 species of fish, including four intolerant species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter). The near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Charlotte Lake is located in the North Fork Crow River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were present in numbers about equal to the expected catch for lakes similar to Charlotte, but Northern Pike and Yellow Bullhead numbers were abundant, above the expected range of values.The catch of Northern Pike (10.8/gill net) was significantly higher than that of 1989 but similar to 1983.  Northern Pike averaged 20 inches long and weighed about two pounds.    Largemouth Bass were caught by an angling group in 1994.  The angler group provided this information since Largemouth Bass are not taken readily with nets and no directed effort was made to sample with electrofishing gear.  Largemouth Bass are thought to be abundant in Lake Charlotte and anglers caught them at a rate of 1.0/hour on the evening of 6/25/94.  Largemouth ranged in size from 7.1 - 16.3 inches in length.  Growth was average.  Largemouth Bass in excess of five pounds are known to have been taken by anglers from Lake Charlotte.Bluegill (17.8/trap net) have been historically abundant, small and slow growing.  Only one Bluegill larger than 7.5 inches was taken and Bluegill in trap nets averaged 6.0 inches and 0.2 pounds.Yellow Bullhead (15.0/trap net) were abundant and are an important predator in this ecosystem.  The healthy population structure showed a range of sizes from 6.9 - 12.0 inches.Only one Walleye was captured during this survey, not surprising since there is no natural reproduction and just one stocking (1990, 150 yearlings) has taken place since 1981.  In small, clear lakes like Lake Charlotte, where Northern Pike are abundant and yellow perch are absent, walleye introductions are usually not successful.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is located in Wright County, west of the town of Hanover.  A small public access located at the north end of the lake has a boat ramp but few parking spaces.  Charlotte is 235 acres in size, with a mean depth of 22 feet and a maximum depth of 46 feet.  The lake maintains good water clarity throughout the year, and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  A fisheries survey was conducted in 2000 to assess these and other gamefish populations.  Northern pike abundance was typical of small, clear lakes like Charlotte.  The average size of pike captured in gill nets was 20 inches (2.1 pounds), and the largest individual was 31 inches.  Numbers of pike were down from the previous survey in 1995, although the average size was unchanged.  The growth rate of pike in Charlotte Lake has been slow compared to the statewide average, but may improve with a lower population and reduced competition.  Past attempts to stock walleye in the lake have had very little success, and the Department of Natural Resources is not currently managing the lake for walleye.  The lake contains few yellow perch, which is an important food of walleye.  Northern pike also prefer yellow perch, and unless pike numbers are reduced, it is unlikely that the lake will support a large number of perch.The 2000 survey showed that largemouth bass were abundant, with many larger than 12 inches, and a few larger than 19 inches.  Black crappie were less abundant than expected for this lake type, but average size was good (8.8 inches).  The largest crappie sampled was over 13 inches.  Bluegill were also caught in lower numbers than expected, but dense vegetation near some of the survey nets may have affected the catch.  The average size of bluegill was 5.7 inches, and the growth rate for bluegill in Charlotte Lake was slower than  the Minnesota average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is a 235 acre lake located three miles west of Hanover in eastern Wright County. It has a maximum depth of 46 feet and a small watershed dominated by pasture, row crops, and forest. A small public access with limited parking is located at the north end of the lake. Charlotte Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish and was last surveyed in 2010. Anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation was common along shore in late August, primarily white waterlily. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but Illinois pondweed, Canada waterweed, and flat stem pondweed were the most common species found in 2010. Water clarity was excellent; Secchi depth was 16.5 feet in late July and MPCA data show a summer average of 16 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 34 feet. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were similar to 2010 and within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Charlotte. Northern Pike were mostly small; lengths in 2017 ranged from 13.4 to 30.8 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 1.6 pounds. Only 9% of Northern Pike were 24 inches or longer, similar to 2010 (8%). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled on May 26 by daytime electrofishing. The catch rate (33/hour) was below the Sauk Rapids daytime average (43/hour) and similar to results in 2010. Lengths ranged from 6.7 to 18.9 inches with an average length of 13.0 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 25% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were lower than 2010, but within the expected range of values. Bluegill were small; lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches. Black Crappie numbers were slightly below the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.8 inches with an average length of 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is located in eastern Wright County, five miles southwest of St. Michael. It has a surface area of 235 acres and a maximum depth of 46 feet. A small public access with limited parking is located on the north end of the lake. Water quality is good and the lake supports a diverse community of native aquatic plants. Game fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was lower than the last survey in 2000, but typical for lakes similar to Charlotte. The average size was 19.5 inches and 1.8 pounds; the largest pike caught was  28.7 inches. Growth of pike to age five was similar to other lakes statewide, but growth was slower thereafter. Yellow perch are an important food source for northern pike. However, none were caught in the survey and this may hinder northern pike growth.  <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught by daytime electrofishing in May 2010. The catch rate was similar to the area average and 23% of bass were larger than 15 inches. The average size was 12 inches and 1.2 pounds; the largest bass was 19 inches long. Growth was similar to statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of bluegill increased from the 2000 survey, but was within the expected range for lakes similar to Charlotte. The average length was 5.3 inches and the largest bluegill caught was nearly eight inches. Bluegill growth was slow. Bluegill grew to 6.6 inches in length in seven years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low, as in previous surveys. The average length was nearly eight inches and the largest crappie was 11 inches. Growth was similar to statewide averages.  <br> \nNo walleye were caught and few were caught in previous surveys. DNR stocking was discontinued after 1990 due to poor success. A limited number of walleye were stocked in 1999 and 2008 by the lake association. Other species caught included: brown and yellow bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance has more than doubled since 1976. Ages 1-7 and 9 were sampled. Growth is average. The 1980 and 1981 year classes are dominant. In both years the northern pike spawning area was either not operated or listed as a failure. Walleye abundance remains low and appears unchanged since 1958. Scant data suggests below average growth. Largemouth Bass abundance appears about average. Ages 3-6 were sampled and the limited data suggests slow growth for younger age classes. Natural reproduction was found in shoreline seining. Bluegill abundance is higher than in 1976 but remains about average at 30.2/trap net. Similar trends appear for Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish populations. Black Crappie abundance is low but similar to previous nettings. Yellow Perch abundance also remains low. Yellow Bullhead abundance remains similar to 1948 and high. Black Bullhead numbers seem to have fallen to about average since 1976. Common Carp remain present in low abundance.</p>",
