                "narrative": "<p>The Berthiaume Lakes are small basins divided by Wright CSAH 35 and located one mile west of Buffalo in east central Wright County.  No public access exists although small boats may be launched from the road right of way on these natural environment lakes.  The lakes are deep and surrounded by a cattail fringe.  Little development has occurred.  No stocking has been done and management has been limited to this, and the initial lake survey done in 1983.  The Berthiaume Lakes are delightful little lakes which should provide many hours of recreational angling to riparian owners. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality is excellent and summer water clarity is 10 feet or more.  Curled pondweed, which is a problem on other area lakes, grew at or near the surface on 3.8% of  North Berthiaume Lake; and was sparse on South Berthiaume Lake.  Arrowhead and cattail were the most common emergent plants.  Coontail was the most abundant submerged plant.  At the time the surveys were conducted (mid-July), oxygen was adequate for fish down to 30 feet or more. <br> \n <br> \nFew changes appear evident since the last survey in 1983.  Northern pike catches were low compared to most area lakes.  Nonetheless, anglers have a good opportunity to catch a smaller-sized northern pike on these lakes.  Only one perch was taken during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe primary management species for the Berthiaume Lakes might be largemouth bass.  However, because of poor access and the abundance of aquatic vegetation, low numbers of  largemouth bass were taken during daytime electrofishing on North Berthiaume Lake.  A few largemouth bass were taken with trap nets.  With good water quality and abundant aquatic vegetation largemouth bass should thrive in these lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were more abundant than crappies in the Berthiaume Lakes.  Bluegill abundance was within the expected range for both lakes, however the average size was small (5 inches) and growth was slow.  Black crappie abundance was lower than the expected range for both lakes.  Only six black crappies were sampled and all were from South Berthiaume Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species taken during the survey included: black, brown and yellow bullhead, central mudminnow, green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality is a major concern for lakes in Wright County.  Surrounding land use practices can have a detrimental effect on the water quality and recreational value of a lake.  Maintaining the water quality in the Berthiaume Lakes should be a high priority for the county and the landowners around the lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
