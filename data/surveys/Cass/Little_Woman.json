Squaw Lake belongs to lake Class 37.  Other lakes in the same Lake Class are: Three Island (8 milesnortheast), Horseshoe (7 miles north) and Carnahan (6 miles northeast) Lakes. Game fish species caught in the trapnets include walleye, northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rockbass,largemouth bass and black crappie.Bluegill were caught at a rate that was comparable to Lake Class 37 lakes.  These bluegill showed a wide rangeof lengths and good growth.Only two northern pike and one walleye were sampled during this assessment.  Trapnets do not adequately samplethese two species and, as a result, catch rates should not be used to indicate relative abundance .Other species captured were yellow, brown and black bullhead and bowfin.</p>",
