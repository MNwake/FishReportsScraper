                "narrative": "<p>     A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Stalker Lake was conducted on June 28, 2018 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 stations, but five stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at six station.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \n     The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from 2018 standard surveys to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \n     Data from this survey indicates Stalker Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

There were no species with net catches that varied much from area medians. Walleye natural reproduction was evident as representatives from the 1981, 1984, and 1986 year-classes (skip years) were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, approximately 45% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading, which is the standard measure of water clarity, was 7.5 feet. Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.5 to 7.9 per net.  Stalker Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification system.     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located on the south shoreline.  The shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Stalker Lake supports large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice. These areas of emergent aquatic vegetation are important components of the lake ecosystem. They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat during all stages of life and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Bulrush and cattails act as natural shoreline stabilizers, reducing erosion caused from wave action and they can even absorb pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish. Because of their ecological value, these aquatic plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Stalker Lake is a popular fishing lake.  Recent lake survey data indicate that Stalker Lake  contains good numbers of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Size distributions for these species appear to be good also.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality spawning habitat that is available.  Growth rate estimates for Stalker Lake are faster for all species listed above than mean growth rates for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.      Walleye is a primary management specie in Stalker Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate has historically been stable and within the expected range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 20.3 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Test-netting data indicate that the 1999 and 2001 year classes are the strongest.  These two year classes correspond to years when walleye  fingerlings were stocked.  Fingerling stocking appears to be able to maintain a stable walleye fishery in Stalker Lake.  Future DNR management will include biennial walleye fingerling stocking to supplement low to moderate levels of natural reproduction.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.9 inches at three years of age.       The northern pike test-net catch rate was below the expected range for lake class 27 and the lowest recorded for Stalker Lake since the 1970 initial survey.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction consistently occurs, but at low to moderate levels.  Pike ranged in length from 16.9 to 26.1 inches with an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.5 inches at four years of age.        Catch and length data from recent assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists with a moderate level of reproduction.  In this survey, bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 18.5 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range for lake class 27.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Nineteen percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.8 inches at five years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant small fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 7.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 7.9 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Stalker Lake is included in lake class 27; other area lakes in this same classification include West Battle, Eagle, South Ten Mile, Crystal, and Little McDonald. <br> \n     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout Stalker Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stalker Lake is a popular angling lake.  Recent lake survey data indicate that Stalker Lake has good populations of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie.  Size distributions for these species appear to be good also.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in Stalker Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.0 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that the strongest year classes consistently correspond to years when walleye fingerlings are stocked.  Catch data indicate that biennial fingerling stocking can maintain a stable walleye population in Stalker Lake. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Age and length data from recent assessments indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 9.1 to 37.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 1.9 pounds.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists with a moderate level of reproduction.  Bass ranged in length from 9.0 to 17.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.      <br> \n     Data from recent assessments indicate that the black crappie population is abundant and has a good size structure.  Fifty-eight percent of the black crappie gill net sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Stalker Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County, approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 lake survey was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased slightly from the previous three surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at three years of age.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists and age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.4 to 29.6 inches with an average length and weight of 22.6 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.6 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Stalker Lake was listed as infested with flowering rush in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 6.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout Stalker Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stalker Lake is a popular angling lake.  Recent lake survey data indicate that Stalker Lake has good populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  Size distributions for these species appear to be good also.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Stalker Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 20.4 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 24.6 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists with a moderate level of reproduction.  Bass ranged in length from 8.5 to 20.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 15.2 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     An abundant Bluegill population exists.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable with thirteen percent of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Stalker Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 lake survey was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stalker Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 24.9 inches with an average length and weight of 18.3 inches and 2.4 pounds.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.0 to 29.2 inches with an average length and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.5 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists with a moderate level of reproduction.  Bass ranged in length from 6.9 to 20.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 15.2 inches at five years of age.      <br> \n     An abundant Bluegill population exists.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable with fifteen percent of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Stalker Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Stalker Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 9, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites with six sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four sites, a 15-foot seine was used at seven sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation or deep water prevented the use of seines at six sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and three native species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Stalker Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Stalker Lake is a 1,280-acre lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Stalker Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest interspersed with areas of agricultural land.  Stalker Lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The morphometry of Stalker Lake is unique; numerous humps and bars exist throughout the lake.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 3.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 7.9 feet.   <br> \n     The shoreline of Stalker Lake is moderately developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout Stalker Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Stalker Lake is a popular angling lake.  Recent lake survey data indicate that Stalker Lake has good populations of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Size distributions for these species appear to be good also.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in Stalker Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.7 to 23.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     A moderate density northern pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 9.3 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists with a moderate level of reproduction.  Bass ranged in length from 7.6 to 19.1 inches with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.      <br> \n     An abundant bluegill population exists.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable with nine percent of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at seven years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Stalker Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium and large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",
