                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is a 638 acre, shallow lake in east-central Mahnomen County.  Dense beds of submerged aquatic vegetation are present throughout much of the lake.  Roy Lake has experienced infrequent winterkills in the past.  A moderately severe winterkill occurred in 1996, the first in many years.  Oxygen levels became very low again in 2001 but the lake did not winterkill.  The lake is still in a state of recovery from the 1996 winterkill.The species most affected by the 1996 winterkill were largemouth bass and bluegill.  Bluegill trap net catches in 2002 (4.3 per net) were half what they were in 1992.  However, the bluegill growth rate was double that of 1992.  Fast growing one, two, and three year old bluegills comprised 87% of the sample in 2002.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 1.3 per trap net in 2002, compared to 3.2 per net in 1992.  All but one of the 15 bass sampled in 2002 were one year old.  They exhibited fast growth rates also.The northern pike gill net catch in 2002 was 8.0 per net, which is very similar to 1992.  Six year classes were represented and growth rates were above average.  Mean length of northern pike sampled in 2002 was 20.1 inches and proportional stock density (PSD) was 46%.  Relative stock density at 30 inches [RSD(30)] was 6%.Walleye fingerling stocking in five of the seven years since the 1996 winterkill succeeded in producing a walleye gill net catch rate of 7.9 per net in 2002.  The walleye gill net catch rate in 1992, prior to the 1996 winterkill, was at an all-time low of 3.0 per net.  The average for Roy Lake is almost 11 walleyes per net.  The walleyes sampled in 2002 were from one to six years old and exhibited very fast growth, resulting in a PSD of 81% and RSD(20) of 15%.Black crappie were sampled following the 1996 winterkill but it appears that they have not been able to reestablish a large population.  Only three were sampled in 2002 compared to 38 in 1992 with only half as many gill nets.  Carp were sampled in 2002 so they are still present following the 1996 winterkill.Roy Lake has the potential to winterkill in severe winters so it is important for lakeshore owners to minimize nutrient input to the lake by using best management practices.  This would include leaving a buffer strip of native plants along the shore to intercept runoff and to limit destruction of aquatic plant that serve to absorb and tie up nutrients.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake (also known as Simon Lake) is 689-acres with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  It is located along the border between Mahnomen and Clearwater counties and within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Dense beds of submersed aquatic vegetation are present throughout much of the lake.  Roy Lake has experienced infrequent winterkills in the past, with moderate winterkills occurring in 1996 and during the winter of 2017-2018.  There is a tribal-owned public access on the northwest corner of the lake.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in mid July 2022 to evaluate the fish populations at Roy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate in 2022 was 4.7 fish per net, a slight increase from the 4.2 per net observed in 2017.  The historical average catch rate is 8.5 Walleye per net.  Walleyes sampled in 2022 averaged 16.2 inches with the longest fish only being 17.1 inches.  However, 52% of the Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches.  The Northern Pike gill net catch rate in 2022 was 16.3 per net, which was higher than Roy Lake's historical average of 9.7 fish per net.  The average length of Northern Pike in 2022 was 23.3 inches and lengths ranged from 16.5 to 32.8 inches.  Fish 24 inches or large made up 39% of the sample.  Bluegill trap net catch rates remained well above the expected range and reached a historical high in 2022.  The average Bluegill sampled was 6.2 inches, with the longest one being 7.2 inches.  Bluegill growth appears to be stunted as very few fish grow past seven inches.  Black Crappie have historically been sampled in low abundance, but the 2022 survey sampled them above the state average catching 8.1 per net.  Black Crappie caught in trap nets were sampled up to 11.1 inches in length and averaged 8.2 inches.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers in 2022.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 5.2 to 17.1 inches.  Largemouth Bass averaged about 13 inches in length.  The Yellow Perch catch rate remained below the lakes historical average of 15.3 fish per net.  In 2022, 5.5 fish per gill net were captured.  The mean length was 7.7 inches and sampled Yellow Perch measured up to 9.1 inches.  The increase in Northern Pike abundance is likely keeping Yellow Perch numbers in low abundance.  Other sampled fish species included Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

Ecological condtions for bass and panfish appear to be good also, however the survey does not indicate large populations of bass or panfish.Roy Lake is a shallow fertile hardwater lake which does not show midsummer thermal stratification and has a dissolved oxygen supply adequate for fish life at the bottom.  During years of low water however winter kills have occured and it has a high bullhead population usually associated with winterkill lakes.  The walleye population is abundant and maintaining itself with natural reproduction.  Most other game fish species are contained at moderate levels of abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The current northern pike gillnet catch-rate is similar to the previous survey's (1987).  At 7.83/GN it is between the first and third quartile for this lake class (#40).  Ages one through six were found in the current survey but three-year-olds comprised 70% of the population.  Length-at-age back calculations indicate an exceptionally fast growth rate for northern pike.  Fast growth has resulted in a rather remarkable PSD=82, median length group is 24.0-24.9 inches.  The RSD(30) is only 4, suggesting angler harvest of larger northern pike and/or poor year classes in years preceding the large 1989 year class.  However, it is a trait of northern pike biology that as northern pike attain a size of approximately 30 inches, preferred habitat and forage requirements change.  Colder water and larger, higher caloric value forage species (tullibees, for example) are required to sustain growth and produce large northern pike.  Neither of these is available in this lake.  White suckers may possibly satisfy the forage requirement but they have never been abundant in this lake.  Therefore, the RSD(30)=4 may be more a function of the northern pike's biological requirements than anything else, and only occasionally do we see individual fish attain a large size.  The fast growth exhibited by young northern pike is likely the result of nearly lake-wide submerged vegetation to provide ambush cover and a abundance of small forage fish.  An ideal situation for young northern pike.  Despite the absence of very large northern pike, this lake can boast an excellent northern pike fishery and opportunity for the angler.Bullheads are abundant and have been since the earliest survey (1954).  Blacks, yellows, and browns are all present.  Black bullheads are generally the most abundant in this lake class but have consistently been near or below the first quartile value here.  Brown bullheads were the most abundant in early surveys while yellow bullheads have been the dominant species in more recent surveys.  Both gillnet and trapnet catches of yellow bullheads were extremely high in the current survey, far above third quartile values.  Commercial harvest of bullheads in this lake is under the jurisdiction of the White Earth Indian Reservation and it is not known if they actively engage in bullhead harvest or not.  The last commercial harvest through State of Minnesota contract was in the early 1970's.An explosive increase in bluegill abundance occurred in this lake between the 1982 and 1987 surveys, and has continued to increase since.  Pumpkinseed sunfish have also increased in abundance since the earliest survey, although not as dramatically as bluegills.  As indicated by current trapnet and gillnet catches, both species are now extremely abundant, far above third quartile values for this lake class.  Bluegill length-at-age back calculations indicate a slow growth rate.  Bluegills 6-7 inches in length are abundant and give rise to a PSD value of 64, but these fish are six to eight years old.  An RSD(8) value of zero illustrates the lack of larger fish.  The increase in sunfish during the 1980's coincides with a general low point in bullhead abundance during which yellow bullheads were apparently replacing brown bullheads as the dominant species.  Other lakes have experienced an increase in sunfish populations with the decline of bullhead abundance and it may well have been a factor in this case.The current largemouth bass test-net catches are somewhat less than the previous survey's but still well above the third quartile values for this lake class, as they have been since the 1982 survey.  The growth rate of largemouth bass is normal.  Recruitment appears to be good with ages two through seven represented and ages two through five appear to be strong, PSD=34 and RSD(15)=12.  Electrofishing should be conducted to further evaluate what appears to be an excellent largemouth bass population.Historical netting data indicates the lake has always supported a rather modest black crappie population for this lake class, fluctuating around the first quartile value.  The current trapnet catch of 0.36/TN is below the first quartile value.  Age and growth data from the black crappies taken in the current survey found five and six year old fish comprising 92% of the sample.  They exhibit slow growth.  Although a few large crappies were present in the earliest surveys, it takes only moderate fishing pressure on top of slow growth to suppress PSD and RSD values, currently at 39 and 0, respectively.The current yellow perch gillnet catch-rate of 25.67/GN shows a significant increase from the previous survey's 8.00/GN.  It is currently between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  Yellow perch net catches have fluctuated widely in the past without any apparent correlation to changes in the rest of the fish community, with one exception.  There apears to be somewhat of an inverse relationship with bullhead abundance, similar to that of sunfish but not as well defined.Walleye gillnet catch-rate has declined significantly from the previous survey, from 6.83/GN in 1987 to the current 3.00/GN.  It is now near the first quartile value for this lake class.  Walleye fry were stocked regularly from the mid-40's through the 60's, a combination of fry and fingerlings was stocked during the 70's, and primarily fingerlings have been stocked in the 80's and early 90's.  Walleye gillnet catches have varied widely from survey to survey despite the regular stocking efforts.  These fluctuations appear to be the result of inconsistent stocking success and also, occasionally successful natural reproduction.  A stocking blank between 1981 and 1986 indicated, from ages found in the 1987 survey, that a modest amount of natural reproduction had occurred.  However, a significant decline in walleye abundance was also observed during that period.  Ages one through seven were all represented in the current survey with the largest year class, 1986, coinciding with a fingerling stocking year.  Walleye fingerlings were also stocked in 1988 and 1990 but were very poorly represented in the walleyes sampled, attesting to the inconsistent nature of walleye stocking success in this lake.  Interestingly, walleye fingerlings stocked in 1986 were much smaller than those stocked in '88 and '90, suggesting smaller fingerlings may be more effective in this particular lake.  Growth rate calculated from walleyes in the current survey is normal.  The PSD=84 and RSD(20)=37 may be somewhat misleading due to the small sample size.  It may also be an indicator of a vulnerable, aging population where immediate recruitment prospects are minimal.Carp were first documented as present in this lake during the current survey.  By what means they were introduced into the lake is not known.  Test net catches are below the first quartile for this lake class but habitat would seem to be optimal and their numbers are expected to increase.  To what extent carp will impact future water quality and fish communities is not known.Roy Lake is a heavily vegetated, productive lake that has on rare occasions been the victim of partial winterkills.  This adds another dimension to fish population dynamics and possible explanations for the rather erratic net catches of some species.  The last known winterkill occurred in the winter of '63-'64.  Even if mortality is not actually observed, severe winters may produce some mortality in sensitive species like centrarchids, or at least add stress that may increase their susceptibility to predation or affect growth-rate.  If carp become abundant it may increase winterkill potential through the increased turbidity that they are infamous for creating.  An abundance of carp can also impact fish populations by disrupting spawning, hatching, and nursery areas, particularly nest building species like the centrarchids.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is known as a good northern, bass, panfish lake with occasional good walleye fishing, as well.  This lake is fairly shallow (16 foot maximum depth) and has experienced infrequent winterkills in the past.  A moderately severe winterkill occurred in 1996, the first in many years.  Oxygen levels became very low again in 2001 but the lake did not winterkill.  The fishery has recovered well, but has also changed over the past 16 years. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, northern pike and black crappie catch rates remained relatively high for this lake while perch catch rates dropped to a new historic low.  Low perch numbers appear to be negatively impacting growth rates of both northern pike and walleye.  The abundant pike averaged 21.0 inches in length and 2.0 pounds.  Pike were generally young (2-3 years) and none larger than 28 inches were sampled.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike and release larger ones to help balance the population.  On average, crappies were small and abundant, but a few individuals over 10 inches were also found. <br> \n <br> \nThe species most affected by the 1996 winterkill were largemouth bass and bluegill.  Both of these species were present in good numbers in 2012.  The average size of bluegills is relatively small at 5.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked regularly in Roy Lake and, with some natural reproduction also occurring, numbers are sufficient to provide decent fishing opportunities.  The average size of walleyes sampled in 2012 was 15.7 inches and 1.6 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nRoy Lake has the potential to winterkill in severe winters so it is important for lakeshore owners to minimize nutrient input to the lake by using best land management practices.  This would include leaving a buffer strip of native plants along the shore to intercept runoff and to limit destruction of aquatic plants that serve to absorb and tie up nutrients.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is a 689-acre, class 39 lake with 16 foot maximum depth, located along the border between Mahnomen and Clearwater counties and within the White Earth Reservation.  Dense beds of submersed aquatic vegetation are present throughout much of the lake.  Roy Lake has experienced infrequent winterkills in the past.  Most recently, a moderate winterkill occurred in 1996.  Oxygen levels became very low again in 2001 but the lake did not winterkill.  An extended winter in 2017-2018 will likely result in some extent of winterkill, but full assessments of the extent of the winterkill will not occur until after this study is published.    <br> \n <br> \nDespite Walleye fingerling stocking in odd years, the Walleye catch rate in 2017 was only 4.2 fish per net, which was one the second lowest rates observed since surveys began.  The historical mean catch rate is 8.5 Walleye per net.  Walleyes sampled in 2017 averaged 16.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate in 2017 was 13.0 per net, which was higher than Roy Lake's historical mean of 9.0 fish per net.  The mean length was 23.9 inches and lengths ranged from 16.2 to 32.2 inches.  On average, Northern Pike grew to 23.5 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate rebounded from the new low set in 2012 to 10.4 fish per net in 2017, but still remained below the historical average of 15.3 fish per net.  The large decrease in perch abundance can likely be attributed to the sharp, recent increase in pike abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie relative abundance as indexed by trap nets has historically been quite low, with the exception of 2007.  Trap net caught Black Crappie ranged 4.4 to 9.7 inches in length and averaged 8.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rates remained well above the expected range.  The 2017 catch rate was 51.6 fish per net, also well above the lake's historical average of 34.8.  This historical average is heavily effected by very low catches during the first three surveys of Roy Lake.  Lengths of sampled Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches with a mean of 5.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAbundant gill net catch rates (6.2 per set) and moderate trap net catch rates (2.5 per net) were found for Largemouth Bass in 2017.  Bass lengths ranged from 5.9 to 18.1 inches.  Bass averaged 13.6 and 10.4 inches in length in gill net and trap nets, respectively.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sampled fish species included Common Carp, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow, and Brown Bullhead.  Black Bullheads were not sampled in 2017.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is known as a good northern, bass, panfish lake with occasional good walleye fishing, as well.  This lake is fairly shallow (16 foot maximum depth) and has experienced infrequent winterkills in the past.  A moderately severe winterkill occurred in 1996, the first in many years.  Oxygen levels became very low again in 2001 but the lake did not winterkill.  The fishery has recovered well, but has also changed over the past 11 years. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, northern pike and black crappie catch rates were at their historic highs for this lake while perch catches dropped very near to historic lows.  The abundant pike averaged 21.7 inches in length and 2.2 pounds.  Some pike over 30 inches were also found.  On average, crappies were small, but large numbers of young fish should provide good angling in a couple of years.  Since yellow perch are the primary forage species for northern pike and walleye, it is concerning when perch populations decline.  However, northern pike and walleye growth rates still remain acceptable. <br> \n <br> \nThe species most affected by the 1996 winterkill were largemouth bass and bluegill.  Both of these species were present in good numbers in 2007.  The average sizes are not large, but there are some relatively good-sized bass and bluegills available. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked regularly in Roy Lake and, with some natural reproduction also occurring, numbers are sufficient to provide decent fishing opportunities.  Walleyes grow fast in Roy Lake and the average size of those sampled in 2007 was 17.1 inches and 1.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nRoy Lake has the potential to winterkill in severe winters so it is important for lakeshore owners to minimize nutrient input to the lake by using best management practices.  This would include leaving a buffer strip of native plants along the shore to intercept runoff and to limit destruction of aquatic plant that serve to absorb and tie up nutrients.</p>",
