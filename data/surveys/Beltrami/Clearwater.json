                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is in the lake class 27 and fish communities are compared with 103 similar lakes  throughout Minnesota. Bemidji area lakes in this class include; Big, Andrusia, BigWolf, Big Turtle, Blackduck, and Kitchi.  These  are typically large, deep, hard water lakes.     Walleye were sampled at a higher abundance than most other lakes in this class, though the weight of 1.5 pounds is slightly below class average.  Only the 1988 assessment had a highergill net catch rate.  Walleye abundance in prior surveys has fluctuated, often in response to adjustments in fingerling stocking schedules.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every third year and enhance the population, although some natural reproduction does occur.  Most walleye sampled were 12-17 inches long, and the largest was about 29 inches in length.  More than half of the walleye examined had neascus Spp (black spot).  Often as fish get larger and change habitat preference, away from dense vegetation, the amount of black spot will decrease.  Walleye angling success may be low, during some periods of the year, due to high yellow perch, tullibee, and white sucker forage availability.     Northern pike were sampled at near average abundance, for class 27, and the highest since 1981.  The weight is slightly above average at about 2.5 pounds and the highest since 1981.  The average length was 22 inches, with the largest at 32 inches.  Most northern pike were 2 or 3 years of age though northern pike up to seven years old were present.       Largemouth bass are present, and a few large individuals were sampled.  The largest largemouth bass sampled was 18.7 inches long.  Shoreline seining has always found bass fingerlings in large numbers, although adults are not easily sampled, by standard survey gear.  Black crappie and bluegill were below average abundance, for class 27, though a few quality size fish are present.  The largest crappie sampled was more than 12 inches, and the largest bluegill was 8.6 inches long.  Rock bass are very abundant and the size is average, for class 27, atabout 1/4 pound each.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also present, but abundance is low, and most are too small to be attractive to anglers.     Yellow perch are abundant to the extent of  being a nuisance for most anglers.  The average size is small at 6.6 inches though a few larger perch were sampled.  More than half of the perch sampled had the parasite Neascus Spp.(black spot) or yellow grub.     White sucker, redhorse (golden and shorthead), and tullibee (cisco) are abundant and provide an excellent forage base for the northern pike and walleye populations.      Whitefish netting is legal under a state statute though no whitefish has been sampled in test nettings.     Bullheads are present, though the abundance is low.  Brown bulheads to 13 inches were sampled.  One small black bullhead was sampled, and yellow bullheads have not been sampled since 1975.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 1008-acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet.  The size of the watershed that drains into the lake is 54,000 acres.  The lake is located on the border of Clearwater and Beltrami Counties northeast of Leonard.  There is a DNR public access on the northwest corner of the lake off of county road 4.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Clearwater Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes in this lake class are typically large, deep and regular shorelines.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Kitchi, Grace, Big Wolf, Big Turtle, Marquette, Blackduck, Big and Andrusia Lakes Clearwater Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, sunfish, black crappie and largemouth bass.Anglers have a variety of fish to angle for.  Best known for it's walleye, abundance in 2002 was higher than what you would find in other lake class 27 lakes.  There is evidence that both stocking and natural reproduction are contributing walleye to Clearwater Lake.  Ten different age classes were represented in the sample.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 7 to 31 inches with an average length of 14.3 inches.  The dominant age class is the 1999 year class which made up 45% of the sample.  Another abundant predator fish is northern pike.  The 2002 abundance was the highest found of all surveys conducted on Clearwater Lake.  Northerns ranged in length from 13 to 35 inches with an average length of 20.7 inches.  The 1999 age class was the most abundant year class making up 42% of the sample.A variety of food fish are available including redhorse, white sucker, tullibee and yellow perch that are utilized by predator fish.  This diverse forage supply probably contributes to the better than average growth rates of the predator species.Members of the sunfish family found in Clearwater Lake that anglers should have success fishing for are bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie and largemouth bass.  None of these species are extremely abundant but do provide some quality fishing.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their propety can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 999-acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet. The lake is located on the border of Beltrami and Clearwater counties about nine miles northeast of the town of Leonard. There is a public water access with parking for 10 trucks/trailers located on the northwest corner of the lake off of Clearwater County Road 4. Most of the shoreline of Clearwater Lake is in private ownership and there is a moderate amount of lakeshore development. <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen and temperature measurements taken at the end of July 2023 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to approximately 24 feet in depth. Clearwater Lake is a moderately clear, moderately productive, scenic body of water that supports quality populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie. Other common species present include Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Perch and a variety of sucker species. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye, with Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass managed secondarily. <br> \n <br> \nClearwater Lake has provided consistent Walleye fishing for much of its management history, and is known for producing large fish. The lake's Walleye population is maintained by intensive fingerling stocking, although natural reproduction is often evident in fish population assessments. The 2023 Walleye catch rate of 8.1 fish per gill net was in the expected range for lake type (3.3 to 8.8 fish per net). Walleye up to almost 30 inches in length were captured; however, the bulk of the catch was made up of walleye less than 18 inches in length (primarily ages 2 through 4). The presence of these year classes in the population should result in good catch rates for anglers in the near term. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 8.8 fish/net is near the upper end of the normal range for this type of lake (2.8 to 9 fish per net). Pike up to 40 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 21 inches and 2.3 pounds. Fourteen percent of the pike captured in gill nets were greater than 26 inches in length. Clearwater Lake has the potential to produce large pike because of good forage species present such as Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and redhorse species. <br> \n <br> \nClearwater Lake supports a Bluegill population that is fairly low density and with good growth rates, typically a formula for quality size structure, but in this case most fish were on the small side. It appears that most fish are not living long enough to attain large sizes, although there was one individual fish captured that was 9.6 inches in length. The Bluegill catch consisted mostly of fish ages 2 through 4 with sizes ranging from 3 to 6 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish documented in the 2023 population assessment were Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and redhorse species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 999-acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet.  The lake is located on the border of Beltrami and Clearwater counties northeast of the town of Leonard.  There is a public water access with parking for 10 trucks/trailers located on the northwest corner of the lake off of County Road 4.  Most of the shoreline of Clearwater Lake is in private ownership and there is a moderate amount of lakeshore development. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements taken at the end of July 2018 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to approximately 23 feet in depth.  Clearwater Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, with Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass managed as secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nClearwater Lake has provided consistent Walleye fishing for much of its management history, and is known for producing trophy-sized fish.  The lake's Walleye population is maintained by intensive fingerling stocking, although some natural reproduction is usually detected in fish population assessments.  The 2018 Walleye catch rate of 6.3 fish per gill net was in the expected range for Lake Class 27 lakes (3.3 to 8.8 fish per net).  Walleye up to 30 inches in length were captured; however, the bulk of the catch was made up of walleye ranging from 12 to 15 inches in length (ages 3 and 4).  The presence of these year classes in the population should reflect good catch rates for anglers in the near term. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate of 8.3 fish/net is near the upper end of the normal range for Lake Class 27 lakes (2.8 to 9 fish per net).  Pike up to 34 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 21 inches in length and 2.4 lbs.  Twenty-one percent of the pike captured in gill nets were greater than 24 inches in length. Clearwater Lake has the potential to produce large pike because of good forage species present such as Tullibee, White Sucker and redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were fairly typical compared to similar types of lakes, having increased in abundance since the previous assessment (2013).  The Bluegill catch consisted mostly of age-2 fish with an average size less than 4 inches in length, although bluegill up to 9.3 inches in length were captured during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Largemouth Bass historically have been low but the sizes are typically of good quality.  The electrofishing catch consisted mostly of large-sized bass from 17 to 19 inches in length (16.4 inch average length).  Generally speaking, Clearwater Lake's bass population is not overly abundant but contains some large fish.  Given the size structure it appears that if anglers are targeting bass harvest must be minimal. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish documented in the 2018 population assessment were Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker and several species of redhorse. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is on the border of Beltrami and Clearwater Counties northeast of the city of Leonard.  The 1008-acre lake has a maximum depth of 65 feet and a 54,000-acre watershed. There is a DNR public access on the northwest corner of the lake off of county road 4.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Clearwater Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes in this lake class are typically large, deep, and have regular-shaped shorelines.  Clearwater Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, sunfish, black crappie and largemouth bass.  Fishermen have a wide variety of fish to angle for.  Because of it's riverine characteristic, some species more commonly found in a river environment are also found in Clearwater Lake such as the redhorse sucker species. <br> \n   <br> \nClearwater Lake has a very good walleye fishery that is maintained by a combination of natural reproduction and fingerling stocking.  Walleye abundance in 2007 of 10 fish per gill net set is typical of past assessments.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 9 to 30 inches with the majority of walleye in the 12-15 inch size.  Eight different year-classes were identified in 2007 with the 2004 and 2005 year-classes making up 83% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has been relatively consistent over all previous assessments dating back to 1953, generally ranging from 5-10 per gill net.  Clearwater Lake has a reputation for producing large pike and the average weight in 2007 of 3.1 pounds is the largest of all the assessments.  Pike ranged from 13 to 34 inches with most in the 21-26 inch size range.  Pike have a diverse forage supply for good growth rates including a variety of redhorse species, white sucker, tullibee, and yellow perch.  This lake also has the physical characteristics such as large size and deep cool water refuge to produce large pike exceeding 20 pounds.  There are no protected size limits in place but anglers can help by voluntary release of mid-sized pike in the 24-36 inch sizes so that more fish can attain their ultimate size potential.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThere are many members of the sunfish family available for anglers to enjoy including bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, largemouth bass, and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance appears to be increasing and fish up to nine inches were sampled, however, quality (the proportion of larger fish in the population) in recent years has declined.  This may be an indication of angler harvest on the select preferred sizes.  <br> \n <br> \nMost of the shoreline around Clearwater Lake is privately owned and subject to development.  Development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds on Minnesota lakes. This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office or go to the following website:  www.dnr.state.mn.us/shorelandmgmt. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 999-acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet.  The lake is located on the border of Beltrami and Clearwater counties northeast of the town of Leonard.  There is a public water access with parking for 10 trucks/trailers located on the northwest corner of the lake off of CR 4.  Most of the shoreline of Clearwater Lake is in private ownership and there is a moderate amount of lakeshore development.  Water quality measurements taken in August 2013 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to 24 feet in depth.  Clearwater Lake is managed primarily for walleye, with northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass managed as secondary species.  Clearwater Lake has provided consistent walleye fishing for much of its management history, and is known for producing trophy-size fish.  The lake's abundant walleye population is maintained by intensive fingerling stocking, although some natural reproduction is usually detected in fish population assessments.  The 2013 walleye catch rate of 13.58 fish per gill net (13.58/GN) was above the typical range for Lake Class 27 lakes (3.25/GN to 8.81/GN) for the third consecutive assessment.  Walleye up to 29.2 inches in length were captured; however, the bulk of the catch was made up of young walleye ranging from 10 to 13 inches in length (age-2).  The abundance of young walleye in the population should translate to good numbers of \"eater\" size walleye available in the near term.  These age-2 fish should grow into the 15-inch length range by 2015.  Age-4 walleye were the second most abundant year class identified in the 2013 assessment, and had an average length of 15.2 inches.  The 2013 northern pike catch rate of 8.75/GN is near the upper end of the normal range for Lake Class 27 lakes (2.76/GN to 9/GN).  Northern pike up to 37.6 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 20.8 inches in length and 2.11 lbs.  Eighteen percent of the pike captured were greater than 24 inches in length.  With good forage species present (tullibee and redhorse), Clearwater Lake has the potential to produce large northern pike.  Bluegill and black crappie numbers have declined since the previous assessment (2007) to levels just within the normal range.  The bluegill catch consisted mostly of age-2 fish with an average size less than 5 inches in length, although bluegill up to 8.8 inches in length were captured in 2013.  The few black crappie captured were large, with an average size of 11.8 inches in length.  Four year classes of black crappie were identified indicating consistent reproduction in recent years, although the low numbers present may suggest that considerable angler harvest has occurred.  Catch rates for largemouth bass were generally low but the size structure of the sample was of good quality.  The gill net catch consisted mostly of medium-size bass from twelve to seventeen inches in length (14-inch average length) while the trap nets captured larger individuals up to 19.2 inches.  Generally speaking, Clearwater Lake's bass population is not overly abundant but contains some large fish that are not pursued by most anglers.  Other species of fish documented in the 2013 population assessment were pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, tullibee (cisco), white sucker and several species of redhorse.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clearwater Lake is a 999-acre lake, located 14 miles east of Clearbrook in Clearwater County. A targeted survey was completed on Clearwater Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during August of 2023 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 10 sites were sampled with a seine and all 14 sites were completed with backpack electrofishing. A total of 21 species were sampled, which included 5 species that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality: Banded Killlifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Rock Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2023 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Clearwater Lake. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score was 78 in 2023 which is indicates a high quality fish community for a lake with Clearwater's chracteristics. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nIn coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Clearwater River Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",
