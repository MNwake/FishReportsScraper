                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catches have declined slightly from the two previous assessments. A CPUE value of 11.1 Walleye/gillnet was recorded in 1989 which compares to 17.3 and 13.2 fish/gillnet in 1981 and 1986 assessments, respectively. However, mean weight increased to 2.06lb/Walleye in 1989, up from 1.73lb average in 1981 and 1.62lbs in 1986. Walleye PSD has increased to 74.0 percent, which reflects a greater percentage of larger fish in the population. Walleye growth was good with age 4 fish averaging 16.1 inches. Walleye growth appears to slow after age 5. Although this is typical for male fish, females also appear to grow slower, this may be partially due to the large number of fish in the 16-23 inch size range. The 1986 fry stocking was either very successful or augmented a strong natural year- class. The 1985 and 1983 year classes stemmed from natural reproduction. No age 1 or 2 Walleyes were sampled in the assessment gear. The abundant 1986 year class may have suppressed recruitment of successive natural or stocked year classes. Yellow Perch CPUE values have decreased from over 100.0 fish/gillnet in past surveys (1976, 1981, 1986) to 72.7 fish/gillnet in 1989. Yellow Perch relative abundance remains high in comparison to other local lakes and should still provide an excellent forage base and sport fishery. Northern Pike abundance has remained relatively stable. Mean size of Northern Pike captured was 3.73lbs. The structure indices indicate a very desirable sport fishery comprised of quality-to-preferred size fish; however, natural recruitment may be limited. Two 30.0 inch muskellunge were captured in the gillnets. Aging these two fish proved difficult. Age 5 fish would correspond with the last stocking. Bluegill trapnets catches increased from 11.5 fish trapnet in 1986 to 48.7 fish/trapnet in 1989. In response to a greater percentage of young fish in the population, mean size decreased from 0.29lbs in 1986 to 0.09lbs in 1989. PSD decreased accordingly from 83.0 to 20.0 percent. Length frequency data would suggest several year classes of Bluegills in the 3.0 to 6.5 inch range. These fish should recruit to a desirable angling size in 1990 and 1991. The Largemouth Bass population was sampled using electrofishing gear which yielded a catch rate of 10.46 fish/hour. Growth of largemouth is excellent age three largemouth averaged 12.9 inches long. Although not adequately sampled, anglers report good catches of Black Crappie and Smallmouth Bass. Yellow Bullhead gillnet catch rates increased from 1.69 fish/gillnet in 1986 to 32.7 fish/gillnet in 1989. Trapnet catches have remained stable over the last four assessments. Fifty-five percent of Yellow Bullhead were between 7.0 and 9.0 inches in length and should be desirable to anglers or commercially exploitable in 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is a 7,110-acre lake located in central Pope County between Glenwood and Starbuck.  For its size, Minnewaska is relatively shallow.  Maximum depth is just 32.0 feet.  It is the largest lake in the county and is a popular destination for anglers and recreational boaters.  Swimming is also a popular activity during summer months.  Municipal swimming beaches are located in Glenwood and Starbuck.  Three public accesses are available.  Two occur on the northeast side of the lake near Glenwood.  The third access is located within the Starbuck Marina.  Residential development occurs around the entire shoreline.   <br> \n  <br> \nLake Minnewaska supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  The lake is managed for walleye.  Largemouth bass and other sunfishes are also important to the fishery.  Although walleye abundance has decreased in recent years, gillnet catches remained above expected rates.  Catches averaged 6.9-walleye/gill net in 2010.  Mean size of captured walleye was 16.5 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleye growth rates are relatively fast with fish usually exceeding 16.0 inches in length after their fourth growing season.  Typical of most large walleye fisheries, natural reproduction accounts for much of the population abundance.  However, walleye fry and fingerlings are routinely stocked to supplement and increase walleye numbers.  The DNR stocks fry on an annual basis.  Fingerling stockings are prescribed following documentation of two consecutive poor year classes.  Walleye fingerlings are also stocked by the Lake Minnewaska Association. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes targeted by anglers include largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass populations have expanded in recent years.  Anglers can expect good catch rates of medium- to large-sized fish.  Lake Minnewaska has become a popular choice for organized bass tournaments.  Bluegill are also abundant and size structure of this population should prove attractive to panfish anglers.  Mean size of 2010 captures was 6.2 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Record-high black crappie abundance was documented in 2010 due to an extremely strong 2007 year class.  Crappie fishing, in terms of both numbers and size, should greatly improve in the near future as this dominant year class recruits to a harvestable size.  Northern pike abundance continues to increase.  In fact, pike numbers have not been this high since the mid 1990s.  Gillnet catch rate exceeded levels expected for this type of lake.  Mean length of the 2010 capture sample was only 19.7 inches but large pike were recorded in the pike catch.  Numerous pike exceeding 30.0 inches in length were captured.   The largest pike measured was nearly 36.0 inches.  Yellow perch catches averaged 31.5-fish/gill net.  Harvestable-size perch are present, but the greatest proportion of the population is comprised of smaller fish.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in the 2010 survey included bigmouth buffalo, black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2014. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure on Lake Minnewaska can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain fishing quality, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  The selective harvest concept promotes release of larger fish and harvest of more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure the lake will sustain enough spawning age fish and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nEurasian water milfoil and curly-leaf pondweed are present in this basin.  To reduce spread of these undesired exotic invasives, all boaters must remove all aquatic vegetation from their boat and trailer before leaving the public access.  For more information on how to reduce the spread of exotic species via water recreation visit the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/preventspread.html.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is an 8,050-acre basin located in central Pope County between the towns of Glenwood and Starbuck.  For its size, Minnewaska is relatively shallow.  Maximum depth is just 32.0 feet. Residential development surrounds the entire lake.  Lake Minnewaska lies within the Chippewa River watershed and outflows to Lake Emily.  It is the largest lake within the Glenwood Management Area and is a popular destination for many anglers and recreational boaters in west-central Minnesota.  Swimming is also a popular activity during summer months.  Municipal swimming beaches are located in Glenwood and Starbuck.  Three public accesses are available.  Two occur on the northeast side of the lake near Glenwood.  The access adjacent to the Glenwood swimming beach is relatively shallow and launching larger boats can be problematic, especially during low water periods.  The third access is located within the Starbuck Marina.  A long, shallow sand bar with rocks is located along the north shoreline in the central portion of the lake.  Boaters should be cautious when navigating around this area. <br> \n  <br> \nLake Minnewaska is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Eurasian watermilfoil has been present for many years, but zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2012.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html  <br> \n  <br> \nLake Minnewaska supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities. This lake is primarily managed for Walleye with bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  In 2014, the Walleye population exhibited relatively high abundance, good size structure, and relatively fast growth rates.  Catch rates averaged 8.3 Walleye/gill net.  Mean size of captured Walleye was 17.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleye growth rates are relatively fast with fish usually exceeding 16.0 inches in length after their fourth growing season.  Typical of most large Walleye fisheries, natural reproduction accounts for much of the population abundance.  Walleye fry and fingerlings are routinely stocked to supplement the population.  The MN DNR stocks fry on an annual basis.  Fingerling stockings are prescribed following documentation of two consecutive poor year classes.  Walleye fingerlings are also stocked by the Lake Minnewaska Association. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes targeted by anglers include Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations have expanded in recent years.  Both species are abundant and larger bass are relatively common.  Consequently, Lake Minnewaska is now a popular choice for organized bass tournaments.  Panfish anglers will likely find good numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Typical of most panfish populations, small- to medium-size fish comprise the majority of these populations.  However, Bluegill exceeding 8.0 inches and Black Crappie and Yellow Perch exceeding 10.0 inches are not uncommon.  Northern Pike were moderately abundant.  Mean size was just 22.0 inches and 2.6 pounds but large pike are present.  A few pike exceeding 34.0 inches in length were captured in 2014.  The largest pike measured was nearly 41.0 inches.  Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads are all present in Lake Minnewaska.  Yellow Bullheads are most common.  Size structure of these populations is impressive as most bullheads caught in survey nets exceeded 12.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2014 survey include Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2018. <br> \n <br> \nFishing pressure on Lake Minnewaska can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain fishing quality, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and harvest of more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical andphysical characteristics is 3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet.  Size structure of the walleye population isdominated by large fish.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.1 pounds.  Most of the fish were 15 inchesin length or greater and two-thirds exceeded twenty inches.  Lake Minnewaska was selected as apotential walleye regulation lake as part of the Statewide Experimental Regulations Project.  However,size structure of fish captured in gillnets, total number of fish harvested by anglers, and sizestructure of fish harvested by anglers indicates little need for a special harvest regulation at thistime.  Northern pike catches averaged 11.3 fish/gillnet, nearly identical to the catch rate of 11.1fish/gillnet recorded in 1995.  Northern pike abundance has increased in recent years.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 0.9 fish/net in 1992 and 4.3 fish/net in 1994.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.4 poundsin 1996.  Age-3 fish comprised 67% of the fish captured in gillnets.  This 1993 year class, the firstyear of normal to high water levels following drought conditions, is primarily responsible for catchrates and size structure in the last two assessments.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 46.0 stock-sizelargemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.3 pounds.  Two-thirds of the fish were12 inches in length or greater and 22% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches decreased from 70.6fish/trapnet in 1992 to 16.8 fish/trapnet in 1996.  Trapnet catches ranged from 11.5 to 70.6 fish/netin previous surveys dating back to 1981.  Gillnet catches also fell from 35.6 fish/net in 1992 to 11.2fish/net in 1996.  A decrease in angler catch rate between 1995 and 1996 was also evident in creelsurvey results.  Approximately 70% of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, comparedto 26% in 1992.  The increase in average size and decrease in catch rate is likely the result of poorreproductive success during the cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Poor year class strength in 1993 isespecially evident in the age class distribution of fish captured in trapnets.  Yellow perch catchesaveraged 32.7 fish/gillnet which is within the expected range of mean catch rates from similar lakes(7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet).  However, gillnet catches were much higher in the previous two surveysaveraging 105.5 and 105.4 fish/net in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured in1996 was 0.2 pounds.  Approximately  20% of the fish captured in gillnets were 8 inches in length orgreater. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catches averaged 7.4 fish/gillnet in 1992. The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 27 is 3.7 to 9.7 fish/net.  The lake management plan for Lake Minnewaska states a long range goal of 15.0 Walleye/gillnet. Catch rates have ranged from 17.3 to 7.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1976.  The size distribution of fish captured is indicative of a quality fishery.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.4 pounds.  PSD and RSDP-M were calculated at 77.6% and 34.9%., respectively.  These indices exceed the long range goal of PSD and RSDP-M of 60% and 20% respectively.  Walleye growth in Lake Minnewaska is similar to the mean growth rate of Walleye in other area lakes within lake class 27.  Age 4 fish average 15.6 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The contribution of Walleye stocking to population density is unclear.  Age classes established in 1989, 1987, and 1985 are the result of natural reproduction.  The strength of these year classes is similar to those year classes in which fry were stocked (table 1).  The current management strategy is to utilize fry stockings to supplement natural reproduction, especially in years when natural reproduction is poor.  Northern Pike catches fell from 4.1 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 0.7 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Catch rates have historically been low, ranging from 4.2 to 1.4 fish/gillnet in surveys dating back to 1976. A long range of 5.0-10.0 fish/gillnet is described in the lake management plan.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 27 is 3.1 to 8.4 fish/net.  Fishing quality in terms of average size of fish available to the angler is favorable. Mean weight of fish captured was 3.4 pounds.  PSD and RSDP-M were calculated at 76.9% and 7.7%, respectively.  Mean growth rate of Northern Pike in Lake Minnewaska is greater than the mean growth rate from other area lakes within lake class 27.  Age 3 fish average 22.7 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Lack of suitable spawning habitat may be limiting Northern Pike abundance.  Many lakes in the Glenwood management area have experienced a decline in Northern Pike density.  Low water levels encountered during the late 1980's may have further limited spawning success.  Daytime, ac electrofishing yielded 49.3 stock-sized Largemouth Bass per hour.  This is significantly greater than the CPUE of 10.0 fish per hour recorded in 1989.  PSD and RSDP-M were calculated at 77.0% and 37.8%, respectively.  Mean relative weight (wr) of Largemouth Bass captured exceeded 110.  The catch rate and size structure recorded in 1992 exceed the long range goals for Largemouth Bass.  Age 1-9 fish were represented in the age class distribution of fish captured.  This indicates that natural reproduction has been consistent over the past ten years.  The Largemouth Bass population should provide opportunities in terms of both abundance and size structure.  Bluegill abundance has continued to increase.  Catches have increased from 11.5 fish/trapnet in 1986 and 48.7 fish/trapnet in 1989, to 70.6 fish/trapnet in 1992.  The current catch index exceeds the inter-quartile range of mean catch rates (3.3 to 52.9 fish/trapnet) for lake class 27.  The size distribution of Bluegill captured indicates the population is dominated by small or young individuals.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  PSD and RSDP-M were calculated at 26.1% and 0%, respectively.  Bluegill growth in Lake Minnewaska is similar to the mean growth rate of Bluegill in other area lakes within lake class 27.  Age 5 fish averaged 6.3 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Yellow Perch catches averaged 85.1 fish/gillnet which is above the third quartile of mean catch rates for lake class 27.  Prior to the 1992 survey there had been a trend of decreasing catch rates for Yellow Perch.  Catch rates had averaged 161.8, and 72.7 fish/gillnet in 1981, 1986, and 1989, respectively.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 15.1%.  Yellow Perch catches averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet in 1992, a noticeable decrease from the catch rate of 32.1 fish/gillnet recorded in 1989.  The current catch is within the normal range of catch rates for lake class 27 and similar to historic catch rates in Lake Minnewaska.  The reason for the high catch rate recorded in 1989 is unclear.  Smallmouth Bass and Black Crappie were not captured in sufficient numbers to evaluate their populations. These species do contribute to the sportfishery of Lake Minnewaska.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is primarily managed for walleye with sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  The walleye fishery has improved greatly in recent years due to the production of an extremely strong year class in 1999.  Walleye catches averaged 8.9 fish per gill net in 2002, the highest catch rate documented since 1989.  Size structure of the population is good with the mean length being 17 inches and the mean weight being approximately 2 pounds.  Another extremely strong year class was produced in 2001, which should provide quality angling experiences for several more years.  Based on current growth rates, fish from the 2001 year class should recruit to the fishery by 2004. Northern pike numbers are relatively low and most fish are smaller individuals.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased since the last survey but the size structure is favorable to anglers.  In fact, 46% of the 2002 gill-net sample exceeded eight inches, which is the best size structure documented in over 10 years.  Sunfish angling has improved in recent years, likely due to improvements in water quality that resulted in increases in water clarity and aquatic vegetation abundance.  Survey data indicate moderate numbers of medium-sized sunnies.  Eighty-six percent of the 2002 trap-net sample exceeded 6 inches but only two percent exceeded 8 inches.  The crappie population resembles the bluegill population; numbers and size structure are both moderate.  The largemouth bass population has also benefited from the recent improvements in water quality.  Largemouth bass are moderately abundant and 12- to 15-inch fish comprise the majority of the population.  Smallmouth bass are also present in Lake Minnewaska.  Although no sampling that specifically targets smallmouth bass is undertaken, incidental gill-net catches and angler reports suggest numbers are relatively low but most fish are large individuals.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is an 8,050-acre basin located in central Pope County between the towns of Glenwood and Starbuck.  For its size, Minnewaska is relatively shallow.  Maximum depth is just 32 feet. Residential development surrounds the entire lake.  Lake Minnewaska lies within the Chippewa River watershed and outflows to Lake Emily.  It is the largest lake within the Glenwood Management Area and is a popular destination for many anglers and recreational boaters in west-central Minnesota.  Swimming is also a popular activity during summer months.  Municipal swimming beaches are located in Glenwood and Starbuck.  Three public accesses are available.  Two occur on the northeast side of the lake near Glenwood.  The access adjacent to the Glenwood swimming beach is relatively shallow and launching larger boats can be problematic, especially during low water periods.  The third access is located within the Starbuck Marina.  A long, shallow sand bar with rocks is located along the north shoreline in the central portion of the lake.  Boaters should be cautious when navigating around this area.  Lake Minnewaska supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities. This lake is primarily managed for Walleye with bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.\n\nLake Minnewaska is a popular destination for many anglers and fishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the quality of this fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2022 to assess the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Walleye abundance (5.7 fish/gill net) has increased since the record-low level that was documented in 2018.  Increased abundance is due to an extremely strong 2019 year class, which accounted for almost 45% of the gill net sample.  Fall electrofishing results indicated another extremely strong year class was produced in 2022.  Further increases in Walleye abundance are likely as this year class recruits to the fishery.  Average size in 2022 was 18 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The largest Walleye captured measured just shy of 28 inches.  Other gamefishes targeted by anglers include Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations have expanded in recent years.  Both species are abundant and larger bass are relatively common.  Consequently, Lake Minnewaska is a popular destination for organized bass tournaments.  Panfish anglers will likely find good numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Typical of most panfish populations, small- to medium-size fish tend to dominate these populations.  However, Bluegill exceeding 8 inches and Black Crappie and Yellow Perch exceeding 10 inches are not uncommon.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfishes are also commonly caught by panfish anglers.  Northern Pike abundance and size structure has increased in recent years.  If fact, record-high pike abundance (19.0 fish/gill net) was documented in 2022.  Mean pike size was just 23 inches and 2.6 pounds but larger pike were present.  Over 25% of the gill net sample exceeded 26 inches in length with the largest pike measuring almost 35 inches.  Anglers are reminded that Northern Pike zone harvest regulations were implemented in 2018.  Lake Minnewaska is located within the North-central Zone where anglers can keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the current surplus of pike under 22 inches to help reduce abundance and improve size structure of this population, and to lessen predatory pressure on small Walleyes.  \n\nOther fish species sampled in the 2022 survey include bullheads, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), and White Sucker.  Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads are all present in Lake Minnewaska.  Yellow Bullheads are most common.  Size structure of these populations is impressive as most bullheads caught in survey nets exceeded 12 inches.  Freshwater Drum also tend to be larger individuals and are often caught by anglers.  \n\nThe next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.  Lake Minnewaska is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil, zebra mussels, and starry stonewort.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html.  \n\nSunfish anglers are reminded that a special regulation was implemented in spring 2022 that reduced the daily bag limit of sunfish from 20 to 10 to help protect and improve sunfish quality on this lake.  For more information regarding the Quality Sunfish Initiative see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/sunfish/index.html.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is a 7,110-acre lake located in central Pope County between the towns of Glenwood and Starbuck.  It is the largest lake in the county and is a popular destination for many anglers and recreational boaters in west-central Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nFish survey records provide insights into the influence of water quality on habitat and fish community composition.  Land use changes in the 70s and 80s and diversion of effluent discharges from Lake Minnewaska resulted in reduced phosphorus concentrations, less frequent or severe algal blooms, much improved water clarity, expansion of aquatic vegetation, and ultimately, a much different fish community and fishery than previously existed.  Vegetation dependent and sight feeding fishes such as sunfishes, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and northern pike responded favorably to habitat changes.  <br> \n <br> \nThis lake is primarily managed for walleye with bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  Walleye are abundant.  Catch rates in 2006 were the highest documented since 1989.  Mean size of captured walleye was 17.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Growth rates of walleye are relatively fast in Lake Minnewaska with fish typically exceeding 17.0 inches in length after their fourth growing season.  Typical of most large walleye fisheries, spikes in population abundance are driven by natural reproduction.  Fry and fingerling stockings by the DNR and Lake Minnewaska Association supplements sporadic natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nGamefishes prospering with water quality and habitat improvements include largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike.  Expanded vegetative coverage affords nursery and escape cover.  Improved water clarity enhances feeding efficiency and survival of sight-feeding predators like bass and pike.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and smallmouth bass populations have greatly expanded in recent years.  Growth rates are above average.  Anglers can expect good catch rates of medium- to large-sized fish.  With development of a high-quality bass fishery, Lake Minnewaska has become a popular choice for fishing tournaments. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have also increased but average size captured remains short of management objectives.  The population tends to be dominated by medium-size individuals.  Mean size of 2006 survey captures was 5.9 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Sunfish fishing and harvest pressure has increased with population expansion.  Size selective harvest pressures may account for limited numbers of 8.0 inch and larger fish in the population. <br> \n <br> \nToo few black crappie have been captured in recent netting surveys to accurately describe population attributes, but crappie continue to support a popular fishery in spring and winter months.  Fishing success and size harvested has been inconsistent in response to variable reproductive success or survival of young crappie.  This member of the sunfish family is more tolerant of past habitat conditions, thus benefits of water quality improvements are less evident.  Resident anglers suggest crappie were more abundant and fishing was better prior to habitat improvements and development of a more complex fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has increased to support a good fishery.  Climatic instability has influenced annual reproductive success, but present population attributes can be qualified as a moderately abundant population of fast growing individuals.  Pike catches during the 2006 survey were largely young fish.  Mean length was only 22.0 inches.  However, growth is above average and pike exceeding 30.0 inches were fairly common in the total catch.  Review of catch statistics from prior surveys indicates average size of northern pike has increased. <br> \n <br> \nFish community stability and above-average growth of most gamefishes is partially attributable to an abundant yellow perch prey base.  In response to a balanced fish community, growth and survival rates are sufficient to allow some portion of the population to reach a harvestable size and add to fishing experiences.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnewaska supports a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Fishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain fishing quality, anglers are encouraged to adopt a selective harvest mindset.  Release larger fish and direct harvest towards surpluses of small- to medium-size fish.  Releasing medium- to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed are present in this basin.  To reduce spread of these deleterious exotics, all boaters should make concentrated efforts to remove all aquatic vegetation from their boat and trailer before leaving the public access.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is a 7,110-acre lake located between the towns of Glenwood and Starbuck in Pope County.  It is the largest lake in the county and is the basis of most tourism in the area.  Residential development surrounds the entire lake.  Eight resorts and two campgrounds are also present along the shoreline.  The lake supports a great deal of recreational swimming, boating, and fishing.Water quality and clarity have improved on Lake Minnewaska over the past two decades.  Total phosphorus concentrations have declined and water transparency has increased.  Much of the improvement is due to eliminating treated wastewater discharge from the old sewage treatment plant in Glenwood.  A new facility went into operation in the late 1970's.  Treated effluent is now pumped away from the lake and is used to irrigate agricultural land.  Leaching from individual septic systems of many lake homes was also eliminated when sewer lines were extended around most of the lake.   The city of Glenwood has recently received a grant to study and improve the discharge of stormwater into Lake Minnewaska.  Lake Minnewaska has a relatively low watershed to surface area ratio of 8:1.  The Trappers Run Creek subwatershed comprises about one-half of the 89.8 square mile watershed.  Water quality delivered by Trappers Run Creek is poor.  However, the water enters Pelican Lake which acts as a sink for most of the nutrients and sediment.  Lake Minnewaska will be adversely affected when the filtering capacity of Pelican Lake is reached.  There have been extensive diagnostic studies within this subwatershed and management plans formulated to reduce the nutrient and sediment load received from Trappers Run Creek.The improvement in water quality has caused a shift in the fish community over the past twenty years.  Improved water transparency  has allowed aquatic vegetation to become more abundant.  Aquatic vegetation provides spawning habitat and escape cover for many species of fish.  Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and pumpkinseed sunfish have all flourished with the improvement in water quality.  These species have provided excellent fishing opportunities in recent years. The down side to the change in water quality is the walleye population has declined in abundance compared to the 1980's.  Annual fry stocking and natural reproduction have failed to produce the occasional strong year classes that were responsible for increased walleye abundance and periodic excellent fishing in the 1980's.  However, it should be noted that the gill net catch of 4.8 fish/net recorded  in 1998, as well as the other catch rates recorded in 1990's, are within the normal range for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1996 and 1998 to supplement the walleye population.  The Minnewaska Lake Association also purchased and stocked privately reared fingerlings in 1998.  The Minnewaska Lake Association has also been involved in other management activities.  They donated necessary funding to purchase radio-transmitters to monitor walleye movement and locate essential spawning habitat.  Information learned from this study prompted further cooperative efforts to enhance spawning habitat in Lake Minnewaska and in the Trappers Run Creek inlet.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewaska is an 8,050-acre basin located in central Pope County between Glenwood and Starbuck.  For its size, Minnewaska is relatively shallow.  Maximum depth is just 32.0 feet. Lake Minnewaska lies within the Chippewa River watershed and outflows to Lake Emily.  It is the largest lake within the Glenwood Management Area and is a popular destination for many anglers and recreational boaters in west-central Minnesota.  Swimming is also a popular activity during summer months.  Municipal swimming beaches are located in Glenwood and Starbuck.  Three public accesses are available.  Two occur on the northeast side of the lake near Glenwood.  The access adjacent to the Glenwood swimming beach is relatively shallow and launching larger boats can be problematic, especially during low water periods.  The third access is located within the Starbuck Marina.  Lake Minnewaska supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities. Fish management is primarily directed at the lake's popular Walleye fishery.  The lake also supports good bass, Northern Pike, and panfishing opportunities.  These populations have benefitted from increasing water clarity and expanding aquatic vegetation diversity and distribution within the lake. <br> \n  <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed over the summer months of 2018 to gain updated information on fish community structure, gamefish abundance, and measures of fishing quality.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey to effectively sample Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  The netting component of the survey was completed in mid-June. <br> \n  <br> \nA change in survey methodology resulted in lower catch rates of Largemouth Bass than preceding surveys, but catch results continued to indicate Largemouth Bass are abundant.  Largemouth Bass growth was slower than anticipated, but age distribution of captures extended to age 14.  With such a broad age and size distribution of captures making up the population sample, fishing quality remains good.  Average size of Largemouth Bass captures was 11.7 inches due to the predominance of four-year-old captures from a strong 2014 year class.  Smallmouth Bass were captured in all survey gear.  Some modest population expansion was evident.  On average, Smallmouth Bass captures were a little larger that Largemouth Bass.  Average size of Smallmouth Bass captures during the spring electrofishing survey was 13.0 inches.   Nineteen Smallmouth Bass were captured in gill nets.  Average size caught in gill nets was 14.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The largest capture measured 17.3 inches.  Lake Minnewaska is a popular destination for organized bass tournaments. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches were much lower than anticipated, particularly in light of annual fry and fingerling stockings by the DNR and Lake Minnewaska Association.  Gill net catches averaged just 3.0 Walleyes/net, which was the first time Walleye abundance has ever been below the normal range for this lake.  Average length and weight of Walleye captures was 18.9 inches and 2.5 pounds.  The last strong year class was likely established in 2013.  Supplemental stockings will continue, but there is uncertainty as to what environmental or ecological factors may be impacting survival and annual recruitment of young Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches increased in response to elevated rates of recruitment in recent years and water clarity increases that have resulted in greater submergent vegetation coverage.  Most of the total gill net catch was comprised of pike measuring within a range of 18.0 to 22.0 inches.  Lake Minnewaska supports some large Northern Pike.  Ten percent of the gill net catch measured 28.0 inches or larger.  The largest pike caught measured 35.1 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther members of the sunfish family captured during the netting survey included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and sunfish hybrids.  Bluegills are abundant.  Strong year classes were established in 2012 and 2015.  Rate of growth was near average so many cohorts of the strong 2012 year class should attain 8.0 inches in length in 2019.  Crappie abundance is poorly estimated in summer netting surveys, since they tend to move offshore and suspend with warming water temperature, making them less vulnerable to capture in trap nets set near shore.  Crappie captures ranged from 6.6 inches to 11.9 inches, thus the population sample was comprised of at least two age groups.  Average size of crappies captured in gill nets was 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch remain abundant.  A robust and stable perch population is important to optimizing growth and productivity of predator populations.  A modest percentage of perch captures were large enough to add to angler harvest.  Age distribution of perch captures extended to age 7.  Fast growing individuals can grow to 10.0 inches in six years.  Approximately four percent of Yellow Perch captured in gill nets were 10.0 inches and larger.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during the 2018 survey include Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), and White Sucker.  Generalist anglers might take note of the Yellow Bullhead population and its fishing potential.  Size distribution of Yellow Bullhead catches extended to 15.3 inches which would be a memorable-size catch.  Freshwater Drum also tend to be larger individuals.  Drum are frequently caught by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nThe next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2022.  Anglers are reminded that new statewide Northern Pike harvest regulations were implemented in 2018.  The state is now divided into three zones - Northeast, North-central, and Southern - each with a specific regulation for angling and for spearing. Lake Minnewaska is located within the North-central Zone where anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Lake Minnewaska is supporting a surplus of harvestable-size pike.  Greater exploitation and harvest of small pike may increase survival of young Walleyes.  Lake Minnewaska is also designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil, zebra mussels, and starry stonewort.  Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels have been present for many years now, but starry stonewort was first confirmed in 2017.

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 24 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Minnewaska.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nEighteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and four species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Minnewaska.</p>",

A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were high, and some quality fish were observed during the survey. Thirteen percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length. Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Minnewaska are moderate and 7 year old Bluegill averaged 7.0 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was 9.1 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were low, but most of the sample consisted of quality sized fish. Approximately 52% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are fast; average length of age 4 fish was 10.2 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 12.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Minnewaska. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Minnewaska is designated as infested with Eurasian watermilfoil, starry stonewort and zebra mussels. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",
