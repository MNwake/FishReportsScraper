                "narrative": "<p>Wilkins Lake is a moderately sized lake with clear water located in central Aitkin County. There is a township owned public access with a concrete log ramp, but no dock, located on the east side of the lake. The surrounding area is a mixture of forest-covered rolling hills with various wetland types interspersed. Sand is the most common substrate in shallow water areas with a few pockets of gravel and rubble scattered around the lake. The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and provides good habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species. Additional benefits provided by a healthy plant community include stabilizing bottom substrates, reducing wave action and resulting erosion, and filtering nutrients and other potential contaminants.  <br> \n <br> \nWilkins Lake was selected in 1991 for an experimental regulation to enhance the size structure of the northern pike population. The regulation required anglers to immediately return all northern pike between 20 and 30\". The bag limit was three and only one fish could be longer than 30\". The regulation was in effect until 2007. When the time period for the regulation expired it was reviewed and determined that the size structure of the pike population did not change appreciably and hence the regulation was dropped. Northern pike are currently managed under the statewide regulations for inland waters. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has been lower in the last three surveys than what was observed in the 1990's. Northern pike caught in gill nets ranged from 16.6 to 29.8\" with an average length of 20.3\". Recruitment from natural reproduction has been consistent with an occasional strong year class contributing to the fishery. The lack of a suitable forage base such as yellow perch is likely limiting the growth rates of pike. Fifty years ago yellow perch were abundant in Wilkins, but have since declined. Yellow perch are stocked when available and juveniles are starting to show up in seine hauls. One adult perch was caught in 2014, prior to this no perch have been caught in gill nets since 1994.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in normal abundance for this type of lake at 1.8 per gill net and have been stable over the last 15 years. Walleye spawning habitat is limited on Wilkins Lake and recruitment from natural reproduction has been poor. All walleye observed in the 2014 survey originated from years in which the lake was stocked. Walleye growth rates are good and a large portion of the population consists of quality sized fish.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the 2009 assessment, bluegill catch rates remained low in 2014 (9.2/trap net), and have shown a steady downward trend since 1985, however, the size structure of the bluegill population is decent with an average size of 6.6\" and 11% longer than 8\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are within the normal range for similar lakes. Occasionally black crappie will produce a strong year class that provides some good angling opportunities. When present, crappies grow well in Wilkins and some good sized fish can be found.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches for largemouth bass have been stable over time. They ranged from 8.6 to 14.1\" in length with an average of 12\", which is about one pound.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilkins Lake is moderately sized with clear water and is located in central Aitkin County. There is a township owned public access with a concrete log ramp, but no dock, located on the east side of the lake. The surrounding area is a mixture of forest-covered rolling hills with various wetland types interspersed. Sand is the most common substrate in shallow water areas with a few pockets of gravel and rubble scattered around the lake. The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and provides good habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species. Additional benefits provided by a healthy plant community include stabilizing bottom substrates, reducing wave action and resulting erosion, and filtering nutrients and other potential contaminants.  <br> \n <br> \nWilkins Lake was selected in 1991 for an experimental regulation to enhance the size structure of the Northern Pike population. The regulation required anglers to immediately return all Northern Pike between 20 and 30\". The bag limit was three and only one fish could be longer than 30\". The regulation was in effect until 2007. When the time period for the regulation expired it was reviewed and determined that the size structure of the pike population did not change appreciably and hence the regulation was dropped. Northern Pike are currently managed under the statewide North Central zone regulations for inland waters which is a 10 fish limit, 22-26 inch protected slot, with no more than 2 over 26 inches allowed in possession. This regulation will allow for greater harvest opportunities for anglers and spearers, while still protecting a large portion of medium sized pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been stable over the last four surveys and lower than what was observed in the 1990's. The gill net catch rate of 3.7/gill net is just below the long term average of 5.4/gill net and on the lower end of what would be considered normal for this type of lake. Northern Pike caught in gill nets ranged from 14.0 to 33.6\" with an average length of 22.4\". Recruitment from natural reproduction has been consistent with an occasional strong year class contributing to the fishery. The lack of a suitable forage base such as Yellow Perch is likely limiting the growth rates of pike. Fifty years ago Yellow Perch were abundant in Wilkins, but have since declined. Yellow Perch are stocked when available and juveniles have shown up in seine hauls but not many are surviving to adults. Nine adult perch were caught in 2019 equaling a catch rate of 1/gill net, prior to this, only one perch was caught since 1994. The 2019 catch of Yellow Perch is likely the result of the most recent stocking in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in normal abundance for this type of lake at 2.3/gill net and have been stable over the last 15 years. Walleye spawning habitat is limited on Wilkins Lake and recruitment from natural reproduction has been poor. Historically, Walleye growth rates are good and a large portion of the population consists of quality sized fish. The average size of Walleye was 18.5 inches with fish up to 27.5 inches present in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates increased in 2019 from the previous survey to 16.0/trap net and are within the expected range for similar lake types. In the long term Bluegill have shown a steady downward trend since 1985. The size structure of the Bluegill population is decent with an average size of 6.6\", 5% longer than 8\" and fish over 9 inches present.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies are within the normal range for similar lakes and survey net catches have shown fairly stable results going back to the mid 1980's. Prior to that abundance was a bit higher. Occasionally Black Crappie will produce a strong year class that provides some good angling opportunities. When present, crappies grow well in Wilkins and some good sized fish can be found. It's not uncommon to find crappie larger than 10 inches in Wilkins Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches for Largemouth Bass have been stable over time and equaled the long term catch rate of 2.1/gill net. Sizes ranged from 7.1 to 14.7\" in length, with an average of 11.0\" and weight of about one pound.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilkins Lake is located in central Aitkin County and is 372 acres in size. About a quarter of the lake is 15 feet deep or less and the maximum depth is 39 feet.  The water is clear with good water quality. The surrounding area is a mixture of forest covered rolling hills, and marsh. Wilkins Lake was selected in 1991 for an experimental regulation to enhance the size structure of the northern pike population.  The regulation requires anglers to immediately return all northern pike between 20 and 30 inches.  The bag limit is three and only one fish can be longer than 30 inches. The regulation will be in effect until 2007.Northern pike have decreased in abundance since 1999 but still have a wide range of sizes available to the angler.  Gill net caught northern pike ranged in length from 13 to 27 inches with an average length of just under 20 inches. Recruitment from natural reproduction has been consistent with an occasional strong year class contributing to the fishery.  The strong 2001-year class produced pike between 17 to 18 inches long in 2004. These fish will be available for anglers to harvest until they grow into the protected slot in a couple of years.  Walleye are present in normal abundance for this lake type with most of the fish coming from stocked year classes.  Walleye spawning habitat is limited on Wilkins Lake and recruitment from natural reproduction has been poor.  Walleye growth rates are good and a large portion of the population consists of quality fish.  The bluegill population has stabilized at about 15 fish per trap net.  The reduced number of bluegill seen in the last two surveys could be the result of a significant loss of hardstem bulrush in spawning and nursery areas. The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.5 to 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of less than 6 inches, which was similar to what was observed in 1999.  Black crappie are not overly abundant but do have a quality size structure that provides some good angling opportunities.  Black crappie sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 5.5 to 13.7 inches with a mean length of almost 10 inches.  Largemouth bass have decreased in abundance since 1999 but are still within the normal range for this lake type.  Bass sampled ranged from 7 to 14 inches in length with most of them greater than 10 inches in length.An important issue on Wilkins Lake at the present time is the loss of habitat.  Large areas of emergent vegetation, specifically hardstem bulrush that once ringed the shoreline have disappeared. These bulrush stands are very important to lake ecology.  Bulrush provides spawning habitat for panfish, nursery cover for young fish, helps stabilize substrate, and removes nutrients form the water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilkins Lake is located in central Aitkin County and is 372 acres in size. A public access is located on the east side of the lake.  About a quarter of the lake is 15 feet deep or less and the maximum depth is 39 feet.  The water is clear with good water quality. The surrounding area is a mixture of forest-covered rolling hills, and marsh.  <br> \n <br> \nWilkins Lake was selected in 1991 for an experimental regulation to enhance the size structure of the northern pike population.  The regulation required anglers to immediately return all northern pike between 20 and 30 inches.  The bag limit was three and only one fish could be longer than 30 inches. The regulation was in effect until 2007. When the time period for the regulation expired it was reviewed and determined that the size structure of the pike population did not change appreciably and hence the regulation was dropped.  Northern pike are currently managed under the statewide limit for inland waters. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have increased in abundance since 2004, but catches have been lower in the last two surveys than what was observed in the 1990s. Northern pike caught in gill nets ranged in length from 11 to 32 inches with an average length of 20.5 inches. Recruitment from natural reproduction has been consistent with an occasional strong year class contributing to the fishery.  The lack of a suitable forage base such as yellow perch is likely limiting the growth rates of pike to some degree.  Fifty years ago yellow perch were abundant in Wilkins, but have since declined and no perch have been caught in gill nets since 1994.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in normal abundance for this lake type at 2.5 per net and have been stable over the last 10 years. Walleye spawning habitat is limited on Wilkins Lake and recruitment from natural reproduction has been poor.  All walleye from the 2009 survey originated from years in which the lake was stocked.  Walleye growth rates are good and a large portion of the population consists of quality fish.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have declined from about 15 fish per trap net in 2004 to 7.4 per net in 2009, and have shown a steady downward trend since 1985.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are within the normal range for this lake type.  Occasionally black crappie will produce a strong year class that provides some good angling opportunities.  When present, crappies grow well in Wilkins and some good sized fish can be found.  Gillnet catches for largemouth bass have increased back to levels seen in the 1990\u0019s and are above average for this lake type.  Bass sampled ranged from 6 to 17 inches in length with an average of about 11 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nAn important issue facing Wilkins Lake at the present time is the loss of habitat.   <br> \nThe reduced number of bluegill seen in the last two surveys as well as the sporadic recruitment of black crappie could be the result of a significant loss of hard-stem bulrush in spawning and nursery areas. Large areas of emergent vegetation, specifically hard-stem bulrush that once ringed the shoreline have disappeared. These bulrush stands are very important to the lake ecology.  It is essential to protect and maintain these bulrush stands as they provide spawning habitat for panfish, nursery cover for young fish, stabilize substrate and shorelines, and remove nutrients from the water. <br> \n</p>",

Population indices for black crappie, yellow perch and walleye range from 45 to 90 percent of the state wide medians. The growth rates for rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill and walleye are more than 20 percent slower than the means given in the lake survey manual and are considered as slow growth. The growth rate for black crappie is good, while northern pike show good growth for the first three annuli and then slow down to less than 20 percent of the normal growth rate. The northern pike, pumpkinseed and bluegill have shown a steady increase in abundance while the yellow perch have shown a steady decrease in numbers.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of July 28, 2014.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but one site was sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used at 2 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site.  Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, mimic shiner, and rock bass.  <br> \n <br> \nWilkins Lake falls within lake class 31 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (90% CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59.  The IBI score calculated from this survey, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 population assessment, was 43. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring panfish netting occurred on Wilkins Lake between 5/21/19 and 5/23/19. Five standard trap nets were lifted over a 2 day period for a total of 10 lifts.  Panfish are often found in near shore areas during the spring and sampling at that time can sometimes give you a better understanding of the size structure of Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. Bluegill comprised the majority of the catch and were caught at a rate of 23.9/net, which was higher than what was caught during the Standard Survey in late July (16/net). Bluegill were also larger during the spring survey with an average length of 7.3 inches and a maximum length of 9.2 inches in comparison to 6.6 inches and 9.1 inches in the summer.  Spring sampling yielded RSD-P=22 compared with RSD-P=5 in the summer. The next most abundant species was Black crappie at 1.7/net which was also slightly higher than the Standard Survey (1.1/net).  Black Crappie were actually larger in the summer averaging 8.8 inches compared with 7.6 inches in the spring. The Standard Survey gillnets did however catch some larger crappies averaging 9.5 inches.  Water temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the survey.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilkins Lake consists of 372 acres with the surrounding land forested and marshy.  The water quality is good and water transparency was 12 feet during the survey in 1999.  The lake has several areas with abundant native aquatic vegetation, which are important to healthy fish communities.  Aquatic plants provide rearing, cover, and feeding habitats for fish at various life stages.  It is important to preserve these shoreline habitats for the health of the lake.       In 1991, Wilkins Lake was selected for an experimental regulation to enhance sizes of northern pike.  The experimental regulation, which is in effect until March 1, 2007, requires anglers to immediately release northern pike between 20 and 30 inches.  The survey in 1999 was conducted to monitor trends in the fish community prior to the final evaluation of the regulation in 2007.       During this survey, northern pike averaged 19.4 inches long and there were excellent numbers of pike between 17 and 20 inches for anglers to harvest.  Northern pike numbers in the lake have increased since the 1994 survey.  Selective harvest of smaller pike and release of larger pike, which are effective predators of small northern pike, will act to increase the catch rates of larger pike while reducing the numbers of smaller pike.  Many of the northern pike were thin and may be the result of very low numbers of large yellow perch in this lake.  Low abundance of perch may have been caused by a loss of aquatic vegetation which is used for cover, while at the same time, numbers of predators increased.  Such a reduction in large forage fish may decrease the condition and abundance of other predators in the lake.  In 1999, walleye abundance decreased from the past survey, but their numbers were still about average for this lake type.  Growth of walleyes was good with fish reaching about 17 inches in five years.  Walleyes ranged in size from 7 to 28 inches and averaged 18 inches long.  Some natural recruitment of walleye occurs in the lake however, about 80% of the fish were from years when fingerlings were stocked.  Both bluegills and black crappies were present in good numbers.  Bluegill abundance was about normal for this lake and represents a positive trend of fewer bluegills over the last ten years.  Declining abundance may reduce competition for food resources between bluegills allowing better growth in the future.  Bluegills averaged about 5.5 inches with 30% greater than 6 inches long.  The abundance of black crappies was above average.  The crappies sampled in 1999 averaged about 8.5 inches in length and were growing well.  Most of these fish were from the 1994 and 1995 year-classes.  Crappies provide a popular spring fishery on the lake.  Largemouth bass numbers in Wilkins Lake were above average and have been high over the last 20 years.  No large fish were captured and sizes ranged from 5.0 to 14.5 inches.  Bass were growing at a normal rate.  Other species in the fish community include bowfin, bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow, black, and brown bullheads. </p>",
