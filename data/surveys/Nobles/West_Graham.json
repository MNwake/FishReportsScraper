                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is considered normal compared to lakes similar to West Graham.  It appears heavy fishing pressure may have decreased the population of larger fish in West Graham.  A good population of walleye from a 1993 hatch is coming up in the fishery and should be between 1 and 2 lbs. for the 1996 fishing season.  It appears this year class of walleye originated from natural reproduction in 1993.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 22 inches and had an average length of just more than 11 inches.  A fair number of walleye more than 14 inches still inhabit the lake but the numbers are less than in 1992.The black crappie population is average compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 to 13 inches and averaged about 10 inches.  There are a lot of black crappie from 9 to 10 inches coming up in the fishery which should make 1996 and 1997 good years to angle crappie.  We sampled a good number of 12 to 13 inch crappie with our nets in 1995.The yellow perch population is on the rise according to our 1995 survey.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6 to 11 inches and had an average length of about 8 inches.  A strong year class of yellow perch were produced in 1995 from natural reproduction according to our shoreline seining results.The channel catfish population has increased since our 1992 survey.  Catfish lengths ranged from 19 to 25 inches and had an average length of about 21 inches.Other fish sampled during our survey included bluegill, northern pike, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, common carp, white crappie and hybrid sunfish. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of West Graham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

West Graham Lake is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources class 43 lake that has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and 3.65 miles of shoreline.  The substrate is a mixture of sand and gravel along the border with muck and detritus in the deeper water areas.  The watershed-to-lake ratio (watershed acres-to-lake acres) is 21-to-1 indicating medium to large size watershed draining into the lake.  The lake is connected to several lakes including Fulda Lake upstream and East Graham Lake downstream and fish movement can take place among the lakes.   A partial winterkill was suspected to have occurred during the winter of 2013-2014 when oxygen levels dropped to 0.4 parts per million (ppm) by March of 2014.  A spring winterkill assessment in April 2014 indicated that little to no winterkill occurred although some dead Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Channel Catfish were observed by fisherman along the shoreline after the ice went out.  However, each of those species were still found in good numbers in the lake during the spring winterkill assessment.  West Graham is managed primarily for Walleye while Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, and Yellow Perch are managed as secondarily.  Walleye fry are stocked 2 of 3 three years with the last stocking in 2014 and the next 2 stockings in 2015 and 2017.  Channel catfish fingerlings were last stocked in 2004 in response to a partial winterkill in 2000-01 and future stocking has been discontinued. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate (# per gill net) of 8.33 in 2014 was within the normal range of 2.28 to 18.06 for class 43 lakes, but below the long term average of 10.6 fish per gill net and well below the long range management goal of 15 fish per gill net.  The historical gill net catch rates over the last decade have all been below the management goal.  The catch rate was 4.00 in 2010, 11.67 in 2006, and 3.00 in 2002.  Normal catch rate ranges developed for Walleye in class 43 lakes within the Windom Fisheries Management Area indicate that the catch rate should more realistically be between 2.33 and 13.33 fish per gill net.  West Graham is within that range and historical catch rates indicate a relatively stable population over time.  Lengths of Walleye sampled in gill nets in 2014 ranged from 12.3 to 26.6 inches with a mean length of 16.0 inches.  The Walleye population had a balanced size distribution and the health of the fish in the sample was good indicating a healthy population.  The size structure metrics meet the management goal of maintaining a Walleye population with a balanced size structure which allows for consistent availability of catchable size fish from year-to-year.  Five year classes of walleye were sampled with fair growth.  Age 3 Walleye averaged 14.0 inches, Age 4 Walleye averaged 15.7 inches, and Age 5 Walleye averaged 20.8 inches.  The Age 2, 3, and 4 Walleyes sampled were likely a result of walleye fry stocking in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  The 2006 and 2009 year classes (Age 5 and 8) were not stocked in West Graham Lake and were likely a result of natural reproduction (2006) or fish that swam into West Graham from Fulda Lake upstream or East Graham Lake downstream.  Heavy rains during the fall of 2010 resulted in many Largemouth Bass and Walleye drifting downstream from Fulda Lake.  Based on electrofishing below the Fulda dam and reports from anglers on West Graham, it is likely many of these fish made it into West Graham. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch rate of 0.25 in 2014 was below the normal range of 1.17 to 20.50 for class 43 lakes and well below the long term average of 12.56 fish per trap net.  In addition, the 2010 catch rate was only 0.22 fish per trap net.  Prior to 2010, trap net catch rates were 31.67 in 2006 and 8.75 in 2002.  Successive low catch rates in 2010 and 2014 indicate a potential collapse in a fishable population to a population that is characterized by several individuals that may be reproducing unsuccessfully.  Only two black crappie, 4.33 and 11.50 inches in length, were sampled during the assessment.  The majority of black crappie sampled in 2006 were age three or older and many have likely died from natural mortality by the time the 2014 assessment was completed.  The lack of year classes of Black Crappie in the 2014 assessment adds credibility to the concern of a lack of natural reproduction between 2006 and 2014.  Additional stocking may be necessary to boost the population.   <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish gill net catch rate was 4.33 in 2014 compared to 4.33 in 2010 and 9.33 in 2006.  No statewide normal catch rate ranges exist for Channel Catfish; however normal catch rate ranges have been developed for class 43 Windom Area Management Lakes.  The normal catch rate range for class 43 Windom Area Management Lakes is 0.00 to 3.00 per gill net indicating that the catch rates in West Graham are particularly high.  All channel catfish aged in the 2006 survey were the result of a yearling stocking in 2001.  Channel catfish were not aged in 2010 but were likely from the 2001 or 2004 stocking.  Channel catfish were not aged in 2014 as well, but larger fish were likely from the 2004 stocking with smaller fish from natural reproduction.  Total lengths of channel catfish sampled in our gill nets in 2014 ranged from 14.7 to 21.5 inches with a mean of 18.0 inches.  The Channel Catfish population had an overall size structure that was dominated by larger fish, however, the health of the fish was good indicating fish are finding adequate food.  The Channel Catfish population appears to be maintaining itself and thriving even though the DNR has not stocked Channel Catfish in West Graham Lake since 2004.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate of 2.67 per net in 2014 was within the normal range of 2.65 to 25.00 for class 43 lakes but below the long term catch rate average of 3.81 per gill net.  The gill net catch rate was 5.00 in 2010, 3.67 in 2006, and 5.33 in 2002 indicating a relatively stable population over the past decade.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in gill nets in 2014 ranged from 6.50 to 11.50 inches with a mean length of 9.47 inches.  The yellow perch population had a balanced size distribution and the fish were in good health indicating the population was in excellent condition in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER NON-MANAGED SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead gill net catch rate of 32.00 in 2014 was equivalent to the lower normal range value for class 43 lakes and exactly the same as the 2010 catch rate of 32.0 per gill net.  The 2014 gill net catch rate was also below the long term average of 60.58 fish per gill net.  Lengths of Black Bullhead sampled in gill nets in 2014 ranged from 7.32 to 11.89 inches with a mean length of 9.08 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Common Carp trap net catch rate of 3.25 per trap net was within the normal range of 1.00 to 5.51 for class 43 lakes but below the long term average of 5.22 per trap net.  The trap net catch rate was 0.56 per net in 2010, 3.56 per net in 2006, and 8.88 per net in 2002.  Lengths of Common Carp sampled in trap nets ranged from 18.82 to 28.15 inches with a mean length of 22.84 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWest Graham is not managed for Northern Pike and has not been stocked with Northern Pike since 1988.  East Graham; however, is managed for Northern Pike and the fish that are found in West Graham have likely swam in from East Graham or have come from Fulda Lake upstream where Northern Pike are also managed.  The Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 1.00 in 2014 was below the statewide normal range of 1.08 to 8.00 for class 43 lakes but the catch rate was within the Windom Area Management catch rate range of 0.00 to 2.00 per gill net.  The historical gill net catch rates were 0.67 per net in 2010, 0.33 per net in 2006, and 36.00 per net in 2002.  High catch rates in 2002 were likely the result of high water levels during the spring of 2001 which allowed fish to swim into West Graham.  High water levels in 2010 and 2011 also led to some movement of fish; however, it does not appear that the response was as high as what was observed in 2001.  Ultimately, the Northern Pike population levels are dependent upon high water levels during the spring when fish can reach spawning areas or move between lakes and find desirable habitat and prey. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2014 population assessment included Bigmouth Buffalo, Orangespotted Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, it appears that the low dissolved oxygen levels during 2013-2014 did not have a major impact on the Walleye or Channel Catfish populations.  The Walleye numbers and sizes have remained relatively stable over the past 10 years and the Channel Catfish numbers have increased over the past 10 years.  In addition, the Yellow Perch numbers have remained stable albeit at a low abundance.  However, it does appear that the Black Bullhead and Black Crappie populations have decreased since 2006.  This may actually be a response to improved water quality since the reclamation of Lake Fulda upstream (2007) contributing to better water quality from the watershed.  Increased water quality may not be directly affecting survival of Black Bullhead or Black Crappie, but instead it may be increasing the ability of sight predators such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye to feed upon the Black Bullhead and Black Crappie young-of-the-year leading to recruitment suppression.  In addition, Black Bullhead and Black Crappie are not prevalent in Fulda Lake and a drastic reduction in immigration from Fulda Lake may be a major reason for the drop in population.  Ultimately, improvements in the watershed and changes in other connected lakes can affect change in the lake that can shift the fish community to one dominated by sight predators and more desirable game fish species.  Future monitoring of West Graham will give further insight and potential management changes to address Black Crappie or Black Bullhead abundance may be needed moving forward.     <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the West Graham Lake fish community appears to be doing well with a diverse fish community that is relatively stable in terms of abundance and/or size structure.  Further Improvements in the lake for the fish community should focus on best management practices in the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will result in direct improvements for the fish community.  Wise use of our natural resources makes us good stewards to the land and water that all of us use every day. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515-acre lake, located southeast of the City of Fulda in Murray County.  The lake is connected to several lakes including Fulda and East Graham and fish movement can take place among the lakes.  West Graham is managed primarily for Walleye while Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are managed as secondary species.  Walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 500 per littoral acre, two out of three years.  Black Crappie adults were last stocked in 2015 to supplement the existing population.  Yellow Perch adults were last stocked in 2014.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 27, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate was 3.0 per gill net, one of the lowest catch rates ever observed at West Graham.  Historically, Walleye catch rates have ranged from 3.0 per gill net in 2002 and 2022 to 23.7 per gill net in 1992, averaging 10.1 per gill net since 1987.  Four year-classes of Walleye were sampled, including fish from 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020.  Walleye from the 2017 and 2018 year-classes were likely from fry stocking and the 2016 and 2020 year-classes were likely from natural reproduction, as stocking did not occur in those years.  Walleye lengths ranged from 13.1 to 22.4 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Catchability of Walleye in the gill nets may have been negatively affected by the high number of Channel Catfish that were caught in the gill net (51.3 per gill net).  Channel Catfish tend to twist the net tightly, thereby greatly reducing the catchability of other species, resulting in a low Walleye catch rate.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Black Crappie catch rate was 12.9 per trap net, slightly below the long term average of 13.6 per trap net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  At least three year classes of Black Crappie were present all of which were from natural reproduction, as adult Black Crappie were last stocked in 2015.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.2 to 12.4 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Black Crappie 6.0 to 8.0 inches were the most common, comprising 80 percent of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nSince surveys began on West Graham Lake in 1987, Yellow Perch catch rates have been fairly stable, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 1987 to 11.2 per gill net in 1995.  In 2022, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 7.0 per gill net, higher than the long term average of 4.6 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 6.3 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum have not been sampled in West Graham prior to the 2022 survey, during which they were sampled at a rate of 4.3 per gill net and 1.3 per trap net.  Lengths of Freshwater Drum ranged from 10.3 inches to 12.6 inches and averaged 17.4 inches.  Freshwater Drum were also sampled in East Graham Lake the Week of June 14, 2022, marking the first time they have been sampled in the West Fork of the Des Moines River watershed.  While it is unknown as to how Freshwater Drum ended up in West Graham or the Des Moines River watershed, we theorize 3 different possibilities.  The obvious one is an illegal stocking, which we believe is a lower probability.  The 2 other possibilities is through unknown drainage networks during high water events.  These are only theories and none of them will be able to be proven with any level of certainty.  It should be noted that Freshwater Drum are a native species to Minnesota but can be susceptible to winterkill.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance continued to be low at 3.3 per trap net, and will likely remain low or decrease because of the highly abundant Channel Catfish population.  Channel Catfish were captured at a rate of 51.3 per gill net, much higher than the long-term average of 8.5 per gill net.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 7.6 to 25.6 inches and averaged 11.0 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Common Carp, Northern Pike, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population in West Graham looked quite healthy with good potential fishing in the 2000 and 2001 fishing seasons.  The average walleye gill net catch was 15.20 fish/net set which was equal to the upper range for this type of lake.  Historically, walleye catch rates were 7.4 fish/net set in 1995, 23.67 fish/net set in 1992, 11.50 fish/net set in 1987 and 2.00 fish/net set in 1981.  Seventy-six walleye were caught in five gill nets with lengths ranging between 7.5 and 19.3 inches, with an average of 12.2.  Most of the walleye sampled were from the 1995 (17 %), 1996 (38 %), and 1997 (39 %) year classes.  Three seine hauls yielded one Age 1+ walleye which may indicate limited natural reproduction in 1999.  As a result, a total of 7,683 walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1999 at a rate of 14.9 fingerlings/pound.  The size structure of walleye on West Graham could provide a substantial brood stock for future reproduction.Black crappie fishing on West Graham should be impressive for the 1999 and 2000 fishing season.  The average black crappie trap net catch was 18.88 fish/net set which was higher than expected for this type of  lake.  Historically, average black crappie trap net catches have been 7.56 fish/net set in 1995 and 10.9 fish/net set in 1992.  Black crappie total lengths ranged between 4.3 and 13.3 inches, with an average of 10.5 inches.  Six year classes of black crappie were sampled which indicates natural consistent recruitment since crappie have not been stocked since 1988.  This year three seine hauls found 65 young of the year black crappie which can be attributed to natural reproduction.  Black crappie populations do not typically recruit consistently like the West Graham population.The average channel catfish gill net catch was 1.00 fish/net set which may be indicative of a low density population.  Total lengths of channel catfish sampled ranged between 12.4 and 13.8 inches and had a mean of 13.1.  Some fish are present for those who target channel catfish.  The black bullhead average gill net catch was 28.60 fish/net set which was low compared to other area lakes of this class.  Total lengths of black bullhead sampled in gill nets ranged between 4.8 and 9.3 inches and had a mean of 8.5.  These data suggest a relatively low density black bullhead population and a population size structure that consisted mostly of smaller sizes.  The average common carp gill net catch was 22.00 fish/net set which was higher than most area lakes.  Total lengths of common carp ranged between 12.5 and 27.6 inches, with an average of 17.1.  No common carp were sampled among three seine hauls which hopefully was indicative of poor reproduction.  These data suggest a high common carp population existed and had a relatively large population size structure.    To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of West Graham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515-acre lake located approximately 8 miles southeast of the city of Fulda in Murray County.  The lake is connected to several lakes including Fulda and East Graham and fish movement can take place among the lakes.  West Graham is managed primarily for Walleye while Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are managed as secondary species.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 25, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in West Graham have varied from 3.0 per gill net in 2002 to 23.7 per gill net in 1992 and have averaged 10.9 per gill net since 1987.  In 2018, the Walleye catch rate was 13.3 per gill net, the highest catch rate in the last couple of decades and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Six year classes of Walleye were sampled including 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.  All of the year classes corresponded to a fry stocking event, except for the 2016 year class, which represented 62 percent of the Walleye sampled.  It has not been identified where the 2016 year class came from, but it could be the result of natural reproduction or movement of fish from Heron Lake, where the 2016 fry stocking was highly successful.  Results from genetic analysis to determine where this year class came from were not available for this report.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 7.7 to 24.5 inches and averaged 13.2 inches.  Mean length at age-1 was 9.0 inches, at age-2 was 12.5 inches, at age-3 was 14.6 inches, at age 4 was 16.6 inches, and at age-5 was 17.8 inches, which is normal growth for lakes in the area.  Walleye angling on West Gram Lake should be good, as multiple year classes are present.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 2010, Black Crappie abundance has been low, at less than 0.3 per trap net.  The Black Crappie population rebounded in 2018 with a catch rate of 22.4 per trap net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  The increase in Black Crappie abundance was likely the result of the adult Crappie (N=3,750) stocking that was done in 2015.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.0 to 13.6 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Black Crappie angling should be good in the spring of 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Yellow Perch gill net catch rate was 8.7 per gill net, which is the highest recorded catch rate since it was 11.2 per gill net in 1995.  The Yellow Perch catch rate exceeded the long term average of 4.4 per gill net and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 7.8 to 11.7 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate was 2.3 per gill net, which was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 20.1 inches to 37.4 inches and averaged 25.1 inches.  Northern Pike have not been stocked into the Graham chain of lakes within the last decade, thus the population is maintained through natural reproduction or movement from other waterbodies such as Heron Lake or Fulda Lakes.  West Graham Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 6.7 per gill net, which is similar to catch rates since 2006.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 9.2 to 31.4 inches and averaged 21.3 inches.  The Black Bullhead catch rate was 25.1 per trap net and 48.0 per gill net, both within expected range of catch rates.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 4.7 to 12.3 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Bluegill, and White Crappie. <br> \n</p>",

WAE CPUE WAS TWICE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43, INDICATING A HIGH DENSITY POPULATION.  MEAN BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS WERE HIGHER FOR EACH AGE THAN IN 1987. APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE SAMPLE WAS REPRESENTED BY AGE-2 AND AGE-3 WAE RANGING FROM 14 TO 19 INCHES. NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE TWO STRONG YEAR CLASSES SINCE NO STOCKING OCCURRED IN THOSE YEARS.  ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN 1992 WHEN 68 YOY WAE WERE COLLECTED IN THREE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS. NATURAL RECRUITMENT APPEARS TO BE PREVALENT AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT.  THE STOCKING OF ADULTS AND FINGERLINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED TO ALLOW BETTER EVALUATION OF STOCKING OR NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN THE FUTURE. YEP GILL NET CPUE INCREASED FROM 0.5 IN 1987 TO 1.3 IN 1992.  YEP CPUE WAS BELOW THE NORMAL RANGE FOR GILL NETS BUT WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR TRAPNETS (1.9).  YEP LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 9.5 INCHES, REPRESENTING AGE-1 AND AGE-2 FISH.  THESE RELATIVELY WEAK YEAR CLASSES ARE A RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  HOWEVER, DURING SHORELINE SEINING 1700 YOY YEP WERE COLLECTED IN THREE HAULS, INDICATING SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR 1992.  BLC TRAP NET CPUE DECREASED FROM 22.2 IN 1987 TO 10.9 IN 1992 BUT REMAINED IN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ITS LAKE CLASS. LARGE BLC DOMINATED THE SAMPLE, INDICATED BY A RSD-P VALUE OF 98 (TABLE 1.)  HOWEVER, 15 AGE-1 BLC WERE SAMPLED.  THESE FISH MAY REPRESENT A RELATIVELY STRONG YEAR CLASS CONSIDERING TRAPNETS TEND TO OVERESTIMATE SIZE STRUCTURE BLC.  BLC GROWTH WAS SLOWER THAN THAT REPORTED IN 1987.  THE BLC POPULATION SHOULD SUPPORT A QUALITY FISHERY IN 1993.  ASSUMING THIS GROUP OF LARGE INDIVIDUALS PRODUCE A SUCCESSFUL YEAR CLASS IN 1993, THE BLC POPULATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO WELL.  BLB TRAPNET CPUE DECREASED FROM 284.00 TO 130.0 WHILE GILLNET CPUE REMAINED STABLE FROM 1987 TO PRESENT. BLB CATCH RATES WITH TRAPNETS WERE ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43 BUT WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR GILLNETS.  BLB WERE DOMINATED BY 7.5 TO 9.5 INCH FISH (PSD=13) (TABLE 1).  ONLY 2,000 LBS OF BLB HAVE BEEN COMMERCIALLY REMOVED SINCE 1986.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 90.0 (+/- 2.9) out of 100 possible. A score of 90.0 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is High (85-92). Approximately 53 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 81.7 (+/- 4.5) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderately High (80-85), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 99.5 (+/- 0.5) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515 acre lake located in Nobles County near the town of Kinbrae.  The lake has 3.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 8.0 feet.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while black crappie and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  A drop in catch rates seen in a 1995 survey resulted in West Graham's inclusion on the 1999 \"Catch up Lakes\" list of the Accelerated Walleye Program.  We since have modified the operational plan to increase the frequency the lake is stocked with walleye.  A partial winterkill may have occurred during the winter of 2000-01 when oxygen levels dropped to 0.7 ppm in February.  Many dead carp, bigmouth buffalo, walleye, black crappie, and channel catfish were observed along the shoreline after the ice went out in April.The walleye population is similar to lakes like West Graham.  Walleye numbers were down however, from the previous survey.  This is likely due to the partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-01.  Since the partial winterkill, the Division of Fisheries in Windom stocked walleye fry in 2001 and fingerlings in 2002.  These fish would not have been sampled during our survey.  Lengths of the walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.6 to 20.4 inches and averaged 17.6 inches.The northern pike population is high when compared to lakes similar to West Graham.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our nets ranged from 12.4 to 20.4 inches and averaged 17.1 inches.  The population was dominated by two year old fish and should provide excellent pike fishing over the next few years.The black crappie population is similar to lakes like West Graham.  As was the case with walleye, the numbers are down a bit from the 1999 survey.  This again was likely due to the partial winterkill in 2000-01.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 13.2 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  Many of the crappie caught were in the 10 to 11.5 inch range with some larger than 12 inches.  The average weight of black crappie was 0.7 pounds.Since channel catfish are susceptible to low oxygen levels, the population is down from the previous survey.  Only small channel catfish in the six to eight inch range were caught during the survey.  The majority of the population is likely from a yearling stocking in the Fall of 2001.The black bullhead population is similar to lakes like West Graham.  Lengths of bullhead caught ranged from 4.0 to 11.3 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Most of the bullhead caught in our nets were in the eight to 10 inch range.The yellow perch population was also down somewhat but still typical of lakes like West Graham.  Lengths of perch caught in our nets ranged from 6.1 to 8.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment, and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of West Graham through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515-acre lake located approximately 8 miles southeast of the city of Fulda in Murray County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, has a watershed to lake ratio of 21 to 1, and is a class 43 lake.  The lake is connected to several lakes including Fulda and East Graham and fish immigration can take place between the lakes.   A partial winterkill may have occurred during the winter of 2000-2001 when oxygen levels dropped to 0.7 parts per million (ppm).  A spring winterkill assessment in the spring of 2001 indicated that the winterkill was not severe although many dead carp, bigmouth buffalo, walleye, black crappie, and channel catfish were observed along the shoreline after the ice went out in April of 2001.  It is also possible that by the time we conducted the winterkill assessment in May of 2001, fish had re-populated the lake.  West Graham is managed primarily for walleye while black crappie and channel catfish are managed as secondary species.  Walleye fry are stocked 2 of 3 three years at 1,000 fish per littoral acre.  Channel catfish fingerlings were last stocked in 2004 in response to the partial winterkill in 2000-01. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate of 4.0 fish/gill net in 2010 was within the expected range of 2.3 to 18.1 fish/gill net for lakes that are similar to West Graham but below the long term average of 10.9 fish/gill net and well below our long range goal of 15 fish/gill net.  It was the second lowest catch rate ever recorded on West Graham.  The catch rate was 11.7 fish/gill net in 2006 and 3.0 fish/gill net in 2002.  Lengths of walleye captured in gill nets ranged from 12.6 to 21.5 inches with an average length of 17.2 inches.  Five different year classes of walleye were captured during the assessment.  Growth rates for walleye was good as an Age 3 fish averaged 15.8 inches in total length.  A strong year class from 2006 was more than likely from natural reproduction since Fulda, West Graham, or East Graham were not stocked with walleye in 2006.  Heavy rains during the fall of 2010 resulted in a large movement of largemouth bass and walleye from Fulda Lake.  Based on electrofishing below the Fulda dam and reports from anglers on West Graham, it is likely many of these fish made it into West Graham. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing on West Graham might be slow when compared to other years.  The 2010 catch rate for black crappie was the lowest ever documented.  The black crappie catch rate of 0.2 fish/trap net in 2010 was below the expected range of 1.2 to 20.5 fish/trap net for lakes similar to West Graham and well below the long term average of 12.3 fish/trap net.  The trap net catch rate was 31.7 fish/trap net in 2006 and 8.8 fish/trap net in 2002.  Only two black crappie, 10.7 and 12.3 inches in length, were sampled during the fish survey.  The majority of black crappie sampled in 2006 were age three or older and many have likely died by the time we conducted the survey in 2010.  The lack of small black crappie in the 2010 assessment appears to indicate poor natural reproduction between 2006 and 2010.  Another explanation; however, could be that fish did reproduce and moved downstream to East Graham and have not returned to West Graham by the time of the survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate was 9.3 fish/gill net in 2010 compared to 8.0 fish/gill net in 2006 and 1.7 fish/gill net in 2002.  All channel catfish aged in 2006 were the result of the yearling stocking in 2001.  Lengths of channel catfish captured in our gill nets in 2010 ranged from 13.9 to 22.8 inches with an average length of 18.8 inches.  This lake might be worth targeting if you are interested in catching channel catfish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate of 5.0 fish/gill net in 2010 was within the expected range of 2.7 to 25.0 fish/gill net for lakes similar to West Graham and above the long term average of 4.0 fish/gill net.  The gill net catch rate was 3.7 fish/gill net in 2006 and 5.3 fish/gill net in 2002.  Lengths of yellow perch captured in gill nets in 2010 ranged from 6.1 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate of 32.0 fish/gill net was substantially lower than the 2006 catch rate of 228.4 fish/gill net.  The 2010 gill net catch rate was also below the 2002 catch rate of 40.7 fish/gill net and below the long term average of 64.7 fish/gill net.  Lengths of black bullhead captured in gill nets in 2010 ranged from 5.3 to 11.3 inches with an average length of 8.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe common carp catch rate of 0.6 was below the expected range of 1.0 to 5.5 fish/trap net for lakes similar to West Graham and below the long term average of 5.4 fish/trap net.  The trap net CPUE was 3.56 in 2006 and 8.88 in 2002.  Lengths of common carp sampled in trap nets ranged from 5.55 to 25.67 inches with a mean length of 19.13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWest Graham is not managed for northern pike and has not been stocked with northern pike since 1988.  East Graham; however, is managed for northern pike and the fish that are found in West Graham have likely moved in from East Graham.  The northern pike catch rate of 0.7 fish/gill net in 2010 was below the expected range of 1.1 to 8.0 for lakes similar to West Graham.  The catch rate was 0.3 fish/gill net in 2006 and 36.0 fish/gill net in 2002.  High catch rates in 2002 were likely the result of high water levels during the spring of 2001 which allowed movement into West Graham. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish captured during the 2010 population assessment included green sunfish and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in West Graham Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515-acre lake located approximately 8 miles southeast of the city of Fulda in Murray County.  West Graham Lake is a class 43 lake that has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and 3.65 miles of shoreline.  The substrate is characterized as having a sand and gravel border with muck and detritus in the deeper water areas.  The watershed-to-lake ratio (watershed acres-to-lake acres) is 21-to-1 indicating medium to large watershed draining into the lake.  The lake is connected to several lakes including Fulda and East Graham and fish movement can take place among the lakes.  West Graham is managed primarily for Walleye while Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are managed secondarily.  West Graham Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 20, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 408.4 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful.  Fin clips were collected from 50 age-0 walleye and tested for genetic analysis.  Over 88% of those fish were a byproduct of stocking.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 5.2 to 7.4 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the West Graham Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Graham is a 515 acre lake located in Nobles County two miles southwest of the town of Kinbrae. The lake has 3.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 8 feet. West Graham is primarily managed for walleye with black crappie and channel catfish as secondary species. Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked in successive years, with the third year left blank. West Graham suffered a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-01. Numerous carp, bigmouth buffalo, walleye, black crappie and channel catfish washed up along the shoreline after ice-out in April. A population assessment was conducted on West Graham during the week of 06/12/06. Three gill nets and nine trap nets were used to assess the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate was above average for lakes similar to West Graham, and increased from the 2002 survey. It looks like the walleye population has recovered from the partial winterkill of 2001. Lengths of walleye ranged from 6.9 to 20.2 inches with an average length of 14.1. Anglers interviewed during the week of the assessment reported catching walleye trolling with artificial lures. Winter anglers also reported some success. <br> \nRecent walleye stockings include 14,508 fingerlings in 2005 and 534,154 fry in 2004. 75% of the walleyes sampled during the assessment were from the 2004 fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie abundance is well above average. Lengths of black crappie ranged from 5.8 to 11.9 inches and averaged 9.3. The average weight of black crappie swimming in West Graham is nearly half a pound. Great natural reproduction has produced four consecutive year classes. Spring crappie fishing has the potential to be dynamite. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish population has increased significantly from the previous survey. Channel catfish stockings in 2001 and 2004 seem to have taken nicely. The average size is 13.3 inches. The chances of a fishable channel catfish population in the near future look promising. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population is high when compared to lakes similar to West Graham. Lengths of bullhead caught ranged from 5.0 to 8.8 inches. Although the number of black bullhead has increased significantly since the last survey, it is hoped the increased walleye and channel catfish populations will begin to forage on bullheads and keep their numbers in check. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was down significantly from a historic high in the last survey. Lack of flooded vegetation available for spawning pike during the spring can cause natural reproduction success to be sporadic or nonexistent. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population remains low but still typical of lakes like West Graham. Lengths of  perch caught in our nets average 8.3 inches and are from a single year class. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in our nets include bigmouth buffalo, common carp, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nMany of our shallow lakes in the prairie pothole region are impaired because of poor land use practices. Water quality and clarity can be improved by implementing Best Management Practices. An example of this would be planting and restoring native grasses and forbs along shorelines and waterways to buffer the effects of erosion and nutrient loading.
