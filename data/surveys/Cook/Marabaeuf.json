Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area.  The northern pike catch was low, but there were some larger fish present.  Northern pike reproduction appeared to have been limited in recent years; several year classes were very weak.  The smallmouth bass catch was also low, although the low catch may not have been a true indication of their abundance in the lake.  Lake trout were taken for the first time in this lake in 1999.  The population appeared to consist of fair numbers of older fish (eight to 14 years).  Marabeouf Lake has not been stocked, and all fish populations were entirely self-sustained.Forage for game fish was provided by yellow perch and northern cisco; however, neither species was particularly abundant.  The presence of northern cisco, and to some extent, lake whitefish, probably accounted for the larger northern pike and lake trout observed in this assessment.</p>",
