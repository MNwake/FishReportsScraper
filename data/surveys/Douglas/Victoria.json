                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Victoria Lake was conducted beginning on August 9th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions (soft sediment and deep water) prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of August 9th, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. Bluegill count per net was between the 50th and 75th quartile, while the Bluegill mean weight was below the 25th quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes. The Yellow Bullhead count was above the 50th quartile and Brown Bullhead count per net was above the 75th quartile.. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catches averaged 1.3 fish/gill net which is within the normal range of mean catch rates (1.2- 5.5 fish/gill net) for lakes within lake classification 25.  Catch rates have ranged from 2.3-4.4 fish/gill net in previous surveys dating back to 1966.  The mean weight of fish captured in gill nets in 1992 was 1.7 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P values were calculated at 62.5% and 37.5%, respectively.  Growth of Walleye in Lake Victoria is greater than the mean growth rate of WAE in other area lakes within lake class 25.  Age 5 fish average 20.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Ages 2-6 were represented in the catch, however cohorts of the 1990 year class (age 2) comprised 60% of the fish captured.  This year class corresponds to a Walleye fingerling stocking at a rate of 4.1 pounds per littoral acre.  Stocking in excess of 3.0 lbs per littoral acre was in response to apparent significant mortality of the initial fingerling stocking. Upon documentation of mortality the lake was stocked with additional fingerlings equivalent to 1.0 lb/littoral acre.  Given the limited area of the littoral zone, higher than normal stocking rates based on littoral zone acreage may be justified.  \nNorthern Pike catches averaged 3.4 fish/net in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes within lake class 25 is 3.3 - 8.5 fish/gill net.  Catch rates have ranged from 2.7 - 11.0 fish/gill net in previous surveys dating back to 1966.  The highest catch rate (11.0 fish/gill net) was recorded during the last survey completed in 1987.  The recent decline in Northern Pike catch rate is likely the result of poor reproductive success during the late 1980's and 1990.  Other area lakes as well as other lakes within the Alexandria chain have experienced a decline in Northern Pike abundance.  The size distribution of fish captured suggests the population is dominated by larger fish.   Mean weight of fish captured in gill nets was 3.3 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P values were calculated at 85.1% and 14.8%, respectively.  Northern Pike growth in Lake Victoria exceeds the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 25 and growth rate of Northern Pike in other lakes within the Alexandria chain. Age 3 fish average 21.8 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  \nDaytime, AC electrofishing yielded 16 stock-size and 30 sub-stock size Largemouth Bass per hour.  PSD and RSD-P values were calculated at 33.3% and 16.7%, respectively.  Daytime, AC electrofishing yielded similar results in 1987 when CPUE averaged 19.0 stock size Largemouth Bass per hour and PSD was calculated at 26.3% . Largemouth Bass growth is below the average growth rate of bass from other area lakes within lake class 25. Age 4 fish average only 10. 8 inches in total length at the time of the formation of the fourth annulus.  The abundance of small Largemouth Bass, as indicated by a sub-stock CPUE of 30 fish per hour, is likely suppressing the growth rate.  This trend will likely continue in the near future because of the good spawning habitat and escape cover provided by aquatic vegetation.  An average of 16 YOY Largemouth Bass were captured in each 100 ft seine haul during the 1992 survey. \nBluegill catches averaged 20.9 fish/trap net in 1992 which is within the normal range of mean catch (10.5 - 50.6 fish/net) from lake class 25.  However this catch rate is significantly less than the catch rate of 102.0 fish/trap net recorded in 1987.  This decrease in the catch rate may not be a true indicator of a decrease in Blue abundance.  Gillnet CPUE increased from 0.0 Bluegill/net in 1987 to 21.8% Bluegill/net in 1992. PSD increased from 32.2% in 1987 to 47.3% in 1992. Ages 2-6 were represented in the catch.  Cohorts of the 1988 year class (age 4) comprised 84.6% of the fish captured in trap nets.  This large year class may explain the shift in the size structure of the Bluegill population.  The growth rate of Bluegill in Lake Victoria is greater than the growth rate of Bluegill in other lakes within the Alexandria chain and slightly better than the mean growth rate from area lakes within lake class 25.  Age 4 fish average 5.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  \nYellow Perch catches averaged 34.5 fish/gill net which is similar to the catch rate of 48.5 fish/gill net recorded during the 1987 lake survey.  These catch rates exceed the normal range of mean catch rates (1.9 - 24.5 fish/gill net) for lake class 25.  Most fish captured ranged from 5.0 to 8.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  The Yellow Perch population should provide an adequate forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Black were not collected in sufficient numbers to evaluate the population.  Trap net CPUE averaged 2.2 fish/trap net which is within the normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 25.  Shoreline seining efforts yielded 21.5 YOY Black Crappie per 100 foot haul.  This catch rate is higher than any of the other lakes that were sampled with shoreline seining.  Fishing reports would also indicate a viable Black Crappie population\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Victoria is a 419-acre, horseshoe-shaped basin located on the eastern city limits of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and is connected to Lake Burgen via a non-navigable connection and to lakes Geneva and Jessie via navigable connections.  Channels to lakes Geneva and Jessie are relatively shallow and could be problematic for larger boats.  A concrete public access is located on the south shore off of County Road 23.  A handicapped-accessible public fishing pier, which is a very popular destination for shore anglers, is also located along the south shoreline off County Road 23.  The shoreline of Lake Victoria is highly developed and steeply sloped.  The lake bottom is also steeply sloped, resulting in rapid drop-offs close to shore and limited shallow water habitat.  The unique shape of this basin (i.e., a narrow horseshoe) makes it less susceptible to wave action and is often utilized as a calm retreat by both anglers and recreational boaters on windy days.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Average Secchi disk transparency readings usually exceed 9.0 feet during summer months. <br> \n <br> \nLake Victoria is primarily managed for bass and panfish with secondary species management directed toward walleye.  The 2008 lake survey revealed a fish community typical of many bass-panfish lakes found throughout west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass and bluegill are abundant but smaller individuals comprise the majority of both populations.  Although extremely rare, bass anglers might also encounter smallmouth bass.  This species was first sampled in 2008 and is likely the result of migration from other lakes within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Abundance and size structure of black crappie and northern pike populations are considered moderate.  Larger pike are present with some fish exceeding 30.0 inches in length.  Walleye numbers should prove favorable to those targeting Minnesota's state fish.  A record-high walleye catch rate (6.8 fish per gill net) was recorded in 2008.  Numerous age classes were present with sizes ranging from 9.6 to 27.4 inches.  Mean size was 16.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  This population is maintained through supplemental fingerling stockings.    Yellow perch are also present but harvestable-size fish are uncommon.       <br> \n   <br> \nAnother species exhibiting record-high abundance in 2008 was the common carp.  High abundance of this species often has a negative impact on water quality and overall lake health.  Thus, harvest of this species is highly encouraged.  Other species encountered during the 2008 survey included: black, brown, and yellow bullhead, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2012.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Victoria Lake is characterized by a limited littoral zone and sharp drop-offs a short distance fromshore.  Catches of northern pike and walleye in gillnets may not reflect actual densities and sizestructures of these populations.  During summer months these species may be suspended over deepwaterhabitat that is not sampled with standard gillnet sets.  Walleye catches averaged 1.4 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.3 to 4.4 fish/net inprevious surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similarchemical and physical characteristics is 1.3 - 5.5 fish/gillnet.  Walleye ranged from 7.2 to 19.3inches in total length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.8 pounds.  Northern pike catches averaged3.3 fish/gillnet, virtually identical to the 3.4 fish/gillnet recorded in 1992.   Gillnet catches haveranged from this low of 3.4 to 11.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.   The normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.1 - 8.5 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 70% of the fishcaptured were 21.0 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 28.0 inches.  Mean weight offish captured was 2.3 pounds.  Largemouth bass are abundant and should provide quality anglingopportunities.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 86.7 stock-size and 30.0 sub-stock largemouth bass perhour.   Almost 70% of the fish captured were 12.0 inches or greater and 13% exceeded 15.0 inches intotal length.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 19.3 fish/net in 1996, similar to the catch rate of20.9 fish/trapnet recorded in 1992.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 20.9 to 102.1 fish/net inprevious surveys dating back to 1979.  Gillnet catches decreased from 21.8 fish/net in 1992 to 0.0fish/net in 1996.  Seventy percent of the fish captured were 6.0 inches or greater.  Size structure andthe possible decrease in abundance suggested by gillnet catches may be related to poor naturalreproduction during cool summers of 1992 and 1993. Ages 3 and 4 were poorly represented in the catch. Yellow perch catches decreased significantly.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.0 fish/net in 1996, comparedto 34.5 fish/net in 1992.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 27.9 to 49.1 fish/net in surveys datingback to 1979.  Most of the fish captured were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches.  Mean weight was 0.1 pounds. Black crappie were not adequately sampled by standard survey gear to evaluate populationcharacteristics.  Trapnet catches averaged 2.1 fish/net in 1996 compared to 2.2 fish/net in 1992.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Victoria is a 419-acre basin located on the eastern city limits of Alexandria.  It is the most southern or upstream basin comprising the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Connections exist to Geneva and Jessie lakes, but shallow water may prohibit larger boats from navigating through these channels.  A concrete public access is located on the south shore off of County Road 23.  A handicapped-accessible public fishing pier is located adjacent to the public access.  This is a popular fishing pier due to sharp drop off and greater depth under the pier.  The shoreline of Lake Victoria is highly developed and largely bluff.  The lake bottom is also steeply sloped, resulting in rapid drop-offs close to shore and limited shallow water habitat.  The unique shape of this basin (i.e., a narrow horseshoe) makes it less susceptible to wave action and is often utilized as a calm retreat by both anglers and recreational boaters on windy days.  While Lake Victoria is typically more turbid than the rest of the lakes in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, water quality and clarity are considered good.  Water transparency readings often exceed 9.0 feet during summer months and clarity has increased following infestation with zebra mussels. \n\nLake Victoria supports abundant populations of Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  The Walleye fishery is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings of the DNR, Lake Victoria Association and Viking Sportsmen Club, Inc.  Walleye gill net catch rates declined slightly in 2016 to 6.6 Walleye/net, yet this catch rate is still considered high when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Many of the Walleye caught were of quality size.  Average length was 16.8 inches.  Lake Victoria provides ample panfishing opportunities.  Bluegills over 8.0 inches and Black Crappies over 12.0 inches were caught during the survey.  Catch rates of Black Crappie were low during the survey, but this species often moves off-shore in late summer and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Largemouth Bass catch rates are increasing.  Most of the bass caught during the survey were younger fish ranging from 10.0 to 14.0 inches.  Look for average size of Largemouth Bass to improve in coming years.  Very few Yellow Perch were caught during the survey.  Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  \n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Victoria.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help improve and sustain quality fishing experiences.  Selective harvest philosophy encourages release of larger fish while encouraging harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Victoria was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Victoria Lake was conducted on August 29-30, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 29-30, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 12 species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, and Common Carp and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The Northern Pike population is still well distributed among all age and size groups. Perch numbers are representative of a stable forage base. Relative abundance of Walleye has decreased since the 1979 survey. However, average size of those fish sampled was 2.4 lbs. Relative abundance of Bluegills has decreased slightly but is still above the local median in numbers and weight. The Bluegill population is skewed towards quality fish and is a well balanced fishery.</p>",

Due mainly to success of a 1986 fingerling stocking. The 1985 fingerling stocking did not appear to contribute to the fishery. Northern Pike numbers are at an all-time high in this survey but are still well distributed among all age and size groups. Yellow Perch abundance is still high and should provide adequate forage for all predator fish. Bluegill abundance was at an all-time high this survey at over 102 fish per trap net lifted. This number is many times the state and local averages, yet many of the fish sampled were in the range acceptable to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Victoria, located on the eastern outskirts of Alexandria, is connected by navigable water to the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and offers extensive recreational opportunities.  Water quality is very good with a summer secchi reading of 10 feet.  Emergent vegetation is limited to the eastern leg of the lake but a well defined submerged weedline exists around the entire lake.  A public fishing pier was installed on the south end of the lake adjacent to the public access.  This is a very popular fishing spot and can provide great angling opportunities for anglers without a boat.Lake Victoria is connected to Lake Geneva through a culvert under HWY 27 east and under an abandoned railroad grade.  Small boats can get through but a sandbar develops on the Geneva side so you'll have to roll up your pants and help the boat across.A high quality, multi-species fishery is present on Lake Victoria.  Walleye net catches have increased since the previous survey with a catch of 4.2 fish/gillnet.  The mean weight of these fish is 2.0 pounds.  These fish averaged 17.7 inches with a25.5 incher being sampled.  These fish can be caught by trolling the weedline breaks.  Fall anglers have good success trolling crankbaits along the deteriorating weedlines.Northern pike are not abundant with a catch rate of 2.8 fish/gillnet.  The average length was just shy of 24 inches with the largest fish measuring 34 inches.  Trolling or casting the flats on the northeast side by the outlet can provide good action.Panfishing can be great on Lake Victoria.  Bluegill numbers are high with a catch of 69.2 fish/trapnet.  This is the second highest catch rate since 1979.  Most of these fish run between 6 and 8 inches and can provide great fishing for young and old alike.  Black crappie numbers are down but they can still provide good action.  The public fishing pier can provide fantastic fishing for crappie in the spring and can be good throughout the open water season.  The weedlines are a good place to start searching as is the flat on the northeast end of the lake.  The flats can also provide excellent ice fishing.Largemouth bass fishing can be great as they are extremely abundant with an electrofishing catch of 104 fish/hour.  These fish run small and this lake should be considered a numbers lake or a good choice to introduce a youngster to bass fishing.  The average size of these fish is just under 11 inches with some larger fish present.  The weedlines are a good bet as are the lily pads along the eastern leg of the lake.If you can't figure the lake out or the fish are turned off, try exploring the rest of the Chain or move into Lake Jessie of the southeast end of the lake.  Lake Jessie can provide phenomenal seasonal fishing opportunities. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nLake Victoria is a 419-acre basin located on the eastern city limits of Alexandria. It is one of the most southern lakes in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes. Connections exist to Geneva and Jessie lakes, but shallow water may prohibit larger boats from navigating through these channels. A concrete public access is located on the south shore off of County Road 23. A handicapped-accessible public fishing pier is located adjacent to the public access. This is a popular fishing pier due to the sharp drop off and greater depth under the pier. The shoreline of Lake Victoria is highly developed and largely bluff. The lake bottom is also steeply sloped, resulting in rapid drop-offs close to shore and limited shallow water habitat. The unique shape of this basin (i.e., a narrow horseshoe) makes it less susceptible to wave action and is often utilized as a calm retreat by both anglers and recreational boaters on windy days.  While Lake Victoria is typically more turbid than the rest of the lakes in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes, water quality and clarity are considered good. Water transparency readings often exceed 9.0 feet during summer months and clarity has increased following zebra mussel infestation.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Victoria.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nLake Victoria supports abundant populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Walleye abundance was lower in the most recent survey, however a fishable population still exists.  The Walleye fishery is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings of the MN DNR and private user groups.  Many of the Walleye caught were of quality size.  Average length was 18.5 inches.  Lake Victoria provides ample panfishing opportunities.  Bluegills over 9 inches and Black Crappies over 12 inches were caught during the survey.  Bluegill catch rates were well above average and a majority of them were over 7 inches.  Catch rates of Black Crappie were above average for Lake Victoria due to a strong 2016 year class.  Average length for crappies was just under 9 inches.  Bass were not sampled well with the gear utilized in the 2020 survey, but catch rates appear to be increasing.  Record-high Northern Pike abundance was documented in 2020.  Smaller pike comprised the majority of the sample but fish exceeding 30 inches were observed.  To help keep this population in check, anglers are encouraged to increase harvest of small pike allowed under the new Northern Pike zone regulations.  Lake Victoria is in the North-central Zone, where all pike 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Anglers can keep 10 pike but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches.  For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.  Very few Yellow Perch were caught during the 2020 survey.  Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass and high predator abundance may limit their numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled include Bowfin (dogfish), Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Victoria.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help improve and sustain quality fishing experiences.  Selective harvest philosophy encourages release of larger fish while encouraging harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Victoria was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009 and Eurasian watermilfoil in 2017.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Victoria is a 419-acre horseshoe shaped basin located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and boaters can access other lakes under State Hwy 27.  Most of the shoreline is steeply sloped.  The lake bottom is also steeply sloped, resulting in rapid drop-offs close to shore and limited shallow water habitat.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Seechi disk transparency usually exceeds 8 feet during summer months.  Lake Victoria supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are usually abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities.  A handicapped accessible public fishing pier is located on the south end of the lake next to the public access.  This is a popular fishing spot for anglers of all ages and provides a good chance to catch these species for those people without a boat.Northern pike and walleye catches were relatively low in 2004, but similar to catch rates recorded in previous surveys.  These catch rates may not reflect actual densities of northern pike and walleye in Lake Victoria.  These species may be suspended over deep- water habitat that is not effectively sampled with standard gill net sets.  Anecdotal reports suggest that Lake Victoria usually provides opportunities to catch northern pike and walleye, especially large fish.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Victoria is a 419 acre, horseshoe-shaped basin located on the eastern city limits of Alexandria.  It is the most southern or upstream basin comprising the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Navigable connections exist to Geneva and Jessie lakes.  These connecting channels are shallow and could be problematic for deep draught boats.  A concrete public access is located on the south shore off of County Road 23.  A handicapped-accessible public fishing pier, which is a very popular destination for shore anglers, is located adjacent to the public access.  The shoreline of Lake Victoria is highly developed and steeply sloped.  The lake bottom is also steeply sloped, resulting in rapid drop-offs close to shore and limited shallow water habitat.  The unique shape of this basin (i.e., a narrow horseshoe) makes it less susceptible to wave action and is often utilized as a calm retreat by both anglers and recreational boaters on windy days.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Water transparency readings often exceed 9.0 feet during summer months.  Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) water transparency data depicts a modest trend towards increased water clarity from the late 1970's until 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources designated Lake Victoria as infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2010.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  All water must be drained from boats and bait containers before leaving the lake.  Consult your current fishing regulations handbook for rules and regulations pertaining to the cleaning of equipment. <br> \n <br> \nAs a result of Lake Victoria being designated as infested water, the 2012 survey was delayed from mid- June to early-August in order to scheduled surveys on Lake Victoria and other infested basins after surveys in non-infested lakes were completed.  Rescheduling the survey into late summer influenced sampling efficiency and catch rates of many gamefish species due to higher water temperatures, establishment of a thermocline, and vegetation establishment.  There proved to be sufficient divergence in catches of walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch between June survey statistics and the August survey results to disallow direct comparisons of catch rates, age structure, and size distribution of population samples among surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye proved to be moderately abundant in partial response to annual and increased stocking.  Most walleyes captured were young fish.  Average length at time of capture was 13.9 inches. Northern pike abundance is low in comparison to other lakes making up the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  A gillnet catch rate of 3.1-pike/net and relatively small average size of fish captured are considered conservative estimates of population abundance and size distribution.  Pike are a cool water fish. Larger pike could be expected to occupy cool water near the thermocline and are not vulnerable to capture in warm, shallow areas of the lake.  The largest northern pike caught measured 28.2 inches.  The largemouth bass population is sampled by electrofishing during spring, thus catches among surveys can be compared with a reasonable certainty of accuracy.  Largemouth bass abundance, average size, and age distribution have declined with loss of old, and strong year classes established during the late-90s and early-2000s.  This popular gamefish is still moderately abundant, but average size of largemouth bass captured was 9.4 inches.  Only six of 35 12-inch and larger bass exceeded 16.0 inches.  Anglers might also encounter smallmouth bass.  This species was first sampled in 2008.  Smallmouth bass appear to be expanding their distribution within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and Douglas County.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Victoria continues to support popular and productive black crappie and bluegill fisheries.  Four age classes of crappie were captured in trapnets.  Older and larger crappies were captured in gillnets in deeper, cooler water.  Fifty-two percent of the gillnet catch exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Bluegill catches decreased greatly during the 2012 survey.  A population decline is real and not a sole impact of survey timing.  Very strong annual year classes were established between 1984 and 2003.  Many of these old fish have been lost to old age and natural mortality.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size, remains good due to progression of year classes established in the early 2000s.  Most bluegill over 8.0 inches in length were captured in gillnets, indicating the larger fish were off shore and occupying the deep weed line.  Average length of bluegills caught in gillnets was 7.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catches were very low at only 0.6 fish/gillnet.  Reduced catches were anticipated due to the later survey date, but a catch rate this low may suggest this very important prey population is in stress due to excessive predation.  Most don't grow to a harvestable size since perch are maturing early in response to heavy predation rather than channeling available protein into body size.  <br> \n <br> \nReductions in largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch abundance are real rather than a simple response to survey timing.   However, survey statistics continue to describe robust fishing opportunities.  Lake Victoria is a good choice for fishing if wind and waves are high on larger lakes, but expect company. <br> \n</p>",
