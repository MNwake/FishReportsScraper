                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a 218-acre lake located five miles north of Annandale in Wright County.  There is one public access located on the west side of the lake.  Bass lake is managed for largemouth bass, northern pike and bluegill.  In 2005, a lake survey was conducted to examine the fishery in Bass Lake.  Lake surveys include: spring largemouth bass electrofishing, summer gill net and trap net surveys, and other biological, physical and chemical measurements.Largemouth Bass Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 18.1 inches with a mean length of 12.3 inches.  The catch rate for largemouth bass was 88.5 fish/hour, which is over one and a half times the median catch rate (52.0 fish/hour) for Montrose area lakes.  Seventy percent of the largemouth bass greater than 8 inches were also greater than 12 inches.  Anglers can expect good bass angling for fish of all sizes.Northern PikeThe catch rate of northern pike in 2005 (27.6 fish/net) was higher than that observed in 1995 (22.0 fish/net) and well above the expected catch for lakes similar to Bass.   Mean length and weight of northern pike sampled was 19.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike have been abundant in Bass Lake since 1981 and anglers have reported good success fishing for small northern pike.WalleyeThe walleye catch rate in 2005 was (0.5 fish/net) similar to that observed in the 1995 survey (0.8 fish/net), but still on the lower end of the expected values for similar lakes.  The three walleye that were captured ranged in length from 21.3 to 24.0 inches.  The low catch of walleye is not surprising since walleye were last stocked in 1993.BluegillThe bluegill catch rate in 2005 (36.4 fish/net) was significantly lower than that observed in 1995 (402.7 fish/net), but still within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Bass.  Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 2.4 to 8.2 inches with a mean length of 4.9 inches.  Good fishing is reported for smaller sized bluegill.Black CrappieBlack crappie were not abundant during this survey and historically, abundance has been low.  Only eight black crappie were sampled during the survey (four each in gill and trap nets).  The catch rate of black crappie in 2005 was 0.4 fish/net, which is below the lower end of the expected values. Other fish species sampled included: black, brown and yellow bullhead, green, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, smallmouth bass, and white sucker. </p>",

Northern Pike abundance has increased from low abundance in 1957 to about 5 times the state average.  Five age classes were caught and growth was good.  Walleye populations have decreased to low abundance since 1957.  Growth was slow for younger age classes, good for older age classes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Important species caught in gill nets were Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike were abundant (11.7/net) and the average weight was just under two pounds.  The catch was significantly lower than the 1987 catch of 19.5/gill net.  Eighty percent of the sample was age 4 or less and growth was average for both sexes.  Yellow Perch (0.8/net) and Walleye (1.2/net) abundance were below the range of expected values for lakes similar to Bass.  \n\nYellow Perch numbers significantly declined from the 1987 catch (14.0/ lift).  However, a number of Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets (2.7/trap net).  Walleye numbers were similar to those found in 1987 (0.5/gill net) and 1981 (1.2/gill net).  A 1989 Walleye stocking did not appear to contribute much to the gill net catch. \n\nImportant species captured with trap nets were Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  Bluegill were abundant and captured at a rate of 80.0 per net.  The average size was less than one tenth of a pound.  Even so, the catch was just one half the number captured during the 1987 assessment (170/trap net).  Bluegill were slow growing; age 6 fish were just over six inches in length.  Hybrid Sunfish were well represented in the catch at 12.2/trap net.  No averages were available for comparison.  Some seven inch Hybrid Sunfish were captured.  \n\nYellow Bullhead were caught at a rate of 12.8/trap net and the numbers were similar to 1987 catches. Yellow Bullhead ranged in length from five to 14 inches.  Black Crappie abundance was low but average for lakes like Bass (1.2/trap net).  Growth of Black Crappie was average.  Largemouth Bass were abundant during the last assessment and that status appears unchanged based on comments from anglers.  No directed sampling effort was made toward Largemouth Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The most abundant species in Bass Lake are Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill. Considerable information exists on these species from nettings done in 1981, 1987, 1992 and 1995.  In addition, a great deal has been learned about the fishery from creel surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995.Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 22.0/gill net, a number which has increased significantly since 1992 but was similar to 1987.  Gill net caught Northern Pike averaged about 19 inches long and weighed 1.7 pounds. About 788 northerns were harvested by anglers during the summer season in 1994.  Harvest rates were high (0.3 fish/hour) and the average weight was 2.3 pounds.Attempts at estimating the Largemouth Bass population were made in the spring of 1995. It was estimated that the number of Largemouth Bass eight inches or longer was between 289-1,275 fish.  The harvest of Largemouth Bass in 1994 was estimated to be 504 fish and the average weight was 1.4 pounds.Sunfish have been historically abundant since at least 1981 and were captured at a rate of 403/trap net. This catch exceeds the expected catch by a factor of six. Bluegill were small (average weight 0.1 pound) and only two fish greater than seven inches were captured. The average length of a Bluegill caught in the trap nets was 5.3 inches. Walleye were not abundant in the netting and captured at a rate of 0.8/lift.  In the past seven years, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked twice (1989 and 1993).  With the high number of Northern Pike and low number of Yellow Perch, Walleye fingerling stockings have a lower probability of success.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a 218 acre lake located five miles north of Annandale in Wright County. The lake has one public access located on the west side of the lake. The water quality of Bass Lake is good with a 10 year average water clarity reading of 14 feet; and adequate dissolved oxygen down to 26 feet during the last week of June 2017. Bass Lake has a small watershed (951 acres) with land use consisting of 35% agriculture, 32% marsh/open water, 12% forest, 10% residential, 6% pasture, and 5% grassland. Emergent and floating-leaf vegetation mapping was also completed to evaluate the physical habitat of Bass Lake. Emergent plants were found to cover 3% of the lake and was limited mostly to the channel area on the west side of the lake north of the public access. Species found included:  cattail spp., yellow water lily, and bulrush spp. A standard survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect good bass angling for fish of all sizes. Largemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May 2017 at nearly twice the average rate for Sauk Rapids area lakes with fish up to 18.5 inches sampled. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 69% were longer than 12 inches and 22% were longer than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBass Lake has a history of high catch rates of Northern Pike with the population being dominated by small fish. Northern Pike numbers were lower than 2008 but remained well above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 9 to 37 inches with an average length and weight of 22 inches and 2.8 pounds. Northern Pike were larger compared to the last survey; 32% were 24 inches or longer in 2017, compared to only 4% in 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye were sampled in 2017, which is not surprising since Walleye were last stocked in 1993. Prior stocking efforts were unsuccessful most likely due to the high Northern Pike abundance and low Yellow Perch abundance. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2017 was similar to that observed in 2005 and good fishing for smaller sized Bluegill can be expected. Of catchable size fish (>3 inches), only 38% were longer than six inches and no Bluegill over eight inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Black Crappie abundance has been low and the catch in 2017 was no exception. While most of the crappie sampled were between eight and nine inches, crappie up to 12 inches were sampled during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The catch rate was similar to 1981 but much higher than 1957. Walleye numbers (0.5/gill net) have continued to decline since the stocking ended in 1978. Limited natural reproduction is indicated by the presence of non-stocked fish and by small fish being caught in spring netting. Largemouth Bass were abundant as determined by seining in 1985. Bass were captured at a rate of 22.6/seine haul. Several year classes were represented. Growth was slow through the third year then improved to good. \n\nBluegill abundance was high (170/trap net), similar to what has been found since the initial survey. They were slow growing and averaged six inches in length. Other sunfish, including Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, and Green Sunfish were also caught in high numbers. The Black Crappie catch was low (0.8/trap net) and the same as 1981. Growth was below average. Forage species were captured in numbers similar to previous nettings. Low numbers of White Sucker were caught, whereas Yellow Perch numbers were twice the local median. Yellow and Brown Bullhead were caught in average numbers.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except two sites where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish, including two species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Bass Lake is above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Bass Lake is located in the Mississippi River   St. Cloud Watershed <br> \n</p>",
