A marsh/bog shore around much of the lake limits development to the east side.  Numerous emergent plants, such as wild rice, cattails, and bulrushes, are important to this lake. They protect the shoreline, regulate nutrient levels, and provide spawning habitat for fish such as northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nQuality angling opportunities on this are limited to northern pike and panfish.  The northern pike catch was average (5.3/gill net) and the average size was 23.4\".  Black crappies were caught in above average numbers, but average length was only 7.6\".  Bluegill numbers were good, with an average size of 6.6\" and 34% were 7\" or larger.  Both bluegill and black crappies numbers were above the goals set for this lake.  The lake is said to have a good largemouth bass population, but our nets don't sample them effectively.  Electrofishing for bass was not completed this survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Upper Dean Lake during the week of June 12, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff.  Sampling included trap netting and nearshore sampling (seining and backpack electrofishing). Nine trap net locations were sampled along the shoreline in a variety of habitats.  Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at four sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish.  Bowfin and Bluegill were the most abundant species by biomass in the trap net gear.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey in June 2010 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Upper Dean Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Dean is a 285 acre lake located southeast of Emily in Crow Wing County.  Development is limited, mainly present along the southeast shoreline.  In 1998 there were 3.9 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  The lake has a maximum depth of 24 feet and about 75% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Clarity is only fair for the area due to bog stained water.  The lake has moderately hard water and moderate phosphorus fertility.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of 8 feet in 1998.  Wild rice was rare in '98 but has a history of being very abundant some years.Upper Dean was test netted in 1998.  Northern pike is the primary gamefish present.  The catch rate of 12/gill net is typical of this type of lake.  Pike sampled ranged from 14-32 inches and averaged 19 inches and 2.0 lbs. in size.  Most pike were from strong 1995-96 year classes and growth was good.  Largemouth bass were poorly sampled in test nets, however, young bass were common and appeared to have good growth.  Black crappie was the most abundant panfish. Crappies averaged 7 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Several strong year classes were present and growth was good.  Bluegill numbers were typical for the lake type.  Bluegills averaged 7 inches and 0.3 lbs in '98 and fish were fast growing.  Yellow perch was the major forage species sampled.  Perch abundance was near the \"high\" category in '98.  Several year classes were present and growth was good.Upper Dean has a history of being impacted by occasional partial winterkill, generally in the more severe winters.  This is one reason northern pike and black crappie have high abundance and bluegill numbers are lower than expected.</p>",
