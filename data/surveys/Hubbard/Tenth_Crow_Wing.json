                "narrative": "<p>Tenth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, one mile southwest of Akeley.  Tenth Crow Wing has a surface area of 173 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Tenth Crow Wing is part of the Crow Wing chain of lakes (eleven lakes total) that are all connected by the Crow Wing River.  Boating with small craft is possible from Tenth Crow Wing downstream into Ninth and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing preventing further downstream travel.  There is also a small dam at the outlet of Eleventh Crow Wing preventing travel upstream.  Tenth Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfishing, as well as providing angling opportunities for largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Tenth Crow Wing is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Cedar, Little Island, Mow, Palmer, and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are highly sought after by anglers on Tenth Crow Wing.  Anglers will find good populations of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find black crappie to be the best option, with fish in the 9-10 inch size range.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed are abundant, but size of fish tends to run small, with few fish over 7 inches in length.  Very few yellow perch are of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nThe upper Crow Wing chain of lakes have a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population made up of large sized fish.  Starting in 2003, a special 40 inch minimum length limit regulation for northern pike was implemented on Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing lakes in the hopes of maintaining or improving the size structure of the northern pike population.  Northern pike up to 41.2 inches were sampled.  Northern pike exhibited fast growth rates in Tenth Crow Wing when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTenth Crow Wing supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing survey sampled high numbers of largemouth bass (93 bass/hr).  While large bass are present in Tenth Crow Wing, the number of bass sampled over 15 inches was low when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a low to moderate walleye population in Tenth Crow Wing. Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2003, when management emphasis was shifted to northern pike, panfish, and bass populations.  There is walleye movement throughout the chain of lakes.  Eighth Crow Wing is downstream and is stocked with walleye fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of tullibee (cisco), yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, white sucker, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Tenth Crow Wing Lake was conducted on August 22-23, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and two sampling stations had conditions that prevented the use of seines. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and no tolerant species.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Tenth Crow Wing Lake based on this survey is exceptionally high, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tenth Crow Wing Lake is located one mile southwest of Akeley in southeastern Hubbard County.  Tenth Crow Wing Lake is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Tenth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 175 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast end of the lake off County Road 49.  Boating access is also available from the channel connecting to Ninth Crow Wing Lake then Eighth Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Tenth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 29.  Class 29 lakes generally have a high littoral area, and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Cedar, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Mud, Palmer and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nA special 40-inch minimum length limit on Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 at Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes and is still in place.  Northern Pike catch rates in 2018 were near the highest recorded.  Pike had an average length and weight of 25 inches and 3.6 pounds, and the largest Northern Pike measured was 35 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Tenth Crow Wing Lake.  The 2018 sampling showed the same number of fish as in 2013, but about half the numbers from 2000 and 2008.  They had a larger average length of 13 inches and fish up to 18 inches were sampled. <br> \n  <br> \nTenth Crow Wing Lake can provide good fishing for Bluegills and Black Crappie.  Bluegills were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys, but they were a larger average size.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill in the 6.5 - 8 inch size range.  Black Crappie sizes were mixed between smaller and larger fish, with the largest group more acceptable to anglers at 9.5 to 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Tenth Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tenth Crow Wing Lake is a 173 acre lake located one mile south of Akeley in Hubbard County.  It is noted for having a good fishery for panfish, northern pike, and largemouth bass.Tenth Crow Wing Lake has historically had a low walleye population.  Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers in 1995 (3.2/gillnet).  Previous surveys have had lower walleye gillnet catches: 1.3/net (1990), 0.3/net (1985), 0.3/net (1979), and 1.0/net (1962).  Average size of walleye was small, 13.0 inches and 0.9 lbs, with fish up to 19.9 inches sampled.  Present and future stocking schedule is to have Tenth Crow Wing Lake stocked every other year on even numbered years to be consistent with stocking in the other Crow Wing chain lakes.  All sampled walleye correspond to stocked years.Tenth Crow Wing Lake, and the Crow Wing Chain in general, have had a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality, large-sized fish.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (4.8/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Average size of northern pike was good, 2.8 lbs and 22.2 inches, with fish measured up to 35.9 inches.  Twenty percent of the sample was 25.0 inches or larger.Tenth Crow Wing Lake is known for having a abundant bluegill population.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers in the trapnets (68.1/net), similar to previous catches.  Bluegill had an average length of 6.2 inches with fish up to 8.3 inches sampled.  Twenty-five percent of the sample was over 7.0 inches in length.Tenth Crow Wing Lake has a reputation for good populations of largemouth bass and black crappie, although standard survey sampling gear is usually not effective in evaluating these populations.  Some general inferences can be made, however.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (2.4/trapnet), similar to past surveys, with fish sampled up to 13.8 inches.  Black crappie catches were low and similar to past surveys.Pumpkinseed were sampled in high numbers (22.3/trapnet).  Historical catches have fluctuated from 4.4/trapnet (1985) to 33.8/trapnet (1962).  Pumpkinseed had an average length of 5.8 inches with fish sampled up to 7.9 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (12.5/gillnet), lower than the two previous surveys: 38.0/gillnet (1990) and 27.0/gillnet (1985).  Yellow perch were small in size with an average length of 6.0 inches, and with fish sampled up to 9.1 inches.  Yellow perch provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, and are not an acceptable size for the angler. Yellow bullhead were sampled in high numbers (11.0/trapnet).  Historical catches have varied, but are similar to the 1995 catch.  Yellow bullhead averaged 9.2 inches in length, with fish sampled up to 10.7 inches.Tullibee (cisco) were sampled in moderate numbers (2.7/gillnet), which is similar to past surveys.  Tullibee provide an excellent forage base for the northern pike population.White sucker gillnet catches were high (5.5/net).  Historical catches have been lower, but stable.Rock bass, golden shiner, green sunfish, and bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tenth Crow Wing Lake is located one mile southwest of Akeley in southeastern Hubbard County.  Tenth Crow Wing Lake is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Tenth Crow Wing has a surface area of 175 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast shore off County Road 49.  Boating access is also available from the channel connecting to Ninth Crow Wing Lake then Eighth Crow Wing Lake.  Tenth Crow Wing provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Tenth Crow Wing is in lake class 29.  Class 29 lakes generally have a high littoral area (lake area less than 15 feet deep) and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Cedar, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Mud, Palmer, and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nA special 24-36 inch protected slot length limit for Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2020 on Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  The objective of this regulation was to maintain or increase Northern Pike sizes.  From 2003 to 2019 these lakes had a 40 inch minimum size limit on Northern Pike.  Northern Pike abundance in recent surveys has fluctuated in moderate numbers for this lake class with good average size.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22.9 inches and 2.9 pounds with fish measured up to 35.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Tenth Crow Wing supports good populations of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing sampling for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2023, but past surveys have sampled moderate to high numbers of bass for this area. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Bowfin, and low numbers of Walleye, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Tenth Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tenth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County , one mile southwest of Akeley.  Tenth Crow Wing has a surface area of 173 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Tenth Crow Wing is part of the Crow Wing chain of lakes (eleven lakes total) that are all connected by the Crow Wing River.  Boating with a small craft is possible from Tenth Crow Wing into Ninth then into Eighth Crow Wing lake.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing preventing further downstream travel.  There is also a small dam at the outlet of Eleventh Crow Wing which prevents travel upstream.  Tenth Crow Wing is a popular lake for panfishing, as well as supporting good populations of largemouth bass, northern pike and walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Tenth Crow Wing is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Cedar, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Palmer, and Spirit.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Tenth Crow Wing.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled during spring electrofishing as well as during the summer survey.  Average size of black crappie was 8.0 inches.  Bluegill were abundant, sampled at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While abundance was good, average size was only fair (6.0 inches). Northern pike abundance was low (2.1 pike/gillnet), below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  While northern pike abundance is low, the pike are quality size.   Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 29.4 inches and 6.9 pounds.  The upper Crow Wing chain of lakes have a history of having a low to moderate pike population made up of larger sized fish.  Northern pike growth rates were very fast when compared to other area lakes.Tenth Crow Wing has an abundant largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing sampled high numbers of largemouth bass (92 bass/hour).  While largemouth bass up to 19.1 inches were sampled, the average size was only 10 inches.  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15.0 inches was lower then other area lakes. Walleye abundance was up in Tenth Crow Wing when compared to past surveys.  The walleye gillnet catch rate of 5.6 walleye/gillnet is above the management goal of 3.0 walleye/net and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  This is the  highest walleye gillnet catch in Tenth Crow Wing for all surveys dating back to 1962.  Sampled walleye had and average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR is contributing significantly to the population in Tenth Crow Wing.  Age analysis of the walleye sample showed 73% corresponding to years of fingerling stocking.  Tenth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Walleye growth rates were slow even though there was an adequate forage base of yellow perch,  tullibee (cisco), and golden shiner.  The yellow perch in Tenth Crow Wing are not of an acceptable size to provide much of a fishery.Other species sampled in moderate numbers include bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Species sampled in low numbers include black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

Tenth Crow Wing Lake is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Tenth Crow Wing has a surface area of 175 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  A public access is located on the southeast end of the lake off County Road 49. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Tenth Crow Wing is in Lake Class 29. Class 29 lakes are generally have a high littoral area, and a regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Cedar, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Mud, Palmer and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Tenth Crow Wing. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 3.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 36 inches in 2013.  A special 40-inch minimum length limit on northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 and is still in place.  A healthy population of largemouth bass is present in Tenth Crow Wing Lake.  Fewer fish were sampled but there was a higher percentage of larger fish.  During the summer assessment, the average length was 11.9 inches and fish up to 18 inches were sampled.  Tenth Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill. Bluegills were sampled in high numbers similar to past surveys. Anglers will find a good numbers of bluegill in the 5.5 - 7.5 inch size range. Black crappie abundance was up, but still moderate compared to local lakes.  The size was poor for anglers, with only one fish over 10 inches.  Yellow perch were seen in low numbers and most fish were too small for angling. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Tenth Crow Wing. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
