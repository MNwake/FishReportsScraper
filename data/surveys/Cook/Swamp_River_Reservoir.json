Even though growth was still slow, there was good evidence that the introduction of yellow perch to serve as forage had resulted in an improvement in northern pike growth, compared to pre-introduction rates.The yellow perch introduction has not only benefited northern pike, it has resulted in the establishment of a reproducing, high-quality yellow perch population that may be of some interest to anglers.  Yellow perch as large as 13.5 inches were collected in 1998, and many were larger than nine inches.  Yellow perch growth had been fast by area standards.Attempts to introduce walleye apparently failed.  Although walleye fry were stocked several times, none have ever been collected in assessments.</p>",

No minnows of any type were collected in small-mesh trap nets used as part of this survey, and even adult northern pike in this lake have been known to prey on insects, presumably because other forage is scarce.   Yellow perch were stocked in the 1980s to provide forage for northern pike, and are now self-sustaining through natural reproduction.  Walleye fry were stocked several times, but the species did not become established. <br> \n <br> \nAs has been the case in all past surveys of this lake, northern pike were abundant but small in 2013, although growth rates had apparently improved since perch were introduced.  When collected in early July in this survey, three-year-old pike averaged 15 inches long, and four-year-old fish averaged 18 inches long.  The largest pike collected measured 23 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were not abundant but were relatively large.  A substantial proportion of the catch in this survey exceeded nine inches, and the largest fish reached 11 inches. <br> \n</p>",

There was evidence that the introduction of yellow perch to serve as forage had resulted in an improvement in northern pike growth, compared to pre-introduction rates.The yellow perch introduction has not only benefited northern pike, it has resulted in the establishment of a reproducing, high-quality yellow perch population that may be of some interest to anglers.  Yellow perch as large as 13 inches were collected in 1998, and many were larger than nine inches.Attempts to introduce walleye apparently failed.  Although walleye fry were stocked several times, none have ever been collected in assessments.</p>",
