                "narrative": "<p>Francis is a moderate-sized lake (1,053 acres) located northeast of the City of Kingston in Meeker County. A county-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the north shore. Francis has seven miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Francis is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Manuella Lakes in Meeker County. Although submergent plant sampling was not performed in 2022, anecdotal observations indicated that the lake continued to have a high quality (diverse and abundant) aquatic plant community. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers in 2022, but average size was impressive with fish averaging 20 inches in length. The longest Walleye sampled was 22 inches. Walleye were all age-6 and tracked back to the last stocking of Walleye fingerlings. Walleye fingerling stocking was discontinued following 2016, due to high costs and limited success. High numbers of Northern Pike and low numbers of Yellow Perch were likely reasons for poor success of past Walleye stocking efforts.  <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 17 inches in length. A rare lunker-sized pike was netted in 2022, measuring 38 inches in length. Francis is well known as a \"hammer handle\" sized pike lake and this was again the case in 2022, with 92% of the catch being less than 20 inches in length. Anglers and Spearers are encouraged to harvest these small pike, which are excellent eating. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone where Francis Lake is found, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Black Crappie are typically sampled at Francis Lake and this remained true in 2022. Crappie over 9 inches in length made up 33% of the catch, with the longest fish captured being slightly over 11 inches. Although gill nets are not typically used to evaluate Bluegill populations, the species was found to be present in fair numbers this summer. The longest Bluegill netted was almost 9 inches in length. Francis has a reputation for a quality sunfish population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Francis Lake has the AIS Zebra Mussel in it. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Francis Lake in 2010 to monitor the fish population.  Near-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were conducted for a state-wide Index of Biotic Integrity initiative.  That analysis was done by Fisheries Research.   The public access on the north side of the lake was paved in 2007.  The lake was well mixed with the dissolved oxygen concentration at the surface being 7.1 mg/l and the bottom concentration being 6.8 mg/l.  Water clarity was moderate with good visibility down to 4.9 feet.  Fishing pressure was light during netting week, with all of the contacted anglers targeting largemouth bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 37 walleye for a catch rate of 3.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 2.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 0.4 to 6.1/net averaging 2.9.  Walleye were 14.7 to 22.4 inches long averaging 18.5 in 2010.  Approximately 95% of the gill net catch was 17 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 26.7 inches in length.  Aged walleye were 3 to 8 years old with 4 year-classes present and age 3 fish made up the majority of the sample (89%).  Approximately 95% of the aged fish corresponded with years when fingerlings were stocked.  In 2005, approximately 90% of the aged walleye matched with stocked years.  This data likely indicated that stocking was needed to maintain the walleye population at Francis Lake.  The latest fingerling stocking regime, a reduced rate of 1 pound/littoral acre one-out-of-three years, was initiated in 1996.  Catch rates during this period (n=3) ranged from 2.0 to 3.4/net averaging 2.9.  Growth was fast.  High numbers of northern pike and largemouth bass likely limit survival of walleye fingerlings at Francis. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 170 northern pike for a catch rate of 15.5/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 19.1/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 were generally high, ranging from 6.9 to 30.3/net averaging 15.4.  In 2010, northern pike were 11.5 to 28.5 inches long averaging 17.0, indicating a poor size structure.  Northern pike were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Most (73%) northern pike were 2 or 3 years old.  Growth was slow.  Francis was stocked with various sizes (fry, fingerlings, etc.) of northern pike from the 1940's up through 1992.  Despite the discontinuation of stocking, catch rates have remained well above the normal range.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 0 yellow perch in 2010.  Every catch rate since netting began (1974) has been below the normal range.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) were 0.0/net 70% of the time.  The highest yellow perch catch rate ever documented was 0.5/net in 1980.    <br> \n  <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 50 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 25.0/hr.  The catch rate in 2005 was 18.5/hr.  Catch rates from 1996 to 2010 (n=6) were variable ranging from 5.0 to 43.0/hr, averaging 22.6.  Largemouth bass were 5.3 to 15.8 inches long averaging 11.4.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of largemouth bass (3.8/net) which was above the normal range.  The maximum length of gill netted largemouth bass was 17.5 inches. Approximately 44% of the electrofishing catch was 12 inches or longer.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 9 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 44 black crappie for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.1/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=10) have generally been low and stable ranging from 1.1 to 5.0/net averaging 3.1.  Black crappie were 4.5 to 10.0 inches long averaging 7.5.  Approximately 50% of the catch was 8 inches or longer.  Black crappie were 2 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age 5 fish made up 42% of the gill net catch and 76% of the trap net catch.  Growth was slow.  The trap net catch rate (2.0/net) was within the normal range.  The 2005 trap net catch was 0.9/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=9) were low and stable ranging from 0.3 to 5.1/net averaging 2.0.  Trap netted black crappie were 3.7 to 10.3 inches long averaging 7.8.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 171 bluegill for a catch rate of 19.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 44.7/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=9) were somewhat variable ranging from 15.5 to 66.0/net averaging 42.9.  In 2010, bluegill were 2.7 to 7.9 inches long averaging 5.2.  Approximately 16% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 2 to 12 years old with 10 year-classes present.  Most (94%) of the trap netted bluegill were 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 years old, indicating fairly stable recruitment.  Growth was slow.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 6 carp for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 were low ranging from 0.0 to 1.0/net averaging 0.5.  Gill nets sampled 0 carp in 2010.  Carp were 22.1 to 29.7 inches long averaging 26.5.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 189 yellow bullhead for a catch rate of 17.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Yellow bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets.  Approximately 80% of the historic catch rates have been above the normal range.   The 2005 catch rate was 21.6/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2010 (n=9) were variable ranging from 4.6 to 56.6/net averaging 23.3.  The latest three catch rates showed a decreasing trend for yellow bullhead at Francis.  Yellow bullhead were 6.1 to 14.3 inches long averaging 10.7. Approximately 96% of the gill net sample was 9 inches or longer and should appeal to bullhead anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:Net catch data was compared to lake class 34 medians.  Important fish species captured in the gillnets were northern pike, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass and walleye.  Northern pike were taken in the gillnets at a rate of 10.4/net.  This is above the normal range for the lake class.  Every survey done since 1978 shows northern pike abundance to be above the normal range.  Although only 17% of the northern pike sampled were larger than 21 inches long (considered quality size), northern pike growth appears to be good.  However, few fish over age 4 were taken in the sample.  It is not known if natural mortality or fishing pressure may limit recruitment of norther pike to quality size. Yellow bullhead were abundant.  The gillnet catch of 56/net was over 25 times the median value and well above the normal range for the lake class.  Nearly 80% of the yellow bullhead taken in gillnets were over 10 inches long.  A commercial fisherman has harvested bullheads on Lake Francis, but his combined catch in the last ten years was only 1050 pounds.  These yellow bullhead should be acceptable sizes to anglers.  Largemouth bass were captured in gillnets at a rate of 1.4/net, which is above the normal range for the lake class.  The trapnet catch of largemouth bass (0.4/net) was very near the lake class median.  Largemouth bass from age 1 through 8 were represented in the combined trapnet and gillnet catch.  The high gillnet catch may have been influenced by the fact that Lake Francis is shallow and vegetated across the entire basin and the gillnets were thus located in better largemouth bass habitat than they would be in many other lakes.  A walleye gillnet catch of 2.6/net was very near the lake class median of 3/net.   Walleye stocking on Lake Francis had been on an annual basis, alternating fry and fingerlings during the early to mid-1980's.  From the late 1980's until present, it has been an alternate year fingerling stocking.  Fish from age 2 through 8 were present in the sample and all ages could be accounted for by stocking records.  Both fingerling and fry stocking may have been successful as evidenced by the presence of age 5 and 7 fish, apparently the result of fry stocking.  Walleye abundance has remained relatively stable since 1978, with gillnet catches ranging from 0.75 to 4.75/lift, all within the normal range for this lake type.  Trapnet catches included bluegill and black crappie.  The bluegill catch of 55/set was above the normal range.  Most of the past surveys have shown high bluegill numbers.  Nearly 70% of the bluegill sample was comprised of age 4 and 5 fish.  These fish ranged in length from 4 to 5.9 inches and are not desirable to most anglers.  Black crappie abundance was low.  Trapnet and gillnet catches (1.7 and 1.0/set, respectively) were below the normal range for the lake class.  This has been typical of black crappie abundance of Lake Francis.  The catch was comprised mainly of age 3 and 4 fish that ranged in length from 6 to 9.4 inches.Nighttime electrofishing was done in the fall to further assess the largemouth bass population and also to look for possible walleye reproduction.  A total of 18 largemouth bass were collected for a catch per hour of 12.3 fish.  This was lower than most other Hutchinson Area lakes that were sampled by electrofishing during the spring of 1992.  This low catch was unexpected after the high numbers captured in the gillnets.  The electrofishing catch may have been affected by season, weather conditions, or vegetation abundance in the fall.  The lengths of largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing was similar to that of bass taken in the gillnets during the assessment netting.  If anything, the electrofishing may have been selective towards smaller size bass.  Only four walleye were captured during the electrofishing and all were older fish.</p>",

A northern pike spawning area (acquired recently by the state) has been a big producer the last several years.  Walleye and yellow perch populations appear low at .75 and .50/gillnet, respectively.  This, despite the stocking of 400,000 walleye fry in 1978 and 1979.  Bluegills and pumpkinseeds are abundant, but slow growing.  A four year old bluegill is less than 4.0 inches long.  Submerged aquatic plants are abundant and they offer refuge for bluegill survival.  Roughfish did not seem to be a problem: carp are large averaging six pounds each and yellow bullheads are present in above average numbers at 8.3/trapnet.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Francis is a moderate sized lake (1,053 acres) located near Kingston, in Meeker County. A large sized county owned access, with a single cement boat ramp, is present on the north shore. Francis has 7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 17 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Francis is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Stella and Erie in Meeker County.    <br> \n <br> \nIce-out trap netting was used to evaluate Francis's Northern Pike population in 2021 and as expected, high numbers of little fish were captured. Pike were 8 to 22 inches long, averaging only 16 inches. This confirmed that the lake was full of \"hammer-handle\" sized fish, and was similar to what has been seen in past summer gill net assessments, although the two gears are not directly comparable. Pike anglers can expect lots of action on Francis, but do not look for many trophies here. Spoons, spinnerbaits, and crankbaits should all fool the Northern Pike found in Francis's clearer waters.  <br> \n <br> \nAs most anglers know, Walleye are not abundant at Francis Lake, but if you get one, it will likely be nice sized. In 2021, Walleye averaged 21 inches in length and fish up to 24 inches were encountered. Walleye can be tough to catch with the abundant submergent vegetation found at Francis, but a few anglers have had some luck dragging leeches out in the deeper portions of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Francis was listed as being infested with Zebra mussel in 2021. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.

Water clarity is good and submergent vegetation (excellent fish habitat) is plentiful at Francis. Spring trap net and electrofishing surveys were conducted on Francis Lake during May 2021. Trap nets were used to target Bluegill and Black Crappie. Electrofishing was used to target Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Bluegill were collected and fish were 3 to 9 inches long, averaging almost 7 inches. Approximately 49% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that good numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. Bluegill anglers can find the tasty panfish throughout Francis's submergent vegetation beds. Bigger Bluegill are often found off the deep weed edge in summer and winter. Trying dragging a waxworm under a sinker in 10 to 14 feet of water in mid-summer if you cannot find the bigger sunfish up shallow. <br> \n <br> \nLower numbers of Black Crappie were collected, but sampling occurred a little too late to provide a good evaluation for this species. However, crappie up to 10 inches in length were found to be present. Winter anglers often find crappie in the mid-lake flats.  <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Largemouth Bass were collected during the electrofishing survey, with fish averaging 13 inches in length. Francis is known for its action oriented bass fishing, with anglers typically catching many medium and smaller sized fish. The longest bass sampled in this 2021 assessment was just under 20 inches, and bass anglers know that bigger fish are occasionally encountered. Twitching crankbaits, slow-rolling spinner baits, buzz baits and a jig-and-a-pig will all take Francis Lake bass. Bulrush beds and lily pads are favorite spots to catch bass at this lake. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (summer gill netting and trap netting) was conducted at Francis Lake in 2015, to evaluate the fish population.  Northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass were primary management species, while black crappie and walleye were listed as secondary management species in the lake management plan.  In 2015, water clarity was good.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (5) of walleye for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the second lowest catch rate ever measured at Francis.  The 2010 catch rate was 3.4/net.  Past catch rates, from 1974 to 2015, were mostly low, ranging from 0.4 to 6.1/net with an average of 2.8/net.  In 2015, gill netted walleye were 17.6 to 20.5 inches long with an average of 19.0/net.  Gill netted walleye were 5 and 8 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Age-5 fish (3) and age-8 fish (2) both corresponded to years when fall fingerlings were stocked, likely indicating inadequate natural reproduction at Francis.  Growth was moderate.  The latest walleye fingerling stocking regime (871 pounds - one-out-of-three years) began in 2001.  Gill net catch rates during this time period (2005, 2010, and 2015) ranged from 0.6/net to 3.4/net with an average of 2.0/net.  High numbers of predators (northern pike and largemouth bass) were likely limiting the success of the walleye fingerling stocking regime at Francis Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of northern pike (137) for a catch rate of 15.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was similar at 15.5/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly high, ranging from 6.9 to 30.3/net with an average of 15.4.  Approximately, 82% of Francis's gill net catch rates were above 10.0/net, indicating that high numbers were typical.  In 2015, gill netted northern pike were 9.5 inches to 32.5 inches long with an average of 16.2 inches.  Only 1 fish was over 24 inches in length, indicating a poor size structure.  Northern pike were 1 to 7 years old with six year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish accounted for 67% and 23% of the gill net catch, respectively.  When compared to other lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries management area the growth rate was slow.  High numbers of small fish and slow growth indicated that the population was stunted.  A state-wide three zone regulation/bag limit proposal, to correct this type of problem, was initiated in 2015 and if approved could begin as early as 2017.  In the meantime, northern pike anglers can expect plenty of action from smaller sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 61 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 30.5/hr.  The catch rate in 2010 was similar at 25.0/hr.  Catch rates from 1996 to 2015 were variable ranging from 5.0 to 43.0/hr, with an average of 23.7/hr.  Largemouth bass were 5.9 inches to 16.6 inches long with an average of 12.3 inches.  Approximately 61% of the catch was 12 inches or longer, while 13% were 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality population.  Gill nets sampled high numbers (55) of largemouth bass for a catch rate of 6.1/net, which was well above the normal range for this type of lake.  The maximum length of gill netted largemouth bass was 17.4 inches.  Largemouth bass, that were aged, were 2 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age-4, age-5, age-6, and age-7 fish were well represented, accounting for 90% of the electrofishing sample.  This indicated that recruitment was good during most years at Francis Lake.  Growth was typical for Francis Lake largemouth bass.  The population appears to be in good condition, except for the lack of trophy sized individuals.  Habitat (clear water and abundant aquatic vegetation) was ideal for largemouth bass at Francis.  Largemouth bass anglers should expect plenty of action from medium sized fish at Francis.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled no yellow perch, as was the case in the previous three assessments (2010, 2005, and 2002).  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were all low, ranging from 0.0/net to 0.5/net with an average of 0.1/net.  High numbers of northern pike were likely limiting the yellow perch population at Francis. <br> \n      <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (15) of black crappie for a catch rate of 1.7/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was 4.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly low, ranging from 1.0/net to 5.0/net with an average of 3.0/net.  In 2015, gill netted black crappie were 3.8 inches to 9.7 inches long with an average of 7.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled 8 black crappies, for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was below the normal range and the second lowest catch rate ever measured at Francis.  The 2010 trap net catch rate was also low (2.0/net).  Historic trap net catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly low, ranging from 0.3/net to 5.1/net with an average of 1.9/net.  Trap netted black crappie were 7.2 inches to 10.6 inches long with an average of 8.5 inches.  Black crappie were often difficult to sample during the summer months, and net catches may not reflect the quality black crappie population present at Francis.  Anecdotal reports indicated good catches of black crappie, most winters, at Francis Lake.        <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (125) of bluegill, for a catch rate of 11.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake, but was the lowest ever measured at Francis.  The 2010 catch rate was 19.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly moderate, ranging from 11.4/net to 66.0/net with an average of 39.8/net.  Bluegill were 2.6 inches to 7.8 inches long with an average of 5.2 inches.  Gill nets sampled bluegill up to 8.2 inches in length.  Approximately 11% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a fair size structure.  Ideal habitat (clear water and abundant submergent vegetation extending into deep water) was present at Francis Lake, in 2015.  Anglers may have to fish deeper water, during certain times of the year, to find the bigger bluegill.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets failed to sample common carp in 2015.  Historic catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were all low, ranging from 0.0/net to 0.3/net.  Trap nets also failed to sample common carp in 2015.  Historic trap net catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0/net to 1.0/net with an average of 0.5/net.  Common carp numbers have likely been held in check at Francis because of the bluegill population.  Bluegill were suspected of being efficient predators on common carp eggs.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 261 yellow bullhead, for a catch rate of 29.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Yellow bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets.  The 2010 catch rate was 17.2/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were variable ranging from 4.6/net to 56.6/net with an average of 23.9/net.  In 2015, gill netted yellow bullhead were 7.3 inches to 13.4 inches long with an average of 11.0 inches.  Approximately 52% of the gill net catch was 11 inches or longer, indicating a size structure that should appeal to yellow bullhead anglers.  The yellow bullhead to black bullhead ratio, from gill nets, was 65:1, which reflects the lake's good water clarity and abundant submergent vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (4) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2010 was 0.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1974 to 2015 were all low ranging from 0.0/net to 1.4/net with an average of 0.8/net.  Gill netted black bullhead were 11.4 inches to 13.4 inches long, with an average of 12.5 inches.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (0.2/net) of black bullhead in 2015. <br> \n</p>",

The bluegill growth rate is good the first year, then decreases to slow the following years.  Overall, I would say the bluegill growth rate is slow, and may be showing signs of stunting.  Possible reasons for stunting may be: 1) dense aquatic plants are preventing predator fish form efficiently preying on bluegill and 2) excellent bluegill preproduction is occurring.  The Yellow perch population has never appeared very high.  Predation by northern pike and walleye may keep the perch population down, which in turn may partly explain the high bluegill population.  Although no perch were sampled in this assessment netting, 68 YOY perch were captured while shoreline seining.  Largemouth bass appeared in both the gill nets and the trap nets.  Shoreline seining showed excellent reproduction of largemouth bass in 1989.</p>",

The lake's watershed is mostly agricultural and much of the lakes shoreline is developed with year-round homes.  Aquatic plants were abundant and diverse at Francis, providing excellent habitat for fish.Francis has a long history of producing high numbers of small \"hammer handle\" sized pike, and this was also the case in 2005.  Gill netted northern pike had a maximum length of 24.8 inches and averaged only 17.4 inches.  High numbers of bluegill were trap netted, with fish ranging from 3.0-7.6 inches in length.  Approximately 5% of the bluegill catch was 7 inches or longer.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled during spring night-time electrofishing.  Bass were 5.1-20.1 inches long, with the majority of the sample falling between 10.5 and 14.0 inches.  Low numbers of black crappie were sampled in both gill and trap nets.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.9-10.3 inches long, averaging 7.5 inches.  Low numbers of walleye were gill netted, ranging in length from 16.7-24.6 inches.  Walleye averaged 19.2 inches in length.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on a one-out-of-three year rotation at Francis Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Francis, Meeker County, is located approximately 2 miles northeast of the village of Kingston.  Lake Francis is a 921 acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The lake has good water quality, abundant aquatic vegetation and a diverse fish community.  A  boat access on the north side is located in a county park with a swimming beach.  There is also an access on the south side owned by the township.  Both access areas are shallow with sand ramps, making it difficult to launch large boats.  A lake survey conducted on Lake Francis in 1996 showed good numbers of gamefish and a variety of non- game and minnow species.  Bluegill sunfish were abundant and can provide good angling, although average length was less than 6 inches.  Black crappie were present, but not as abundant.  Average length of the black crappie sampled was 7.5 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie net catches have remained consistent and both species should provide good angling most years.  Northern pike and largemouth bass were abundant and attract most of the anglers attention.  Average length of northern pike was about 18 inches, but fish up to 32 inches long were sampled.  The average length of largemouth captured in the nets was nearly 12 inches long and larger fish are present.  An abundance of emergent and submergent vegetation and areas of undeveloped, wooded shoreline provide good habitat and offer the angler many different fishing locations.  Walleye provide additional angling opportunities.  Gillnet catch rates in 1996 were near the lake class average.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 9 to 25 inches and average length was nearly 17 inches.  The walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction and stocking.  Yellow bullhead are abundant and the average size was nearly 10 inches long.  Yellow bullhead may provide an overlooked angling opportunity and this size fish should be desirable to most anglers.</p>",
