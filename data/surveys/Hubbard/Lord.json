                "narrative": "<p>Lord Lake is located 6 miles south of Park Rapids in southwestern Hubbard County. Lord has a surface area of 61 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  There is a public access on the southeast shore of the lake, off 145th Ave. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Lord is in Lake Class 36. Class 36 lakes are small with very high littoral area. Other class 36 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Owl, Schoreder and Twenty-one. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Lord. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 27 inches.  Black crappies were sampled in similar numbers as past surveys.  The average length was 6.5 inches, with the largest 12.3 inches. There are a fair number of crappies over 9 inches, which are preferred by anglers.  The yellow perch catch was much lower than past surveys.  Average length of yellow perch was 6.4 inches, with no fish sampled over 9 inches.  Most perch will provide forage for the northern pike, but will not hold much of a draw for fisherman.  Anglers will find bluegills in higher numbers than past years.  Most fish are in the 5.5-7 inch size range. Pumpkinseeds were also sampled in good numbers, and of similar size that could be targeted by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lord. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

These catches show a substantial increase over 1963 when catches were within the normal ranges.  Mean weight of northern pike sapled was 1.51 lbs.  The present PSD (9) indicates a very small size structure and no fish reach preferred lengths.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, averaging 16.98 inches at age 4, however, growth rates are variable within and amoung year classes.  Age 5 northern pike ranged from 16.80 to 24.0 inches.Pumpkinseed and yellow perch catches were above the third quartile for lakes of this classification, increasing in abundance since 1963.  Both species have small size structure (pumpkinseed PSD=0, yellow perch PSD=25).  Bluegill catches were below the first quartile in 1991.  Numbers of bluegill per trapnet was also below the first quartile in 1963, but pounds/trapnet was within the normal range.  The trend appears to be decreasing bluegill sizes.  Catch rates of largemouth bass were within the normal ranges in 1991, the first year bass were sampled from Lord Lake.At 2.00 fish/gillnet, white sucker abundance was within the normal range, while 4.85 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for lakes of this class.  White sucker catch rates were below the first quartile in 1963.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lord Lake is a small 54 acre lake located five miles south of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Lord Lake has a maximum depth of 32.0 feet, but other than one deep hole most of the lake is shallow.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Lord Lake provides angling  opportunities for northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lord Lake is in lake class 36.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Owl and Twenty-one.Northern pike are abundant in Lord Lake.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 15.5 pike/gillnet is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  The northern pike population in Lord in known more for numbers than size, dominated by \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.4 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.2 inches.  The northern pike population in Lord is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.Panfish are a popular choice for anglers on Lord with good populations of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Black crappie abundance was within the \"typical\" range for this lake class for both gear types.  Average size of black crappie was near 8.0 inches with fish measured up to 12.3 inches.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were sampled with the catch rate of 10.3 bluegill/trapnet within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Bluegill catch rates in past surveys were lower, below the \"typical\" range.  Average size of sampled bluegill was only 5.1 inches, however, bluegill up to 8.6 inches were sampled.  Moderate numbers of pumpkinseed were sampled, but average size was only 5.3 inches with fish measured up to 7.8 inches.Yellow perch are abundant in Lord, but very few fish are of an acceptable size for angling as average length was only 6.6 inches.</p>",
