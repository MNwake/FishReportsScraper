Only 2 walleye were sampled during this survey and were both stocked the previous year. Neither fish exceeded 12 inches in length. Northern pike were sampled in average abundance and size. Individuals up to 27 inches were sampled during the survey. Pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were each sampled in average numbers. Channel catfish were not sampled during this survey. Annual stocking of this species continues</p>",

Black crappie numbers are low and average numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed are found in Tanners Lake.  Northern pike numbers give indication of an increase since 1975 although direct comparison is not possible.  The last stocking conducted was 1976.  The current length frequency would tend to indicate that at least a portion of the catch is made up of naturally reproduced fish.  Yellow bullhead were taken only in gillnets (1 fish) in 1975 while in 1980 they were more numerous being taken in both gill and trap nets.  Brown bullhead show the reverse, being taken in good numbers in the 1975 trapnets but absent in the 1980 netting.  Bluegill numbers remain high with small fish predominating.  Largemouth bass reproduction is verified from shoreling seining results.</p>",

Walleye fingerlings were stocked in fall 1986.  The small size of Tanners Lake and a newly developed access allowed a unique opportunity to stock walleye adults at 10 fish per littoral acre and evaluate survival after a period of fishing.  Walleyes sampled were mostly from the 1986 fingerling stocking.  Survival and growth are good.  Three walleye adults were netted.  They were of the 1985 yearclass and exhibited normal growth.  Fishing for the stocked adults was reported to be very good.  Northern pike sampled showed good average growth and size distribution.  There is ample perch forage available for both northern pike and walleye.</p>",

Northern pike abundance is low but the average size sampled, 26.4 inches, is above the metro average. Channel catfish have been stocked since 1996. The population has increased each successive survey. Individuals up to 22.8 inches were sampled. Largemouth bass were sampled in good abundance and a variety of sizes. Individuals up to 16.8 inches in length were found. Pumpkinseed sunfish were found in high abundance for this type of lake. Green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were found in average abundance. Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers, while yellow bullhead were sampled in average numbers.      </p>",

Surface use ordinance limits speeds on the lake to 10 mph or less.Bluegill, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish dominated the catch.  Most fish were small, although a few bluegill were over 7 inches long.  Black crappie numbers, after reaching historic highs in 1995, dropped to low levels.  Fish were small, with few over 8 inches.  Yellow perch were moderately abundant and small in size.Northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye were present in low numbers.  Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in this lake, with fish ranging from 14-17 inches long.  Yellow bullhead, white sucker, and black bullhead were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Walleye numbers were fair with most fish over 16 inches in length.  Good numbers of young largemouth bass were sampled.  Electrofishing was not done to assess the adult population.  Yellow perch were common with fish of small size.  A few yellow bullhead were sampled with several large individuals present. Three white sucker, three giolden shiner, and one black bullhead were also sampled.</p>",
