Considerable changes in the fish community have occurred since initial lake surveying began in 1969.  The recreational fishery today can be described as predominantly Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have declined from exceptionally high numbers in previous survey years, but they still remain abundant in the lake.  Northern Pike averaged 23 inches in length, with several pike over 30 inches caught.  Bluegill catch rate has slightly decreased relative to previous sampling years, with 6 to 8 inch Bluegills most abundant.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass catches remained similar to historical averages.  Crappie averaged 9 inches in size, while bass averaged 16 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAs a small, relatively undisturbed waterbody, Hungry Lake's shoreline should be protected from unchecked shoreline development.  Development related pressures can contribute to water quality degradation if best management practices are not followed, resulting in negative impacts on resident fish populations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on July 6, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at 1 site due to abundant vegetation and soft sediments.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including 3 species that are intolerant of excessive shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Hungry Lake is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Hungry Lake is located in the Otter Tail River Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A marked increase in the gillnet catch of northern pike has occurred over the last two surveys.  It is now well over double the local median.  The majority of these fish are less than 19 inches in length and exhibit below normal growth.  Coinciding with the increase of northern pike is a dramatic decline of yellow perch.  Yellow perch have gone from a catch of 76.25/gillnet in 1980 to 1.50/gillnet in 1990.  Walleyes, despite substantial stocking, have also suffered a decline, from nearly double the local median in 1980 to only one-third the local median in 1990.  The combination of a large northern pike population and a nearly exhausted yellow perch forage base is most likely responsible for the below normal northern pike growth rate, also, the declining walleye population due to northern pike predation.  Bluegills have exploded following an initial stocking in 1981 to a level exceeding the local median by over three times.  The abundance and size of bluegills (median length group 7.0-7.4 inches) should provide an excellent angling opportunity.  Black bullheads have declined and apparently been replaced by yellow bullheads.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Lake is a small lake with very little development.  It provides an aesthetically pleasing setting to anglers.  The fish community has undergone substantial changes since the initial lake survey in 1969.  No bluegill, largemouth bass, or walleye were found in 1969, even though these species had previously been stocked in Hungry Lake.  Since then, all three species were reintroduced successfully and walleye fingerlings continue to be stocked. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community can best be described as pike/bass/panfish with modest numbers of stocked walleye, as well.  Northern pike and bluegill net catches remained quite high in 2007.  The growth rate for the abundant bluegills was not fast, but average length was still 7.1 inches.  Several bluegills over eight inches were found.  The abundant northern pike averaged 21.3 inches with an average weight of 2.2 pounds.  A few pike over 30 inches were caught. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie, walleye, and largemouth bass catches were near the historical averages for Hungry Lake.  Average size for walleye was 20.2 inches and 3.5 pounds while the average crappie length was 8.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs a small, relatively undisturbed lake, Hungry Lake's shoreline should be protected from unchecked development.  Development related pressures tend to degrade water quality and fish populations rapidly if best management practices are not followed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Lake is a small lake with very little development.  It provides an aesthetically pleasing setting.  The fish community has undergone substantial changes since the initial lake survey in 1969.  No bluegill, largemouth bass, or walleye were found in 1969, although walleye had been stocked in the 1950's.  All three of these species were subsequently stocked; walleye have been stocked routinely, largemouth bass and bluegill as introductions in 1980 and 1981 respectively.  The fish community is best described as a variety of species with an abundance of northern pike and bluegill.  Northern pike have been increasing in abundance since 1980 and are now present in numbers much greater than would be expected for a lake of this type.  The increase in northern pike nearly depleted a once abundant yellow perch forage base.   Northern pike are showing below average growth.  The mean length is 17.9 inches.  Bluegill have also become more abundant than would be expected in this lake type.  In 1990 the bluegill population still showed average growth rates and good size structure with a mean length of 7 inches, but overabundance combined with fishing pressure is beginning to show.  Bluegill growth has slowed and mean size is now 6.2 inches.  If just catching some fish is an anglers goal, Hungry Lake with its abundant northern pike and bluegill populations should provide the action.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and walleye are present in modest numbers that can add to the action.  Even if the fish aren't biting the undeveloped nature of Hungry Lake provides for an enjoyable outing.  The shoreline remains nearly undisturbed and any future development should strive to retain this characteristic.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Lake is a small lake with very little development.  It provides an aesthetically pleasing setting to anglers.  The fish community has undergone substantial changes since the initial lake survey in 1969.  No bluegill, largemouth bass, or walleye were found in 1969, even though these species had previously been stocked in Hungry Lake.  Since then, all three species were reintroduced successfully and walleye fingerlings continue to be stocked.The fish community can best be described as pike/bass/panfish with modest numbers of stocked walleye, as well.  Northern pike and bluegill net catches were very high in 2001.  Growth rates for the abundant bluegills was slow but average length was still 6.8 inches.  Very few bluegills over eight inches were found.  The abundant northern pike averaged just under 22 inches with an average weight of 2.3 pounds.  No pike over 30 inches were caught.Crappie, walleye, and largemouth bass catches were at or above the historical averages for Hungry Lake.  Average size for walleye was 20.1 inches and 3.0 pounds while the average crappie length was 7.4 inches.As a small, relatively undisturbed lake, Hungry Lake's shoreline should be protected from unchecked development.  Development related pressures tend to degrade water quality and fish populations rapidly if best management practices are not followed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungry Lake is a 240-acre lake with very little development.  It provides an aesthetically pleasing setting to anglers.  The fish community has undergone substantial changes since the initial lake survey in 1969.  No Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, or Walleye were found in 1969, even though these species had previously been stocked in Hungry Lake.  Since then, all three species were reintroduced successfully and Walleye fingerlings continue to be stocked. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community can best be described as pike/bass/panfish with a minimal number of stocked Walleye.  Northern Pike and Bluegill net catches remained quite high in 2013.  The growth rate for the abundant Bluegills was not fast, but average length was still near seven inches.  A few Bluegills over eight inches were found.  The abundant Northern Pike averaged 21.8 inches with an average weight of 2.5 pounds.  A few pike over 30 inches were caught. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie and Largemouth Bass catches were slightly higher than their historical averages for Hungry Lake while Walleye catch rates were slightly lower.  Average size for Walleye was 18.8 inches and 2.5 pounds while the average crappie length was 9.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs a small, relatively undisturbed lake, Hungry Lake's shoreline should be protected from unchecked shoreline development.  Development related pressures tend to degrade water quality and fish populations rapidly if best management practices are not followed.</p>",
