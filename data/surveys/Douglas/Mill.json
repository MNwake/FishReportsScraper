                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a shallow, fertile basin located just west of Millerville in northern Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 16.0 feet.  Residential development surrounding the lake is limited.  Water clarity is considered moderate with Secchi readings typically exceeding 7.0 feet during summer months.  However, because of the shallow, fertile nature of this basin, water clarity can be much reduced due to periodic algal blooms and/or re-suspension of bottom sediments resulting from wind and wave action.  Lake Aaron is connected to Lake Moses via a non-navigable channel.  A state-owned public access and concrete ramp is located along the south shoreline. <br> \n  <br> \nThis lake is primarily managed for bass and panfish with secondary species management directed at walleye.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present.  Largemouth abundance is high and size structure of this population should prove promising to bass anglers.  Mean size of spring electrofishing captures was 13.4 inches.  The largest bass measured was 18.7 inches.  Smallmouth are rare but most caught will be larger individuals.  Panfish species commonly targeted by anglers include bluegill and black crappie.  Current abundance of both species is considered moderate.  Historically, size structure of both populations has been dominated by small- to medium-sized fish but survey results indicate crappie size has improved in recent years.  Yellow perch are present but are usually not targeted by anglers due to limited abundance and small average size.  Current walleye abundance is relatively high for this type of lake but smaller, younger fish dominate this population.  Mean size was 13.9 inches and 1.2 pounds in 2010. To help maintain this population, walleye fingerlings are stocked on a biennial basis by the DNR.  Additional fingerlings are also routinely stocked by The Millerville Sportsmen Club.  Northern pike are overly abundant.  Although a few large pike are present, \"hammer handle\" pike are the norm.  Mean size was just 16.7 inches and 1.1 pounds in 2010.  These surplus pike need to be harvested. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2010 lake survey include brown and yellow bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2014.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a 545-acre lake located less than a mile west of Millerville in northern Douglas County.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  The basin's moderate to high fertility can cause reductions in water clarity due to algae growth, particularly after heavy winds.  Water transparency averages about 7 feet during the summer.  Residential development is light and the shoreline provides good fish and wildlife habitat, with extensive stands of hardstem bulrush and woody cover.   The public access and an active family resort are located on the south side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in June of 2016 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations.  Bluegills and Pumpkinseed Sunfish proved to be abundant.  Bluegill catches ranged from 3.4 to 8.7 inches in length and averaged 6.7 inches.  Bluegill growth is slow, but fishing quality offered by this population is presently good due to elevated numbers of seven- and nine-year-old fish making up the population.  Seventeen percent of Bluegills captured in trap nets were 8.0 inches and larger.  Pumpkinseed Sunfish catches averaged 6.2 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance and fishing quality have declined over time with less young fish recruiting into the fishery and loss of many very old fish that stemmed from increased and relative consistent recruitment in the late-1990s and early-2000s.  Largemouth Bass captures averaged 13.1 inches.  The largest bass caught measured 16.7 inches.  Two Smallmouth Bass were captured during the 2016 survey.  These fish averaged 12.4 inch in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches also declined from excessive population abundance measures recorded in earlier surveys.  Pike captures in gill nets averaged 18.1 inches.  Four captures exceeded 28.0 inches.  The largest capture measured 32.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAaron Lake supports a limited Walleye fishery sustained through supplemental fingerling stockings.  Twenty-five Walleyes were captured during the 2016 survey.  Average size of captures was 15.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Six captures exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  The largest capture was a memorable-size fish measuring 25.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie proved to be moderately abundant.  Most were captured in gill nets rather than trap nets suggesting crappies had moved offshore and into a little deeper and cooler water at time of the late-June survey.  Crappie captures averaged 9.2 inches.  Age determinations from scales indicated most captures were four- and five-year-old fish.  Age assignments of crappie captures extended to age seven.  That one old fish measured 12.0 inches in length.  The crappie population should provide fairly good fishing in 2017 and 2018 as those 4- and 5- year-olds grow past 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest from the surplus of 14.0- to 21.0-inch Northern Pike to keep population density in check, improve predator/prey balance, and increase survival of stocked Walleye fingerlings.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron continues to support a large population of slow-growing Northern Pike.  Although the 1960 survey had a catch rate of 5.4 pike/gillnet, surveys in 1978, 1983, 1987, and the present survey, 1990, all had net catches of over 14.0 fish/gillnet.  This increase in abundance may be linked to stocking. An intensive Northern Pike stocking program began in 1962.  Heavy stocking of adults and fingerlings continued until 1979.  High water through the early and mid 80's should have provided good reproduction habitat, thus perpetuating natural recruitment.  Since the drought began in 1988, Northern Pike gillnet catch rate has declined from 29.5 fish/gillnet in 1987 to the present 14.17 fish/gillnet.  Future population status may be dependent on prevailing climatic conditions. Northern pike growth rates are extremely slow. Age 3 northern pike averaged only 18.6 inches. PSD values have steadily increased from 4 in 1983, to 18 in 1987, to 26 in 1990.  This increase is likely a function of discontinued stocking and limited reproductive success during the extended drought. Yellow Perch catches have declined from the 1960 survey when a catch rate of 30.4 fish/gillnet was reported.  Surveys from 1978 to 1990 had net catches ranging from 5.33 to 20.00 fish/gillnet. An average catch rate of 8.67 fish/gillnet was recorded in 1990.  Only one of the Yellow Perch netted was over 8.5 inches. Despite Walleye stocking efforts, relative abundance estimates remain low as demonstrated by an average catch of 3.33 Walleye/gillnet night. Half (11 of the 22 Walleyes) of captured Walleye were age 1.  This age class is probably the result of a 1989 fingerling stocking.  Age class distribution from the 1987 survey indicated a 1984 fingerling stocking produced a strong year class. However, the 1986 fingerling stocking failed to produce a viable year class.  Fry stockings have severally had limited results; however, the 1983 assessment suggests a 1979 fry stocking was successful.  Growth rates of the Walleye are quite slow with age 3 Walleye averaging 12.8 inches.  Sub-stock Walleyes exhibited a relative weight (wr) of 114.5 suggesting forage availability may be a limiting problem for a young Walleye.  Stock-to-preferred-size Walleye had average wr values near 100, while the preferred-and memorable-size fish had an average wr of 86.8.  The high relative weights of small Walleyes is surprising, considering the slow growth.  Predation of stocked Walleye by the abundant Northern Pike populations may be a limiting factor in Walleye recruitment. Lake Aaron has a stunted Bluegill population. Bluegill trapnet indices have historically been high.  The present survey had a record catch rate of 70.6 fish/trapnet.  Mean of the captured Bluegill was 0.13 lbs.  Growth rates are extremely slow with age 5 fish averaging 4.53 inches.  Although Bluegill are generally small, a PSD of 28 might suggest anglers should have some opportunity to harvest desirable-size individuals.  The Bluegill population was subject to trapping and transplanting operations in 1988 when 239 pounds were taken for relocation into other area lakes. Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were not adequately sampled during the survey.  Age and growth data from the 1987 assessment indicates good growth for both species.  No Smallmouth Bass were taken during the survey.  The 1983 and 1987 assessments documents limited population. Black Bullhead were not netted in the 1960, 1978, and 1983 assessments.  Three Black Bullheads were netted in 1987 and 5 Black Bullheads in 1990. They may have entered from Lake Moses during the high water in 1986.  Size structure and abundance estimates determined for the Yellow Bullhead population would indicate an excellent sport or commercial fishing opportunities, with over 12.0 fish in each trapnet.  These fish averaged 1.07 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Aaron Lake is shallow and fertile.  Maximum depth is 16.5 feet.  Despite the shallow nature of thelake, winterkill has not been documented.  The distribution and abundance of aquatic vegetation issimilar to conditions described in the 1978 lake survey.  Submergent vegetation is common in mostshallow areas and is dense along the north shore and northwest bay of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush andcommon cattail are common along the north shore and northwest bay, yet scattered in other shorelineareas.  The aquatic vegetation provides suitable spawning habitat and unlimited cover for centrarchids.Northern pike catches averaged 6.6 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (2.3 - 9.2 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches were much greater in previous surveys; averaging 14.2, 29.5, 14.7, and 14.3 in 1990, 1987,1983, and 1978, respectively.  Despite the decrease in northern pike abundance, size structure has notimproved.  Only 15% of the fish captured were 21 inches in length or greater.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 1.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass should provide quality angling opportunities.  Electrofishingyielded 25.0 largemouth bass per hour.  Eighty percent of the fish captured were 12 inches in lengthor greater and 20% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.6 pounds.  Bluegillabundance remains high and the population exhibits signs of stunting.  Trapnet catches averaged 39.9fish/net in 1994.  Trapnet catches ranged from 35.5 - 70.6 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to1978.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 5.9 - 43.3 fish/trapnet.  Sizestructure of the population is poor.  Approximately 20% of the fish captured were 6 inches in lengthor greater.  Black crappie catches averaged 12.8 fish/gillnet and 1.2 fish/trapnet.  Trapnets may noteffectively sample black crappie during summer months.  Trapnet catches ranged from 0.5 - 0.9 fish/netand gillnet catches ranged from 0.3 - 6.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1978.  Strongyear classes in 1989 and 1990 account for the elevated catch rates in 1994.  Cohorts from these yearclasses (age-4 and age-5) comprised 94% of the fish captured in survey nets.  Age-4 fish averaged 7.9inches and age-5 fish averaged 8.9 inches in total length at time of capture.  Yellow perch gillnetcatches averaged 4.2 fish/net in 1994.  Gillnet catches ranged from 5.3 - 20.0 fish/net in previoussurveys.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.7 - 28.4 fish/gillnet.  Most ofthe fish captured were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in total length.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged3.9 fish/net which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lake types (1.2 - 5.3fish/gillnet).  Catches have been consistent over the past ten years averaging 3.3, 3.7, and 2.5fish/gillnet in 1990, 1987, and 1983, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.4 pounds. Natural reproduction was evident from the age class distribution of fish captured in gillnets.  It alsoappears that there was no difference between the effectiveness of recent fry and fingerling stockingsin supplementing the walleye population.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a 545-acre shallow lake located in northwest Douglas County, east of Millerville.  Maximum depth is 16.5 feet.  Despite the shallow nature of the lake, winterkill has never been documented.  Submergent vegetation is common in shallow areas and is dense along the north shore and northwest bay of the lake.  Bulrush and cattail are also common in this area, yet scattered in other shoreline areas.  The aquatic plants provide good spawning habitat and escape cover for sunfish and largemouth bass.  Aquatic vegetation also filters nutrients that fuel summer algae blooms and protects shorelines from erosion caused by wave action.Water quality is still relatively good on Lake Aaron.  Seechi disk measurement was 6.0 feet at the end of June.  The lake does experience moderate green algae blooms during late July and August.  Agricultural drainage from field crops and a feedlot on the western shore add excess nutrients to the lake and negatively impacts water quality.Anglers targeting walleye and largemouth bass will have the best opportunity to catch quality-sized fish.  Walleye catch of 10.5 fish per net exceeds the normal catch for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Although natural reproduction is evident, the most recent strong year class correlates with a fingerling stocking in 1996.  Eighty six percent of the fish sampled belonged to this year class.  These fish ranged from 12 - 15 inches in length in 1998 should provide good angling opportunities during the 1999 open-water season.  Larger fish were also sampled, ranging up to 24.6 inches.  Largemouth bass are relatively abundant and the size structure of the population is excellent.  Over one-third of the fish are 15 inches or greater.  A remnant smallmouth bass population is also present in Aaron Lake.  Although no fish were sampled during the present survey, anglers indicate that smallmouth bass are still caught.Northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are all abundant and provide additional angling opportunities.  Average size for these species tends to be small.  However, the numbers should provide good action.  Ice anglers have recently had good success catching black crappie.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a shallow, 545-acre basin located in northwest Douglas County, just west of Millerville. Maximum depth is 17 feet.  Approximately 75% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Available water quality information describes Lake Aaron as eutrophic.  Water transparency during those few years monitored, averaged 4.9 feet. Strong winds and wave actions can re-suspend bottom sediments and stimulate periodic algal blooms.  Submergent vegetation is common and seasonally dense along the north shoreline and northwest bay.  Even though Lake Aaron is shallow and fertile, there has been no documentation of winterkill. Lake Aaron is assigned an ecological classification of a \"bass-panfish\" lake.  Gamefishes present include northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfishes, black crappie, rock bass, and a rare smallmouth bass.  Walleye are stocked to stocked to provide and sustain a popular fishery.\n\nTrue to the lake's ecological classification, largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish are abundant.  In response to intense competition for food and plenty of escape cover, growth rates of sunfishes are below average.  Anglers can anticipate high catch rates of medium-size bass and bluegill.  Few large sunfishes are present due to slow growth and size-selective harvest of the older fish. \n\nThe fish community is poorly balanced due to excessive numbers of small northern pike.  Similar to sunfishes, pike growth is slow.  Few live long enough to grow beyond 30-inches in length.  Average weight of pike is approximately 1.5 lbs.  Heavy predation by pike, largemouth bass, and walleye keep the preferred prey, yellow perch, at very low densities.  Anglers can play an important role in restoring fish community balance by releasing large gamefish and harvesting excessive numbers of small northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.\n\nSome limited natural reproduction of walleye is documented.  Supplemental fingerlings stockings occur every other year to bolster population abundance and fishing success.  Those escaping predation by hungry northern pike and largemouth bass support a good fishery.  Fishing opportunities can be simply described as \"quality over quantity\".  Limits are not common, but average size caught is good.  The average length of walleye captured in the 2006 survey was 15.3 inches.  Two captures exceeded 25.0 inches.   \n\nBlack crappie abundance and average size can vary greatly, dependent upon annual reproductive success.  Average catches in survey have typically been within the upper range of normal for the lake-type.  Fishing pressure is heavy once a strong age group grows to a harvestable-size.  Catch rates can be good, but average size caught fails to live up to potential.  Growth rate is below average and harvest is seasonally heavy.  Few older crappie live long enough to grow larger than 10.0 inches in length.\n\nAbundant gamefish populations offer excellent family fishing experiences.  The DNR public access with concrete ramp is located on the far south end of the lake.\n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but 1 stations was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 1 station. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including 4 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Aaron Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Chippewa River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

As one would expect with this extremely high number, the average size is small, 1.26 pounds each. Surprisingly Yellow Perch gill net indices have increased and Walleye gill net indices have increased slightly. Bluegill trapnet indices have been high throughout the past surveys and are now at an all time high and average size is 0.11 pounds each. Largemouth Bass were sampled by a boom electrofisher for the first time. The number of bass sampled was low for local area lakes. Bass were aged by scale reading and showed average to good growth for the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a 545-acre shallow basin located in northwest Douglas County, just west of Millerville.  It is located just north of Lake Moses.  Maximum depth of Lake Aaron is only 17 feet, however winterkill has never been documented.  Submergent vegetation is common in shallow areas and is dense along the northern shore and in the northwest bay.  Bulrush and cattail are also common in this area.  These aquatic plants provide valuable spawning habitat and cover for gamefish.  Aquatic vegetation also competes with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake and protects shorelines from erosion caused by wave action.  Water quality remains relatively good in Lake Aaron.  Seechi disk transparency was 8.0 feet at the end of June.  The lake can experience green algae blooms during late July and August.Small northern pike dominate the fish community in Lake Aaron.  Gill net catches exceeded 30 fish/net.  Most of the fish were between 15 and 21 inches in length.  Mean weight was 1.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass and bluegill should provide quality fishing.  Both species are relatively abundant.  About one-half of the largemouth bass were 12 inches in length or greater and 15% exceeded 15 inches.  Over one-half of the bluegills captured were 6 inches or greater, however none exceeded 8 inches.  Black crappie can also provide quality fishing at times.Walleye abundance has decreased since the last survey in 1998.  Gill net catches averaged 3.0 fish/net in 2002, compared to 10.6 fish/net in 1998.  The present catch rate is within the normal range of mean catch rates for this kind of lake and is similar to historic catch rates dating back to the early 1980's.   The size structure of the present population is indicative of a quality fishery.  Approximately one-half of the fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater and 25% exceeded 20 inches.  Recent fingerling stockings have contributed little to walleye abundance.  This is not surprising, given the high density of small northern pike present in Lake Aaron.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Aaron is a 545-acre lake located less than a mile west of Millerville in northern Douglas County.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  A trend of increasing water clarity continues.  Water transparency was 10.0 feet at the time of the 2022 survey. The basin's moderate to high fertility can occasionally cause reductions in water clarity due to algae growth, particularly after heavy winds.  Residential development is minimal, and the shoreline provides good fish and wildlife habitat, with extensive stands of hardstem bulrush and woody cover. The public access and an active family resort are located on the south side of the lake.\n  \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in June of 2022 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations. Lake Aaron supports a limited Walleye fishery sustained through supplemental fingerling stockings. Gill net catch rates of 4.0 Walleye/net were representative of historic averages. Walleye grow rapidly in this productive basin and typically reach 16 inches after three growing seasons.\n\nCatch rates of Northern Pike (17.7/gill net) have more than doubled from the previous survey.  Eighty-nine percent of pike sampled ranged from 14 to 20 inches in length.  In 2022, mean size was 17 inches and 1.2 pounds. The largest pike sampled measured 35 inches.  Anglers are reminded that new pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Lake Aaron is located in the North-Central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released. Harvesting smaller pike will help shift the population back towards larger individuals and reduce the number of predators for young Walleye and other gamefish.\n \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Lake Aaron.  Catch rates of Largemouth Bass in gill nets and by electrofishing were high.  Largemouth Bass growth is slow and on average it takes five years for bass to reach 12 inches.  Size structure of the electrofishing catch described a quality fishery.  Approximately 70% of the bass were over 12 inches and the largest bass observed from all sampling types was 19 inches.\n\nBluegill catch rates averaged 19.3 fish/trap net, which is historically low for Lake Aaron. Conversely, gill net catch rates of 52.7 Bluegill/net were a record high. This suggests Bluegill had likely moved offshore at the time of the late-June survey.  Growth rates are moderate and on average, it takes Bluegill 5.5 years to reach 6 inches.  A significant number of Bluegill over 8 inches were caught during the survey, with the largest measuring 9.5 inches.  Black Crappie proved to be abundant and 64% of fish were less than 5 years old.  Similar to the Bluegill catch, a majority of Black Crappie were captured in offshore gill nets.  Black Crappie growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was over 9 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was over 12 inches and the oldest crappie was 11 years old. Adult Yellow Perch numbers were low during the 2022 survey. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.\n  \nOther species sampled during the 2022 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028.\n\nLake Aaron was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2020.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",
