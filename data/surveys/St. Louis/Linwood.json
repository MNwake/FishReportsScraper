                "narrative": "<p>Linwood Lake is a 251 acre, soft-water lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet.  The lake lies within the Superior National Forest and is accessible by portage from the Whiteface Reservoir.  The only inlet is from a swamp area and the outlet flows to Wiggle Lake and Whiteface Reservoir.  Shoal-water soils are about 60% muck, 30% gravel and 10% sand.  The lake is surrounded by forest land and has 8 cabins on the southwest and north sides of the lake.Water levels are relatively stable, fluctuating only about one foot in the past few years.  Bulrushes occur all along the shorelines of the main lake and floatingleaf and submergent vegetation is fairly uniformly distributed throughout shallow areas.Linwood Lake contains a good population of various game fishes.  Suckers of all sizes are abundant.  A good population of large and small walleyes were found by test netting.  Northern pike were taken in small numbers but had a good size distribution.  perch were scarce in nets but many young-of-the-year were taken in seining along with suckers.  Large bluegills and black crappies were abundant with younger fish present.  Some rockbass were also taken.Spawning facilities are fair for northern pike and good for panfish and largemouth bass.  Walleye spawning areas are good along gravelly shores.Fishing pressure is light on Linwood Lake and will remain light for the present due to a portage access and fishing availability in the nearby reservoir.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance, indexed by assessment netting, was 4.0 per lift in 1996.  The 1996 index value was the highest compared to four other assessment conducted on Linwood Lake since 1965.  However, all five historical walleye abundance index values were below the median of 6.3 for lakes of similar type.  Walleye fry have been stocked in Linwood lake in 1981, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995.  Walleye aged from 1991 and 1996 showed a 64% and 44% correlation between years of stocking and walleye year classes.  This makes evaluation of walleye stocking difficult for Linwood Lake due to natural reproduction.  Walleye size structure was excellent, with 80% of the sampled fish longer than 15 inches.  Walleye growth rates were average to fast, reaching 14.9 inches at age IV.     Bluegill and black crappie catch rates were both within accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Size structure was also good with 46% of the bluegill longer than six inches and 49% of the black crappie longer than eight inches.  Both bluegill and black crappie produced strong year classes in 1994.</p>",
