                "narrative": "<p>Holly Lake is currently managed for walleye and northern pike.  The long range goal for walleye (from the 2013 lake management plan) is a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  The goal for northern pike is a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches present.  This was the first of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2013 plan to determine whether walleye stocking in this lake is needed or desirable, and whether stocking would be required to restore the northern pike population.  The second survey will be done in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of walleye were taken in the 2015 survey.  Although the catch fell short of the long range goal for the lake, the size goal was met by the presence of a few fish over 20 inches in length.  Most of the walleye taken appeared to have been produced naturally; of the years in which stocking was done, only 2009 appeared to have contributed a few fish to the catch.  Sampling with small-mesh trap nets, done as part of this survey, indicated another natural year class was produced in 2015.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area, with fish reaching a mean length of 15.4 inches by the end of their fifth year. <br> \n <br> \nAfter three surveys between 1999 and 2007 with low (or zero) northern pike gill net catches, the catch rebounded in 2015.  The long range catch goal from the 2013 plan was nearly met, and the size goal was achieved.  It was clear that stocking of northern pike would not be needed.  Only four year classes contributed to the 2015 catch, and although no fish older than four years were collected, good growth rates resulted in a few fish exceeding 25 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite an apparent resurgence in northern pike abundance, the yellow perch gill net catch remained high in 2015.  Although yellow perch provided an excellent forage base for walleye and northern pike, most were too small to have been of much interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe pumpkinseed sunfish catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets was lower than catches observed in 2003 and 2007, both of which had been above normal for a lake of this type.  With abundance apparently down, and the small size of the fish that were collected, Holly Lake offered only very limited panfishing opportunities in 2015.  Bluegill have been found on rare occasions in this lake in the past, and a few were probably still present in 2015, despite their absence from the survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 white sucker gill net catch was the lowest ever seen in this lake, but remained within the normal range for a lake of this type.  Many of the white sucker collected were small enough to have provided forage for the larger northern pike seen. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Holly is 75-acre lake located about 11 miles north of Lutsen. Public access is through a boat landing on the southeast bay of the lake. Holly has historically been managed for walleye with supplemental stocking since the 1970s. Walleye stocking was discontinued in 2018 after survey results showed a healthy naturally reproducing population. Primary and secondary management species are walleye and northern pike. The 2023 standard survey of Holly Lake was conducted to evaluate the walleye and northern pike populations in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in both gill nets and trap nets are above average when compared to similar lakes in the area, and slightly higher than in the last two surveys for Holly Lake. Size structure of the walleye captured ranged from 3.2 to 23.7 inches with a mean of around 14.6 inches. Both the abundance and size goals for walleye were met in the 2023 survey. Aging results indicated the presence of 8 year classes with 6 of them appearing to be naturally reproduced. The oldest individual sampled was 12 years old. Evidence of continued naturally reproduction is a good sign for the walleye population in Holly Lake. Growth appeared to be slightly above average for area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike in the gill nets and standard trap nets are above average when compared to similar lakes in the area, and comparable to the previous two surveys in Holly Lake. Size structure of the northern pike captured ranged from 10.9 to 30.9 inches with a mean length of 22.9 inches. Both the abundance and size goals for northern pike were met in this survey. Anglers looking to target northern pike may find good action with the presence of some larger individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was higher than the previous survey but still lower than historical values in Holly Lake. Even with the thriving walleye and northern pike populations, the yellow perch catch is above average for similar area lakes. Yellow perch ranged from 5.4 inches to 10.9 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches. The prevalence and size of yellow perch in Holly Lake not only make great forage for piscivores predator populations but may also be of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance was higher than previous two surveys but remains similar to historical values recorded. Pumpkinseed and golden shiner were additional species captured in the 0.25-inch trap nets in smaller numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Holly Lake is currently managed for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The long range goal for Walleye (from the 2013 lake management plan) is a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  The goal for Northern Pike is a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches present.  This was the second of two standard surveys scheduled in the 2013 plan to determine whether Walleye stocking in this lake was still needed or desirable, and whether stocking would be required to restore the Northern Pike population.  Results of both surveys will be considered when the lake management plan is revised in February 2020. <br> \n <br> \nResults of the 2015 survey suggested Walleye stocking in Holly Lake since 2009 had been ineffective; however, the low number of gill net sets used in this lake made it impossible to make that determination on the basis of a single survey.  The 2018 survey reinforced those results, providing strong evidence that most of the Walleye in this lake have been produced naturally, and not by stocking. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Holly Lake in 2018, and although no large fish were seen, plenty of 16-20-inch fish were present.  The 2018 Walleye gill net catch met the goal from the 2013 plan, and the capture of two fish larger than 20 inches meant the size goal from that plan was met as well.  Year classes that may have been affected by stocking (2009, 2012, and 2015) accounted for just three of the 32 Walleye captured in standard gill nets and trap nets.  It appeared that relatively strong natural year classes may have been produced in 2010 and 2013.  A strong catch of young-of-year (YOY) Walleye in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets indicated that another strong natural year class in 2018 was at least a possibility.    Walleye growth had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 15.9 inches at the end of their fifth year, equaling the area mean.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were fairly abundant in Holly Lake in 2018, although most were small (under 22 inches in length).  After three surveys between 1999 and 2007 with low (or zero) Northern Pike gill net catches, the appears to have rebounded.  The long range catch goal from the 2013 plan was met in 2018, and the size goal was also achieved.  It was clear that stocking of Northern Pike would not be needed.  Only four year classes contributed to the 2018 catch, with no fish older than four years collected.  Good growth rates, rather than longevity, allowed a few fish to reach 25 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nWith apparent increases in Walleye and Northern Pike numbers seen in 2018, it was not surprising to see a drop in the Yellow Perch gill net catch.  However, the catch remained within the normal range for a lake of this class, and enough were present to provide a strong forage base.   Although most of the Yellow Perch taken in 2018 were small, a few reached sizes that would have been of some interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish were present in fair numbers in 2018, but all were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  Bluegill have been found on rare occasions in this lake in the past, and a few were probably still present in 2018, despite their absence from the survey catch. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Natural reproduction had also occurred, producing the 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2002 year classes, and the very strong 1998 year class.  Walleye growth had been average for lakes of this class and in this area.  The forage base of yellow perch appears excellent.Yellow perch were abundant, with fish up to 11 inches taken.  Growth rates for yellow perch appeared somewhat slow; five-year-old fish averaged just 7.4 inches when collected in early July.Pumpkinseed sunfish were collected in the highest numbers since they were first observed in 1995.  They were small, with the largest being 6.3 in long and four years old.Although Holly Lake has always supported a high number of northern pike in the past (as recently as 1995), Only three were taken in any gear in the 2003 assessment.  None were caught in the 1999 assessment.  In other area lakes, introduction of walleye has resulted in declines in northern pike populations, and this may have occurred in Holly Lake as well.</p>",

Stocking appeared to have contributed strongly to the walleye population, but natural reproduction had also occurred, producing the 1998 and 1996 year class fish.  Walleye growth had been fast for the area, due to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base.Yellow perch were abundant but small, with few fish over eight inches taken.  Growth rates for yellow perch were slow; four-year-old fish averaged just 6.5 inches when collected in early July.Pumpkinseed sunfish were present, but not in very high numbers.  Most were small, two-year-old fish.  Growth rates for pumpkinseed were about average for this area; the two-year-old fish averaged 4.4 inches when collected in early July.Although Holly Lake has always supported a high number of northern pike in the past (as recently as 1995), none were taken in any gear in the 1999 assessment.  In other area lakes, introduction of walleye has resulted in declines in northern pike populations, and this may have occurred in Holly Lake as well.</p>",

SEVERAL WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, BUT ONLY TWO WERE RELATIVELY STRONG 1986 AND 1984. IT APPEARS FROM THIS AND PAST ASSESSMENTS THAT THE WALLEYE POPULATION IN HOLLY LAKE IS DEPENDANT ON STOCKING; NO STRONG YEAR CLASSES HAVE OCCURRED IN YEARS WITH NO STOCKING. THERE IS ALSO SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT FRY STOCKING WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS FINGERLING STOCKING, IF NOT MORE SO. THE 1979, 1984, AND 1986 FRY STOCKINGS ALL PRODUC- ED STRONGER YEAR CLASSES THAN THE 1985 FINGERLING STOCKING. YELLOW PERCH WERE ABUNDANT, AND SOME ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ANGLING OPPORTUNITY.

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were fairly abundant in Holly Lake in 2007.  The walleye gill net catch was low compared to catches in assessments done since 1995, but was above the median for this class of lake, and well above catches observed in the lake prior to 1989.  The trap net catch was the highest ever observed in the lake, and was very high for the lake class.  Average size was similar to that of recent assessments, and matched the median for the lake class.  Many year classes were present, including several produced by natural reproduction.  It appeared that recent walleye fingerling stocking had contributed little to the walleye population.  Walleye growth had been slower than average for this class of lake, despite the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was very low, as it has been in this lake since 1999.  Only one northern pike was caught in this assessment, in a quarter-in-mesh trap net.  Only three were taken in the 2003 assessment, and none in the 1999 assessment.  The one fish taken in 2007 was three years old and had grown somewhat faster than average for the lake class.  Evidence suggests that increasing walleye abundance in this lake since 1989 has caused the sharp decline in northern pike numbers. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population appeared to be higher than in any previous assessment, and was very high for the lake class.  Average size of perch was the second lowest recorded for the lake, and near the low end of the normal range for the lake class.  Many year classes were present, including fish up to 10 years of age.  Growth had been about average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nThe pumpkinseed sunfish population appeared to be the highest of any assessment in this lake, and was very high for the lake class.  Average size was the largest for the lake historically, but near the median for the lake class.  Fish as large as 6.5 inches were taken, but most were smaller than 5.5 inches.</p>",

Walleye fingerling stocking since 1989 was probably responsible for most of the walleye collected, although some natural reproduction also occurred.  Northern pike were also abundant, but mostly small.  Few fish older than three years of age were collected.  Yellow perch were abundant, and provided an excellent forage base for walleye and northern pike.  However, few yellow perch were large enough to be of much interest to anglers.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were collected for the first time in this lake.  Pumpkinseed abundance was good for a lake of this class, and fish up to six inches were observed.</p>",
