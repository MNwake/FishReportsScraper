Cabins ring much of the lake with a cramped back-in access on the northeast side of the lake.  Bluegill, black crappie, northern pike and largemouth bass comprise the bulk of the fish community.     The 1997 spring electrofishing captured largemouth bass at one of the highest rates in the Duluth Area, although the bulk of the sampled bass were young fish, averaging 7.7 inches in length.  Northern pike seen in the netting portion of the investigation were captured at low to average numbers, however, average length was a respectable 24.2 inches with a range from 18.4 to 28.4 inches.  Both largemouth bass and northern pike were growing faster than area medians.  Walleye numbers continued quite low with minimal response to six years of every other year fry stocking.     Bluegill abundance increased from the lake survey in 1991.  Only three age groups were sampled with growth faster than area medians.  Average length was 4.8 inches with a range from 3.2 to 8.1 inches.  Black crappie numbers also increased from the 1991 investigation with several age classes sampled which showed average growth rates.  Average length was 8.3 inches with a range from 5.1 to 11.3 inches.  Other species sampled in 1997 included:  white sucker, yellow perch and golden shiners.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilson is a 55 acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 14 feet.  The lake is located 5 miles northeast of Cotton, MN off County #224 and has an earthen, back-in access.  The designated public access is off the road right-of-way and has very limited parking.  The primary management species is walleye, with secondary management for largemouth bass     Walleye fry have been stocked in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999 and 2000.  Walleye stocking was changed to fingerlings in 2002.  Walleye abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure, growth and age were not analyzed due to small sample size.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2002.  Largemouth bass abundance was 56.7 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length of 8.8 inches was average.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 12.1 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2000 year-class and all year-classes from 1995 through 2001 represented.     Northern pike abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 20.4 inches was small.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and only one fish older than age four.     Yellow perch abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 6.7 inches was small.  Yellow perch were not aged from the 2002 investigation.     Black crappie abundance of 5.2 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.3 inches was small.  Age analysis revealed strong 2000 and 2001 year-classes and only three fish older than two years.     Bluegill abundance of 10.8 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.3 inches was small.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 5.5 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1999 year class and only one fish older than four.     Other fish species sampled include rock bass and white sucker.     Management of Wilson Lake with walleye fry has resulted in very limited return to DNR test netting samples.  Management for walleye in Wilson Lake was shifted from fry to fingerlings in 2002.  Walleye fingerlings will be stocked into Wilson until an evaluation of the new stocking stratege is complete.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilson is a 55-acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 14 feet. Wilson Lake is located five miles northeast of Cotton, MN off County #224 and has a County administered, earthen back-in access on the east side.  Wilson Lake was stocked with walleye fry in even years from 1992 to 1998 and fingerlings at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (55 pounds) in even years from 2000 through 2008.  Wilson Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2008 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not sampled by experimental gillnet.  Two walleye were sampled with trapnets.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 20.3 inches and both were aged to the 2004 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance of 74.7 per hour of electrofishing was less than 2002 (56.7) but was still considered high compared to other populations in Duluth Area lakes.  Average size of 12.3 inches was relatively large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed consistently strong recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2001 through 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2002 (6.0) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 20.5 inches and growth was also average.  Age analysis revealed inconsistent recruitment with only two year-classes (2005, 2006) represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.2 per trapnet lift was less than 2002 (5.2) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 10.2 inches was large and rate of growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed fairly consistent recruitment with five year-classes represented from 2001 through 2006. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 4.0 per trapnet lift had declined since 2002 (10.8) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 5.8 inches was small and growth was typical compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment from 2000 through 2006 with strong 2002 and 2004 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift had declined since 2002 (4.0) and was considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of three yellow perch was 6.9 inches and they were all recruited from the 2003 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Johnny darter, rock bass and spottail shiner. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 24 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Wild celery was the most frequently identified plant (100% of transects) followed by pipewort and bushy pondweed (80% of transects).  Only five other species or species groups had a frequency of occurrence greater than 50%.  The most common substrate types were sand and rubble, which were identified along 80% and 70% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Tamarack is a neutral (pH 7.0), soft water lake (alkalinity 11 ppm) with low fertility (total phosphorus 0.020 ppm). <br> \n</p>",

Their abundance has declined since stocking was stopped in 1987.  Bluegills are abundant, however, catch rates declined dramatically from previous surveys.  Black crappie population is abundant with age group II representing 80% of the catch.  Yellow perch numbers are below state and local averages.  Limited spawning areas for walleye keeps their numbers low, however, growth is near normal.</p>",
