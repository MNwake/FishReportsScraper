                "narrative": "<p>Beartrack is a small, clear water lake located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The lake is only accessible via portage trails coming from Little Beartrack Lake or Thumb Lake. There are three primitive campsites maintained by the U.S. Forest Service on the lake. The fish community is simple with only a few species present. Individual fish are generally small.White suckers were the most common fish sampled during 2000.  Sucker numbers were high compared to other lakes like Beartrack.  Average length was 13 inches, however, suckers up to 18 inches were collected.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  The largest perch sampled was ten inches in length, however, most were less than eight inches.  The only other fish species collected during the 2000 survey was green sunfish. Green sunfish averaged five inches in length. Beartrack is a beautiful lake for paddling, camping or swimming but better fishing can probably be found in some of the neighboring lakes.</p>",
