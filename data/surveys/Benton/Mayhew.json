                "narrative": "<p>Mayhew Lake has been known for providing a winter crappie fishery and shore fishing is common during open water from the County park on the southwest side of the lake.  The fish community in Mayhew Lake has shown some changes since the last survey in 1996.  Northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill numbers have increased. The desired results from the lake survey would be a decrease in pike numbers while seeing an increase in the walleye and perch populations.  Higher pike numbers may have a detrimental effect on other species in the lake such as walleye and yellow perch.  While smaller northerns were common in the survey, some fish exceeding 24 inches in length were observed.  The larger pike should be able to prey on the smaller pike and the abundant white sucker population thus reducing competition for and on the walleye and perch.    Crappie fishing should be good on Mayhew Lake.  A special assessment targetting crappies was conducted in May of 2002 and a good sample of crappies was captured.  Many of the crappies seen were between 9 and 11 inches in length, a size acceptable to most fishermen.  The net catches from the lake survey indicate the lake has a abundant population of crappies and there is another  strong year class present that should provide good fishing in two years.    Walleye fingerlings stocking was resumed in 1997 after there appeared to be poor survival from the walleye fry stocking efforts.  While walleye numbers were back to the desired level for the lake the population appears to be supported by only one year class.  All the fish seen in the survey were between 15 and 17 inches in length.  The presence of an abundant perch population helps increase the survival of walleye fingerling as perch are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike.    Although bluegills are present in Mayhew Lake, abundance appears to be low and anglers will have to work for them.  Natural reproduction success appears to be sporadic, likely the result of poor water quality and lack of vegetation in the lake.  While having low abundance of vegetation is desirable for swimming beaches, vegetation provides shelter and food for fish, especially bluegills, while also filtering the water.  Most of the bluegills seen in the assessments were above average in size with some small fish, under 4 inches present.  Few medium size bluegills, between 4 and 6 inches, were seen in the surveys indicating that fishing will be even slower in next couple of years.    The carp population is also high in Mayhew Lake, which adds to the turbidity problem and lack of vegetation.  All of the carp were over 23 inches in length, suggesting the population is dominated by older fish and reproduction could be low.  Other species in the fish community include black bullheads, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseeds, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  Of the two species of bullheads present, black bullheads are more tolerant of poor water quality and thus are more abundant than the yellow bullheads.  The black bullhead catch was dominated by small bullheads under 7 inches in length.  Some larger bullheads are present, however, as fish up to 13 inches were seen in both species.  White suckers are abundant and available in a range of sizes small enough for gamefish prey and big enough for anglers.    Largemouth bass abundance is low due to the poor water clarity and lack of vegetation in the lake.  A few bass are seen in the surveys and some young of the year captured in seine hauls, but anglers would probably see very few.  Most of the pumpkinseed sunfish seen in the survey were nice size, between 6 and 7 inches.      The summer of 2002 was wetter than normal raising water levels in the lake.  Water quality has long been a problem in Mayhew Lake as severe algae blooms are the summertime norm.  The water entering the lake via numerous inlets comes primarily from agricultural fields, feedlots, and pastures.  The Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District has been working with lakeshore owners and other landowners in the watershed to improve the water quality.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller northern pike under 24 inches and limit their harvest of big bluegills.  These practices will work toward a more balanced fish community and desirable size fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Mayhew Lake is one of only two managed fish lakes in Benton County.  The lake is rather small being only 131 acres in size and 20 feet deep.  Steep drop-offs and a sunken island are the main fishing structures in the lake. Water quality problems have been a major issue for decades.  Several factors including land use practices in the watershed and along the lakeshore have contributed to summer algae blooms and poor water quality.  Mayhew Lake lies within an agricultural watershed and also has livestock pastures along its' shore and inlets.   <br> \n    The lake is probably best know for its black crappie fishing although once in a while there will be a good walleye bite.  Some perch fishing, winter especially, has been reported in recent years.  Walleye and northern pike numbers appear to have decreased in abundance since the last survey in 2002.  The walleye catch was below the management goals for the lake but with the lower northern pike numbers, walleye fingerling survival may improve.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in the lake in odd numbered years. The lake also has high yellow perch numbers, which may also help walleye numbers increase.  Perch are an important prey species for both walleye and northern pike and abundant perch can minimize predation of stocked walleye by larger northern pike.  White sucker are also abundant and are known to be a favorite food of northern pike. <br> \n   A panfish assessment was conducted in early June of 2008, which caught a large number of black crappie.  Most of the crappie were less than 8 inches in length, however, there were some fish measured up to almost 12 inches in length.  Although the lake supports a bluegill population, it does not appear to that abundant.  Average size of the bluegill caught in the panfish assessment was less than 5 inches in length.  There does appear to be some larger bluegill as fish up to 8 inches were netted but anglers will have to work to find them.  Natural reproduction success appears to be sporadic, likely the result of poor water quality and lack of vegetation in the lake.  The turbid water favors black crappie over bluegill.  Mayhew Lake also has some pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish, which were caught in the panfish assessment, but their densities appear to be low.  One green sunfish was caught in the summer survey. <br> \n    Common carp are known to relatively abundant in the lake from direct observations and electrofishing.  Most of the carp in the 2002 survey were caught in trapnets, which were not used in this survey.  Other fish species that were sampled in the summer survey include black bullhead and largemouth bass.  The panfish assessment caught a high number of black bullhead as well as some yellow bullhead.  Bullhead species abundance can be an indicator of water quality as turbid water is more favorable to black bullheads while yellow bullhead prefer cleaner water.   <br> \n     Benton County has worked to improve the county park on the west side of Mayhew Lake.  The park now has not only the boat access but also offers a fishing pier and picnic area with tables and grills.  The park is well maintained which encourages shore fishing, but leaving a native shoreline buffer strip would be beneficial to the lake.  A TMDL Study (Total Daily Maximum Load) focusing on nutrient impairment is part of the Benton County Comprehensive Local Water Management Plan.  The study was scheduled to start in 2008. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    A spring assessment was conducted on Mayhew Lake in early June to better evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations in the lake.  Crappie provide an important winter fishery on the lake and the bluegill provide a summer fishery.  The 2008 panfish assessment had 12 trapnet lifts while the previous spring panfish assessment 2002 had only 6 lifts.  A routine population assessment using just gillnets was conducted in the later part of June. <br> \n    A total of 390 black crappie were sampled in the 2008 assessment for a catch rate of 32.5/trapnet.  The fish measured between 4.6 and 11.7 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 7.5 - 8 inches and 6% (n=24) of the fish were over 9 inches in length.  The 2002 netting produced a catch rate of 50.5/trapnet and the fish caught displayed a much more desirable population size structure.   They ranged from 4 to 11 inches in length and had a mean length of 9.6 inches.  More preferred size crappie comprised the catch as the modal length was 9.5 - 10 inches, and 79% (n=240) of the fish exceeded 9 inches.  Crappie more than 10 inches in length accounted for 38% (n=116) of the sample while in 2008 it was only 3% (n=11) of the catch.  Both of the spring assessments met the lake management goal for Mayhew Lake of a spring trapnet catch of at least 25 crappie per trapnet.  The 2008 spring assessment unlike the 2002 assessment, however, fell far short of the management goal of having at least 50% of the catch exceeding 9 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment with all of the age groups displaying normal growth. A strong 2004 year class accounted for 74% of the sample. <br> \n     An additional 55 black crappie were caught in the 2008 population assessment gillnets.  Those fish measured from 7 to 11 inches length with a mean length of 8 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 8 - 8.5 inches and less than 2% (n=1) of the crappies were over 9 inches in length. <br> \n     The 2008 spring assessment produced a fair bluegill catch when compared to the previous netting efforts in 2002.  A total of 77 bluegill between 3.4 and 8.3 inches in length were caught. The population size structure did not appear to be very desirable with a mean length of only 4.7 inches, modal length of 4 - 4.5 inches, and less than 4% (n=3) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  In 2002, 29 bluegill were caught in the spring assessment and 53 in the lake survey trapnets.  The lake survey catch rate of 5.9/trapnet was equal to the 25% quartile for lake class 34.  The bluegill catches in 2002 displayed a more desirable population size structure than in 2008.  Fish in the 2002 spring assessment were between 6.6 and 8.5 inches, while those in the lake survey trapnets were from 2.4 to 8.5 inches in length.  Mean length was 7.2 inches in the spring catch and 6.8 inches in the survey sample.  Modal length was better in the lake survey catch at 7 - 7.5 inches while it was 6.5 - 7 inches in the spring catch.  Bluegills exceeding 7 inches accounted for 62% (n=18) of the spring catch and 66% (n=35) of the lake survey catch.  Ages 2 thru 4 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment with all of the age groups exhibiting fast growth.  A dominant 2006 year class comprised 78% of the sample suggesting highly variable recruitment. <br> \n    Some other fish species measured in the 2008 panfish assessment included one 12-inch largemouth bass, 37 pumpkinseed sunfish between 3.8 and 6.5 inches in length, two walleye, 10 and 20 inches in length, and two yellow perch around 7 inches in length.  Species, which were counted, included black bullhead, carp, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n    An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates. <br> \n</p>",

Daytime electrofishing conducted in the spring of 2013 confirmed declines in the numbers of Black Crappie and Common Carp which were two of the most abundant species in the lake.  No Walleye, Largemouth Bass, or Bluegill were observed suggesting they may have been eliminated from the lake.  Moderate numbers of White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike were observed.  Fry stocking after winterkill is often successful as competition and predation factors are reduced.   <br> \n      Fall night electrofishing was conducted primarily to assess survival and growth of Walleye fry stocked in the spring.   The electrofishing was also used to provide more recent fish population data and assess abundance and recruitment of all fish species present.   Water clarity continued to be an issue as evidenced by the turbid conditions observed during the assessment.  <br> \n      About two-thirds of the lake was electrofished in just over an hour of on-time.  A total of seventy-two  young of the year Walleye were netted for a catch rate of 67/hour.  The fingerlings netted varied greatly in length, 3.8 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches.   Some of the smaller Walleye fingerlings may have been over-looked due to the high abundance of young of the year Yellow Perch. <br> \n      Several  fish species appeared to respond favorably to the lower density of predator species and interspecies competition.  Young of the year Yellow Perch and White Sucker were especially abundant.  Adult Yellow Perch and White Sucker were also common.   Young of the year Northern Pike were also quite numerous and appeared to have grown rapidly over the summer with the abundant prey base.   The young pike were estimated to be from twelve to fourteen inches in length.  No adult Northern Pike were observed during the electrofishing effort. <br> \n       More adult Common Carp were observed than desired but only four young of the year carp were netted with no other being observed.   The Black Crappie did not appear to respond as rapidly to lower population densities.  Only two young of the year crappie were observed and no adults were netted or observed.  No Bluegill were observed during the fall electrofishing, so the species may have to be re-introduced.  A few bullheads of various sizes were observed. <br> \n       Walleye fry are to be stocked again in the spring of 2014 with the contingency of fall fingerling stocking if there is no apparent or poor fry survival.   Fry stocking has shown to be an effective method of maintaining a population after winterkills, but fingerling stocking has been more effective between winterkills when predator fish populations are higher. </p>",

Mayhew Lake experienced a significant winterkill in 2012 - 2103 due to deep snow, opaque ice, and extended cold weather.  Daytime electrofishing in the spring of 2013 confirmed declines in the numbers of Black Crappie and Common Carp which were two of the most abundant species in the lake.  No Walleye, Largemouth Bass, or Bluegill were observed during the 2013 electrofishing which suggested they may have been eliminated from the lake.  Other fish species observed at the time included White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.   <br> \n       Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2013 and fall electrofishing used to evaluate survival and growth of young Walleye.   The sampling effort provided a catch rate of 67/hour (n=72) with the young of year Walleye ranging from 3.8 to 9.2 inches in length.   One observation from the sampling effort was that some smaller young of year Walleye may have been overlooked due to the abundance of young of year Yellow Perch. <br> \n        The 2013 fall electrofishing was also used to provide more recent fish community data and assess abundance and recruitment of all fish species present.   Several fish species appeared to respond favorably to the lower density of predator species and interspecific competition.  Young of year perch and White Sucker were especially abundant.  Young of year Northern Pike were also quite numerous and appeared to have grown rapidly over the summer with the abundant prey base.  More adult Common Carp were observed than desired but few young of year carp.  Fewer Black Crappie than expected were observed, young of year or adults.   <br> \n       The management plan for Mayhew Lake was to again stock Walleye fry in spring of 2014 followed by fingerlings if poor fry survival was evident.  Only two young of year Walleye were sampled in the 2014 fall electrofishing assessment.   While historically poor water clarity may have hindered Walleye fingerling identification, plenty of young of year Yellow Perch and White Sucker were observed.  Also present were numerous young of year Northern Pike and an abundance of yearling Northern Pike.  Contrary to 2013 electrofishing results, Black Crappie, mostly yearlings, were abundant in the 2014 electrofishing assessment.   <br> \n       Due to the low number of young of year Walleye observed and netted in the 2014 fall night electrofishing effort, Walleye fingerlings were stocked in Mayhew Lake later in the fall.  Evaluation of the Walleye population may not occur for several years until the fish are old enough to be vulnerable to gill nets.   A reintroduction stocking of adult Largemouth Bass and Bluegill was also done in the fall of 2014.</p>",

THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS NOSE DIVED WHILE THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS SKY ROCKETED. NO DOUBT THESE CHANGES ARE INTER-RELATED BLUEGILL INTRODUCTIONS IN 1985 AND 1989 ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW UP. RESULTS OF A 1985 LARGEMOUTH BASS INTRODUCTION WERE LESS MEASURABLE. CARP AND BULLHEADS ARE PRESENT. BUT NOT IN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH NUMBERS. WHITE SUCKERS WERE PRESENT IN HIGH NUMBERS, BUT ARE OF A GOOD FORAGE SIZE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayhew Lake has a watershed dominated by agriculture.  Row crops to the north andintense pasturing around the lake contribute nutrients to the lake leading tosummer algae blooms and decreased water quality.  Lack of vegetation and turbidwater makes the lake poorly suited to largemouth bass and bluegill.  Gamefishpopulations, (walleye, northern pike, and black crappies) have declined since thelast survey.  Walleye fry stocking has shown limited success and no naturalreproduction has been documented.  The lake does have nice size northern pike asall that were measured exceeded 22 inches in length.  Black crappies continue toprovide the main fishery for the lake, but the average size remains small at sixto nine inches.  The bluegill population is low, however, individuals up 8.5 incheswere sampled.  Yellow and black bullheads are present in the lake.  Average sizewas ten inches for the blacks and twelve inches for the yellows.  Other roughfishobserved were white suckers, carp and bowfin at normal to low abundance for thelake type.Largemouth bass are present, but little is known about abundance or size structureof the population as none have ever been sampled using standard lake survey gear. Yellow perch abundance has increased and the population is considered high for thislake type.  Average size was small at six inches.  Perch are an important preyspecies for walleye and northern pike.Better farming practices need to be implemented within the watershed.  This wouldimprove water quality and fish habitat, making lake conditions more conducive toproviding a healthy and desirable fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayhew Lake (DOW# 05-0007-00; Lake Class 34) is a 128 acre lake located near Mayhew, Minnesota. A county owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southwest Shore. Mayhew Lake has 3.02 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 20 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Mayhew Lake is in Lake Class 34; lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, are turbid, and are very irregular in shape. <br> \n <br> \nMayhew Lake had a partial winterkill in 2010-2011 which has limited fishing opportunities in recent years. However recent successful Walleye stockings has produced a strong Walleye population that is dominated by 14-16 inch fish perfect for angler looking to take home a meal. In addition Northern Pike numbers were good with plenty of fish between 20-22 inches for harvesting and also a few up to 35 inches for those anglers looking for a trophy.  Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were also stocked following the winterkill although their numbers remain low at this time.  Reproduction of these species has not been evaluated. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Mayhew Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayhew Lake is a small, 128-acre lake located about 12 miles northeast of St. Cloud. It's a popular winter fishery for crappies and Rainbow Trout which are stocked as catchable size fish on an annual basis. Mayhew's close proximity to St. Cloud makes it a good choice for quick day trips in any season. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes and crappies are the species of most management importance at this time. This survey used gill nets to sample Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and trap nets to sample Black Crappies and Bluegills. Water quality is poor in Mayhew Lake and there have been times in the past where the lake has winterkilled. Black Crappie are a species that can do very well in lakes that winterkill on  occasion. Trap nets in this survey caught a total of 155 crappies, average length was 8.4 inches and maximum length was 10.1 inches. Crappies generally run little on the small side in Mayhew Lake but they can often provide a hot bite during the winter. Bluegills were also caught in trap nets and individual sizes usually run from 6-8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThirteen Walleyes were captured, the majority measured between 12 and 15 inches. Fingerlings are stocked every other year. Walleyes grow fairly fast in Mayhew Lake, 3-year old fish have ranged from 14-19 inches. Northern Pike were common in gill nets, over half those caught exceeded 24 inches. The largest pike caught was 36.6 inches. Yellow Perch are an important prey species and provide food for pike and Walleye. The number of perch increased in our sampling during this survey compared to the last survey which is good to see. Individual perch measured ranged from 5.8-8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAs mentioned, catchable-size Rainbow Trout are stocked every fall when available and anglers are encouraged to harvest them. Check the Minnesota Fishing Regulations booklet for seasons and bag limits. Often times anglers will report catching trout while fishing crappies on Mayhew. Anglers who choose to keep trout must have a valid trout stamp in their possession.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught during this survey were Black Bullheads. As mentioned, water quality is poor in Mayhew Lake and species like Black Bullheads can flourish in such lakes. Since the last survey in 2016, Black Bullheads have more than tripled in number. The vast majority measured less than 7 inches and while they do not provide any angling value, they can provide an ample prey source for Walleyes and Northern Pike. White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead were two other species commonly caught.  <br> \n</p>",
