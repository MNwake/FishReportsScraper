Good numbers of 15-20 inch fish were present.  The walleye population was supported entirely through natural reproduction, and there were several relatively strong year classes present.  Walleye growth was slow.  Forage was provided by yellow perch, which were present in average numbers.  Yellow perch growth was also slow, and few reached sizes large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Northern pike abundance was low, but a few large fish were present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cascade is a 451-acre lake located 18 miles north of Lutsen and access is through a public boat landing on the southeast corner of the lake. Cascade Lake is managed for walleye and northern pike. The 2023 standard survey was conducted to evaluate the survival and growth of the walleye and northern pike populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were high in 2023 and had been increasing since 1998. Walleye ranged from 7.4 to 22.1 inches with a mean length of 15.9 inches. Age distribution of captured walleye indicated fish from 14 different year classes, all naturally reproduced with the oldest fish being 19 years old. Growth rates were average until walleye reached about 18 inches in size, then walleye grew very slowly reaching a maximum size of only 22 inches. The relatively high abundance of walleye and low abundance of prey may be limiting overall growth, but Cascade Lake supports an excellent naturally reproducing walleye fishery for anglers interested in good catch rates.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 2023 was historically low and below average for similar lakes in the area. Size structure of the northern pike captured ranged from 9.25 to 29.4 inches with a mean length of 20.2 inches. Anglers targeting northern pike in Cascade Lake have the ability to encounter some larger individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was low and had been declining since 1988. This is not surprising as walleye populations were increasing over this same time frame. The white sucker catch was also the lowest recorded and likely do not provide much forage for northern pike or walleye. <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

The estimated population of walleye 10 inches or longer in April 2007 was 1,544 fish, based on a cooperative mark-and-recapture population study conducted by the 1854 Treaty Authority and DNR Fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of northern pike was withiin the normal range for this lake and lakes of this class.

The long range goal for walleye is to maintain a self-sustained population with a minimum gill net catch of 8.0 fish/set, with some fish larger than 20 inches present.  The goal for northern pike is a minimum gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish larger than 25 inches present.  This was the third of three assessments scheduled in the 2005 lake management plan to determine whether the lake showed any signs of excessive walleye or northern pike harvest.  Based on those assessments, the management plan will be reviewed and revised in March 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant, and somewhat larger than usual (for this lake) in 2012.  Long range goals for the walleye population were met in the 2012 assessment.  The gill net catch was near the upper end of the normal range for the lake class, and several fish over 20 inches in length were collected.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2012 catch, with the strongest occurring in 2006 and 2005.  Walleye growth had been slightly slower than average; five-year-old fish reached a mean length of 15.1 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 15.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDuring spring electrofishing  by the Fond du Lac band and the 1854 Treaty Authority, 493 walleye 10 inches or larger were marked (red tags) and released in Cascade Lake.  Recaptures of marked fish during the August 2012 assessment allowed us to estimate that the lake supported a total population of 1,400 walleye 10-inches or larger in April 2012 (plus or minus 450 fish). <br> \n <br> \nThis assessment provided no evidence for over-harvest of walleye in this lake.  Walleye gill net catches have increased slightly, and the mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets has increased substantially since both reached lows in 1998.  Older year classes were well represented in the 2012 catch, which included fish as old as ten years. <br> \n <br> \nThe long range catch goal for northern pike was met in 2012, but no fish larger than 25 inches were collected.  Only three age classes contributed to the catch, and no fish older than three years were taken.  Growth of young northern pike had been fast; two-year-old fish reached a mean length of 17.3 inches at the end of their second year, compared to an average of 13.6 inches for similar lakes in this area.  Fast growth for northern pike was surprising, given the modest yellow perch population present, and high competition for forage from a fairly dense walleye population; however, similarly fast growth was also seen among young fish taken in the 2007 assessment of this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lack of older northern pike in this assessment could have been due to excessive harvest.  Gill net catches and the mean weight of northern pike taken in gill nets have declined since 1998, although both remain within historic ranges.  That said, most anglers on this lake target walleye, and it would be surprising if they were taking large numbers of northern pike.  Assessments in 1998 and 2007 collected a few larger northern pike, and it is possible that the results of the 2012 assessment were an anomaly. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 yellow perch gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1986.  Based on their lengths, most of the perch taken in this assessment may have been from a single year class.  Few would have been large enough to interest anglers. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the white sucker gill net catch was well above the median for the lake class, it was still one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  Most of the white sucker taken were too large to have served as forage for any but the largest northern pike. <br> \n</p>",
