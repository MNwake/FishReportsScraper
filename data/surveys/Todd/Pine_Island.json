                "narrative": "<p>The fish community structure of Pine Island Lake is typical of lakes withinits classification (Lake Class 29).  The lake is characterized by a high abundanceof small northern pike, low abundance of walleye and yellow perch and small, slowgrowing sunfish.  Since 1988, the northern pike gillnet catch has shown asignificant increase 8.00/set to 17.33/set).  The walleye gillnet catch fell from4.50/set to 3.00/set) which does not indicate a statistically significant decline. Stocking seems to be maintaining the population, although several areas around thelake have suitable spawning habitat.  High predation by the expanding northern pikepopulation and low forage availability have the potential to further reduce walleyecatches and stocking success.  The increasing pike population may also negativelyimpact the yellow perch population which has remained in the normal range for lakeclass 29 since 1950.  Largemouth bass populations are difficult to assess usingstandard lake survey gear.  Electrofishing will be required to accurately assessthe largemouth bass population.  Larger bass (3.5+ pounds) are commonly caught byanglers.  The bluegill trapnet catch fell within the normal lake class range andis dominated by small individuals.  Only one bluegill over 7.5 inches was sampledin the survey.  Black crappie population has remained stable.  Anglers report goodfishing for crappies with the average size 8 to 9 inches.  Development on the lakehas not increased much since the 1983 survey.  Most of the west side is marsh andpasture remaining undeveloped.  The small remaining stands of bulrush on the lakeare important fish habitat and need to be protected.</p>",

The lake has been daytime electrofished during four springs since 2011.  A total of 66 Largemouth Bass were captured in 2019 in just under an hour of effort resulting in a catch rate of 68/hour.   Bass ranged from 6.0 to 19.4 inches in length with half the fish falling in the 14-17.9 inch range.  Mean length was 13.3 inches.   Past daytime catch rates have been variable ranging from 28.5 to 77 per hour with a mean of 51 per hour.  The 2019 results were typical for Pine Island Lake and suggest a relatively stable population with consistent reproduction.  A variety of habitats are present in the lake including bulrush beds, woody cover, lily pads, cattail fringe and boulders.  Anglers seeking bass should find a range of sizes with some potential for larger fish over 18 inches.  Harvest of bass over 16 inches should be considered carefully as many of these fish may be 10 to 15 years old or even older.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Pine Island Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to a new regulation proposal.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring while offering increased protection to spawning bass.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually would be used to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on eight bass lakes (four experimental, four control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice.   <br> \n       Pine Island Lake was under consideration to be a control lake.  The lake has data from two previous electrofishing assessments, one daytime electrofishing (2011) and one night time electrofishing (1999).  Little Falls Area Fisheries acquired a new, more efficient electrofishing boat in 2007 and two netters are commonly used with the new boat versus one with the older rig.  Surface water temperature was 58 degrees at the time of the 2013 electrofishing assessment.  The 2013 daytime electrofishing produced the lowest catch of the three electrofishing efforts.  Only 26 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2013 for a catch rate of 28.5/hour.  The fish ranged from 4.5 to 17.4 inches in length with a mean length of 12.5 inches.  Only one bass exceeding sixteen inches was observed.  The modal length was the same in all three electrofishing samples, 13 - 14 inches.  The 2013 PSD of 78 was better than in 2011 (63) but lower than that of 1999 (81). <br> \n      The highest catch (n=77; 77/hour) of the three electrofishing efforts was produced in 2011 and the sample size structure was better compared to 2013.  The bass measured from 7.6 to 19.4 inches in length with a mean length of 12.7 inches and 12% (n=9) exceeded sixteen inches.  Larger bass comprised a greater portion of the 1999 electrofishing sample.  Fifty-eight Largemouth Bass (41/hour) were netted in the 1999 effort.  The fish were between 6.5 and 18 inches in length with a mean length of 12.9 inches.  Bass more than sixteen inches in length accounted for 16% (n=9) of the sample.   <br> \n       The 2013 electrofishing catch rate was also below the lake management goal of 40 - 60 bass per hour.  The 2013 catch did, along with the two previous catches, surpass the goal of a PSD from 40 - 60. <br> \n      Ages 2 through 7, 9 and 10 were represented in the 2013 bass catch.  A strong year class from 2007 accounted for 38% (n=10) of the sample and was responsible for the modal length.  Bass in the two younger age groups appeared to grow slow while the older age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.   <br> \n     Spring electrofishing in 2013 also provided an opportunity to further evaluate the Black Crappie population in Pine Island Lake as electrofishing has proven to be an effective method for sampling crappie.  Although the crappie tended to be in deeper water than the bass, attempts were made to catch all crappies that were observed.  Thirty-five Black Crappie were netted in the 2013 spring electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 38.3/hour.  The same number of crappie were caught in the 1999 spring electrofishing effort but the catch rate was 24.5/hour.  Sixty-five crappie were caught in the 2011 daytime spring electrofishing effort (65/hour).   <br> \n     Crappie in the 2013 sample measured from 8.6 to 11.3 inches in length with a mean length of 9.3 inches.  The sample size structures were comparable in the 2013 and 2011 efforts.  Crappie in the 2011 sample were between 7.6 and 10.8 inches in length with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  Modal length was the same in both samples, 9 - 9.5 inches.  Fish exceeding nine inches comprised 63% (n=22) of the 2013 sample and 65% (n=42) of the 2011 catch.  In 2013 three crappie (9%) were more than ten inches compared to 12% (n=8) in 2011.   <br> \n     Size structure of the 1999 Black Crappie sample was more desirable.  Although the largest fish was only eleven inches, mean length was 9.6 inches and modal length 10 - 10.5 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 77% (n=27) of the sample with 48% (n=17) more than ten inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Island Lake is an aesthetically pleasing lake supporting a fairly typical bass/panfish type fishery in northern Todd County.  The lake lies amid mature pines and is located approximately 6 miles west of Cushing.  Mean depth of the lake is 13 feet with a maximum depth of 26 feet.  Approximately 53% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is very good with visibility down to 12 feet.  Minor algae blooms occur and can cause the water to have a slight greenish color.  Pine Island has lush aquatic plants that grow to a depth of 17 feet.  Northern water milfoil, Robbin's pondweed, flatstem pondweed, and largeleaf pondweed are common to abundant underwater plants in the lake and provide excellent fish habitat.  Common emergent type plants include waterlily (white and yellow) and commoncattail.  Bottom types in the shallows are mainly sand and rubble with some areas also containing gravel and boulder.     Pine Island Lake has an undesirable northern pike population characterized by high numbers and slow growth.  Northerns over 24 inches were not sampled during the assessment and most individuals were in the 12 to 16 inch range.  Most pike sampled did not reach 20 inches until their fifth growing season, a growth rate slower than normal for this area.  High northern pike populations can have negative impacts on prey populations and are often the cause for walleye stocking failures.  Anglers areencouraged to harvest small northerns and release pike over 24 inches.  It is thought that the presence of large northern pike may limit the abundance of smaller \"hamerhandles\".     The walleye population on Pine Island Lake provides a limited fishery and is supported almost entirely by stocking.  Walleye captured during the survey ranged from 10 to 26.5 inches.  Trophy individuals in excess of 10 pounds have been reported by anglers in the past.  It is likely that walleye managment success would improve with a reduction in the northern pike population.     Largemouth bass provide excellent opportunities for anglers targeting this species.  Spring electrofishing sampled fish from 6.5 to 18 inches with fish in the 12 to 17 inch range common.  Growth rates were normal to fast on Pine Island and some trophy bass over 20 inches exist.  The presence of slop bays, healthy submerged vegetation, and boat docks provide excellent habitat for bass.  Releasing largemouth bass 12 inches and larger would help maintain this quality fishery.     Black crappie in Pine Island Lake are normal in abundance when compared to similar lakes and offer a quality angling experience.  Crappies captured in the survey ranged from 4 to 11 inches with individuals in the 9 and 10 inch classes common.  Growth rates were normal to fast for all age groups sampled. The bluegill population shows undesirable characteristic such as; high numbers, slow growth, and small size.  Bluegill in the 6 and 7 inch range are present but anglers will likely sort through many small fish to find a few of acceptable size.  High harvest of larger bluegills would likely make the problem worse, therefore, it is recommended that anglers take enough for a meal and not kill an entire limit if they find some \"keepers\".  Some large pumpkinseeds to near 9 inches were sampled during the assessment.       Yellow perch were the primary prey species captured in Pine Island Lake and are present in good numbers.  Perch captured in the survey ranged from 5.3 to 8.7 inches in length.  The presence of a healthy perch population is a surprise in light of historically high northern pike numbers.  The success of the walleye stocking program probably depends on the maintenance of this perch population.  Other species sampled during the survey include black and brown bullhead and hybrid sunfish.      Shoreline seining in past surveys captured several shiner and minnow species along with young-of-the-year largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.</p>",

Water clarity was good for this area of the State with a secchi disk reading of almost twelve feet in early August.  The primary management species for Pine Island Lake are northern pike and black crappie.   The lake has a reputation for being a \"hammerhandle\" lake and survey results confirm that characteristic.   The northern pike gill net catch was above both the management goal for the lake and the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Few of the pike caught in the survey were over 24 inches, although one over 30 inches was measured and an occasional report is heard about larger fish.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike and release fish over 24 as high pike numbers can have a negative impact on prey populations and are often the cause of walleye stocking failures.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years, but the population has been declining despite stocking efforts.  Yellow perch numbers also have been declining and the gill net catch was a record low for the lake as well as below the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Pine Island appears to have abundant black crappie and largemouth bass populations.  While most crappie caught in the survey were less than nine inches in length, anglers could catch an occasional larger fish.  Quality size largemouth bass up to 20 inches were observed in the survey, however, the average size was closer to 12-13 inches or about one pound.  The bluegill population is dominated by an abundance of small fish.  Bluegill over seven inches have been rare in sampling efforts on the lake regardless of the time of year and gear type used.   Brown bullhead were the only bullhead species caught in the summer survey and quality size fish up to 12 inches were measured.   <br> \n      The access on Pine Island Lake is owned by the township and is actually the end of a township road.  The site has no ramp and limited parking.  During the summer it is not unusual for locals to use the access as a swimming beach.  Proper land use practices are encouraged in the surrounding watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the water quality and fish habitat in the lake.  Protecting the fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but 2 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including 4 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Pine Island Lake from this survey is well above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes and indicative of an exceptional fish community. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Island Lake (DOW# 77-0067-00; Lake Class 29) is a 235 acre lake located near Cushing, Minnesota. A township owned gravel boat ramp is located on the north Shore. Pine Island Lake has 3.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 26 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Pine Island Lake is in Lake Class 29; lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nPine Island Lake is predominantly known as a bass and panfish lake. The majority of Bluegill and Black Crappie were just below the size that most anglers prefer, although there were good numbers of both. Numbers of Largemouth Bass were not as high as in the past, but a large percentage of bass sampled were between 12-15 inches. Both Northern Pike and Walleye numbers were similar to past years, however higher numbers of larger Northern Pike were sampled with pike up to 35 inches. Anglers should consider any Walleye caught as a pleasant surprise. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Pine Island Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Island Lake is an aesthetically pleasing lake supporting a fairly typical bass/panfish type fishery in northern Todd County.  Much of the shallow water bottom type was sand and rubble with approximately 53% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity was good with visibility down to 13 feet which allows aquatic vegetation to grow to a depth of 18 feet.  Pine Island has lush aquatic vegetation with the most common submerged plants being northern water milfoil, bushy pondweed, largeleaf pondweed and Robbins pondweed.  The west end of the lake is shallow with dense vegetation beds, muck bottom, and marshy shoreline.  The lake also has two small islands which are connected by a shallow bar covered with waterlilies.  The lake does have a sand/gravel public access that is located at the end of a township road and is also used as a swimming beach.    Panfish and largemouth bass are species commonly sought by anglers in the spring and summer with northern pike and black crappies being popular in the winter.  A special assessment was conducted in April targetting crappies and bluegills.  The average size of the spring caught crappies was about 9 inches and the bluegills about 6 inches.  There were some nice size crappies seen up to 11 inches but few nice size bluegills over 7 inches were observed.  Pine Island Lake has historically had an abundant northern pike population.  While there were a few more pike seen over 21 inches than in the last survey the average continues to be small, about 19 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northerns and release pike over 24 inches as high pike numbers can have a negative impact on prey populations and are often the cause of walleye stocking failures.  The walleye and yellow perch catches were down from 1999 levels.  If anglers are lucky enough to locate some walleyes, chances are good that they will be quality fish as the average size in the survey was almost 19 inches and anglers have reported catching 10 pound fish.  While most anglers complain about perch, high perch numbers typically promote good growth rates in both northerns and walleye as well as bluegills.      Neascus or black spot was common on some of the northern pike and yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.    Proper land use practices are encouraged in the surrounding watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the water quality and fish habitat in the lake.  Protecting the fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Information on shoreline regulations, restoration, and best management practices can be found at the Todd County Planning and Zoning website as well as the DNR website.www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm    and   www.dnr.state.mn.us</p>",
