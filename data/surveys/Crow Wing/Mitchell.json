                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 439 acre lake located three miles north of Fifty Lakes in Crow Wing County.  It reaches a maximum depth of 78 feet, with 28% of the lake 15' deep or less.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Development is moderate around most of the lake.   A 2008 aquatic vegetation survey found a diverse plant community.   Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in alternate (odd-numbered) years.  The 2014 walleye catch of 0.9/gillnet was below average, though the average size was quite nice at 20.9\" and 3.5 lbs.  Walleyes up to 29.3\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation has been in effect since 2003 requiring the release of all northern pike less than 40\" in length.  The gillnet catch of 6.9/net was average compared to similar lakes.  The average size was 23.8\" and 3.2 lbs.  Northern pike at least 24\" long made up 39% of the catch, with 15% being over 30\" in length.  Growth was above average with seven year classes present.  The 2011 year class made up 44% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch was average at 1.2/gillnet and 0.8/trapnet.  For both gears combined 56% of black crappies were at least 8\" in length.  Black crappies up to 12.3\" were captured.  Bluegill numbers were low at 2.6/ trapnet.  Size was decent with 52% at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 22.0/ hr.  The average length was 13.7\" with 64% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 6.0/ hr.  The average size was 16.0\" with 83% measuring at least 14\" in length.  Smallmouth up to 19.5\" were captured.  Smallmouth were also sampled in average numbers in gillnets, with an average size of 17.1\".  <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Mitchell Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Mitchell Lake on August 3rd, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.8 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.2?C (66.6?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 1996-2002 further indicate marginal oxythermal habitat in most years, with the worst conditions recorded in 2002. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye stocking switched from fingerling to fry stocking in 2017.  The changed seemed to have helped, as 9 of the 11 Walleyes captured were from fry stocking years.  The catch rate was average for this type of lake (1.2/gill net), with an average length of 13.3\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were the highest ever at 13.0/gill net with an average size of 22.9\".  Recently, the Northern Pike regulations switched from a minimum size of 40\" to a 24\"-36\" slot.  This new regulation will allow fishermen to keep some of the smaller fish, while giving fish over 24\" a chance to grow into trophies.  The growth rate of these fish is fast, and with a variety of prey such as Redhorse, White Suckers, and Tullibee, the potential is there for Mitchell to produce trophy fish as it has in the past.  Anecdotal reports suggest that fish over 40\" still exist in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nMitchell contains both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  While electrofishing wasn't completed in 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions, small amounts of both were captured in our nets in 2020.  Average length of Smallmouth Bass was 16.9\", while the lone Largemouth caught in gill nets was 17.3\".  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish didn't look to offer much for fishing opportunities.  While Black Crappies numbers were high for this type of lake at 2.7/trap net, average size was small at only 5.6\".  Some larger fish up to 11.3\" do exist.  Bluegill numbers were average at 19.2/trap net, but size was small.  Average length was 5.7\" and only 9% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 439 acre lake located about three miles northeast of Fifty Lakes.  A public access is located on the east end of the lake.  The maximum depth is 78' and about 27% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essentlai spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes have been stocked as fry on an annual basis since 1981 and are currently stocked at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre (118,000 fry).  The 2001 walleye catch of 0.8/gill net was below average.  Compared to 1996, average length and weight increased from 18.1\" and 2.4lbs to 22.3\" and 4.0lbs.Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2001 at 6.3/gill net, which is the highest abundance to date.  Fish from the 1998 year class averaged 22.5\" and contributed 56% of the catch.  Compared to 1996, average length and weight for all northern pike increased from 21.7\" and 2.4lbs to 24.8\" and 4.2lbs with relatively fast growth.The largemouth bass catch of 0.2/trap net was below average, but is similar to past catches on this lake.  Average weight was 0.5lbs.  Smallmouth bass abundance was average at 0.7/gill net.  Average length and weight were 15.9\" and 2.1lbs, respectively.The bluegill catch of 13.0/trap net was average compared to similar lakes and is typical for this lake.  Growth was relatively slow and 4.3% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 10% in 1996 and 1991.  Black crappie abundance was average in 2001 at 1.2/trap net.  Average weight was 0.3lbs and 72.7% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger, compared to 50% in 1996.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's gamefish.  All were sampled in average numbers in 2001. </p>",

Mitchell is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 31st, 2020, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 3 stations.  Twenty eight species were sampled, including ten species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Burbot, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 6-9, 2020 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 15 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 18.6 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 14.0?C (57.2?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Data collected in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2002 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

Bluegills (16.33/trapnet) remained average in both abundance and size (0.13/lb). Median length was 5.0 inches.  Catch of smallmouth bass (0.83/gillnet) remained average.  Ages 3-5 were present among the five fish caught and aged.  As in 1985, only one small largemouth bass was captured in survey nets.  The catch of black crappie rose from the low category (0.33/trapnet) in 1985, to the high category (3.83/trapnet) in 1991 compared to quartile values for the lake class.  Crappie size averaged 0.4 lb in 1991.  Median length was up to 9.0 inches.  Walleye abundance dropped from 3.83 to 2.00/ gillnet since 1985, a 48% change and statistically significant.  Catch remained in the average category for the lake class, however.  Five age classes were present (1-2, 5-7) in roughly equal numbers.  Annual fry stocking has also been done since before 1984.  Yellow perch (4.5/gillnet) decreased in numbers since 1985 (7.5/gillnet); not a statistically significant change.  Median size was similar to 1985 but size range was 5.0-6.4 inches in 1991 compared to 5.0-10.4 inches in 1985.  Yellow bullhead (3.33/ trapnet) remained average in numbers and size. Yellow bullheads to 13.0 inches. Burbot were sampled in 1985 but not in 1991.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell is a 439 acre lake located about three miles northeast of Fifty Lakes.  A public access is located on the east end of the lake.  Maximuum depth is 78 feet and about 27% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is below average for this area.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand and gravel.  A variety of aquatic plants is present.  Emergents, like bulrush, enhance the quality of spawning habitat for largemouth bass and panfish species.  The several submergent and floating leafed species present in the lake provide important food sources and protective cover for a wide variety of species.Northern pike were the most abundant gamefish sampled in the 1996 test netting.  Their abundance was \"average\" when compared with similar type lakes, but was on the \"high\" end when compared to past nettings of Mitchell Lake.  A number of year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Pike averaged 21 inches and 2.4 lbs. in size in 1996.The walleye catch was also in the \"average\" category compared to similar type lakes.  A number of year classes were sampled, most having similar abundances in the catch.  Walleyes averaged 18 inches and 2.4 lbs. in '96.  Walleye fry have been stocked on a nearly annual basis since the early 1980s.Largemouth bass were caught in \"low\" numbers in 1996 but the catch was similar to past catch rates.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in the lake since 1980.  The 1996 catch was similar to that made in 1991.Bluegills were caught in \"low\" numbers in '96 but the catch was within the catch range from previous nettings.  Bluegill growth was good and about 10% of sampled fish were 7.0 inches or more in length, similar to 1991 findings.  Black crappies were found in \"average\" numbers.  Five different year classes were found in the sample of six fish caught and aged.A variety of forage species was sampled in 1996.  Yellow perch, an important forage base for walleyes and northern pike, were sampled in \"low\" numbers in '96.  Most perch were sampled as young fish during natural reproduction checking.  Tullibee were also caught in '96.  Their catch increased over the 1991 catch but was within the range seen in past nettings.  White suckers were taken in \"average\" numbers in '96.  Past catches had all been in the \"high\" category.Other species sampled in 1996 included bowfin (dogfish), rock bass, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullheads and greater redhorse.</p>",

This is in response to the 40\" minimum size regulation implemented in 2003, intended to maintain or improve the abundance of large pike in the lake, and will be used to evaluate the regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling was conducted from April 14-27, 2008.  Initially, 2 single frame, 3/4 inch trap nets were used to block the inlet from Dagget Brook, immediately upstream of the mouth.  This location is consistent with past sampling.  Water temperature was 36 F when sampling began.  Three trap nets were also set in close proximity to the mouth as well as a single net upstream in case fish were not caught in the two nets blocking the mouth.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 113 fish were sampled.  The maximum length attained for males was 29.5\" and 34.8\" for females.  Stock length was considered to be 14\" and of these 98 fish, 20% were at least 24\" and 5% were 30\" or greater.  A total of 57 stock length males were sampled with 14% measuring at least 24\".  Of the 41 stock length females, 29% measured at least 24\" and 12% were at least 30\".  No fish were sampled above the 40\" minimum length requirement.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 439 acre lake located about three miles northeast of Fifty Lakes.  A public access is found on the east end of the lake.  The maximum depth is 78' and about 27% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  There is considerable development with 96 homes/cabins along nearly 5 miles of shoreline and it is imperative that lakeshore property owners exercise good stewardship to prevent water quality problems.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 28 species present, and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were stocked as fry on an annual basis from 1981-2002 and are currently stocked as fingerlings, beginning in 2004.  The 2008 walleye catch of 1.6/gill net is considered average for the lake.  Compared to 2001, average length and weight decreased from 22.3\" and 4.0lbs to 15.5\" and 1.6lbs in 2008 because of the increased presence of younger year classes resulting from fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers when compared to similar lakes.  However, at 7.1/gill net this is the highest abundance to date.  The 2005 year class contributed 44% of the catch.  Average length and weight continued to increase from the previous two surveys and are now at 26.1\" and 4.2lbs.  Northern pike under 40\" are currently protected by an experimental regulation that went into effect in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch of 18.9/trap net was average compared to similar lakes, and is similar to typical catches on this lake.  Size continues to be relatively small with only 8% measuring at least 7\".  Black crappie abundance was above average in 2008 at 3.3/trap net.  Average weight was 0.2lbs and only 11% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger, compared to 73% in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, white suckers, and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  All were sampled in average numbers when compared to similar lakes,although white sucker and tullibee catches were among the lowest to date. <br> \n</p>",
