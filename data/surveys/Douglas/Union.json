Emergent vegetation, mainly cattail and hardstem bulrush, is abundant around the majority of the lakeshore.  Water clarity is very good.  Mid-summer Secchi reading was 9.0 feet.Northern pike remain abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 12.0 fish/net.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 1.6 pounds.  The northern pike population is currently dominated by two and three-year-old fish.  Sampled fish averaged 19.4 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 30.1 inches.Fewer largemouth bass were captured in 2005.  Day electrofishing catches averaged 7.5 fish/hour.  The change from night electrofishing may explain the decline given the high water clarity.Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 14.6 fish/net.  Mean length of sampled fish was 6.4 inches.  The largest fish measured 8.9 inches.  Over 73% of captured fish exceeded 6.0 inches, however, only 4% of the fish exceeded 8.0 inches.Black crappie relative abundance increased.  Trapnet catches averaged 3.9 fish/net.  Mean length of sampled fish was 9.2 inches.  Ninety-seven percent of the captured fish were age-4.Yellow perch numbers are very low.  This may be explained by high northern pike abundance.  One walleye was sampled in gillnets in 2005.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Union Lake was conducted in June 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations and a 15-foot seine was used at eight stations. Several sites had soft sediments and a substantial fringe of abundant bulrush and water lilies, with deep water beyond, making sampling nearshore fishes difficult. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Union Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union (also referred to as South Union) Lake is a small, bowl-shaped basin located between Alexandria and Forada. Water quality and clarity are good. Water transparency readings typically exceed 10 feet during summer months. A small, public access is located along the northeast shoreline. Union Lake contains a relatively simple fish community consistent with most bass-panfish lakes found in west-central Minnesota.\n\nThe Bluegill population (22.3/trap net) is similar to recent surveys. Recruitment is consistent, with many strong year classes. Growth is also fairly fast. Average and maximum length were almost 6 and 9 inches, respectively. Similar to other mid-July surveys, few Black Crappies were sampled. During the 2022 survey, Black Crappie abundance (2.8/gill net) while low, was a historical high for Union Lake. Average and maximum length were over 10 and 13 inches, respectively.\n \nLargemouth Bass relative abundance (82/hour of electrofishing) was substantially higher than the previous two surveys (34.2/hour in 2016 and 19.6/hour in 2010). Bass ranged in length from 3 to 19 inches, with a mean of 11.5 inches. Many bass were small but 34% exceeded 14 inches.\n\nNorthern Pike (5.5/gill net) were less abundant than they have been in the past. Size structure was poor (81% of pike were below 22 inches), similar to past surveys. Average length was slightly over 20 inches and the largest pike sampled was only 28 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike. New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase size structure. Union Lake is in the North-Central Zone, where all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Anglers can keep 10 pike, but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nWalleye (0.8/gill net) and Yellow Perch (0.3/gill net) were sampled at low densities, but this is similar to previous surveys. Walleye ranged in length from 19 to 23 inches. Too few of each species were sampled for any meaningful analysis. Other species sampled were Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

The relative abundance of Northern Pike has declined by 50% since the 1979 survey. This figure may not be statistically sound due to only 2 nets being used in the 1979 survey. The present index (8.0 fish/gill net) is still considered abundant when compared to state and local medians. The average weight is 1.6 lbs Yellow Perch and Black Crappie number are low.

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill trap net catches declined to 9.15/fish net. Previous surveys conducted in 1966, 1979, and 1984 had catches of 77.2, 75.3 and 45.3 Bluegills/trap net. Although Bluegill trap net abundance declined, gill net catches increased. Discrepancies in catch rate and gear efficiency may be due to a later survey date. PSD of the Bluegills had steadily decreased from 73.0 percent in 1966 to 25.0 percent in 1989. Most large individuals were caught in gill nets in deeper water. This suggests the larger Bluegills have moved out into deeper water seek thermal refuge and are no longer vulnerable to the trap nets. The Bluegills are slow growing with age 5 fish averaging 6.04 inches in total length. Northern Pike abundance has dropped from 16.0 fish/gill net in 1979 to 4.75 fish/gill net in 1989. This decrease in abundance may account for a slight increase in mean size from 1.56 lbs to 1.93 lbs. Age 4 Northern Pike averaged only 19.3 inches in total length. The Largemouth Bass population was sampled by electrofishing gear. A catch rate of 20.0 fish/hr was calculated from electrofishing efforts. Growth rates of Largemouth Bass were quite slow with age 5 bass averaging 12.95 inches. The 1988 Walleye fingerling stocking consisted of carry-over fish made up of 1987 year-class. Five of seven Walleyes sampled were from this 1987 year-class. No Yellow Perch were captured in gill nets and only three were taken in the trap nets. The bullhead species are quality size and could have sport fishing or commercial value. Yellow Bullhead comprise the dominant bullhead species. Catch averaged 32.0 fish/gillnet.</p>",

Emergent vegetation, mainly cattail and bulrush are abundant around most of the lakeshore.  Recently much of the south and northwestern shorelines have been or are being developed.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are both abundant in South Union Lake and should provide quality angling opportunities.  The northern pike population is currently dominated by 2 year-old fish which averaged 17 inches at capture, however, larger fish are present.  Forty three percent of the largemouth bass population sampled exceeded 12 inches in length.  Bluegill are not as abundant in South Union Lake as they are in other similar lakes.  Bluegill also tend to be small, few fish larger than 7 inches were sampled with either trap or gill nets.  Although not many were captured in the 2000 survey, anglers have reported good to excellent fishing for black crappies in recent years.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake is a 104-acre lake located southeast of Alexandria, near Forada.  Water clarity measurements exceed 13 feet during summer months.  A broad band of emergent plants, namely hardstem bulrush and cattails ring much of the shoreline.  Rooted aquatic plants are common to abundant, particularly in the shallow southwest portion of the lake.  Habitat attributes are most characteristic of a bass-panfish lake.  A DNR public access is located on the northeast side of the lake.  Union Lake is relatively quiet and only moderately developed compared to other lakes in the area.  <br> \n  <br> \nA standardized fisheries survey was completed in 2016 to gain estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Largemouth Bass population attributes were gained from a night electrofishing survey completed May 18, 2016.  Electrofishing catches described a modest density of Largemouth Bass.  Sizes at capture ranged from 5.9 inches to 17.2 inches and averaged 12.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe netting component of the standard survey occurred July 18-21.  Northern pike proved to be abundant.  Pike catches averaged 20.5 inches in length.  Seven of the 56 Northern Pike captured in gill nets exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  The largest pike capture measured 31.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stockings have not been very successful in this very small, clear water lake holding an abundance of competitors and predators, namely Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.  Five Walleyes were captured.  With few young fish in the population, age structure and average size of Walleyes was skewed towards larger fish.  Average size of Walleye captures was 20.3 inches and 3.8 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches were modest as expected in mid-summer surveys.  The population sample included representatives of six age classes.  Age distribution extended to age 7.  Crappie captures ranged from 3.9 to 12.1 inches.  Fish quality offered by the crappie population was good.  Twenty-five percent of captures were 10.0 inches and larger.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills proved abundant.  The population sample depicted some modest recruitment of young fish into the population each year and an age distribution that extended to age 12.  Bluegill growth is a little below average, but with the extended age structure, a modest density of 8.0 inch and larger fish were present.  The single 12-year-old Bluegill captured measured 10.1 inches in length.  The panfish community also includes Pumpkinseed Sunfish and sunfish hybrids.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present, but few are large enough to stimulate harvest. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes common to surveys include Bowfin or dogfish, as well as Yellow and Brown Bullheads. <br> \n  <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to take advantage of the lightly exploited surpluses of 21.0-inch and smaller Northern Pike and 12.0-inch and smaller Largemouth Bass and release larger gamefishes to enhance fishing quality.   <br> \n</p>",

Gillnet catches averaged 15.3 fish/net which exceeds the normal range ofmean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.5 - 10.5fish/gillnet).  Gilllnet catches have ranged from 4.8 to 15.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating backto 1966.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 2.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass are also abundant andshould provide quality angling opportunities.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 78.9 stock-size fishper hour.  Approximately 75% of the fish were 12 inches in length or greater and 18% exceeded 15inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.4 pounds.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 16.1 fish/netin 1995 compared to 9.1 fish/net in 1989.  Trapnet catches averaged 45.3, 75.3, and 77.2 fish/net in1984, 1979, and 1966, respectively.  Most of the fish captured were small.  Only 25% were 6.0 inchesor greater.  Trapnets may not effectively sample the bluegill population in the extensive shallow areasof Union Lake during July.  Many of the larger fish may inhabit deeper water at this time of the year. Gillnet catches averaged 4.0 fish/net and most of the fish were 6.0 to 8.0 inches in total length. Walleye catches averaged 1.8 fish/gillnet in 1995.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 0.5 - 2.0 fish/netin previous surveys.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.3 - 5.0fish/gillnet.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked one of every three years to provide an additionalfishing opportunity.  However, the age class distribution of fish captured in gillnets does notcorrelate with stocking chronology.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union (also referred to as South Union) Lake is a small, bowl-shaped basin located between Alexandria and Forada.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Water transparency readings typically exceed 10.0 feet during summer months.  Extensive beds of submergent vegetation are common in shallow areas.  Emergent vegetation is abundant around most of the shoreline. Residential development can be described as low to moderate.  A small, public access is located along the northeast shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nUnion Lake contains a relatively simple fish community consistent with most bass-panfish fisheries found in west-central Minnesota.  Anglers can expect good numbers of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Size structures of these populations, especially bluegill and northern pike, tend to be skewed towards smaller individuals in response to slow growth.  Other gamefish species present include black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch.  Walleye and yellow perch numbers are very low.   Walleye fingerlings have been stocked but stocking success on this basin has been poor.  Consequently, walleye are now stocked only in years when surplus fish are available.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike to reduce predation on and competition with the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected during the 2010 lake survey include bowfin (dogfish), brown and yellow bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2015.  <br> \n</p>",
