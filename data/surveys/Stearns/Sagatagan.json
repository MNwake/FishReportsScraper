                "narrative": "<p>Sagatagan Lake is located in Stearns County, three miles west of St. Joseph, and entirely within the campus of St. John's University.  The lake is 159 acres in size, has a mean depth of 8.9 feet and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  There is no public access.  It is a typical bass-panfish lake with high numbers of bass, bluegill and northern pike and low numbers of yellow perch and black crappie.  No species are currently stocked.  The lake has good water clarity and a diverse plant community, probably due to its small, undeveloped watershed and largely unaltered shoreline.  Northern pike are abundant and there has been little change from 1984 to 2000 in the catch rate or average size (1.6 pounds, 20 inches in 2000).  Growth is slow and few pike larger than 24 inches were caught; the largest individual was 28 inches. The number of largemouth bass caught during spring electrofishing was below average, but the average size was high.  Half of all bass captured were larger than 12 inches and the largest was 20.7 inches.  Few yellow perch were captured in the 2000 survey and all were small.  Low perch numbers may be caused by abundant small pike and may also be limiting pike growth. Bluegill abundance has not changed substantially since the 1984 survey and is still within the expected range for this lake type.  The average size of bluegill was normal (5.2 inches) and the largest caught was 7.7 inches.  Black crappie catch rate and average size were typical for this type of lake.  However, crappies captured during the summer survey were mostly medium-sized fish (8 inches) and none were larger than 9 inches.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were also caught during the survey in low numbers, but some were over 8 inches in length.  Yellow bullhead catch rates increased from 1984 to 2000 while their average weight remained normal (0.5 pounds).  Yellow bullhead are common in lakes with good water quality and are not a cause for concern.  A few brown bullheads were also captured.  Anglers can help improve fishing in Sagatagan Lake by selectively harvesting smaller pike (less than 22 inches) and releasing larger pike and bass.  Reducing the number of small pike may allow perch numbers to increase, providing better forage for pike and increasing their growth.  Releasing larger bass may help keep average bass size high and help keep the number of small bluegill in check.  If the watershed and shoreline remain largely undeveloped, it seems likely that the lake and the fish community will remain stable.</p>",

The Bluegill population was composed of extremely slow growing fish and were abundant at 37.8/trap net (twice the local median). Black Crappies, 6.8/ gill net, (not taken in traps) and Largemouth Bass (0.3/trap net) show average growth but were both taken at rates well below the local median. Yellow Bullheads were taken at a rate of 2 times the local median (10.8/trap net) but were generally small in size at 7-9 inches. Yellow Perch were present, but in very low numbers (0.7/gill net).</p>",
