The majority of fish caught were 3 and 4 year olds, and growth rates for northerns were fast.  The average size northern caught in Two Rivers (3.8 lbs) remained above average for this lake type.        The catch rate of walleye (1.7/gill net) also did not significantly change from the previous survey (1.8/gill net).   The average weight of walleye in gill nets was 1.1 lbs, and 14.2 inches in length.  The majority of fish caught were two years old and growth rates were average for this lake class.        The catch rate in gill nets of yellow perch increased dramatically, reaching the highest level reported so far (70.7/gill net).  Yellow perch averaged 7.8 inches in length and ranged in size up to 11 inches.  The majority of fish caught were 4 years old and growth rates for perch were average.        The catch rate in trap nets of bluegills (1.1/trap net) remained low for this lake type, and did not significantly change from the previous survey (2.4/trap net).  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 5.6-8.7 inches and averaged 7.4 inches in length.  The average weight of bluegill was 0.4 lbs, which was above the state average.        The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets did not change significantly from the previous survey and remained within expected levels for lakes like Two Rivers.  Black crappie caught ranged in size from 5.4-13.0 inches and averaged 6.9 inches in length.  The trap net catch of white crappies (0.1/trap net) appeared to drop substantially from the previous survey (15.4/trap net), falling below the state average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Rivers Lake is a 575-acre lake located three miles southwest of Holdingford in north central Stearns County. The lake has a maximum depth of 63 feet and an average summer water clarity of 6.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to a depth of 15 feet. The watershed is large with land use dominated by cultivated crops and pasture. The Two River flows through Two Rivers Lake and into the Mississippi River 10 miles to the northeast. A public access is located on the west side of the lake.  Two Rivers is managed primarily for Walleye and the last survey was conducted in 2019. Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye fishery of Two Rivers Lake has been maintained through a mixture of fry and fingerling stocking dating back to 1952.. Fingerling stocking continues biennially with additional stocking by the lake association. The Walleye catch in 2023 was similar to 2019 and the long-term average for Two Rivers Lake and was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Two Rivers. Lengths in 2023 ranged from 8.5 to 29.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 1.8 pounds. Sixty-five percent of walleye sampled were longer than 15 inches. Walleye grow fast in Tw River Lake reaching 15 inches in 3 - 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were the highest on record , surpassing the previous high in 2019.Northern Pike numbers have increased tremendously since 2014 and are now above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Two Rivers. Lengths ranged from 13.0 to 35.0 inches with an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 3.3 pounds. Twenty-three percent of Northern Pike were longer than 26 inches  and 9% were longer than 30 inches. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike in the coming years, with a good chance to catch some larger fish. However, anglers can help maintain the quality size structure by harvesting smaller pike (less than 22 inches) and releasing the larger individuals in the population. <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was conducted May 26th. The catch rate for Largemouth Bass was higher than in 2019, whereas the catch rate for Smallmouth Bass was lower than in 2019. The Largemouth Bass catch rate was well below the average bass catch rate in the Sauk Rapids Area. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 13.4 to 19.3 inches with an average length of 15.7 inches while Smallmouth Bass lengths ranged from 11.0 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 16.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2023 was lower than the catch in 2019, but within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Two Rivers. Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 7.9 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches. Thirty-nine percent of the Bluegill caught were longer than six inches and none were longer than eight inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were lower than 2019, but still above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.2 inches with an average length of 7.7 inches. Fourteen percent of crappies were longer than 10 inches. Anglers can expect the good fishing for Black Crappie, with the chance of catching fish over 10 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were lower than 2019, but within the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 8.0 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches. This decrease in Yellow Perch numbers may be partially due to the increase in Northern Pike numbers over the last 10 years. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Suckers continue to be relatively abundant with catches above the range of expected values for the lake class. Other species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Rivers Lake is a 575 acre lake located in central Stearns County.  Two Rivers Lake has a large watershed heavily influenced by agriculture. Consequently, these practices have large impacts on the resources within the watershed.  Water quality was below average for the North Central Hardwoods area.  Water clarity was 3.5 feet. The combination of lower water quality and clarity likely resulted in few aquatic plants.  Water characteristics and most fish populations were similar to the results seen in the 2009 survey.  Two Rivers Lake provides an excellent opportunity for a multi species fishing trip, quality sized fish for catch and release opportunities, as well fish for consumption. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Rivers Lake is managed primarily for Walleye.  Combinations of fry and fingerlings have been stocked; however, since 2010 it has been stocked with fingerlings. Walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 28.3 inches, and averaged 16.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also a primary management species in Two Rivers Lake. The number of Northern Pike was low relative to similar lakes.  The 24 fish caught ranged in length from 11.1 to 28.9 inches with an average length of 22.3 inches. The average length was slightly smaller than 2009; however, the average weight, 2.6 pounds, was higher. <br> \n  <br> \nBass were sampled by electrofishing on May 22, 2014.  A total of 23 Largemouth Bass and 55 Smallmouth Bass were captured at a rate of 18.8 and 44.9 fish per hour, respectively.  Better sampling conditions could explain the higher catch rate when compared to previous surveys. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 13.1 to 20.5 inches, with an average length of 16.2 inches. Smallmouth Bass ranged from 9.3 to 19.6 inches, and averaged 14.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were noticeably lower. Only 22 fish were sampled this year compared to 169 in 2009.  The gill net catch was 3.2 fish per net. Size was similar to previous surveys.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.4 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Yellow Perch numbers could be down for a variety of reasons including: poor recruitment, predation, or limited food resources.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were found in larger numbers (23.2/gill net; 10.1/trap net).  Fish ranged in length from 6.5 to 12.1 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  In the previous survey there were fewer fish; however, they were slightly longer on average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill results (3.4/trap net) were similar to previous surveys (4.2/trap net).  Fish ranged from 5.0 to 8.5 inches in length, averaging 7.4 inches and 0.4 pounds.  The total number of fish captured was lower than the expected values for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were present in the survey and were measured up to 33.9 inches and 13.7 pounds.  The sampling gear used in this survey is not well suited to sample Common Carp; consequently, it is difficult to make accurate statements about Common Carp beyond their presences or absence. All three species of bullhead (Black, Brown, and Yellow) were observed in this survey.  Black Bullhead represented the majority of the bullhead catch. The average length of all three species of bullhead was less than 12 inches.  White Sucker relative abundance and size seems to be relatively unchanged from the 2009 survey. Fish ranged in length from 14.6 to 22.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe last plant survey was conducted in 2009. Seven species of submersed aquatic plants were identified.  <br> \nOf these, only one, sago pondweed was common. Adequate dissolved oxygen was available to 20 feet during early July. The relatively low diversity and abundance of aquatic plants is likely the result of poor water quality characteristics and low water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth Bass abundance was also low, with nine fish showing average growth. White Crappie were abundant and have increased dramatically from previous surveys. The 1985 year class made up 91% of the sample. Growth was good. Black Crappie abundance also increased but was still considered normal for area lakes. The sample which had good growth, was 60% age three and 28% age four fish. Walleye abundance was average and increased from a scarce 0.5 fish per lift in 1982. The sample of 11 fish averaged good growth. The Walleye catch showed a fair match with stocking records. Yellow Perch declined from historically abundant levels to more average 10.5 per gill net. The sample consisted of mostly six to seven inch fish. No young of the year perch were sampled in shoal water seining. White Suckers have increased to an abundant 9.7/gill net from 0.3/gill net in 1982. Common Shiners were also present. Black Bullhead gill net catches indicated they were abundant. Also present was an expected amount of Yellow Bullheads and Common Carp. Shoreline seining captured 358 young of the year carp. Bowfin (dogfish) remained scarce.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Rivers Lake is a 575 acre recreational development lake located in central Stearns County.  The lake has been heavily impacted by agricultural use within the watershed and by poor water quality of the South Two River.  Water quality parameters were typically below average for the North Central Hardwoods eco-region.  Because of poor water quality there was a lack of aquatic plants and oxygen was present only to 16 feet. In lakes like these northern pike, bass and sunfish tend to be low in abundance, while crappie and walleye have higher numbers.   This was true of Two Rivers Lake, in this, the first survey since 1999. <br> \n <br> \nBass were sampled by electrofishing on May 12, 2009.  Only four largemouth and two smallmouth bass were captured in an hour of electrofishing.  Because of poor water quality Two Rivers Lake is not known as a bass lake, however, the low catch might have been due to the 40 mph winds on the night of electrofishing.  During that same evening we observed 57 walleye (< 11 inches, not measured) while searching for bass.  Smallmouth bass are present due to the influence of the South Two River and its connection with the Mississippi River.  At other times during electrofishing we have observed bass to be more abundant and always in good condition. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike (1.3/gill net) was below the range of normal values for lakes similar to Two Rivers.  The catch was similar to historic catches, which have always been low in number.  Fish ranged in length from 13 to 33 inches with an average of 25.5 inches.  The percent of northern pike greater than 24 inches was 50%. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Rivers Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  Fry have been stocked in nine of the past 14 years.  Fry stocking during the years 2005-2008 met with little success and the result has been fingerling contingency stockings.  The catch of walleye (3.7/gill net) declined from 1999 (6.5/gill net).  The decline was greater than 40% but the catch was still within the range of expected values.  Walleye ranged in length from 11 to 28 inches with an average of 21 inches.  At times the walleye fishing on Two Rivers Lake can be good. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, yellow perch have been abundant.  The gill net catch, 27.5/gill net, declined significantly from 1999 (67.3/gill net), though it was still within the average range.  High yellow perch abundance suggests that food availability for stocked walleye is good.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie (9.4/trap net) was above the range of expected values, as it has been since 1982.  Black crappie ranged in length from 1.1 to 9.8 inches with a mean of 7.7 inches.  Growth rates for black crappie were average, and fish grew to a length of eight inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (4.2/trap net) catches were low and below the range of expected values for lake class 24. Only once in the four nettings since 1982 have bluegill been within the range of expected values. Bluegill ranged in length from 4.6 to 7.2 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  Growth rates for bluegill were above statewide averages, and fish grew to a length of six inches in three years.  <br> \n <br> \nCarp and bullheads were present in nuisance proportions despite the best removal efforts of local sportsmen.  A planned ice-out assessment of gamefish was called off due to high catches of bullheads.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Rivers Lake is a 575-acre lake located in Stearns County near the town of Holdingford. The lake has a large watershed with land use dominated by cultivated crops and pasture. Two Rivers Lake has a maximum depth of 63 feet. The Two River flows through Two Rivers Lake and into the Mississippi River 10 miles to the northeast. A public access is located on the west side of the lake. Water clarity was modest; Secchi depth was 4.5 feet in mid-July, compared to the MPCA 10 year summer average of 6.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 11 feet. Two Rivers is managed primarily for Walleye and the last survey was conducted in 2014. Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking maintained the Walleye fishery until 2003 when several consecutive fry stockings were unsuccessful. Fingerling stocking began in 2007 and continues biennially with additional stocking by the lake association. The Walleye catch in 2019 was similar to 2014 and the long-term average, and was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Two Rivers. Lengths ranged from 8.7 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 1.7 pounds. Twenty-seven percent of Walleye were longer than 15 inches. Seven year classes were represented; most Walleye were from the 2017 year class (age two) and grew to 11 inches by age two. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were the highest recorded, much higher than 2014 and the long-term average, and higher than the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 14.5 to 30.2 inches with an average length and weight of 22.9 inches and 2.7 pounds. Twenty-three percent of Northern Pike were longer than 26 inches and one percent were longer than thirty inches. <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was conducted on June 4th and June 7th. The catch rates for Largemouth Bass (5.8/hour) and Smallmouth Bass (7.6/hour) were lower than 2014 (18.8/hr, 44.9/hr, respectively) and well below the Sauk Rapids Area Largemouth Bass average of 43.3/hr. However, previous electrofishing was conducted at night when catches are typically higher. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 6.3 to 17.5 inches with an average length of 14.7 inches. Smallmouth Bass lengths ranged from 11.0 to 19.1 inches with an average length of 14.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was the highest recorded but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.0 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches. Sixty-one percent of the Bluegill caught were longer than six inches and none were longer than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were similar to 2014 and well above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. Only two percent of crappies were longer than 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were higher than 2014, lower than the long-term average, and within the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 9.3 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches. It is surprising that both Northern Pike and Yellow Perch numbers increased since the last survey. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were relatively numerous; the catch was above the range of expected values but similar to 2014. Other species captured included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

Low but consistent natural reproduction is occurring. Growth of pike was near average but slower for older fish.  Walleye abundance was low according to this survey but probably underestimated the actual abundance.  Only two age classes of Walleye were sampled but growth appears to be above average.  White and Black Crappie abundance was within the expected range for similar lakes. Largemouth Bass are naturally reproducing.  Although low, Bluegill abundance was higher than previous surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Rivers Lake is located in Stearns county, three miles southwest of Holdingford.  The lake is 575 acres in size, with a mean depth of 21 feet and maximum depth of 63 feet.  The lake lies in flat terrain, and the shoreline is comprised of cabins, grassland, wooded areas, and farms.  The lake bottom is largely marl and sand, with limited vegetation.  A public access is located on the west side of the lake, with parking for 10 or more vehicles.Two Rivers Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  A survey in 1999 found the walleye catch (6.5/gill net) to be within the range typical of lakes similar to Two Rivers.  The catch was substantially higher than the previous three surveys (1.7/gill net in 1993, 1.8 in 1988, and 0.5 in 1982). The higher catch rate may be a reflection of the change in the walleye stocking strategy - in 1995 the DNR began stocking walleye fry rather than fingerlings.  Nearly all of the walleye sampled in 1999 were two, three, or four years old, and therefore likely came from fry stocking.  Under the right conditions, a larger population of walleye can result from fry stocking, and at a much lower cost than fingerling stocking.  The average size of walleye was 15 inches, or 1.4 pounds.  Growth rates were above average.  Northern pike were caught in relatively low numbers (2.5/gill net), but averaged 23 inches, or 2.7 pounds.  The low numbers may favor survival and growth of walleye in the lake, since there is less predation by northern pike and less competition for food.  In also may lead to an increase in the average size of pike.  Yellow perch are a preferred food for both northern pike and walleye, and are abundant in Two Rivers Lake (67.3/gill net).  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers, and averaged nine inches in length.  The sparse aquatic vegetation may be limiting largemouth bass reproduction and feeding.  Smallmouth bass are also present, but may be migrating in from the South Two River, as suitable spawning habitat for smallmouth is limited within the lake.  Bluegill numbers appear to be up sharply from 1993, and are now average in both numbers and size.  However, water levels were high in 1993, and this may have hampered netting success for bluegill.  Black crappie are abundant but small for this type of lake.  Two Rivers Lake also holds populations of bullhead, dogfish, carp, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Two Rivers Lake was conducted on August 23-28, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations and similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample fourteen stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-four species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Two Rivers Lake is impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score that is near the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Sartell-Mississippi River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
