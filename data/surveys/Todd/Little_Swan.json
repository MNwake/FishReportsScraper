                "narrative": "<p>     A special assessment targeting panfish was conducted on Little Swan in late May.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of twelve lifts.  All fish were identified and measured so results could be used to produce an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score for the lake.  A standard population assessment using gillnets was conducted in early August.   <br> \n     The spring trap net assessment sampled thirty-four black crappie, while similar assessments in 2006 and 2000 produced lower catches, ten and six fish, respectively.  The 2012 assessment produced the most desirable population size structure.  The fish measured from 5.8 to 10.7 inches in length with a mean length of 8.9 inches and 59% (n=20) exceeding nine inches in length.  Twelve percent (n=4) of the crappie were more than ten inches in length.   Crappie in the 2006 sample ranged from 6.6 to 10 inches with a mean length of 7.8 inches, 30% (n=3) more than nine inches, and one (10%) ten-inch fish.   In 2000, the fish were between 7.8 and 10.2 inches with a mean length of 8.6 inches.  Two of the fish (33%) were more than nine inches with one (17%) that exceeded ten inches.   <br> \n     The lake management goal for Little Swan Lake is have 40% of the black crappie spring trap net exceed nine inches in length.  The 2012 trap net assessment was the only assessment to meet that goal. <br> \n     The 2012 summer gill nets sampled two black crappie; one 7.9 inches and one 12.2 inches in length.  The gill net catch of 0.3/lift was within the normal range for lake class 29 and consistent with previous gill net catches.  Spring time electrofishing may prove to be another method to evaluate the black crappie population in Little Swan Lake.  Eighteen crappie were netted while conducting largemouth bass electrofishing in late April.  The fish ranged from 7.5 to 10.6 inches in length with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 67% (n=12) of the catch with 11% (n=2) more than 10 inches in length. <br> \n     Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment and Ages 3 through 5 and 7 in the spring electrofishing.  Age groups 2 through 4 displayed fast growth and the older age groups normal growth in both samples when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.   Two year classes from 2008 and 2009 comprised the majority of the fish in both samples.   The 2008 year class (Age 4) made up 47% of the panfish assessment catch and 50% of the spring electrofishing catch.  The 2009 year class (Age 3) was 29% of the panfish assessment catch and 28% of the spring electrofishing catch.   <br> \n     Spring trap net assessments have been conducted three times since 2000 to evaluate the bluegill population in Little Swan Lake.  The 2012 assessment produced the lowest catch of the three assessments with only 294 bluegill caught.   A total of 628 fish were netted in 2006 and 1,099 in 2000. The 2000 bluegill catch displayed the most desirable population size structure of the three assessments, despite the having the largest sample size.  Fish in 2012 ranged from 2.8 to 8.7 inches in length.  The longest bluegill in 2006 was only 7.7 inches while in 2000 it was 8.8 inches.  Mean length for 2012 was 5.7 inches compared to 5.4 inches in 2006 and 6.2 inches in 2000.  Bluegill larger than seven inches comprised 23% (n=68) of the 2012 which was an improvement from the 9% (n=59) in 2006.  However, in 2000, 25% (n=275) of the bluegill were more than seven inches in length.  Also in 2000, 4% (n=42) of the fish exceeded eight inches in length compared to 2% (n=6) in 2012 and none in 2006. <br> \n     The bluegill lake management goal is to have at least 25% of the spring trap net catch exceed seven inches in length.  That goal was met in 2000 and the 2012 results were near the goal, while the catch in 2006 was far below the goal. <br> \n      Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment bluegill sample.   Age 3 fish displayed normal growth while the other age groups showed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Two year classes from 2007 and 2008 accounted for over half of the sample.  The 2007 year class (Age 5) comprised 29% of the sample and the 2008 year class (Age 4) 30%. <br> \n      The last standard summer trap netting was conducted mid-August of 2000.  A total of 506 bluegill were netted for a catch rate of 56.2/lift which was above the 75% quartile of 43.4/trap net for lake class 23.  The fish measured from 3 to 8.7 inches in length with a mean length of 5.1 inches.  Unlike the 2000 spring results the summer catch was dominated by smaller fish as only 3% (n=15) were more than seven inches in length and 0.8% (n=4) exceeded eight inches.   <br> \n      There was also a difference in species make-up between the 2012 spring trap net assessment and the 2012 summer gill net assessment.  The spring assessment had 14 fish species, three which were not found in the summer gill nets, bowfin, golden shiner, and yellow perch.  The summer gill nets sampled 13 fish species, two of which were not caught in the spring assessment, northern pike and tullibee.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Little Swan Lake is a small, 149 acre riverine lake on the west side of the town of Pillsbury.  The lake has a maximum depth of 67 feet with submergent vegetation growing out to a depth of 14.5 feet.  The most common species of submergent vegetation were claspingleaf pondweed, coontail, flatstem pondweed, and northern milfoil.  Water clarity was good for the end of July with a secchi disk reading of 9.1 feet.  Sand was the most common shoal water substrate around the lake.  There is a public access on the east side of the lake off of the county road.  Because of the close proximity of the road to the lake, there is limited parking area available for vehicles and trailers.  There is a public swimming beach on the southeast side of the lake which attracts many local residents.   Precipitation and runoff upstream in the Swan River watershed can have considerable influence on water quality in the lake.  Fish management focus is on northern pike and largemouth bass.\n   Two of the fish populations in Little Swan Lake displayed significant abundance changes since the 2000 survey, one of which was the northern pike while the other was white sucker.  Northern pike numbers showed a significant decrease in numbers in 2006 after posting a significant increase in 2000 from the 1994 survey.  Pike numbers now appear to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes, but are higher than the management goal for the lake.  A fair number of the pike were over 24 inches in length although the average size was 22 inches or about 2.6 pounds.  High pike numbers can negatively affect the entire fish community by decreasing prey species abundance such as yellow perch, white sucker, and tullibee.  Besides being an important food species to pike and walleye, yellow perch have also been found to  be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Yellow perch abundance in the lake appears low as they were only sampled in the spring bluegill assessment\n    Only one 21-inch walleye was caught in the summer survey indicating low abundance.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1989 after repeated stocking failed to produce good fishing.  The current population is likely maintained by natural reproduction in the lake and Swan River or migration from the river.  Past surveys have indicated that Little Swan Lake has a healthy largemouth bass population.   Few largemouth bass were seen in the summer survey which is not unusual.  Like most bass lakes, small to medium size fish are more plentiful with an occasional trophy size being caught by fishermen.  \n    Bluegills provide an important fishery on the lake so a spring assessment was conducted to evaluate the size structure of the adult population.  Even in the early June netting, the catch was dominated by smaller bluegills under 6 inches in length.  There were, however, a fair number of bluegills between 6 and 7 inches with some up to almost 8 inches measured.  The crappie catch in the spring assessment was not very impressive.  Only 10 crappies were caught with the average size being about 8 inches and the longest crappie measuring 10 inches.  Two other panfish species seen in the spring assessment were hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseeds.  \n    Little Swan Lake also supports a healthy tullibee or cisco population.  There was a range of sizes and year classes seen in the survey suggesting steady recruitment.   The tullibee can provide a good food source for the larger northern pike and walleye that are more likely to frequent the deeper water.  Some of the tullibee were found to be infested with triaenophorus or white grub that may make them unappealing to anglers.  White sucker, which showed a significant decrease in abundance from the last survey, are also another species in the lake that can be a prey species for the gamefish.  Both brown and yellow bullheads are present in the lake.  The yellow bullhead was the more abundant of the two species as the brown bullheads were only sampled in the spring assessment.  \n     Anglers are encouraged to keep northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike to reduce pike numbers and improve the population size structure.  Many of the northern pike in the lake were found to have neascus or black spot which may make they undesirable to anglers.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that usually resides in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Filleting the fish will usually remove most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans can not be infested.\n     Protecting and improving the water quality in Little Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners and landowners along the Swan River.  Good land use management practices such as buffer strips along the lake and river can reduce runoff and nutrients entering the lake.  Excess nutrients can lead to algae blooms and excessive vegetation growth.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie have good websites which provide information for shoreline property owners.\n\nMPCA - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\"\n    www.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html\n\nTodd County - \"Information for Shoreline Property Owners\"\n    www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake (DOW# 77-0034-00; Lake Class 23) is a 164 acre lake located near Pillsbury, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the east shore. Little Swan Lake has 2.36 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep, have a very low amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have hard water, and very clear. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Swan is a typical bass/panfish lake in the Little Falls area. Largemouth Bass are abundant with some quality fish up to 20 inches. Both Bluegill and Black Crappie are also abundant with plenty of eater sized fish for anglers. Northern Pike are highly abundant with mainly smaller fish (20-24 inches). However some larger fish were sampled up to 35 inches. Any Walleye caught by anglers should be considered a bonus fish, as Little Swan has a very low population of Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Greater Redhorse, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS), can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Little Swan Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake is a small, 149 acre riverine lake with a maximum depth of 67 feet.  Water clarity was good for the middle of August with a secchi disk reading of 8.5 feet.  Precipitation and runoff upstream in the Swan River watershed can have considerable influence on water quality in the lake.  Fish management goals for the lake focus on northern pike and largemouth bass.     Several of the fish populations in Little Swan Lake displayed significant abundance changes since the 1994 survey, one of which was the northern pike.  Although a larger portion of the population appears to under 24 inches in length than in 1994, good size pike can still be found with fish up to 34 inches documented.  The expanding pike population can have a negative impact on several of the other fish populations.  High pike numbers can decrease prey species abundance, such as yellow perch, which can lead to slow growth rates and an increase in small bluegills.  Perch have been shown to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.      Little Swan appears to support an excellent largemouth bass population.  The spring electrofishing catch rate was high compared to other area lakes with a variety of sizes available to anglers.  While the average size was about 11 inches, bass up to almost 19 inches were observed.     Walleyes are present in low numbers.  Annual stocking between 1979 and 1989 failed to produce good fishing and this management was discontinued.  The current population is probably from natural reproduction in the lake or the Swan River.       Bluegills continue to be abundant and the population dominated by small fish.  Average size for the bluegills is 5 inches, however, fish between 6 and 7 inches appear to be common.  A spring assessment targetting bluegills did document bluegills up to almost 9 inches in length with 25% of the fish exceeding 7 inches.  Another sunfish available to anglers is pumpkinseeds.  This sunfish species is also abundant and the population dominated by small fish.     Black crappies abundance appears to have increased since the last survey, but remains within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Average size seen in the survey was about 7 inches with some individuals measuring up to almost 11 inches in length.  The spring electrofishing suggested a strong 1997 year class which would be 8 to 9 inch fish.     Yellow perch continue to be scarce in the lake with few fish seen in the survey.  Perch can be an important prey species for many fish species in a lake.  Tullibee or cisco are present in Little Swan Lake in moderate numbers and appear to be the major food fish for the northern pike.  Tullibee prefer cool water and suspend in the deeper water of the lake in the summer as do the larger northern pike.  Another prey species available to northern pike and to anglers are white suckers.  Sucker numbers showed a real increase since the last survey and are high in abundance when compared to similar type lakes.     Other fish species observed in the survey included bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullheads.  Both bullhead species were relatively abundant and ranged in size up to 14 inches.     Anglers are encouraged to keep northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the bigger pike to reduce pike numbers and improve the population size structure.  High pike numbers can increase predation on other fish species leading to a decline in their abundance and a decline in northern pike growth rates.  Protecting and improving the water quality in Little Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners and people along the Swan River.  Good land use management practices such as buffer strips along the lake and river can reduce runoff and nutrients entering the lake.  Added nutrients can cause excess vegetation growth and algae blooms.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake is a fairly small (149 acres), moderately deep (67 feet),river fed lake which contains a variety of good fish habitats.  Water clarity canvary considerably depending on precipitation and runoff upstream in the Swan Riverwatershed.     Northern pike numbers have increased since 1988 and continue to be atdesirable levels.  Good numbers of northern pike larger than 24 inches are present. An angler reported catching several pike larger than five pounds and large pike arealso taken by spearers during winter.     Bluegills are present in high numbers, but they tend to be small.  Much of theangling pressure on Little Swan Lake is directed at panfish and northern pike. Crappies continue to be a small but periodically important part of the catch.  Inrecent years fishing has been spotty although good numbers of nice fish have beenreported in the past.     The largemouth bass population appears to be maintaining itself at moderatelevels.  Most angler catch of bass seems to be incidental to fishing for panfish. During 1994, reproductive success appeared to be good.  In the future moreinformation will be gathered on the bass population through electrofishing.     Walleyes are present in low numbers.  Annual stocking between 1979 and 1989failed to produce good fishing and this management was discontinued.  The currentpopulation is possibly a mix of previously stocked fish and migrants from the SwanRiver.     Yellow perch are present in low to moderate numbers.  Perch ranged in sizebetween 5.0 and 8.5 inches.  Another prey fish present is northern cisco(tullibee).  Tullibee continue to be the most important forage for large northernpike.  Tullibee prefer cool water which is present in the deeper water areas of thelake during the summer.     Yellow bullheads are relatively abundant and range in size from approximately6.5 to 13 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little Swan Lake is a small, 149 acre riverine lake on the west side of the town of Pillsbury.   Fishing structures include steep drop-offs, weedlines, shallow flats, a shallow bay, and a sunken bar.  Water clarity was good for early August with a secchi disk reading of 12.3 feet.   A public access is located on the east side of the lake off of a county road.  Because of the close proximity of the road to the lake, limited parking is available for vehicles and trailers.  On the southeast side of the lake there is a public swimming beach which attracts many local residents.     Fish management focus is on northern pike and largemouth bass.  A spring panfish trap net assessment was also conducted in 2012 to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations. <br> \n   Northern pike numbers appear to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   A fair number of pike caught in the summer survey were over 24 inches in length although the average size was 22 inches or about 2.5 pounds.   The pike caught showed good growth rates.   Little Swan Lake appears to have a healthy largemouth bass population.   Like most bass lakes, small to medium size fish are more plentiful with an occasional trophy size being caught by fishermen.  The walleye catch was up significantly from the last survey but still near the low end of the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   The current population is likely maintained by natural reproduction in the lake and Swan River.  Adult fish between 17 and 25 inches comprised the entire catch. <br> \n    The spring panfish trap net assessment catch was dominated by smaller bluegills under 6 inches in length.  There were, however, a fair number of bluegills between 6 and 7 inches with some up to almost 9 inches measured.  The crappie catch in the spring assessment was not very impressive.  Average size was about 9 inches in the assessment and the longest crappie was less than 11 inches.  One crappie exceeding 12 inches was caught in the summer survey indicating some large crappie available to anglers.   Three other panfish species seen in the spring assessment were hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  <br> \n        Little Swan Lake also supports a healthy tullibee or cisco population.  There was a range of sizes and year classes seen in the survey suggesting steady recruitment.   The tullibee can provide a good food source for the larger northern pike and walleye that are more likely to frequent the deeper water.  Some of the tullibee were found to be infested with triaenophorus, or white grub that may make them unappealing to anglers.  Yellow perch abundance in the lake appears low as they were only sampled in the spring panfish assessment.   The Swan River provides alternative prey species such as suckers, redhorse, and a variety of minnow species.  White sucker abundance showed an increase from the last survey which could benefit the northern pike and walleye populations.  Both brown and yellow bullhead are present in the lake.  Yellow bullhead was the more abundant of the two species with quality size individuals over 12 inches caught of both species.    Bowfin or dogfish were only caught in the spring panfish assessment and can provide quite a fight for an angler.  They are known to be efficient predators on small bluegills, helping maintain good growth in a bluegill population. <br> \n     Anglers are encouraged to keep northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike to reduce pike numbers and improve the population size structure.  Many of the walleye in the lake were found to have neascus or black spot which may decrease their desirability by anglers.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that usually resides in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Filleting the fish will usually remove most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. <br> \n     Protecting and improving the water quality in Little Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners and landowners along the Swan River and within its watershed.  Good land use management practices such as buffer strips along the lake and river can reduce runoff and nutrients entering the lake.  Precipitation and runoff upstream in the Swan River watershed could have considerable influence on water quality in the lake.  Excess nutrients can lead to algae blooms and excessive vegetation growth.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Panfish provide an important fishery on Little Swan Lake.  A special assessment using trapnets was conducted in early June targetting bluegills.  The panfish assessment was conducted in conjunction with a lake survey scheduled for late July which would use only gillnets to evaluate the gamefish populations.  Six trapnets were set and lifted over a three day period for a total of 12 net lifts.  All gamefish, black crappies, and a subsample of bluegills were measured from each net.  Other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from the bluegills and crappies for age and growth data analysis. <br> \n    A total of 628 bluegills (52.3/trapnet) were captured in the spring assessment which was less than the 1099 that were netted in 2000 (99.9/trapnet).  Fish in the 2006 netting measured from 3 - 7.7 inches in length with a modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches, mean length of 5.5 inches, and 11% (n=67) of the fish exceeding 7 inches while none of the fish were over 8 inches.  Despite the larger sample size in 2000, the sample displayed a better population size structure.   Fish in the 2000 catch ranged from 3 - 8.8 inches in length with a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches, mean length of 6.2 inches, and 25% (n=275) of the fish more than 7 inches in length.  Bluegills exceeding 8 inches accounted for 4% of the sample.  The management goal for the lake is to maintain a spring trapnet catch where at least 25% of the bluegills exceed 7 inches in length.  Ages 3 - 10 were represented in the 2006 panfish assessment with Ages 3 and 7 - 10 displaying normal growth while Ages 4 - 6 showed slow growth.   <br> \n    The panfish assessments have been ineffective at sampling the black crappies in the lake.  Only 10 crappies were caught in 2006 which was slightly better than the 6 caught in 2000.  The crappies in 2006 were between 6.6 - 10 inches in length with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches, mean length of 7.8 inches, and 30% (n=3) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  In 2000, the crappies measured from 7.8 - 10.2 inches in length with a modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches, mean length of 8.6 inches, and 33% (n=2) of the fish more than 9 inches.  Spring night electrofishing in 2000 for largemouth bass has proven to be an effective method for sampling crappies.  A total of 43 black crappies were netted for a catch rate of 31.6/hour.  The fish ranged from 6.1 - 11.9 inches in length with a modal length of 8.5 - 9 inches, mean length of 9.1 inches, and 44% (n=19) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  While the two spring trapnets assessment fell below the management goal of at least 40% of the spring crappies caught exceeding 9 inches, the electrofishing effort surpassed that goal.  Ages 3 - 5 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with the 2003 year class accounting for 70% of the catch.  Ages 3 and 5 showed normal growth while Age 4 fish displayed fast growth. <br> \n     The 2006 spring assessment also captured 2 largemouth bass between 10 and 15 inches, 6 northern pike between 12.6 and 19 inches, and one 13-inch walleye.  Yellow bullheads were the second most abundant species in the trapnets with 138 being caught.  Other fish species that were identified included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow perch.   <br> \n     The prespawn spring assessment has proven to be an effective method for sampling bluegills in Little Swan Lake, however, it has not worked well for crappies.  Either a different time frame or another method such as electrofishing will have to be tried to sample that species. <br> \n     An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Swan Lake (DOW# 77-0034-00; Lake Class 23) is a 164 acre lake located near Pillsbury, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the east Shore. Little Swan Lake has 2.36 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet. Little Swan Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep, have a very low amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have hard water, and are very clear. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 an ice-out survey targeted at mature Northern Pike was completed. Previous ice-out surveys have not been completed so comparisons cannot be made, but size structure of the population was poor with fish only up to 33 inches captured.  The results of this survey were unexpected as previous summer surveys documented the presence of excellent size structure on Little Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Little Swan Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
