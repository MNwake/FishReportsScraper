The littoral area comprises 86% of the total lake area; frequent, partial winterkills result because of this large littoral area.  Shoal water soils are 90% muck and 10% sand.  Secchi reading was 4 feet.  Total alkalinity was 42.5 p.p.m.  Several emergent and sumberged aquatic plants were found, and the density ratings range from sparse to moderate.Test netting indicated a good fish population of northern pike and brown bullhead.  Spawning habitat was good for northern pike and was poor for centrarchids.  Black grub (Neascus spp.) was the only parasite found; northern pike and yellow perch, only species infected, had a high infection of Neascus spp.</p>",
