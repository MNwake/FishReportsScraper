                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY: <br> \nNet catch data was compared to other lake class 42 lakes around the state.  Important gamefish species captured in gillnets and trapnets included northern pike, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch, and walleye.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 1.7/net was within the normal range for lake class 42 lakes.  Northern pike sampled ranged in length from 16 to 29 inches.   Fish from age 1 through age 4 were represented in the sample.  Nearly 50% of the fish sampled were age 3 and fish from this age class ranged from 22 to 27 inches long.  Northern pike numbers in the trapnets (1.2/net) were above the lake class median of 0.76/net.  White crappie catches in the gillnets and trapnets (10.8 and 6.7/net, respectively) were within the normal range for the lake class.  Over 90% of the white crappie sampled were age 1 and 2 fish.  Growth appeared good, with the age 2 fish ranging in length from 6 to 10 inches.  Black crappie abundance was low.  The gillnet catch of 0.8/net was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Most of the black crappie sampled were age 1 and 2 fish.  Growth of these fish was not as good as that of the white crappie.  Age 2 black crappie ranged in length from 5 to 8.4 inches.  Black crappie adults were stocked in Otter-Campbell Lake in 1991 and 1992.  Yellow perch abundance was low.  Only 10 perch were sampled in gillnets, for a catch rate of 1.1/gillnet, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Yellow perch sampled were not aged.  A walleye gillnet catch of 5.4/net was slightly above the lake class median of 4.3/net.  The trap net catch of 1.2/net was very near the lake class median level also.  Walleye from age 1 to 5 were represented in the sampled.  Almost one-half of the walleye sampled were age 2 and were 10 to 15 inches long.  These fish may have been the result of a fry stocking in 1990.  Walleye fry were also stocked in 1988, but no age 4 walleye were sampled.  Age 1 and 3 walleye comprised most of the remaining fish sampled.  These age classes cannot be accounted for by stocking records and may be the result of natural reproduction.  If reproduction is occurring, it is likely that it takes place upstream in the South Fork of the Crow River.  Black bullhead numbers were near the median level in the gillnet catch and within the lake class normal range for the trapnets.  Most of the black bullhead were small, with 80% being less than 7 inches long.  Carp were very abundant.  Catch rates for both net types were above the normal range for the lake class, and a wide range of carp sizes were sampled.</p>",

Catch and growth rates are average for this area.  Northern pike are considerably above average in numbers and have average growth rates.  About 74% of the northern pike captured were II or III year old fish.  Bluegills were slightly below local values in abundance, with growth rates about average.  The south basin of Otter Lake was most suitable for bluegills.  Catch rates for this section of the lake, if considered separately, exceeded local values with 23.67 bluegills captured per trapnet set.  White crappie abundance was 180% of local values; all fish were age IV or less.  White Crappie abundance was significantly higher in the norther most basin of Otter than the south most basin of Otter or Campbell basin.  Gill net values are 17.33 per lift in the northern Otter basin compared to 6.67 in the southern basin and 8.67 in the Campbell basin.  Yellow perch catch rates were slightly above local values with a median length of 7.7\".  Black crappie, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead were sampled in significant numbers.  Roughfish population of white suckers, carp and black bullheads were all at least 2 times local averages.  One smallmouth buffalo was captured. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Otter/Campbell Reservoir in 2012 to monitor the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the system.  A total of 15 species were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.   The old dam, at the outlet, was replaced with a rock step type structure around 2009.  This new structure may be responsible for the increases in relative abundance of channel catfish, northern pike, and walleye.  In 2012, shorthead redhorse were sampled for the first time at Otter/Campbell Reservoir.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Otter/Campbell lakeshed (285,237 acres) was highly disturbed and dominated (83%) by row crop agriculture.  The shoreline was heavily developed, with residential homes (189) making up the largest type of shoreline use (72%) in 2012.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 445:1.  Aquatic vegetation was rated as rare.  Only 2 varieties of submergent vegetation, Curlyleaf pondweed and sago pondweed, were sampled in 2012.  The reservoir continued to be plagued by intense algal blooms and poor water quality.  The secchi disk reading was only 1.4 feet on 6/25/12.  The only shoalwater substrate that was classified as abundant was silt.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (53) of northern pike for a catch rate of 5.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the second highest catch rate ever recorded at the reservoir.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were variable, ranging from 0.8 to 9.1/net with an average of 3.8 and median (middle most data point) of 1.7.  Historically speaking, recruitment could be classified as low.  Gill netted northern pike were 14.2 to 31.8 inches long with an average of 21.9.  Approximately 26% fo the gill net catch was 24 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.   Northern pike were last stocked in 1992.  Northern pike were age-1 through age-7 with 7 year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were the strongest year-classes, accounting for 26% and 35% of the gill net catch, respectively.  Growth was somewhat slow.  A summerkill of northern pike occurred in July 2012, when the water temperature climbed into the upper 80 degrees F range.         <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (35) of black crappie for a catch rate of 3.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was (8.7/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 ranged from 0.7 to 14.0/net with an average of 6.1.  Trap netted black crappie were 4.3 to 8.8 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (88) of black crappie for a catch rate of 9.8/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2005 gill net catch rate was 1.7/net.  Historic catch rates were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 9.8/net with an average of 2.8.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.4 to 11.2 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Black crappie were age-1 to age-5 with 5 year-classes present.  Age-2 fish made up 54% of the gill net catch and 91% of the trap net catch.  Growth was moderate.  Black crappie were last stocked in 1992. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (7) of white crappie for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 ranged from 0.0 to 14.0/net with an averae of 3.9.  Trap netted white crappie were 7.9 to 13.0 inches long with an average of 10.5.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (18) of white crappie for a catch rate of 2.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates ranged from 0.0 to 10.9/net with an average of 4.9.  Gill netted fish were 4.9 to 13.5 inches long with an average of 8.1.  White crappie were age-1 to age-4 with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  An easy way to tell the difference between white crappie and black crappie is to count the number of dorsal spines.  White crappie have 5 or 6 spines while black crappie have 7 or 8 spines.  <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (129) of walleye for a catch rate of 14.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever recorded.  The 2005 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 14.3/net with an average of 6.0.  Gill netted walleye were 7.5 to 22.6 inches long with an average of 16.1.  Approximatley 87% of the gill net sample was 13 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-1 to age-6 with 6 year-classes present.  The 2009 and 2010 year-classes were both ranked as strong, accounting for 56% and 24% of the catch, respectively.  Walleye were last stocked in 1990.  In 2012, growth was fast.  Anecdotal reports indicated that there was a significant amount of fishing pressure during the summer, fall, and winter of 2012, on the reservoir, with fair to good success for walleye.  <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (67) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 7.4/net.  The 2012 catch rate was over 24 times greater than the previous high catch rate (0.3/net in 2005).  Historic catch rates ranged from 0.0 to 7.4/net with an average of 1.6.  In 2012, channel catfish were 6.7 to 27.2 inches long with an averge of 14.3.  Channel catfish were age-1 to age-10 with 8 year-classes present.  The 2010 year-class accounted for 50% of the gill netted fish that were aged.  Standard shoreline seining sampled 6 young-of-the-year channel catfish, which likely indicated that fish were spawning successfully within the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (6) of bluegill for a catch rate of 0.7/net which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was also low (3.2/net).  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 9.7/net, with an average of 2.3.  In 2012, trap netted bluegill were 6.1 to 7.6 inches long with an average of 6.6.  Bluegill were age-3 to age-5 with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate to fast.  Young-of-the-year bluegill (2,327) were the most abundantly sampled fish from the shoreline seining portion of the assessment.  Winterkill and a lack of submergent vegetation were likely major limiting factors on this species.  <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (6) of largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted largemouth bass were 6.9 to 14.2 inches long.  Trap nets sampled 2 largemouth bass, up to 15.2 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were age-1 to age-4 with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Winterkill and a lack of submergent vegetation were likely major limiting factors on this species.    <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (12) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 4.9/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly low, ranging from 0.8 to 18.7/net with an average of 5.4.  Yellow perch were 5.5 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 8.1. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (36) of carp for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly high, ranging from 0.5 to 47.3/net with an average of 16.7.  Trap netted carp were 14.3 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 20.1.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers (67) of carp for a catch rate of 7.4/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  Historic catch rates were all high, ranging from 7.2 to 34.9/net with an average of 13.6.  Gill netted carp were 8.3 to 27.4 inches long with an average of 18.7.  High numbers of carp, over the last 35+ years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Otter/Campbell Reservoir.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (603) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 67.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was the second highest on record, going back to the 1975 assessment.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly moderate to high, ranging from 28.7 to 96.3/net with an average of 55.1.  Gill netted black bullhead were 4.7 to 18.3 inches long with an average of7.5.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (59) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 6.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The majority of the fish were too small to appeal to bullhead anglers.  In recent years, many area lakes have experienced a decline in black bullhead abundance, but not the reservoir.   <br> \n    <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nOtter/Campbell has a long history of winterkill and the reservoir was opened to liberalized fishing as recently as 2009.  Winter dissolved oxygen concentrations were very low in all three sections of the reservoir during the 2012-2013 winter.  Dead fish were reported just above the dam in early March, 2013.  Fish populations can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the frequency and severity of winterkill. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Otter (including Campbell Lake to the north) is a moderate sized (642 acres) reservoir located in the City of Hutchinson in McLeod County. Otter has approximately 14 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 9 feet, but much of the shallow reservoir is closer to 5 feet in depth. There are two City Parks (Masonic West River and Roberts) that both have cement boat ramps with ample parking. A fishing pier is available in the eastern arm of the reservoir and numerous shore fishing opportunities are available to anglers. The reservoir's fish populations occasionally suffer from winterkill. Abundances of those species that are more intolerant of low oxygen levels such as Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Channel Catfish, can vary greatly from year to year depending on the severity of the latest winterkill event. A partial winterkill occurred in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used to assess the reservoir's Walleye population in 2022. Electrofishing catches indicated that fair to moderate numbers of Walleye were present this year. Walleye were 7 to 22 inches long, averaging 14 inches. High numbers of young of the year Walleye were sampled in October. Winter anglers are reminded to be extra careful while ice angling on Otter, as flowing water from the South Fork of the Crow River can lead to thin ice conditions in various parts of the shallow basin. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

The lake has a history of winterkill and catches can vary greatly from year-to-year depending on the severity of the last event.  The current fishery looks fairly good.  No fish have been stocked since 1992.Moderate numbers of walleye were gill netted, ranging in size from 6.8-19.1 inches and averaging 11.5 inches.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted, averaging 21.4 inches.  Quality sized northern pike (up to 33.7 inches) were trap netted.  Fair numbers of yellow perch were gill netted, ranging in size from 5.2-10.7 inches and averaging 8.2 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were trap netted, ranging in size from 3.7-10.6 inches and averaging 7.9 inches.  Low numbers of white crappie were trap netted averaging 9.2 inches.  Low numbers of bluegill were trap netted, and most were small.  Bluegill were 2.8-8.1 inches long averaging 4.1 inches.  Only 5% of the sample was 7 inches or longer.  High numbers of carp were gill netted, averaging 17.9 inches.  Black bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in both gill and trap nets, averaging 8.7 inches.</p>",
