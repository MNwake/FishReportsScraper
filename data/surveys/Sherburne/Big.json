                "narrative": "<p>Big and Mitchell Lakes are located within city of Big Lake in Sherburne County.  The two lakes are connected by a narrow channel on the north side of Big Lake.  Water quality is quite good, and the lakes are very popular for recreational use during the open water season.  More than three hundred boats were counted at docks along shore in 2004, and during summer weekends the two lakes are often very busy. A survey was conducted in the summer of 2004 to assess fish populations and included spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Big and Mitchell Lakes.  Results were also compared to past surveys of the two lakes to look for possible changes in the fish community. Shoreline seining was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction of prominent game fish. Watershed mapping and aquatic plant surveys were also part of the evaluation.In 2004, catch rates for northern pike more than doubled from 1994 for Big and Mitchell Lakes, and were higher than the range that is typical for lakes like these.  Catch rates were also more than twice the current management target.  Northern pike up to 31 inches were sampled during the summer netting, but most of the fish were 17-26 inches.  Average weight was 2.1 pounds. Walleye populations have been created on Big and Mitchell Lakes by occasional stocking of fingerlings, since natural reproduction does not appear to occur.  Big and Mitchell Lakes were stocked with walleye most recently in 1994 and 1997.  The summer catch rate of walleye in 2004 was low, but within the normal range for lakes like Big and Mitchell.  All of the walleyes sampled were found to be from years that stocking occurred.  The largest age class present was from the 1994 stocking, and averaged 22.8 inches.  A few individuals were determined to be from the 1990 stocking, and one individual was estimated to be from the 1986 stocking (18 years old).  Growth rates were found to be slow, and varied greatly among individuals.  This is probably due to the low density of suitable forage available; very few yellow perch, small white suckers or other appropriate-sized prey were sampled during the survey. Big and Mitchell Lakes are well suited for largemouth bass because of good water clarity and diverse aquatic vegetation.  The bass population appeared very high in 2004, based on night electrofishing.  Ninety-five bass per hour were sampled in Big Lake, while 153 bass per hour were sampled in Mitchell Lake.  The median catch rate for largemouth bass in area lakes is 52/hr.  The population was dominated by mid-sized fish (8-12 inches), while bass over 16 inches were rare. The catch rates of black crappies were low for both Big and Mitchell Lakes.  The average size of black crappie was also low when compared to other lakes similar to Big and Mitchell.  The bluegill catch on Big and Mitchell increased from 1994, and was within expected levels for lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size, however, was low, and growth rates were slow.  Other sunfish species (pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish) were also sampled in 2004. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 21, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and deep water along with large-sized, rip-rap prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Mimic Shiner) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Big Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Saint Cloud Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 251-acre lake located in Sherburne County within the city limits of Big Lake. It is connected to Mitchell Lake via a navigable channel. Big Lake has a maximum depth of 48 feet and a small watershed. A city owned public access is located at the southwest corner of the lake near Highway 10. A standard survey was completed in 1983 to update fisheries data last collected in 1973.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance remains low compared to the local median. The population did not show the dramatic increase in abundance seen in Mitchell Lake, although the growth rates and age class structures were very similar. \n\nWalleye abundance had increased to 6.8/gill net with the 1979 fingerling and the 1978 fry stockings representing 80% of the fish sampled. Walleye abundance in Big Lake was about one half that of Mitchell Lake. \n\nLargemouth Bass abundance was most likely high based on gill net catch and spring electrofishing, although growth rates were slow. Largemouth Bass ages two - five were strongly present in the summer sample. \n\nBluegill abundance had the same general decline as seen in Mitchell Lake to average, although abundance in the gill net catch remained high. The dominant Bluegill age class was age three. Growth was generally slow until about age six. \n\nThe Black Crappie catch in 1983 decreased from 1973. Ages one - three were sampled and age three was the most abundant. Growth was average.\n\nYellow Perch abundance in 1983 decreased some from 1973, but remained average. Shoreline seining showed young of year Yellow Perch present as well as other forage species. \n\nOther species sampled included: Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1994 survey of Big Lake revealed the following information about the lake.     The gill net catch rate of northern pike significantly increased from the 1989 assessment but remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Big Lake.  Northern pike caught ranged in size from 12.9-24.5 inches and averaged 17.9 inches in length.  The average weight of northern pike (1.2 pounds) appeared to be small but this may have been caused by a large influx of two and three year old pike.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other lakes in the state.     The catch rate of walleye in gill nets decreased from the 1989 assessment and fell below expected levels for this lake type.  Natural reproduction appears to be limited and the drop in catch may be attributed to low survival or high angler harvest of the 1990 and 1992 stocking of walleye fingerlings.  Walleye caught ranged in size from 11.9-29.2 inches, with the largest fish caught weighing 8.81 pounds.  The growth rate of walleye was fast up to age 3 and average for ages 4-10.      The catch rate of yellow perch in gill nets dropped from the 1989 assessment and fell below expected levels for this lake class.  A possible explanation of this decline may be the increase in two and three year old northern pike.  Yellow perch caught ranged in size from 6.4-8.7 inches and averaged 7.2 inches in length.     The catch rate of bluegill in trap nets did not appear to change from the 1989 assessment and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  Three to five year old fish dominated the catch (88% of the total catch) and bluegill caught averaged 6.4 inches in length.  The growth rate of bluegill was slow up to age 3 and average for ages 4-7.     The trap net catch rate of black crappie did not change from the 1989 assessment and remained low for lakes similar to Big Lake.  The growth rate of black crappie was fast when compared to other populations in the state.     Largemouth bass populations on Big Lake and nearby Mitchell Lake were assessed by spring electrofishing.  A total of 30 bass were caught a rate of 13.3 fish per hour sampling, which was slightly below the median for this lake type (16.0 per hour sampling).  Largemouth bass sampled ranged in length from 5.3-15.5 inches and averaged 9.5 inches in length.  The growth rate of largemouth bass was average when compared with other bass populations in the state.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake is a 251 acre lake located in Sherburne County within the city limits of Big Lake. It is connected to Mitchell Lake via a navigable channel. Big Lake has a maximum depth of 48 feet and a small watershed primarily composed of development, open water, and row crops. A city owned public access is located at the southwest corner of the lake near Highway 10. Big Lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2004. Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nNo emergent or floating leaf vegetation was found in the current survey. Submerged vegetation is widespread and was surveyed in 2009; chara was the dominant species, followed by curly leaf pondweed, coontail, bushy pondweed, and northern water milfoil. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 12.5 feet in late July and MPCA data show a summer average of 10 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 21 feet in late July. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were above the expected range of values for lakes similar to Big Lake, but lower than 2004. Most pike were small; only 11% were 24 inches or longer, compared to 17% in 2004. Lengths ranged from 12.1 to 26.7 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 19. The catch rate of 50/hr. was near the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43/hour. Lengths ranged from 4.7 to 18.3 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 16% were 15 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked intermittently through 1997, but were not stocked between 1997 and 2014. Since 2014, fingerling or larger Walleye have been stocked annually by either the DNR or the lake association. The Walleye catch in 2017 was within the expected range of values for similar lakes and higher than 2004. Lengths ranged from 6.4 to 21.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.7 pounds. Walleye ages ranged from two to four years old and growth was fast, reaching 15 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was lower than 2004, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches. Targeted sampling using trap nets was conducted in late May to better assess Bluegill numbers and size. The Bluegill catch rate was higher than the standard survey and the average size was longer (5.9 inches), but the percentage of fish eight inches or longer was the same (1% in both surveys). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low overall and similar to 2004 results. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.3 to 11.8 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. Black Crappie were measured during the targeted Bluegill survey and crappie size was larger than the standard survey. Average length was 9.2 inches and 22% were ten inches or longer, compared to 10% in the standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were very low in 2017 and have been low since 1989. Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 10 inches with a mean length of 7.1 inches. Other species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. Surprisingly, Black Bullheads were caught in average numbers in 2004, but none were found in 2017. However, Yellow Bullhead numbers increased substantially. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Big Lake from May 25 30, 2017. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 272 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 2.2 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD 8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. Big Lake PSD was 50 and RSD 8 was 1. So 50% of Bluegill were six inches or longer and 1% were eight inches or longer. These results seem average for overall size, but poor for larger Bluegill. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range from 26 to 95 and an RSD 8 range from 0 to 54. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish were also caught; a total of 15 Pumpkinseed and 79 Hybrid Sunfish were captured. Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 4.9 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches. Hybrid Sunfish lengths ranged from 3.8 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches. A total of 120 Black Crappie were also caught; lengths ranged from 5.2 to 11.7 inches with an average length of 9.2 inches. Black Crappie likely finished spawning earlier and were not targeted in the current survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was also conducted on Mitchell Lake. The results were similar to Big Lake and can be found in a separate report. <br> \n</p>",
