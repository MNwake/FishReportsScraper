                "narrative": "<p>Coffee Lake is a 126 acre, soft-water lake. Its maximum depth is 11.0 feet and the median depth is 6.0 feet. The outlet of the lake flows to Perent Lake, and eventually to Hudson Bay by way of the Kawishiwi River system.      Water appear to fluctuate less than one foot in a year, with long-term fluctuationns less than three feet.     The lake is accessible to public use through a Federal Forest Service road to the lake. The lake lies within 1/2 mile of the roadless and airspace reservation boundary of the \"Wilderness Area\" of the Superior National Forest.     Shoal water soils are mostly sand with boulders, and limited areas with mixtures of sand, gravel, rubble, and boulders. Most of the lake lacks vegetation, but several species of aquatic plants are present in depths to four feet.      Gillnet catches of Walleye were greater than the state-wide median, and slightly less than the Kawishiwi watershed median. Northern Pike were taken in numbers less than the watershed median and equal to the state-wide median. Other species of fish taken in gillnetting and trapnetting were Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. Most of the Walleye caught were below 16\" in length, while Northern Pike ranged between 8.5\" and 30\" in length.</p>",

The lake is fairly remote and is accessible via a rough logging road.  There is a carry-down access for small boats or canoes.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers and averaged about 1.4 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled in the survey was 4.0 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers but were too small to interest anglers.  Fish up to 9.4 inches were collected but most were less than 8.0 inches.</p>",

A very rough access road from Lake County Rd. 7 goes 1.5 miles to the south end of the lake, high clearance four-wheel-drive vehicle recommended for this brushy logging road (USFS Rd 1244).  Most anglers using small boats and canoes access the outlet and carry across the boulder field to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Coffee Lake is comprised of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, white sucker and minnow species.  The walleye numbers in the 2007 assessment were slightly below average for this type of lake, but higher than in the two previous assessments.  The average weight was 1.4 pounds, which was above the lake class average but within the range of past assessments on Coffee Lake.  Approximately 47% of the walleye sampled in the 2007 assessment were over 15 inches.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1998 and natural reproduction is maintaining the present population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were near average for the lake class in 2007 and similar to pike numbers in previous samples on Coffee Lake.  The average weight of northern pike sampled in 2007 was 2.0 pounds, a typical size seen in previous assessments.  Forty-five percent of the northern pike sampled were over 22 inches, with only one fish over 28 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers fluctuate widely in Coffee Lake.  The 2007 sample was below the historic average, but near the average for this lake type.  The average length of yellow perch in 2007 was 7.2 inches, with a few fish over 8 inches in the sample.  <br> \n</p>",

Test nets in 1995 indicate Coffee Lake has an average abundance of walleye compared to other lakes in its class. Walleye sampled ranged in size from 7.7 inches to 26.8 inches (7.0 pounds). Anglers can expect to see a large part of the walleye they catch to be one pound or less. In the survey approximately 70% of the walleye sampled were under 14 inches.     Northern pike are common in Coffee Lake and average approximately 2 pounds each. Those sampled ranged from 10 inches to 29.5 inches. Coffee Lake in the past has produced northern pike up to 15 pounds.     Coffee Lake is appropriately named as this best describes the color of its water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coffee Lake is a 130 acre lake located 16.5 miles north of Isabella, Minnesota in the Superior National Forest.  The shoreline around the lake is under state and federal ownership and consists primarily of mixed deciduous forest with small areas of bog.  The maximum depth is 11 feet with brown bog-stained water.  Boulder and sand are the main substrate types in the lake.  The aquatic plant community in the lake is fairly diverse with 18 species present.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the main game fish found in Coffee Lake.  Yellow Perch, White Sucker, Rock Bass, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish also reside in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake access road (USFS Rd. 1244) is located off of Lake County Rd. 7 about 1.0 mile north of the Windy Lake access.  The access road leads to the outlet of the lake after 1.7 miles of travel through very rough and brushy terrain.  A high clearance four-wheel drive vehicle or ATV is recommended for traveling the road.  The access is on the southwest end of the lake and depending on the lake water levels, small boats and canoes may need to be carried across the boulder field at the outlet to the lake.  Fishing pressure on Coffee Lake is presumed to be light as it is a lake off of normal travel routes. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Coffee Lake is maintained by natural reproduction.  The 2015 Walleye gill net catch was slightly below average for similar northeastern Minnesota lakes, but consistent with the long term average for Coffee Lake.  The average length was 14.1 inches and weight was 1.0 pound; the largest Walleye was 19.1 inches long and weighed 2.2 pounds.  Natural reproduction appears to be consistent with a few strong year classes.  The 2015 survey saw seven year classes present with two years classes (2012 and 2011) making up 60% of the catch.  Growth is average in Coffee Lake when compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was near the historical average for Coffee Lake, yet slightly below average when compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  Average length of Northern Pike was 20.5 inches.  Larger Northern Pike are present in the lake and three fish were measured over 32 inches in length, all three weighed over 8 pounds.  The largest pike was 37.6 inches long and weighed 12.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers in 2015 were near average for similar lakes in the area.  However, the majority of perch tend to be smaller with the average length of 6.2 inches and weight of 0.1 pounds.  The largest perch observed was 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gillnet catch was average for the lake class.  Size of White Sucker was near the average at 2.0 pounds and 15.7 inches.  Twenty-three Rock Bass and single Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also sampled during the 2015 survey. <br> \n <br> \nCoffee Lake offers a destination for anglers desiring to venture to a remote lake with a chance of catching large Northern Pike and decent sized Walleye.  The water in Coffee Lake is very dark and there are many boulders in the lake, many of which are not easily seen.  Boaters should take care when using a motor on the lake to avoid hitting a boulder.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coffee Lake is located about 16 miles northeast of Isabella within the Superior National Forest. It covers an area of 130 acres with a maximum depth of about 11 feet and has dark brown colored water. Public access is off Lake County 7 via US Forest Service 1244 (Coffee Lake access road) which is approximately 1.7 miles long through rough and brushy terrain most suitable for a small four-wheel drive vehicle or ATV. The lake is best suited to canoes or light boats on a rack or on trailers that can be disconnected and turned around near the lake as there is little room to maneuver. The access is located in a shallow bay and there are several rocky areas that can be a hazard to boat motors so anglers should use caution while navigating around the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species and their population has been maintained through natural reproduction since stocking ceased after 1998. The catch rate of 5.0 Walleye per gill net was within the normal range for the type of lake and similar to previous surveys of Coffee Lake. Although no exceptionally large fish were sampled, a wide range of sizes were caught and the average size was good at 16.5 inches long and 1.7 pounds. Age analysis determined ten unique year classes were sampled which indicates natural reproduction has been successful at producing a Walleye fishery with diverse size and age structure. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the secondary management species and the 2022 catch rate of 2.83 per gill net was similar to previous surveys and within the normal range for the lake. Size was also similar to historic survey data with a majority of pike less than 24 inches long and an occasional larger fish. While not a destination for Northern Pike fishing there is a chance to catch a quality sized fish for anglers that make their way to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were also sampled in 2022, but their populations are not likely to be of interest to anglers due to low abundance or poor size structure. </p>",
