Few Largemouth Bass were sampled in test nets and none over 3\" were taken.

Shamrock Lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet, and has relatively good water clarity as indicated by a secchi disk reading of 8 feet.     Fish collected in the DNR test nets during the 1999 lake survey were largemouth bass, bluegill and a few white sucker.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  This species can be difficult to capture in nets therefore netting results are not always reflective of their abundance.  The fish ranged from 4.8 inches to 14.5 inches (1.5 pounds), however only 23% of the largemouth bass collected were larger than 7.0 inches.     Bluegill were also sampled in average numbers, but are below average in size.  They averaged 5.0 inches and ranged from 3.1 inches to 7.4 inches.  Approximately 25% of the bluegill sampled were between 6.5 inches and 7.4 inches which is a marginal size for most anglers to keep.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2013 special assessment on Shamrock Lake was an effort to locate a source lake for bluegill in the Finland Area with fish numbers adequate to be captured and restocked to establish populations in other area lakes.  The process of transferring bluegill between lakes involves certifying the source population as viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) free.  Sixty bluegills (Age1+) were needed from Shamrock Lake to satisfy the testing requirements for the VHS disease test, the 2013 collection fell short of that goal.  No VHS disease has been found in the inland waters of Minnesota or Lake Superior; however, other Great Lakes and tributaries connected to Lake Superior have had VHS infested sites. <br> \n <br> \nOf the 89 bluegill caught in trap nets, the majority were less than 3 inches and the largest was only 5.2 inches.  Previous investigations have sampled bluegills up to 9.5 inches; however, the number of large bluegill present in Shamrock Lake has been low.  It was apparent from ageing bluegills in previous investigations that the reproduction in Shamrock Lake is generally sporadic with strong year-classes of bluegill infrequent.  Poor reproduction/survival is a problem in most lakes having bluegill populations in the Finland management area.  The bluegill are a pure strain in Shamrock Lake making these fish desirable for establishing new panfish management lakes , there are no pumpkinseed sunfish or hybrid sunfish present.  Unfortunately, the unstable bluegill population in Shamrock Lake and difficult access makes collecting and transporting large numbers of bluegill for introduction in new waters unworkable. <br> \n <br> \nAlso captured in 2013 were largemouth bass and white suckers.  The largemouth bass ranged from 1.6 inches to 4.5 inches with many young-of-the-year counted in the sample, a total of 78 largemouth bass were captured.  Although trap nets do a poor job of sampling largemouth bass populations, previous investigations have sampled fish over 14 inches.  The fifteen white suckers sampled ranged from 12.8 inches to 20.3 inches.  The composition of the fish community in Shamrock Lake has not changed since the initial investigation in 1961, when bluegill, largemouth bass and white sucker were the species sampled.  Near-shore sampling with small mesh trap nets in various investigations has also documented the presence of brook stickleback and Iowa darter in Shamrock Lake.  There was one attempt to introduce smallmouth bass, with 500 fingerlings stocked in 1947; no smallmouth bass have been sampled in any investigation. <br> \n</p>",

The Largemouth Bass population is high by area standards and appears to be reproducing well.It appears that much of the productivity of this lake is tied up in the sucker population. A sucker removal program will be started, possibly in the spring of 1980. This hopefully will benefit the Bluegills and in turn the Largemouth Bass. White Suckers caught during sucker removal will be chopped up and returned to the lake as fertilizer. The lake has potential as a trout lake but will not be considered at the present time.</p>",

The maximum depth is 13 feet and the water is clear with a Secchi disc visible at all depths. The lake is accessible from a 600-foot trail off Forest Service Rd. # 1657. The lake is surrounded by public land and the shoreline is undeveloped and in a wild state.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Shamrock Lake is comprised of largemouth bass, bluegills, white suckers and Iowa darters. Largemouth bass were collected in average numbers in 2006 compared to similar lakes in this class. The fish ranged from 5 inches to 14.3 inches, and averaged approximately 0.7 pounds. Approximately half of the fish collected were smaller than 9 inches, and the remaining half were between 11.5 and 14.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in average numbers in 2006.  Approximately 13% of the bluegills in this assessment were larger than 7 inches, with fish up to 9.5 inches collected (fish that large are uncommon in this lake). Shamrock Lake typically maintains average bluegill numbers, but the size is generally small, with the number of fish larger than 8 inches usually low.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shamrock Lake is located 12 miles west and seven miles north of Isabella in the Superior National Forest near the Tomahawk Road (USFS 377).  The public access is carry-in and located off the Kelly Loop (USFS 386) 600 feet down a small road (fire #1657) in the southwest corner of the lake.  The lake is 55 acres with a maximum depth of 15 feet with good water clarity (10 feet) and light brown bog stained water.  Sand, gravel, muck, and decaying organic matter are the most common bottom substrates with rare occurrences of rubble and boulders.  There are 30 species of aquatic vegetation.  One inlet and one outlet are present.  The lake is very scenic with no cabins or other development, and it is thought to have light fishing pressure.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey in 2015 was the first time a spring netting assessment was performed targeting Largemouth Bass and Bluegill with trap nets.  Catch for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass in past assessments have fluctuated widely, which is not uncommon in this area due to very sporadic reproduction.   In 2015 the catch was very low with only two bass and 30 Bluegill captured.  Of the 30 Bluegill captured, 29 were under an inch long and one bluegill was 3.6 inches long that was aged as 2 years old. Each Largemouth Bass captured were about 10 inches in length.  White Suckers were also sampled in average numbers and size.  Brook Stickleback and Iowa Darters were sampled in fine mesh trap nets.  <br> \n</p>",
