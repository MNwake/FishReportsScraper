Growth of northerns was good through their 3rd year, then slowed until almost 20 percent behind the state average by year VII.  Largemouth bass numbers were average in gill and trap nets, growth was average to all annuli.  Yearling bass were observed in high numbers; young-of-year bass were sampled in late-summer shoreline seining.  The yellow perch catch consisted one fish taken in a gill net; low abundance of this prey species could be the cause of slow northern pike growth.  The white sucker catch was average as in the last survey; sizes were also similar.  The bluegill catch was average; size of these fish was considered typical for the area.  The proportion of quality-sized (> 6 inch T.L.) bluegills sampled in all gears was .53.  Bullheads were sparse in the catch; also, few carp were taken.  White crappies were sampled in gillnets only; they were low in abundance and small in size.  Black crappies were sampled in numbers lower than local and statewide medians and were small in size.  Winter anglers report taking some larger black crappie than were sampled in this survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is located in Shoreview and is categorized in lake class 24.  Surface acreage is 409 acres with 245 acres being littoral (60%) and a maximum depth of 28 feet. Most of the shoreline is developed as single-family homes.  Ramsey County Parks operates a popular park facility in the southeast corner of the lake.  Facilities include a picnic area, boat ramp and swimming beach.  Water quality of Turtle Lake is relatively good with a secchi disc of 10 feet in 2019 and 6 feet in 2017. An experimental regulation requiring the immediate release of Largemouth Bass went into effect in 1997 to increase the catch of Largemouth Bass and to maintain quality sized fish. This regulation is being changed, effective beginning in the 2020 season, to a protected slot of 14-20 inch (with one over 20 inches allowed for harvest). This regulation will allow harvest of smaller bass and is expected to shift the size bass in the lake to a larger average size. The effectiveness of the protected slot will be evaluated in 2035. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleyes have been the primary management species in the lake. Currently, 245 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually. Walleyes were sampled in above average abundance with a size structure that is representative for lakes similar to Turtle. Bluegill were sampled in low abundance and only 5 percent captured were 7 inches or longer.  The largest Bluegill captured was 8.5 inches. Black Crappies were also captured in low abundance and averaged 8.0 inches in length.  Northern Pike were caught at a high abundance in the gill nets at 10.8 fish per gill net set. Northern Pike captured averaged 18 inches in length and generally have a poor size structure when compared to lakes like Turtle. Yellow Bullheads were caught at a median level in gill nets and averaged 11 inches however some quality 14 inch Yellow Bullhead are present in Turtle Lake at this time. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Turtle Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 14, 2020. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish. Three of these species are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one species is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Bluegill dominated the trap net catch numbers, but only comprised approximately 26% of total trap net biomass. Of the Bluegills sampled, 16% were between 5 and 7 inches, 30% were over 7 inches and 6% were over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe targeted survey of the nearshore fish community data were combined with the concurrently sampled summer trap net survey and gill net data from a July 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Turtle Lake from this survey is just below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Turtle Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by FIBI scores. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also available. Black crappies were sampled in lower numbers than average for Turtle Lake. More than 60% of the black crappies sampled were larger than 8 inches and more than 23% were larger than 10 inches. Northern pike were found in high abundance. Walleye were also sampled in high abundance. The average size caught was 15.6 inches. Other species sampled include carp, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), white sucker, and yellow perch.        </p>",

Surface acreage is 409 acres with 245 acres being littoral (60%) and the lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A special regulation that requires the release of all Largemouth Bass is in effect for this lake. Walleyes (WAE) have been the primary management species in the lake. Currently 2,000 fry/littoral-acre are stocked biennially in even years (approximately 490,000 fish). Walleyes were sampled in low abundance and approximately 40 percent captured were 20 inches or longer. Bluegills were also caught in low abundance and only 10 percent captured were 7 inches or longer.  The largest Bluegill captured was 8.58 inches. Black Crappies captured averaged 5.8 inches in length.  Northern Pike were caught at a high abundance in the gill nets at 12.1 fish per gill net set. Northern Pike captured averaged 18.19 inches in length and 1.32 pounds. Yellow Bullheads were caught at a median level in gill nets and averaged 12.2 inches and 0.85 pounds.</p>",

A special regulation that requires the release of all Largemouth Bass is in effect for this lake. The East Metro Fisheries office is discussing a change to this regulation, moving to a protected slot limit for Largemouth Bass to allow some harvest to occur from this abundant fish population. This electrofishing survey provides additional data on the size structure of Largemouth Bass in Turtle Lake. In addition to the Largemouth Bass, two Smallmouth Bass were sampled and are likely from an illegal stocking by an angler desiring this species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass electrofishing catch was 71 fish per hour, this is slightly higher than the catch rates from 2013 and 2007 which were 51 and 54 respectively. One major difference in these three surveys is that the 2018 electrofishing was conducted at night while 2013 and 2007 were both daytime electrofishing which could result in a lower catch rate. The 2018 catch rate is typical for metro area bass lakes, though the size structure is compressed with 94% of the fish sampled under 14 inches long. Sampled fish ranged from 3.9 inches up to 19.5 inches long with a mean length of 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

This is intended to increase the number of large bass.  Largemouth bass catch during spring electrofishimg was the highest recorded.  Most bass, however, are small with an average size of 10.7 inches.  Thirty percent of the catch was over 12 inches long, but only 2% was over 16 inches long.  Bluegill are abundant, but small (average size = 4.5 inches).  Black crappies and white crappies are less abundant than bluegill, with white crappies being larger than black crappies (average size of 9 inches vs. 7 inches).  Northern pike abundance is moderate with an average size of 25 inches, but some 30 inch-plus fish are present.  Yellow perch and walleye are also present, but in very low numbers. </p>",

Surface acreage is 409 acres with 245 acres being littoral (60%) and a maximum depth of 28 feet. A special regulation that requires the release of all Largemouth Bass is in effect for this lake. The East Metro Fisheries office is discussing a change to this regulation, moving to a protected slot limit for Largemouth Bass to allow some harvest to occur from this abundant fish population.\n\nWalleyes are the primary management species in the lake. The 2017 netting survey targeted Walleye and only gill nets were used. Walleyes were sampled in the normal range for this lake class at a rate of 3.38 fish per gill net. Sampled Walleye averaged 17.7 inches and 2 pounds. Currently 1.0 pounds per littoral-acre (245 pounds) of fingerlings are stocked annually. Northern Pike were sampled in high numbers again at 9.38 fish per gill net set. Northern Pike captured ranged in size from 12 inches up to 36 inches in length. Yellow Bullheads were caught at a median level in gill nets and averaged 12.2 inches.\n\n\nTable 1.

The average size caught during the survey was only 5.1 inches in length, although bluegills up to 8.2 inches were sampled. Black crappies were sampled at an average rate when compared to similar lakes, but are side, averaging approximately 6.0 inches. However, individuals up to 11.0 inches were also caught. White crappies are present in low numbers. Northern pike were caught in average abundance. They average 22.38 inches in length. Over 15% of the pike sampled exceeded 25 inches. Largemouth bass were sampled at their highest rate in this survey. Bass up to 17.8 inches were caught. Other species such as pumpkinseed, green and hybrid sunfish are present in low to moderate abundance. The Mn DNR began stocking walleye in 2002. Walleye are present in the lake, but in low numbers. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake (lake class 24) located in Shoreview has a surface acreage of 409 acres with 245 acres being littoral (60%) and a maximum depth of 28 feet. Most of the shoreline is developed as single-family homes.  Ramsey County Parks operates a popular park facility in the southeast corner of the lake.  Facilities include a picnic area, boat ramp and swimming beach.  Water quality of Turtle Lake is relatively good with a secchi disc of 10 feet in 2019 and 6 feet in 2017. Beginning in 2020, a Largemouth Bass protected slot of 14-20 inch (with one over 20 inches allowed for harvest) has been implemented. The purpose of this regulation is to allow harvest of smaller bass with the expectation to shift the size structure of Largemouth Bass in the lake to a larger average size. The effectiveness of the protected slot will be evaluated in 2035. Also, Northern Pike anglers are to be aware of the zone management regulations for Northern Pike that went into effect in 2018. Turtle Lake is in the North-Central Zone and which allows a harvest of 10 fish with 2 allowed over 26 inches and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleyes are the primary management species in the lake. Currently, 245 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually. Walleyes were sampled in above average abundance with a size structure that is slightly above average for lakes similar to Turtle. Bluegill were sampled in moderate to low abundance. Black Crappies were also captured in moderate abundance and averaged 7.5 inches in length.  Northern Pike were caught in good numbers with 7.7 per gill net set. Northern Pike averaged 20 inches in length and generally have a poor size structure when compared to other lakes like Turtle. Yellow Bullheads were caught at a median level in gill nets and averaged 12 inches with some quality 14 inch Yellow Bullhead present in Turtle Lake at this time. <br> \n</p>",
