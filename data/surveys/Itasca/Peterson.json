                "narrative": "<p>Peterson Lake is a 130 acre lake three miles NW of Talmoon, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 55 ft and a secchi depth of 13 ft at the time of the survey.  A public access is located on the west shoreline.  Largemouth bass, panfish and northern pike dominated the fish community.  The lake experienced a partial winterkill in 1996. A survey after the winter kill sampled northern pike, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  To supplement the fishery, adult black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass were stocked in 1996.  This is the first population assessment conducted after the partial winter kill of 1996.Spring electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth and smallmouth bass population.  Largemouth bass catch rate was 6.6/hour and smallmouth bass catch rate was 2.5/hour. The catch rates are generally lower than similar lakes in the Grand Rapids management area. Largemouth bass length varied from 7 to 17 inches and smallmouth bass length varied from 14 to 18 inches.  Largemouth bass of several different ages were sampled indicating successful natural reproduction following the re-introduction in 1996.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for ages one to six, and was slower than the statewide averages for ages six and seven.  Smallmouth bass were not stocked after the winter kill and are likely the result of an unauthorized  private stocking.  Only age six and seven year old fish were sampled indicating that they have not spawned successfully.  Peterson Lake is not suitable for smallmouth bass and may eventually be eliminated from the fishery due to lack of suitable spawning habitat.Northern pike gill net catch was 14.0/set which is much higher than similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 24 inches.  Growth was slightly slower than statewide averages with fish reaching 22 inches after six years.Yellow perch gill net catch was 8.0/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish over nine inches.  Although walleye had never been sampled previously in Peterson Lake, a single walleye was sampled in the gill nets.  The walleye like the smallmouth bass may have been the result of an unauthorized private stocking.  The habitat in Peterson Lake is generally not suitable for walleye, and it is likely that walleye will not persist in the fish community.Black crappie gill net catch was 2.0/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  The trap net catch was 0.2/set which is lower than the expected range.  Size structure in the gill nets was poor with no fish greater than nine inches.  Black crappie sampled were ages 2, 3, and 5, indicating that at least two successful year class have developed since the winter kill.Bluegill trap net catch was 6.7/set which is lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with very few fish greater than eight inches.  The fish community is likely still rebounding from the winter kill in 1996.  Yellow perch and black crappie abundance is still below historical abundance.  Northern pike abundance is higher than historical abundance.  Other species sampled include brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through fishing, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent lawn wastes and sediment from entering the lake.  In addition, lawn fertilizer should be avoided. However, if fertilizers are used, lakeshore owners should consider a brand containing no phosphorous.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peterson Lake is 130 acres with a large proportion less than 15 feet deep (94 acres). The lake has a history of partial winterkills. Lakeshore residents suspected a partial winterkill in 2018/2019 but the extent was not determined. Shoreline residents again reported possible winterkill in 2019/2020 as dead fish were observed in the spring. Winterkill conditions were observed on other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTest netting was conducted mid-August to help sample or observe young of the year fish to determine if production occurred in the spring. Three standard gill nets, two standard trap nets and two small mesh trap nets were set at likely locations and not comparable to past effort. Gill nets sampled Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch at rates of 0.3, 5.6 and 17.3 per net, respectively. Pike and perch were caught in a wide range of lengths indicating multiple ages were present in the sample. Angling opportunities for pike and perch will be favorable in the very near future as pike over 30 inches and perch over 8 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nStandard trap nets caught Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch while small mesh trap nets caught Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brown Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Northern Pike, Tadpole Madtom and Yellow Perch. A high proportion of Black Crappie caught in trap nets were less than three inches and were from spring 2020 production. Angling opportunities for crappie will likely be decent in a few years. <br> \n <br> \nPeterson Lake and the fish community appear to be fairly resilient to winterkill. There appears to be enough habitat available to protect enough fish to repopulate the lake at this time. Connectivity to Little Peterson or South Ackerman may also help to repopulate the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peterson Lake is a class 32 lake located about four miles northwest of Talmoon, Minnesota.   The lake has a public access on the west side and it is lightly developed.  The lake has extensive shallow, vegetated habitat with one deeper hole.  There is an abundance of spawning and nursery habitat for bass, panfish, and Northern Pike.  Consequently, these attributes tend to result in poor growth and occasional, partial winterkills.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2004 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Black Crappie and Bluegill as the primary species of management with Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike as secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Black Crappie trap-net or gill-net catch above 4.0/net, Bluegill trap-net catch near 14.0/net, Northern Pike gill-net catch near 9.0/net, and electrofishing catch for Largemouth Bass above 20/hr.  A standard survey was conducted in June of 2015 to assess the status of the fish community.  A total of 4 gill nets and 9 trap nets were used in the survey as well as spring night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have been very high in the past but have been more normal in recent surveys.  The gill-net catch was 5.0 fish/net and exceeded the LMP goal in 2015.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 inches and averged 7.1 inches.  Seven age-classes were estimated from scales with fish from age 2 to age 9 sampled.  Age-8 fish represented 41% of the sample.  Growth was poor compared to other class 32 lakes.  Black Crappie average 6.4 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches have been quite variable since 1971.  In 2015, the trap-net catch was 17.9 fish/net.  The catch was within the normal range and met the LMP goal.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.4 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  Eleven age-classes were estimated from scales with fish from age 2 to age 12 sampled.  Growth was poor compared to the lake class average.  Fish averaged 4.8 inches after five years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing for the second time in 2015.  The catch was 30.1/hr on-time in 2015 compared to 6.6/hr in 2000.  Our LMP goal to sample  20/hr was achieved in 2015.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.6 to 19.1 inches and averaged 15.2 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified from scales with fish from age 3 to 11 present.  There was no dominant year-class.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Fish averaged 14.3 inches after five years of growth.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 7.8 to 17.8 fish/net since 1971.  The catch of 7.8 fish/net in 2015 was the lowest on record but met the LMP goal.  The lower catches corresponded to improved size structure.  The sampled fish ranged from 16.5 to 31.7 inches and averaged 22.8 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified by scales and cliethra with fish from age 2 to age 10 present.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 19.6 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have ranged from 3.5 to 45.3 fish/gill net since 1971.  The 2015 catch was lowest on record at 3.5 fish/gill net.  The sampled Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 7.6 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  Due to the Yellow Perch size structure, they are probably more important within the fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers.  Age and growth information was not collected in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",
