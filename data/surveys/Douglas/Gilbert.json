                "narrative": "<p>A winterkill during the winter of 1988-89 resulted in significantly mortality of most gamefish species in the lake. Only three species of fish were captured during the netting assessment. These species included northern pike, carp, and black bullheads. All carp captured were young-of-year, while 15 of the 23 northerns netted were young-of the-year. Growth of northern pike was excellent. Age 3 northern pike averaged 23.3 inches and age 4 northern pike were approximately 29 inches in total length. Age 0 northern pike were already 7.5 to 10.9 inches long (late July). Northern pike were not captured during the 1983 survey. They may have entered the lake from Elizabeth Lake during the high water in the fall of 1986. In May of 1986, bluegills, largemouth bass and walleye were stocked in Gilbert Lake after a winterkill during the previous winter. Electrofishing efforts in April 1987, indicated walleye fry stocking and largemouth bass brood stocking had been successful in establishing a 1986 year class. The age 1 walleye were approximately 7.5 inches in length and the age 1 bass ranged from 4.0 to 7.4 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Lake is a small, shallow basin located approximately nine miles west of Alexandria.  Water clarity is extremely poor during summer months.  Seechi disk transparency is usually 2 feet or less.  Dense blooms of blue-green algae are present during summer months and impair most recreational pursuits on the lake.  Agricultural practices within the watershed and cattle along the shoreline likely contribute to the excessive nutrients in the lake.  The shallow and fertile nature of Gilbert Lake make it prone to periodic winterkill.  The last significant winterkill occurred during the severe winter of 1996-97.  Fish populations in Gilbert Lake are strongly influenced by the frequency and severity of winterkills, as well as the success of re-stocking following the winterkill.Walleye have become relatively abundant in Gilbert Lake.  Gill net catches averaged 12.0 fish/net in 2002.  Walleye fry were introduced in the spring of 1997, following the last winterkill.  Fry were also stocked in 1999 and 2001.  The age class distribution of fish captured strongly reflects the stocking chronology.  Most of the fish captured were between 14 and 21 inches in length.  Mean weight was 1.7 pounds.  Bluegill have also become established since the last winterkill.  Fish are moderately abundant and the size structure of the population is highly desirable.  More than half of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater and about 20% exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill had not been present in previous surveys since 1983.  The source of these fish is unknown.  Adult largemouth bass and black crappie have been stocked in recent years to enhance the fishing opportunities in Gilbert Lake.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Lake is a small, shallow basin located approximately 9 miles west of Alexandria. Water quality is poor due to nutrient enrichment. Water clarity is typically less than 2 feet during summer months due to frequent and occasionally severe algae blooms.  Recreational uses are at least seasonally impaired.  The shallow and fertile nature of Gilbert Lake makes the fish community vulnerable to periodic winterkill. The last significant winterkill occurred during the winter of 1996-1997. Fish community composition, gamefish diversity, and fishing potential are constrained by poor habitat conditions, severity of winterkills, and gamefish species restocked following winterkill. Northern pike, walleye, black crappie and largemouth bass were stocked after the winterkill of 1996-1997.  <br> \n     <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked in odd number years.  Catches were surprisingly good during the 2007 survey in probable response to an extended period of mild winters.  Age distribution of captures was well correlated with year of stocking.  Some natural reproduction was noted in 2002.  Walleye grow very fast in Gilbert Lake, attaining over 18.0 inches in length in four years.  In response, the average size and weight of walleye captured in gillnets was 21.8 inches and 4.3 pounds.  Such statistics suggest fishing pressure and harvest were very light.  This fishery was likely a well-kept secret. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie proved to be abundant, but the catch was largely comprised of young fish stemming from strong natural reproduction in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Size distribution reflected the high proportion of young fish in the population.  Average size caught in trapnets was 7.4 inches.  No 10.0-inch and larger crappie were captured. <br> \n <br> \nPoor water clarity and limited vegetated habitat constitute limiting habitat conditions for gamefishes such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  No northern pike were captured during the 2007 survey.  Survival of young bluegill appeared to be low in response to lack of nursery and escape cover.  Eight age groups were represented in the survey catch, but only 19 bluegill were caught.  Survivors grow fairly fast, thus average size of bluegill captured is above average.   The average weight of bluegill was 0.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass fare a little better than northern pike as a predator due to greater tolerance of high water temperatures.  Feeding efficiency lost to poor water clarity is partially offset by the limited escape cover for prey.  A low to moderately abundant population was detected by 2007 electrofishing assessment.  Similar to other sunfish populations, limited abundance translates to above average growth from lack of competition.   Average length and weight of bass caught was 13.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The largest bass measured in the total electrofishing catch was 18.4 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nGilbert Lake has a great carrying capacity for fish life due to the basin's high fertility.  Unfortunately, because of stressful habitat conditions, tolerant and opportunistic fishes such as black bullhead, common carp, and white sucker comprised the greatest proportion of the carrying capacity.  Ninety-five percent of total poundage of fish captured in gillnets was attributable to black bullheads and carp.  <br> \n <br> \nManagement Update:  Early and extended ice and snow cover in 2007 resulted in near dissolved oxygen depletion by mid-February of 2008.  Gilbert Lake was opened to liberalized fishing opportunities in February to salvage surviving gamefishes.  It is probable that most gamefishes were lost to severe winterkill. <br> \n</p>",

Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were likely.  Trap netting results and abundance of dead fish along the shoreline suggested that winterkill was severe and restorative stockings were warranted.  The only gamefishes captured were four Northern Pike and one Yellow Perch.  Restorative stockings of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch were completed during spring 2019.  In absence of future winterkill events, fishable populations for these species likely won't become established until 2021 or later.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Gilbert Lake is limited by occasional winterkill, the last event occurring duringthe winter of 1988-89.  Northern pike, common carp, and black bullhead were the only species collectedduring the last population assessment in 1989.  One northern pike was captured during the 1996 survey.  This fish was 36.6 inches in total length andweighed 12.7 pounds.  Ice-out trapnetting in 1992 only captured two northern pike.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 11.5 fish/net in 1989, and 65% of those fish were young-of-the-year.  Apparently this yearclass suffered significant mortality.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded three largemouth bass in 1.2hours of effort.  Two of the fish were between 5.0 and 6.0 inches in total length and the other fishwas 16.5 inches.  A largemouth bass measuring 15.2 inches in total length was captured in a trapnet. Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked in 1994 by a local sportsmen's group, however the smaller fishare likely only age-1 (1995 year class).  Shoreline seining captured 13 YOY largemouth bass in 1996,which also suggests limited natural reproduction is occurring.  The larger fish may have eithersurvived the last winterkill, migrated in the lake from connected lakes during high water conditionsin 1993, or are the result of an unauthorized stocking.  Yellow perch are abundant.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 75.3 fish/net in 1996.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.0 - 22.3fish/gillnet.  Yellow perch were not captured in previous surveys, however approximately 1350 yearlingswere stocked in January of 1992.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 0.2 pounds.  Common carp arelikely abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 8.8 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of mean catchrates for similar lakes (0.8 -4.3 fish/gillnet).  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.2 pounds.  Blackbullhead catches averaged 8.3 fish/gillnet and 9.0 fish/trapnet.  Catches averaged 8.5 fish/gillnet and1.0 fish/trapnet in 1989.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds in gillnets and 0.1 pounds intrapnets. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilbert Lake is a small (202 acres), shallow basin located approximately nine miles west of Alexandria.  A small public access with limited parking is located on the northwest shoreline.  Water quality and clarity have been poor due to nutrient enrichment and frequent and occasionally severe algae blooms.  The shallow and fertile nature of this basin make the fish community vulnerable to periodic winterkill.  The last significant winterkill event occurred during the 2013-2014 winter.  Fish community composition, gamefish diversity, and fishing potential have been constrained by poor habitat conditions, severity of winterkills, and gamefish species restocked following winterkill events.  Walleye fry and pre-spawn adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were stocked after the winterkill of 2013-2014. <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in July 2016 to assess fish community structure and determine success of post-winterkill stockings.  Survey methodology also included spring electrofishing to estimate abundance and size distribution of the Largemouth Bass population.  This sampling event occurred on May 24.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe recent winterkill and prompt re-establishment of predator populations resulted in much improved habitat conditions.  Water transparency was 6.5 feet at time of the mid-July survey.  In probable response to increased water clarity and sunlight penetration, submerged vegetation was found throughout the basin. <br> \n <br> \nRe-introductory stockings of adult Largemouth bass and Black Crappies were successful and recruitment of young fish was exceptional.  Both Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass proved to be abundant; however, fishing potential remained marginal since most captures were two-year-old fish, the offspring of limited numbers of adults stocked following the winterkill event.  Black Crappie captures averaged approximately 7.4 inches.  Average length of bass captured during the electrofishing survey was 9.3 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was documented, but catches were well below that of other gamefishes.  Most of those captures were also two-year-old fish.  A Walleye fry stocking in 2014 was also successful in re-establishing a Walleye population.   Twenty-five two-year-old Walleyes were captured in gill net sets.  Those young walleyes were growing fast, averaging 12.9 inches at capture.  Restorative stockings in 2014 also included 455 juvenile Yellow Perch.  A promising fishery may develop as this population matures.   Yellow Perch catches were comprised of three age classes, age-1 through age-3, which indicated that a reproducing population was established.  Gill net catches were high at 54.3 fish/net.  Perch are also growing rapidly in a post-winterkill environment.  The older, age-3 captures averaged 10.3 inches.  This population is likely to attract the attention of anglers once cohorts of the strong 2014 year class recruit into the fishery. <br> \n   <br> \nSustained development of this promising fishery will continue to hinge on frequency and severity of winterkill events.  Occasional winterkills and prompt re-introduction of predators may be beneficial in limited expansion of Black Bullhead and Common Carp populations.  Survey catches of both fishes was greatly reduced in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe next standard survey is tentatively planned for summer 2026.  Targeted assessments may occur upon suspicion or documentation of winterkill events to assess severity of such fish mortality events.         <br> \n</p>",
