The walleye population was entirely natural, since this lake has not been stocked since 1990.  The northern pike catch in 2006 was low; however, northern pike catches have varied widely in this lake, and a low catch in any given year has not been unusual.  Most of the northern pike collected in 2006 were two-year-old fish less than 18 inches in length.  Yellow perch were abundant, and many were large enough to provide some good angling opportunities.  Lake whitefish were also abundant and large.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tom Lake is located approximately 17 miles northeast of the City of Grand Marais. There is a DNR-owned public access located on the northwest side of the lake off Brumbaugh Road with parking for six vehicles.  Tom Lake is an ecological class 6 lake, which is characterized by very irregular shorelines, moderate littoral coverage, and very soft (unmineralized) tannin-stained water. Walleye are the primary management species for Tom Lake, and were introduced into the lake in 1935 and stocked with some regularity until 1990. The 2016 survey was the second of two scheduled in the 2007 lake management plan to monitor the status of the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Tom Lake in 2016, and were present in a wide range of sizes including a few larger fish. The Walleye gill net catch was similar to past catches in this lake, and was comparable to median gill net catches for other Class 6 lakes in northeast Minnesota.  The mean weight for Walleye sampled in gill nets fell within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to past results from Tom Lake as well. Past trap net catches of Walleye in Tom Lake have been high compared to other lakes in this class. The 2016 Walleye trap net catch was also well above average for the lake class, and comprised a majority of the total Walleye catch in this survey. A large proportion of the Walleye sampled in trap nets were small resulting in a low mean weight. Fourteen year classes of Walleye, all naturally produced, contributed to the total catch. Fish of one to four years of age dominated the 2016 sample, with strong year classes apparently produced in 2012 and 2013. Growth rates of Walleye sampled in 2016 had been about average; four-year-old fish reached a mean length of 12.3 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 12.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey was the first since 1982 where no Northern Pike were sampled. Survey results since 1990 had shown a declining trend in net catches of Northern Pike in Tom Lake, with the previous survey (2013) sampling just a single fish.  Reasons for this decline haven't been documented, but it may be related to a loss of spawning habitat or competition with Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish and Burbot represent the coldwater fish community in Tom Lake.  The 2016 gill net catch and mean weight of sampled Lake Whitefish both fell within the normal range for Class 6 lakes that support this species.  No aging structures were collected from Lake Whitefish during this survey; however, the length frequency distribution suggested that at least three year classes contributed to the catch. Similar to past surveys, Burbot were sampled in low numbers in 2016 with a few larger fish included in the sample.   <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch and White Sucker are the primary forage species in Tom Lake. Catches of Yellow Perch in gill nets and trap nets in 2016 were the highest recorded to date for Tom Lake, and were well above average for Class 6 lakes. The lengths of Yellow Perch were well distributed, including a sizable proportion of fish 8 inches or longer. The catch of White Sucker in gill nets fell into normal range for the lake class, but was above average for trap nets. Both gear types sampled White Sucker small enough to serve as forage for large predators. Creek Chub, which were sampled in multiple trap nets, may also contribute to the prey base. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing a waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota aquatic invasive species laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tom Lake is a 404 acre lake located approximately 7 miles northwest of Hovland. Public access is through a boat landing on the northwest side of the lake. Tom Lake part of the Lake Superior North watershed and is the headwater lake of the Swamp River. Tom Lake is primarily managed for walleye. The 2023 standard lake survey was conducted to monitor the fish community, record current limnological conditions, and evaluate walleye management goals currently in place for Tom Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was in the normal range for Tom Lake and met the current management goal. Catch rates are comparable to similar area lakes. Walleye ranged from 8.5 to 26.9 inches with a mean length of 14.3 inches. Aging results indicated the presence of 8 naturally reproduced year classes with the oldest individual appearing to be 23 years old. Back calculated growth rates indicated slower growth than similar area lakes with age 5 fish averaging 14.6 inches compared to an area average of 16.0 inches. Tom Lake continues to maintain a decent walleye fishery with some large fish present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates are extremely low and had been declining since 1990. Only a single fish was found in the 2013, 2016, and 2023 surveys combined. Northern pike populations may not recover if they continue to be this low.  <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish and burbot represent the coldwater fish community in Tom Lake. Lake whitefish abundance was similar to recent surveys and fell within the normal range for similar Minnesota lakes (Class 6). Like past surveys, burbot were sampled in low numbers but were large in size. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates were the highest recorded for Tom Lake and had been increasing since 2013. Catch rates were much higher than similar Minnesota lakes (Class 6). Yellow perch ranged from 5.7 to 10.5 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches. Yellow perch not only provide excellent forage opportunity for walleye in Tom Lake but may also provide an angling opportunity for large yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance was higher than previous surveys and had been increasing since 2013 but remain in the normal range when compared to similar Minnesota Lakes (Class 6).  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

The catch included several naturally produced year classes, all produced since stocking ended after 1990.  Walleye growth had been about average for Grand Marais lakes of this class.The catch of northern pike was low for lakes of this class, but was not low for Tom Lake historically.  Northern pike were up to 21 inches long, but no older than age 3, so growth had been faster than average.Yellow perch abundance was not high, but was normal for Tom Lake and for lakes of this class.  The largest perch was 10 inches long, and several others exceeded 8 inches.The catch of lake whitefish was in the mid-range of catches from lakes of this class, and was typical of recent catches in Tom Lake.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 23 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the first of two assessments scheduled in the 2007 lake management plan to monitor walleye and northern pike populations in this lake.  A second assessment is scheduled for 2016. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Tom Lake in 2013, and were present in a wide rage of sizes, including some larger fish.  The walleye gill net catch was similar to walleye catches seen in Tom Lake since 1982.   The mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets fell within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to means seen in this lake in the past.  Although the walleye gill net catch could not be considered high, it was accompanied by a high catch in trap nets; it is possible that during the assessment period walleye were more active in near-shore areas, and less vulnerable to off-shore sampling gear.  The trap net catch included several larger fish.  Twelve year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the total walleye catch, including a fairly strong year class produced in 2010.  Walleye growth had been good; fiish reached a mean length of 13.4 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to a mean of 12.6 inches for similar lakes in the Grand Marais area. <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike were taken in gill nets in 2013, and just one was collected in trap nets.  The low catch came at the end of a long decline that seemed to have begun after 1987, when the catch peaked at just over two fish per net.  Catches of zero northern pike have been seen in this lake in the past (1982), and the species has been able to recover.  Reasons for the current decline in northern pike catch are unknown. <br> \n <br> \nForage for walleye and northern pike was provided primarily by yellow perch, since most of the white sucker present would have been too large to have been taken by any but the largest predators in the lake.  The 2013 yellow perch gill net catch fell within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to most catches seen in this lake in the past.  Few of the yellow perch present in 2013 would have been large enough to have been of much interest to anglers.  Trend data suggest that yellow perch abundance may have increased in this lake at the same time that northern pike catches declined. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake whitefish gill net catch was the highest seen to date in this lake, and was well above the normal range for the lake class.  Some very large fish were present, and from their size distribution it appeared that at least three fairly strong year classes had contributed to the 2013 catch.  Lake whitefish abundance may also have responded to the drop in northern pike numbers since 1987. <br> \n <br> \nNo bass or panfish have ever been collected in Tom Lake, and none were found in 2013.  Walleye may be the only non-native fish species present in this lake.  Prior to netting, a DNR Fisheries crew checked the lake for spiny waterflea using plankton nets, and found none.  Anglers should still be careful to follow all invasives species control measures when moving gear into or out of this lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
