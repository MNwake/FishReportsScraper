IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SAY THE GOOD NUMBERS OF 20-24.9 INCH FISH DENOTE THE 80 STOCKING (AGE VI). PERCH ARE PRESENT IN NUMBERS WELL ABOVE THE REGIONAL QUARTILES (118/GILLNET). THIS REPRESENTS A STATISTICALLY HIGHER CATCH THAN IN 1981 (50/GILLNET). LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS (4.5- 9.4) AND MEAN LENGTH (7.0) ARE VERY SIMILAR TO 1981. TWICE AS MANY PERCH WERE UNDER 6.4 AS COMPARED TO 1986. NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS SHOWED EXCELLENT REPRODUCTION. BOWFIN, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, AND PUMPKINSEED CATCHES INDICATED ABOVE AVG POPULATIONS. YELLOW ARE THE PREDOMINATE BULLHEADS IN 1981, 88% WERE 12 INCHES OR LARGER. 1986 NETTING INDICATED THIS FIGURE HAD DROPPED TO 5%. DURING THE INTERVAL BETWEEN SURVEYS OVER 5000 PDS WERE REMOVED BY SUCKER AND BLACK BULLHEAD EXHIBITED  BELOW AVG POPULATIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF BLUEGILLS CAP- TURED IN 1981 FELL BETWEEN 3.0-5.4 INCHES WITH A FEW BETWEEN 7.5-8.4 AND 1 AT 10.0-10.4. 1986 PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PICTURE. ALMOST 70% OF THE BLUEGILL LENGTH FREQUENCIES WERE BETWEEN 6.0-7.9 WITH A TOTAL RANGE OF 4.0-8.4 INCHES. CRAPPIES NUMBERS ARE DOWN THOUGH STILL WITHIN REGION QUARTILES. LENGTH FREQUENCIES REMAIN FAIRLY SIMILAR</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Panfish provide an important fishery on Maple Lake.  A panfish assessment targeting black crappie and bluegill was conducted in mid-June to gather information on the size structure of the populations.  Trapnets had not been set in Maple Lake in the last two test nettings which were Research directed gillnet surveys for walleye in 2008 and 2006.  The lake surveys for Maple Lake are usually conducted in mid-June and have produced panfish results comparable to the panfish assessments.  Six lake survey trapnets were set in the 2009 panfish assessment and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts.  Crappie, bluegill, and gamefish were all measured and scales collected from the crappie and bluegill for age data.  All other fish species were identified and counted. <br> \n       The 2009 spring assessment captured a total of 213 black crappie ( 17.8/trapnet), that measured from 5.8 to 12.2 inches in length.  Mean length was 8 inches with a modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches.  The population appears to be dominated by small fish as 8% (n=16) of the crappie were over 9 inches in length with 3% (n=6) exceeding 10 inches.  A similar panfish assessment in 2003 netted 145 crappie (12.1/trapnet).  The fish ranged from 4.6 to 11.1 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  The size structure of that catch was more desirable than the one displayed in the 2009 assessment.  Modal length for the sample was 8.5 - 9 inches with 34% (n=50) of the crappie exceeding 9 inches and 18% (n=27) more than 10 inches.   Ages 3 thru 8 and 10 were represented in the 2009 aged sample.  Age groups 3 thru 8 displayed normal growth while age 10 fish showed slow growth.  The majority of the crappie appeared to come from the 2005 year class.   Year class strengths suggest steady recruitment with an occasional stronger year class.   <br> \n       An ice-out assessment for northern pike conducted in early April of 2004 captured 45 black crappie.   Smaller fish also dominated that catch.  Fish measured from 3.2 to 11.2 inches length with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Modal length was 4.5 - 5 inches with 18% (n=8) of the crappie more than 9 inches and 4% (n=6) exceeded 10 inches in length.   <br> \n       Bluegill was the most abundant species in the 2009 panfish assessment with 314 fish sampled (26.2/trapnet).  Fish ranged from 4.6 to 9.4 inches in length with a mean length of 7 inches.   The population size structure displayed some desirable characteristics.  Modal length for the sample was 7.5 - 8 inches with 58% (n=182) of the bluegill exceeding 7 inches.  Bluegill more than 8 inches in length accounted for 14% (n=43) of the catch while 0.8% (n=2) exceeded 9 inches.   The 2003 panfish assessment netted 728 bluegill (60.7/trapnet), between 3.9 and 9.2 inches in length.  Mean length  was 6.3 inches with a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches.  The population was dominated by smaller fish as bluegill exceeding 7 inches accounted for only 10% (n=77) of the catch, with 2% (n=17) more than 8 inches and 0.2 (n=2) over 9 inches.   Ages 3 thru 10 were represented in the 2009 aged sample.  All of the age groups exhibited fast growth  and two strong year classes from 2005 and 2003 accounted for most of the fish. <br> \n       A 2004 ice-out assessment captured 170 bluegill between 3.2 and 9.1 inches in length.  While the modal length was 7 - 7.5 inches, the mean length was only 5.7 inches.  Fish over 7 inches accounted for 25% (N=43) of the sample with 1% (n=2)  more than 8 inches and 0.6% (n=1) exceeded 9 inches. <br> \n       Both gillnet surveys in 2008 and 2006 sampled black crappie, n=86 (14.3/gillnet) and n=169 (18.8/gillnet), respectively.  Both gillnet catches were well above the 3rd quartile of 3.5/gillnet for lake class 31.  Small crappie dominated both catches.  The 2006 survey was the only survey to have a crappie over 9 inches, which was a single fish.  Mean length in 2008 was 6.8 inches and modal length 7 - 7.5 inches.  In 2006, the mean length was 5.4 inches and modal length 5.5 - 6 inches. <br> \n       The last full lake survey in 2004 had a black crappie catch of 3.3/trapnet (n=30) and gillnet catch of 4.1/set (n=37).  The trapnet catch fell within the normal range of 0.7 - 3.4/trapnet for the lake class while the gillnet catch was above the 75% quartile of 3.5/gillnet.  There were crappie up to 12 inches caught in the trapnets and 11 inches in the gillnets.  Fish exceeding 9 inches accounted for 37% (n=11) of the trapnet catch and 24% (n=9) of the gillnet catch.  Three (10%) of the trapnet fish and seven (18%) of the gillnet fish were more than 10 inches in length. <br> \n        Two northern pike, 24 and 30 inches in length, were sampled in the 2009 panfish assessment along with three walleye between 25 and 28 inches in length.  Other fish species caught included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n        Panfish assessments appear to be the most effective method of collecting larger numbers of black crappie and bluegill.  It was noted in the 2003 panfish assessment that the routine lake surveys have produced similar results when comparing sample size structure from panfish assessments.   Spring ice-out assessments can also produce high numbers of crappie but most of the fish appear to be smaller.     <br> \n        An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth of the crappie and bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a fertile, moderately sized lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake can be fairly turbid during the summer months with heavy growth of submerged vegetation.  Most recreation on the lake occurs in the form of fishing which can draw numbers of people year-round. <br> \n A spring panfish trap net assessment was conducted on Maple Lake in late-May of 2015 which targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the area and the assessment was used to gather information on the size structure of the populations.  A special sunfish regulation is being implemented March 1st, 2016 for Maple Lake that would reduce the bag limit to ten sunfish.  Maple Lake has a reputation of producing seven to nine inch Bluegill and receives heavy fishing pressure from anglers targeting the species.  It is hoped that a reduction in harvest will allow more fish to attain greater age and size.   Considerable numbers of both Bluegill and Black Crappie reside in Maple Lake.  Bluegills are abundant and grow fast but the numbers of large fish appear to be limited by fishing pressure.  The 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment sampled 537 Bluegill between 4 and 8.9 inches in length.  Seven inch sunfish are common but few reach 9 inches.    Crappie are also quite numerous.  Fish in the 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment measured from 6.4 to 11.6 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches.    Smaller crappie dominated the 2015 sample as the majority of fish (60%; n=338) were between seven and eight inches in length.   Crappie reproduction was very strong in 2011 producing a huge year class which dominated the trap net assessment in 2015. <br> \n      Maple Lake is located in an area dominated by agricultural land uses which combined with its shallow basin results in a very fertile (eutrophic) state.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to improve the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal along the lakeshore will help protect the shoreline from erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and reduce nutrients entering the water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a popular fishing lake in the area and provides plenty ofangling opportunity.  Known for the bluegill and black crappie fishing, the lakealso has walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Poor summer water clarityfrom algae blooms is common and dense vegetation beds are found on the west sideof the lake and around the access.      Several changes have occurred in the fish community since the last survey. Walleye numbers decreased while northern pike, yellow perch, bluegills, and blackcrappies all showed increases in numbers.  Even though walleye abundance declined,numbers were about average for lakes similar to Maple.  Several year classes weresampled, indicating the availability of a variety of sizes to the angler, includingfish over eight pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year andsurvival of the fingerlings may be affected by the high pike population.  Somewalleye natural reproduction was found to occur in the lake and contribution to thefishery will be evaluated to determine future stocking needs.  Normally a highnorthern pike population is undesirable in a lake.  This aggressive predator fishcan easily throw a fish community out of balance and produce small, hammer-handles. Maple Lake's pike population was unusual in that the average size of the fish wasbig, three pounds.  The abundant yellow perch population is an important componentin maintaining good growth in the pike population.  Perch are the major preyspecies for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch have also been found to beinstrumental in maintaining a well-balanced bluegill population of fast growing,quality individuals.  Typically largemouth bass are difficult to assess during asummer survey.  Spring trapnetting and electrofishing were more effective andsampled fish from nine to nineteen inches.  The abundant bluegill and black crappiepopulations were dominated by small fish, however bluegills over six inches werecommon and eleven inch+ crappies have been observed.  Pumpkinseeds are alsoabundant with individuals over six inches common.  Maple Lake's roughfish communityis comprised of white suckers, bowfin or dogfish, yellow bullheads, and brownbullheads.  While most of the bullheads were average in size, fish up to fourteeninches were measured.     Some of the northern pike had neascus or a black trematode.  The trematode isa parasite that goes from snails to fish to a fish-eating bird, such as a heron,to mature.  Humans can not be infested.  Skinning the fish removes most of theparasite and cooking will kill the rest.  Intestinal worms were common in thewalleye.  Removing the guts will also remove the worms.     Maple Lake offers some excellent fishing opportunity.  Releasing largernorthern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish willhelp sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Best agricultural andshoreline management practices are encouraged in the surrounding watershed toimprove water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a popular fishing lake in Todd County and provides plenty of angling opportunity.  Known for the bluegill and black crappie fishing, the lake also has walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Poor summer water clarity from algae blooms is a common occurence.    While the walleye population has shown a decline in abundance since the last survey in 1997, numbers continue to be around average when compared to similar type lakes.  The average size of the walleyes from the survey was almost three pounds, with a wide range of sizes sampled.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year and some natural reproduction has also been documented.  Northern pike numbers continue to be high in the lake which could adversely effect survival of the walleye fingerlings.  Normally a high pike population is undesirable in a lake.  This aggressive predator fish can easily throw a fish community out of balance and produce small, hammer-handles.  Maple Lake's pike population is unusual in that the average size of the fish in the survey was fair size, almost three pounds with some fish over 30 inches observed.  The abundant yellow perch population is an important component in maintaining good growth in the pike populaltion.  Perch are the major prey species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch have also been found to be instrumental in maintaining a well-balanced bluegill population of fast growing, quality individuals.  Black crappies appear to be abundant and the population dominated by small fish, however fish over eleven inches have been observed in past surveys.  While gillnets are not the standard gear for sampling bluegills, some quality fish over 8 inches in length were seen in the survey.  Typical methods for assessing largemouth bass were not used in this survey, however, Maple Lake has a history of producing big bass.      Pumpkinseeds are a sunfish species in the lake that appear to be numberous and slightly smaller in size than the bluegills.   Maple Lake's roughfish community is comprised of white suckers, bowfin or dogfish, carp, black bullheads, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads.  Bullheads over 13 inches were observed in all three populations.    Maple Lake offers some excellent fishing opportunity.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Good agricultural and shoreline management practices are encouraged in the surrounding watershed to improve water quality.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a fertile, moderately sized lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake can be fairly turbid during the summer months with heavy growth of submerged vegetation.  Most recreation on the lake occurs in the form of fishing which can draw numbers of people year-round. <br> \n <br> \nA spring panfish trap net assessment was conducted on Maple Lake on June 3, 2019 which targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie.  The lake provides a popular panfish fishery in the area and the assessment was used to gather information on the size structure of the populations.  A special sunfish regulation was  implemented March 1, 2016 for Maple Lake that reduced the bag limit to ten sunfish.  Maple Lake has a reputation of producing seven to nine inch Bluegill and appears to receive heavy fishing pressure from anglers targeting the species.  It was hoped that a reduction in harvest would allow more fish to attain greater age and size.   Considerable numbers of both Bluegill and Black Crappie reside in Maple Lake.  Bluegills are abundant and grow fast but the numbers of large fish appear to be limited by fishing pressure.  The 2019 spring panfish trap net assessment sampled 389 Bluegill between 3.6 and 8.8 inches in length.  Seven inch sunfish are common but few reach 9 inches.    Bluegill exceeding 8.0 inches comprised only 3.6% and 3.2% of the catch in the 2019 and 2015 assessments respectively.  No conclusions regarding the Bluegill bag limit reduction to 10 fish can be made at this time.  It may be that the reduction in the bag limit is not sufficient to produce an increase in the abundance of larger fish on Maple Lake.  Fisheries managers suggest focusing harvest on more abundant fish in the 7 inch range and limiting harvest and releasing some fish over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie are also typically sampled in abundance during spring panfish assessments.  The 2019 survey, however, captured only 36 Black Crappie. Crappie sampled ranged from 6.6 to 11.8 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  A total of 562 fish were sampled in the 2015 spring panfish assessment that measured 6.4 to 11.6 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches.  Smaller crappie dominated the 2015 sample as the majority of fish (60%; n=338) were between seven and eight inches in length.  Timing of spring sampling is critical when considering Black Crappie catches, and netting results often do not represent population abundance. <br> \n <br> \nMaple Lake is located in an area dominated by agricultural land uses which combined with its shallow basin results in a very fertile (eutrophic) state.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to improve the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal along the lakeshore will help protect the shoreline from erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and reduce nutrients entering the water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This report summarizes the findings of the standard survey completed the week of June 21, 2021 which used six gill nets to assess the fishery status of Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch. These three species were targeted and are most readily caught by gill nets. Catch-rate and size structure data are compared to the last survey that used gill nets, which can be referenced in LakeFinder under \"Targeted Survey 2015-06-22\".  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management consists of stocking mainly fingerlings and occasionally fry. Currently the Walleye population can be defined as low-density and generally comprised of larger, older fish. There are anecdotal reports of anglers occasionally catching decent sized Walleyes but for the most part, the lake is not a destination for hot Walleye fishing. Fingerling stocking has been only marginally successful at establishing a quality fishable population. Reasons for this are unclear. Higher fingerling stocking rates of large fingerlings might be more successful and could be pursued if sources become available.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is higher than we'd like to see but not as high as other lakes in the area where pike numbers have reached nuisance levels. Pike in Maple Lake can grow to large sizes and we commonly see fish over 30 inches. Such large individuals are rare in central Minnesota which is the reason for the current harvest regulations in this region of the state. Populations of large pike (over 30 inches) in lakes like Maple are fragile. It takes very little harvest to negatively impact the fishery. Given angler restraint and perhaps higher protections, Maple Lake has the potential to increase its number of big pike and may have trophy potential (producing 40-inch fish).  <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch are a favorite prey for Northern Pike and Walleye. Despite occasional high pike abundance, Maple Lake consistently produces large numbers of perch. Ecologically, this is of great benefit to predatory species in the lake. From an angler's perspective however, perch in Maple rarely provide much of a fishery. There are occasional perch caught that approach 10 inches, but we have never sampled a perch over ten inches with our gill nets. When looking at historical perch length frequency distributions, we see high numbers of fish between 5-8 inches and a few between 8 and 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and crappie are not typically sampled on a consistent basis with gill nets. However, Maple Lake produces good fishing for both species. Individual sizes are modest but there are plenty of them. Maple Lake is a productive, nutrient-rich lake and has moderate to heavy algal blooms during the summer. What it lacks in clear water it makes up for in highly productive fisheries.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   A gillnet assessment was conducted on Maple Lake by Research personnel from Glenwood as part of a walleye research study.  Walleye stocking regimes are being studied to determine the most effective stocking rates in moderate-sized Minnesota lake class 23, 24, 25, and 31.  Lakes were stocked with OTC marked fish and gillnetting has been used as the recapture method three years after each stocking.  The standard lake survey gillnet locations were used for comparing population abundances.  Lakes were first stocked with marked fingerlings in 2001 followed by additional stockings in 2003 and 2005.  Scales and otoliths were only taken from the walleye by Research for age data.   A full oxygen - temperature profile and field measurements of water quality were not done.  No aging data was provided for the report. <br> \n   The walleye gillnet catch of 1/set in 2006 was a significant decrease from the 4/gillnet catch of 2004 and the lowest catch to date for the lake.  The gillnet catch also fell below the 25% quartile for lake class 31 and the management goal of 5 - 10 walleye per gillnet.  The 2004 and 2001 (2.4/gillnet) catch rates were also below the management goal while those from 1997, 1986, and 1981 met the goal with catches around 5/gillnet.  The management goal was exceeded by the 1991 catch rate of 12/gillnet. Looke to the Research report for an analysis of the walleye stocking.  Fish in the 2006 sample measured from 14 to 24 inches in length with a mean length of 17.6 inches.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches comprised 33% (n=3) of the catch.  The 2004 catch displayed a much wider size range, from 7.8 to 28 inches in length.  Mean length was larger at 20.1 inches and 44% (n=16) of the fish were over 20 inches.  The average walleye weight in the 2006 catch was 2 pounds which fell within the management goal of an average weight of 1.75 to 2.5 pounds in the gillnet catch.  The average weight seen in the 2004 survey was an impressive 3.2 pounds.   <br> \n    Northern pike numbers also appear to have decreased significantly since the last survey.  The 2004 survey produced a gillnet catch of 9/set (n=81) which declined to 6.9/gillnet (n=62) in 2006.  The 2006 catch rate did fall within the normal range for the lake class and met the management goal (interquartile range = 3.5 - 10.5).  Three of the surveys from 1981 to 2001 saw pike gillnet catches of over 17/gillnet.   The lowest pike catch for Maple Lake was 3.5/gillnet in 1986.  Pike in the 2006 catch were between 17 and 35 inches in length with a mean length of 22.6 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 19 - 20 inches with 27% (n=17) of the pike exceeding 24 inches.  The 2004 sample displayed a much more desirable population size structure with the fish measuring between 17 and 34 inches, a mean length of 24.8 inches and modal length of 24 - 25 inches.  Pike exceeding 24 inches in length comprised 53% (n=43) of the catch which exceeded the management goal of at least 40% of the gillnet catch more than 24 inches in length while the 2006 results fell below that goal. <br> \n    The 2006 netting results showed a significant increase in black crappie abundance.  The 18.8/gillnet catch (n=169) was more than 4 times the 2004 catch of 4.1/gillnet (n=37) and more than 5 times the 75% quartile of 3.5/gillnet for the lake class.  The 2006 catch rate was also the highest crappie gillnet catch to date for the lake with 0.4/gillnet in 1997 being the lowest.  Small fish dominated the 2006 catch as only one of the crappies in the sample was over 9 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 5.4 inches with a modal length of 4.5 - 5 inches which was probably due to a strong year class.  The size structure of the 2004 catch was much more desirable with fish up to 11 inches being sampled.  Mean length for that catch was 8 inches with a modal length of 7 - 7.5  inches and 24% (n=9) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.   <br> \n    Yellow perch have also shown a significant increase in abundance since the last survey.  The 2006 gillnet catch of 53.2/set was a significant increase from the 36/gillnet catch in 2004 which was also the lowest perch catch for the lake.  Not only was the 2006 catch rate above the 75% quartile of 43.6/gillnet for the lake class, four of the catch rates between 1981 and 2001 were above that quartile with the highest being 157.6/gillnet in 1997.   The perch ranged from 5 to 9.5 inches in the 2006 sample while they were up to 10.4 inches in 2004.  The modal length was the same for both catches, 5.5 - 6 inches.  The increase in perch numbers may be a the result of lower northern pike abundance. <br> \n     Catches for both bowfin and brown bullheads were above their respective 75% lake class quartiles while the catch rates for black bullheads and yellow bullheads were within their normal range.  The gillnet catches for white sucker and largemouth bass were below their respective 25% quartiles.  Some bluegills and pumpkinseeds were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    A gillnet assessment was conducted on Maple Lake by Research personnel from the Glenwood Office as part of a walleye research study.  Walleye stocking regimes are being evaluated to determine the most effective stocking rates in moderate-sized Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 25, and 31.  Lakes were being stocked with OTC marked fish and gillnetting has been used for comparing population abundances.  Lakes were first stocked with the marked fingerlings in 2001 followed by additional stockings in 2003 and 2005.  Scales and otoliths were taken only from walleye by Research for age data.  Fewer gillnets, six instead of nine, were set in the 2008 assessment due to the high catch of larger northern pike. <br> \n    The 2008 walleye gillnet catch of 1.8/set (n=11) was comparable to the 1/gillnet catch (n=9) of 2006 and within the normal range for lake class 31 (interquartile range = 1.3 - 5).  As in 2006, the 2008 gillnet catch fell below the management goal of 5 - 10 walleye per gillnet.  The 2004 (4/gillnet) and 2001 (2.4/gillnet) catch rates were also below the management goal while those from 1997, 1986, and 1981 met the goal with catches around 5/gillnet.  The 12.5/gillnet from 1991 was the highest on record and surpassed the management goal as well as being more than twice the 75% quartile.  Refer to the Research report for an analysis of the walleye stocking.  Walleye in the 2008 survey measured from 10 to 26 inches in length with a mean length of 14 inches and mean weight of 1.2 pounds.  Only 9% (n=3) of the walleye were more than 20 inches in length compared to 33% in 2006 and 44% in 2004.  Walleye up to 24 inches were measured in 2006, while in both 2004 and 2001, fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  Walleye mean weight in the 2006 assessment was 2 pounds, 3.2 pounds in 2004, and 2.9 pounds in 2001.  <br> \n     One outcome of the 2008 survey was the change in northern pike abundance.  The 2008 gillnet catch of 8.5/set (n=51) was a significant increase from the 6.9/gillnet catch (n=62) of 2006.  Three surveys from 1981 to 2001 showed pike gillnet catches of over 17/gillnet with a record low of 3.5/gillnet recorded in 1986.  Despite the increased abundance in 2008, size structure of the sample was excellent with fish between 17 and 36 inches measured.  Mean length for the catch was 28.4 inches with a mean weight of 5.8 pounds.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 86% (n=44) of the sample with 31% (n=16) more than 30 inches and 4% (n=2) over 36 inches in length.  This was the first gillnet survey to capture a pike over 36 inches, however, pike up to 39 inches were measured in the 2004 northern pike ice-out assessment.  The management goal for the lake is to maintain a pike catch within the interquartile range of 3.5 - 10.5/gillnet with at least 40% of the fish exceeding 24 inches.  The 2004 survey catch (n=81; 9/gillnet) produced a mean length of 24.8 inches and mean weight of 3.6 pounds with 53% of the fish more than 24 inches in length.  Catches from both 2006 and 2001 produced similar mean lengths of 22.6 inches and mean weights of 2.8 pounds, however, only 27% of the 2006 pike sample exceeded 24 inches while 31% did in 2001. <br> \n     The 2008 black crappie catch rate of 14.3/gillnet was comparable to that of 2006 and remained above the 75% quartile of 3.5/gillnet.  Crappie abundance had shown a significant increase in 2006 when the 2004 catch rate of 4.1/gillnet jumped to 18.8/gillnet. Previous gillnet catches from 1981 to 2001 ranged from 0.4/set to 4.4/set.  Smaller crappie dominated the catches in both 2008 and 2006.  None of the crappie in the 2008 were over 9 inches in length while only one was in 2006.  The average length and modal length were better in 2008, 6.8 inches and 7 - 7.5 inches, respectively, compared to 5.4 inches and 5.5 - 6 inches in 2006.  Crappie up to 11 inches had been measured in the 2004 survey where the catch had a mean length of 8 inches and 24% (n=9) of the fish were more than 9 inches in length. <br> \n      Maple Lake has a history of supporting an abundant yellow perch population.  The 2008 gillnet catch of 49/set (n=294) was comparable with the 2006 gillnet catch of 53.2/set and remained above the 75% quartile of 43.6/gillnet for the lake class.  Four of the last six surveys have produced perch gillnet catches above the 75% quartile with the highest being 157.6/set in 1997.  The lowest gillnet catch was 36/set in 2004 with a similar catch rate in 1991.  Perch between 6.5 and 7.5 inches in length accounted for 61% (n=180) of the 2008 catch with perch between 5 and 8.5 inches being measured. <br> \n       Catch rates for black bullhead, bowfin, white sucker, and yellow bullhead suggest low abundance with their catch rates being below their respective 25% quartile for the lake class.  Nine bluegill between 6.5 and 7.5 inches in length were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a fertile, moderately sized lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake can be fairly turbid during the summer months with heavy growth of submerged vegetation.  Most recreation on the lake occurs in the form of fishing which can draw numbers of people year-round. <br> \n     Considerable numbers of both Bluegill and Black Crappie reside in Maple Lake.  Bluegills are abundant and grow fast but the numbers of large fish appear to be limited by fishing pressure.  Sunfish exceeding 7 inches are common but few reach 9 inches.  In an attempt to increase the numbers of large Bluegills the daily bag limit will be reduced to 10 fish on March 1 of 2016.  Crappie are also quite numerous but the average size is about 8 inches.   Some crappies can exceed 11 inches.  Crappie reproduction is very consistent resulting in regular production of large year classes. <br> \n     While panfishing is what draws most anglers the lake supports a healthy population of Northern Pike which average about 4 pounds.  Pike in the 10 pound range are a possible catch.  Walleyes are present in moderate  numbers  and a variety of sizes.    Walleye fingerlings are stocked during odd numbered years to sustain this fishery.  Due to the stained water Walleyes can be caught at any hour.  Largemouth Bass are also found in moderate abundance with fish in the 15-19 inch range likely to be encountered. <br> \n     All three species of bullhead (Black, Brown, Yellow) reside in Maple Lake but not in excessive numbers.  Yellow Perch are currently very abundant and provide an excellent prey source for the larger predatory fish species such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  Rough fish species such as Bowfin (Dogfish), White Sucker, and Common Carp are also present in typical abundance. <br> \n     Maple Lake is located in an area dominated by agricultural land uses which combined with its shallow basin results in a very fertile (eutrophic) state.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to improve the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal along the lakeshore will help protect the shoreline from erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and reduce nutrients entering the water. <br> \n</p>",

THE MEAN WEIGHT OF NOP DECLINED FROM 3.68 LBS (1986) TO 2.66 LBS (1991).  AGES II-IV AND VI-IX WERE SAMPLED, WITH AGE III COMPRISING 48% OF THE CATCH. GROWTH OF ALL AGE CLASSES WAS GOOD.  WAE WERE PRESENT IN HIGH NUMBERS (12.0/GILLNET) AND HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 1986 (5.0/SET) AND 1981 (5.15/SET).  ANNUAL STOCKING OF YEARLING AND FINGERLINGS SINCE 1986 APPEARS TO HAVE CREATED HIGH POPULATION LEVELS.  AGES II AND V WERE PREDOMINANT, ACCOUNTING FOR 37% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  MEAN WEIGHTS OF WAE HAVE DECLINED FROM 3.05 LBS IN 1986 TO 1.99 LBS IN 1991.  YEP CATCH HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 1986 (118.33/SET) TO 1991 (37.0/SET). YEP ARE STILL RELATIVELY ABUNDANT, EQUALLING THE THIRD QUARTILE VALUE FOR LAKE CLASS 31.  AGES II-V WERE SAMPLED BY GILLNET WITH AGES III AND IV COMPRISING 73% OF THE CATCH.  GROWTH WAS NORMAL, EXCEPT FOR SLOW GROWTH DURING THE FIRST YEAR. THE BLG POPULATION IS AT A NORMAL LEVEL AND REMAINS SIMILAR TO 1981 AND 1986.  THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF BLG CAUGHT BY TRAPNET WERE 7 INCHES OR LARGER.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES SAMPLED (I-V).  TRAPNET CATCH OF BLC WAS SOMEWHAT GREATER IN 1991 (8.33/SET) VERSE 1986 (2.17/SET).  THE MEDIAN LENGTH INCREMENT WAS 7.0-7.4 INCHES, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A GOOD 1989 YEAR CLASS.  GROWTH WAS NORMAL FOR AGES I-IV.  LMB WERE NOT SAMPLED DURING THE 1991 SURVEY.  LMB ARE NOT VERY SUSEPTIBLE TO CAPTURE BY GILLNET OR TRAPNET.  NIGHT ELECTRO- FISHING WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE FUTURE TO EVALUATE LMB POPULATIONS.  ANGLER INTERVIEWS CONFIRMED GOOD FISHING FOR LMB.  YEB WERE PRESENT IN HIGH NUMBERS (25.83/SET).  APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE YEB CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS WERE 9 INCHES OR LARGER.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A special assessment was conducted on Maple Lake in mid-June which targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the area and the assessment was used to gather information on the size structure of the populations.  Similar panfish assessments were also conducted in 2009 and 2003.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of twelve lifts although only ten were counted due to issues with bogs.  Only Bluegill and Black Crappie were measured and scales collected from the two species for age data.  All other fish species were identified and counted.   <br> \n      The 2013 panfish assessment captured 292 Bluegill (29.2/TN) which was the lowest number of Bluegill caught for the three panfish assessments.   The 2009 assessment sampled 314 Bluegill (26.2/TN) and the 2003 assessment 728 fish (60.7/TN).  Fish in the 2013 assessment measured from 3.1 - 9.4 inches with a mean length of 6.2 inches and modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches for the sample.  Twenty-eight percent (n=83) of the Bluegill exceeded seven inches with 4% (n=11) more than eight inches and 0.3% (n=1) over nine inches in length.  The length distribution displayed a strong truncation at eight inches likely due to angler harvest. <br> \n     The size structure of the 2009 Bluegill sample shared the most favorable characteristics compared to 2013 and 2003.  Fish measured from 4.6 to 9.2 inches in length with a mean length of 7 inches and modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches for the sample.  Over half (58%; n= 182) of the fish were more than seven inches in length.  Those over eight inches comprised 14% (n=43) of the catch with 0.6% (n=2) exceeding nine inches.  Smaller to medium size Bluegill were more prevalent in the 2003 catch.   Fish between 3.9 and 9.3 inches were netted with a mean length of 6.3 inches and modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches for the sample.  Only 10% (n=77) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 2% (n=17) more than eight inches and 0.3% (n=2) over nine inches in length.   <br> \n     Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2013 Bluegill sample suggesting consistent recruitment.   All age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The Bluegill catch was dominated by the 2010 year class which accounted for 37% of the sample and the 5 -5.5 inch modal length.   Few fish were over six years of age when they reached a desirable size and were presumed harvested.   <br> \n      The panfish assessments have proven to be an effective method of sampling the Black Crappie population in Maple Lake.  A record number of Black Crappie (n=545; 54.5/TN) were caught in the 2013 panfish assessment.  Previous catches ranged from 12.1/TN (n=145) in 2003 to 17.8/TN (n=213) in 2009.  Smaller crappie dominated the 2013 sample as the majority of fish (87%; n=474) were between 4.5 and 5.5 inches in length.  Only 2% (n=13) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.  Although fish up 11.4 inches were caught, mean length was 5.4 inches and modal length 5 - 5.5 inches for the sample.   <br> \n      Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2013 panfish assessment.  All of the crappie age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The 2011 year class dominated the catch, comprising 94% of the sample and was responsible for the both the smaller mean length and 5 - 5.5 inch modal length.   <br> \n     The largest Black Crappie captured in the three panfish assessments was in 2009 and measured 12.2 inches.  Mean length for the 2009 sample was 8 inches with a modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches and 8% (n=16) exceeding nine inches.  Although 11.1 inches was the longest crappie in the 2003 assessment, the size structure of the catch was more desirable.  Mean length was 8.2 inches, modal length 8 - 8.5 inches, and 34% (n=50) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.   <br> \n      Other fish species caught in the 2013 panfish assessment included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Summer trap netting was performed on Maple Lake during June 21-22, 2018 to provide updated trap net data for calculation of a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI).  IBI calculations are used to evaluate habitat conditions overall lake health or impairment.   Maple Lake continues to be a popular destination for anglers seeking sunfish and crappies.   A special regulation consisting of a 10 fish bag limit for sunfish was implemented in 2016 and is being evaluated using targeted spring trap net data. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for Bluegill in 2018 was 64.6/lift which was well above the normal range for lakes similar to Maple.    Bluegill ranged in size from 3.1-8.7 inches in length with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Nearly 40% of the Bluegill exceeded 7 inches, however only 2.6% were longer than 8 inches. <br> \n    <br> \nBlack Crappie were well represented in the 2018 trap nets resulting in a catch rate of 17.3/lift which was also well above the norm for similar lakes. Over 65% of the sample was comprised of fish from 8.5-9.5 inches long which is an acceptable harvesting size for most anglers.  Few larger crappie were observed as only 2% exceeded 10 inches.  The largest crappie measured was 10.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed have been prevalent in summer trap nets with catch rates of 10.4/lift and 12/lift in 2018 and 2004, respectively.  Other notable fish in the 2018 trap nets included 4 Walleye ranging from 24.8-28.3 inches and a Northern Pike that measured 35.2 inches.  Two species considered tolerant to human induced degradation were observed, Common Carp and Black Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a popular fishing lake in Todd County and provides plenty of angling opportunity.  Known for the bluegill and black crappie fishing, the lake also has walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Much of the shoreline is sand except for the west side that is more marshy.  Coontail and filamentous algae were the most common submerged aquatic vegetation with cattails being the most common emergent plant.  Water quality has been an on-going problem for Maple Lake as summer algae blooms are common.  The secchi disk reading of 8 feet at the time of the survey in June was good but by August, water clarity usually has been reduced to 2 feet.    Some major changes were observed in the fish community composition since the last survey in 2001.  Walleye numbers were up after being at a record low in 2001 but are still slightly below management goals for the lake.  While there appears to be some keeper size walleye, most of the fish in the survey were over 20 inches in length, with smaller fish under 12 inches being scarce.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in the lake in odd numbered years and the high northern pike numbers observed in the previous survey may have affected the survival of the 2003 fingerlings.  Northern pike numbers did show a decline from 2001 and fall within the range of management goals for the lake.  Anglers have a good chance of catching a nice pike as the average size in the survey was around 3.5 pounds with some fish in the 11 pound range.  Typical methods of assessing largemouth bass were not used in this survey, however, Maple Lake has a history of producing big bass.  An ice-out assessment conducted in 2004 did catch some bass that were in the 4 - 5 pound range.    Yellow perch also appeared to be effected by the high pike population as a decline in numbers was seen in the 2004 survey, however, histortical netting data indicate that the species has the ability to quickly rebound when pike numbers decline.  An abundant perch population is an important component in maintaining good growth rates in both northern pike and walleye.  Perch have also been found to be instrumental in maintaining a well-balanced bluegill population of fast growing, quality individuals.  Maple Lake has a reputation for producing some good bluegill fishing and quality fish.  Abundance declined from the last survey but almost a quarter of the fish were over 7 inches in length.  Black crappie abundance also declined and the population appears to be dominated by small fish under 9 inches but some individuals up to 12 inches were observed.    Pumpkinseeds are a sunfish species in the lake that appear to be numerous and slightly smaller in size than the bluegills.  Maple Lake's roughfish community is comprised of white suckers, shorthead redhorse, bowfin or dogfish, black bullheads, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads.  Yellow bullheads were the most numerous of the three species and all three populations had fish over 13 inches in length.    Maple Lake offers some excellent fishing opportunity.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Good agricultural and shoreline management practices are encouraged in the surrounding watershed to improve water quality.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie has a good website which provides information to shoreland property owners.  (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm)</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 25-27 to provide data on the Bluegill size structure and evaluate effects of a 10 fish bag limit on sunfish which was implemented on March 1, 2016.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake six previous times since 2003.  Future evaluations relating to the 10 sunfish bag limit will incorporate spring trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2022 captured 184 Bluegill.  Spring sample sizes in the past ranged from 292-726 fish, sometimes with fewer lifts.  The total number of fish captured and catch rates are not reliable indicators of abundance changes when spring trap nets are used.  Spring conditions can be quite variable and the lower catch in 2022 is not likely to represent a true decline in the population.   Bluegill in 2022 ranged from 3.9- 8.58 inches and mean length was 6.63 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 36% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up 1% of the sample.  The trap net assessment completed in 2019 exhibited a similar size structure with 31% exceeding 7 inches, 3.6% over 8 inches and none over 9 inches.  Maximum length was 8.78 inches and mean length was 6.3 inches.  Bluegill over 9 inches have been absent since 2013.   Bluegill size structure goals aim for at least 50% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 10% to exceed 8 inches, 2% over 9 inches and the presence of fish 10 inches or longer.  The 2022 results along with other post-regulation trap net assessments fail to show any progress towards reaching these management goals for size structure.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include:  mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.  When combining the four pre-regulation spring trap net surveys mean size was 6.57 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches was 2.14 net, and mean length of the top 10% was 8.06 inches.  The catch rate of Bluegill over 8 inches in 2022 was 0.2/net.  In 2022, mean length was 6.63 inches and the mean length of the top 10% was 7.67 inches.  These metrics also demonstrate that no improvement in size structure has occurred following the implementation of specialized regulations.   Most Bluegill display moderate growth up to 7.5 inches and then growth slows considerably with few reaching 8 inches despite attaining Age 9.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and Maple Lake's catches have demonstrated this variability.  Spring trap net catches in the lake have ranged from 36 to 562 fish with a mean of 266 fish.  As with Bluegills a low overall catch of crappies does not necessarily reflect a lower population.  A total of 205 crappies were captured in 2022 ranging in size from 5.9 to 12 inches, no crappies 12 inches or longer had been sampled since 2009.  Mean length in 2022 was 9.7 inches and crappie longer than 10 inches comprised over 41% of the sample which was substantially higher than any previous spring trap net effort.    Crappies reach 9 inches at Age 5 but growth slows appreciably once the fish reach 10 inches.  The most prominent year class in the sample was Age 11 with these fish averaging 10.7 inches long.  The oldest fish sampled was 13 years old. <br> \n <br> \nSixteen Pumpkinseeds were captured but not measured.   Five Walleye were also netted and ranged from 10.4 to 27.5 inches.  A single Northern Pike measuring 33.1 inches was sampled. <br> \n</p>",
