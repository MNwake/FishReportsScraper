Age 5 fish were most abundant in the sample which suggests slow growth for this species. Bluegill abundance (11.8/trap net) borders on low for this area but is near the state median. Ages 2 and 3 are dominant of the four age classes sampled and growth is at or above average. Pumpkinseed numbers (8/trap net) are above the area median. While hybrid sunfish numbers (1.5/trap net) were about average. White crappie abundance is low (0.3/trap net) while that of black crappies is high (17/trap net). Black crappie growth is good for the four ages sampled. Yellow perch abundance is average for this area (11.5/gill net) and similar to Dallas lake. These are the only two lakes in the watershed where perch are this numerous. The common carp catch (6.8/trap net) is high and is rivaled only by that of long lake (5.3/trap net) in this watershed. Black bullhead numbers are high (20/trap net) while yellow bullhead numbers are low (0.3/trap net). White sucker abundance is average for this area with a catch of 0.5/gill net.</p>",
