An assessment was done in May, 2014 primarily to determine if any rainbow trout were present after low oxygen readings and a severe winter, but also to remove unwanted species.   Six quarter-inch trap nets were set around the shoreline for consecutive 4 days.   A total of 5 northern pike and 63 yellow perch were caught and moved to the larger pit just across the gravel berm to the west.  1,540 black bullheads were also caught and disposed of.  No trout were captured or observed.   </p>",
