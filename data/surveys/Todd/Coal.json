                "narrative": "<p>    Coal Lake is a popular panfish lake near Browerville.  Despite being only 25 feet deep, the lake does have fishing structure such as weedlines, points, moderate drop-offs, and bays.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 10.2 feet at the end of June.  Much of the east side of the lake is marsh which has limited development along that shore.   <br> \n     The fish community has remained relatively stable since the last survey and includes species as northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill which attract anglers.  Northern pike numbers were above management goals which could have a negative effect on both walleye stocking and yellow perch abundance.  The majority of the pike in the survey were less than 24 inches in length although the lake has been known to produce trophy size fish.  Small pike are surplus and we encourage harvest.  Despite walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years and some natural reproduction, the gill net catch was below management goals.   Anglers have an opportunity to catch a nice one though, as most of the walleye in the summer survey were over 20 inches in length.  Although few largemouth bass were caught in the summer survey, spring electrofishing indicated a healthy population.  Anglers are likely to see mostly small to medium size bass.  Bluegill are a major target species for fishermen on the lake.  Average size was about six inches in the summer survey, but fish over seven inches comprised a significant portion of the catch in spring trap net assessments.  Black crappie were another species that were scarce in the summer survey, but some were netted during spring electrofishing.  Many of the fish caught were more than nine inches long with some up to 12 inches observed.  Other panfish species found in the lake included pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish.  All three species of bullhead were caught in the summer survey.  Yellow bullhead were the most abundant of the three species.  For anglers who like to catch bullhead, brown bullhead up to 15 inches were measured as well as yellow bullhead up to 13 inches.   <br> \n      Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike and walleye as well as practice selective harvest of bluegill and black crappie to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Proper land use practices are also encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and improve water quality and fish habitat in the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coal Lake received a standard survey using gill nets, trap nets and electrofishing during May and June, 2022. Sampling gear targeted Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. As an overview, Coal Lake has a Walleye population characterized as low-density, Northern Pike are moderately abundant and small in average size, medium to large Yellow Perch are scarce, Bluegill and Black Crappie are modest in size and abundance, and Largemouth Bass numbers are average with a few large fish present.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets caught a total of 60 pike, 15 crappies, two Walleyes and one perch. The average size Northern Pike was 20.4 inches, most fish caught were less than 20 inches and maximum length was a 28.5 inch fish. From a management perspective, we'd like to see pike abundance stay low. It bumped up in 2022 but the long-term average is still reasonable. Future monitoring will continue to observe population trends.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked on an every-other-year basis however, the desired abundance level has not been recently attained.  At this time, there are a few larger Walleyes in the lake but for the most part, angling pursuits would be better directed toward panfish and bass.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are scarce because Northern Pike keep them cropped down. It's possible that perch are more abundant than our gill nets indicate since they have to be about 4-5 inches long before they're vulnerable to capture. Other lakes with apparent low perch abundance have been sampled with special small-mesh gill nets and found to be very abundant but measuring three inches or less.  <br> \n <br> \nCrappies over 12 inches can be found in Coal but they're rare. For the most part, lengths average anywhere from 5-10 inches. Bluegills, while higher in abundance, run on bit on the small side, averaging about six inches. We have however measured Bluegills over nine inches. Electrofishing caught a total of 54 Largemouth Bass. Average size was 12.3 inches however a few trophy fish are present.  <br> \n  <br> \nCoal Lake continues to offer users a relatively peaceful fishing or boating experience. The lake is only moderately developed and there are plenty of natural features along the shoreline to enjoy. Water clarity is about 10 feet but has a dark stain to it caused by decaying vegetation and tannic acid in the watershed. This is not harmful in any way and in fact, is indicative of an adjacent landscape rich in wetlands and forested cover.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Coal Lake was conducted on June 28 and July 1, 2022 by Little Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine.  Backpack electrofishing was performed at all stations with one site being electrofished from the boat.  Seining was completed at nine of ten sampling stations.  Several seine hauls consisted of lengthened hauls to increase the area sampled. Some heavily vegetated and/or soft bottom stations required shortened hauls or fixed-pole sampling.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including a single species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish, Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Coal Lake is \"normal\" as indicated by the FIBI score of 49, above the impairment threshold (38) for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  The score from 2022 is quite similar to past scores in 2011 (46.5) and 2017 (52.1) and the species composition/assemblage showed minimal differences.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coal Lake has historically had a high walleye population.  The 1993 survey wasno exception, even though the catch was less than half of the 1988 survey catch. Natural reproduction has been a major factor in maintaining the current walleyepopulation.  Northern pike numbers were low for this lake class probably due todrought conditions in previous years.  A low predator population appears to havecontributed to a significant increase in yellow perch which are an important preyspecies.  The largemouth bass population is difficult to assess using standard lakesurvey gear and electrofishing will be required to properly identify populationcharacteristics.  Coal Lake does have an excellent panfish population.  Blackcrappies up to 12 inches were sampled, with 7.5 - 8.5 inches being the averagesize.  Fishing has been good for bluegills and pumpkinseed in the summer.  Sunfishover 7 inches are common.  The present fish community structure is highly desirableand should provide quality fishing opportunities for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coal Lake is a popular panfish lake near Browerville.  The lake has moderate residential development and a youth ranch along its shores.  While being shallow, maximum depth of 25 feet, the lake does have some fishing structures such as weedlines, points, moderate drop-offs, and bays.     Coal Lake supports a variety of fish species that may attract anglers, such as bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Several of the fish populations have shown dramatic changes since the last survey in 1993.  One of the most significant was in the northern pike population which showed an increase in numbers and a decrease in average size.  Northern pike numbers are currently the highest they have ever been in Coal Lake.  The average size of the pike was about 1.5 pounds, however, a 17 pound pike was seen during the survey suggesting the lake can produce trophy size pike.  The high pike population may be responsible for the lowest yellow perch and walleye catches to date for Coal Lake.  Most of the walleye seen in the spring and summer assessments were in the 14 - 17 inch range with some fish up to nine pounds present. The reduced abundance of perch is a concern as they are an important prey species.  Good perch abundance often results in better walleye fingerling survival and increased growth rates for predators and bluegills.   Largemouth bass are present in good numbers.  While the average size was about thirteen inches, some trophy size bass are present.  Panfish species in Coal Lake include bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, and hybrid sunfish.   Bluegills over six inches were common in the summer assessment with some up to eight inches being observed.   The other two species of sunfish, pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish, also produced individuals over six inches in length.  Anglers report poor crappie fishing the last several years and 1999 summer net catches along with spring electrofishing suggest a low population.  Other species in the fish community included black, brown, and yellow bullheads, white suckers, and bowfin or dogfish.  All of the roughfish species appear to be at low population levels when compared to similar lakes.     Releasing larger northern pike and walleye, along with selective harvest of bluegills is encouraged by anglers to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northerns and release pike over 24 inches.  Lower pike numbers should decrease predatory competition for yellow perch, improve growth rates in the pike, and increase survival of  walleye fingerlings.  Proper land use practices are also encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and improve the water quality in Coal Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coal Lake is a popular panfish lake near Browerville.  The lake has moderate development and a youth ranch along its shores.  Much of the east side of the lake is marsh which has limited development along that shore.  The remaining shoreline has shallow water substrates comprised of mostly sand and rubble.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 11 feet at the end of June which allowed the vegetation to grow to a depth of 12 feet.  The most common submerged aquatic plants, plants which grow primarily under the water surface, were coontail, large-leaf pondweed, and Robbin's pondweed.   Although the lake is only 25 feet deep, the lake does have fishing structures such as weedlines, points, moderate drop-offs, and bays.    The lake supports a variety of fish species that may attract anglers.  Besides bluegills, there are also black crappies, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  One of the most notable changes since the last survey was an apparent decline in northern pike numbers.  Lower pike abundance usually leads to faster growth rates in the pike due to less competition for food and also better survival of walleye fingerlings.  Average size of the pike in the summer survey was almost 2 pounds but the lake has shown it can produce trophy size fish as a 17-pound northern pike was documented in the last survey.  Yellow perch are showing a positive response to the lower northern pike numbers with an increase in abundance.  Perch can be an important prey species for both pike and walleye and have also been shown to improve growth rate of bluegills.  The walleye population has a variety of sizes available to the angler as fish between 12 and 26 inches were seen in the survey.  The lake typically will receive walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years and some natural reproduction also occurs.  Few largemouth bass were caught in the summer survey but the lake has been known to produce trophy size fish.  Panfish species in the lake include bluegills, black crappies, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds.  Bluegills over 6 inches were common in the survey with some up to almost 8 inches being measured.  Most of the crappies that were seen were around 9 inches but some larger fish have been observed both in nets and by anglers.  Other species that make up the fish community include black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  The yellow bullheads were the most common of the three species.  Most of the black bullheads were small by anglers standards but some larger bullheads up almost 15 inches were measured of the other two species.    Releasing larger northern pike and walleye, along with selective harvest of bluegills and crappies is encouraged by anglers to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Proper land use practices are also encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and improve water quality and fish habitat in the lake.  Protecting fish habitat will also help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Leaving or establishing shoreline buffer strips along the lakeshore helps control erosion and slow pollutants entering the water.

                "narrative": "<p>Coal Lake (DOW# 77-0046-00; Lake Class 29) is a 171 acre lake located near Browerville, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southwest shore. Coal Lake has 2.76 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 29; lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nCoal Lake offers some unique opportunities for anglers in the Little Falls area. Walleye numbers are relatively good when compared to other Lake Class 29 lakes with a wide range of sizes. Largemouth Bass numbers are high with a good number of 13-15 inch fish, but not many larger than 15 inches. Both Bluegill and Black Crappie size structure were fairly average for the area with some quality fish. Very large Brown and Yellow Bullhead were seen with fish up to 16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Coal Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
