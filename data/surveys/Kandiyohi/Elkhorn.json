                "narrative": "<p>GROWTH RATES FOR ALL SPECIES EVALUATED WERE BELOW AVERAGE-TO-AVERAGE FOR THIS MODERATELY FERTILE LAKE.  THE RELATIVELY HEAVY SUBMERGED VEGETATION COVERAGE WITHIN THE LITTORAL ZONE FAVORS THE SURVIVAL OF PREY (PRIMARILY BLG) BY LIMITING THE FORAGING EFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMARY PREDATORS (LMB, NOP, WAE, BLC).  THE NOP CATCH INDEX (5.00 PER GN) WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR ELKHORN LAKE AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER 31 LAKES. THE MAJORITY OF THE SAMPLED NOP WERE WITHIN THE 18-22 INCH SIZE RANGE.  THE 1991 BLG CATCH INDEX (68.40 PER TN) WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES, BUT WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL MEAN FOR ELKHORN LAKE (66.66 PER TN). THE MEAN WEIGHT FOR TN CAUGHT BLG IN 1991 (0.06 LBS) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR ELKHORN. THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED BLG WERE IN THE 3.5 - 5.5 INCH RANGE WITH NO BLG OVER 7.0 INCHES SAMPLED. THE BLG GROWTH RATES WERE THE SLOWEST WITHIN THE SPICER FISHERIES AREA (AVERAGE LENGTH AFTER 5 YEARS IS LESS THAN 5 INCHES).  THE 1991 YEP CATCH INDEX (4.00 PER GN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES.  YEP ABUNDANCE APPEARS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY IN THIS LAKE (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY AT THE END OF THE REPORT) BASED ON THE GN INDICES.  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (1.00 PER GN) WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES, BUT WAS SIMILAR TO 4 OUT OF THE 5 SURVEY'S DONE ON ELKHORN.  WAE WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO SPRING ELECTROFISHING WITH THE MAJORITY FROM THE 1989 AND 1988 YEAR-CLASS (1990, 1988 STOCKINGS).  THE MAJORITY OF WAE SAMPLED LESS THAN 12.0 INCHES.  THE FEW LARGE WAE THAT WERE SAMPLED AND AGED SHOWED VERY GOOD GROWTH AFTER THE THIRD YEAR WHICH MAY BE A RESULT OF THEM REACHING A SUITABLE SIZE TO PREY EFFECTIVELY ON THE STUNTED BLG POPULATION.  THE BLC 1991 CATCH INDICES (1.00 PER GN, 1.40 PER TN) WERE THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR THE  LAST 3 SURVEY'S, BUT LOWER THAN THE 1975 AND 1960 SURVEY'S.  THE INDEX VALUES WERE SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 31 LAKES.  THE SIZE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE WAS MADE UP OF SMALL FISH PRIMARILY (ONLY 1 CRAPPIE OVER 9.0 INCHES WAS SAMPLED). BASED ON THE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY DATA, BLB POPULATIONS APPEAR TO FLUCTUATE WIDELY IN THIS LAKE.  THE 1991 BLB CATCH INDEX (0.50 PER GN) WAS THE LOWEST RECORDED SINCE THE 1960 SURVEY.  THE LMB SPRING ELECTROFISHING INDEX WAS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER SPICER AREA LAKES.  ALL SIZE-CLASSES FROM 5 - 20 INCHES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE.  GROWTH RATES WERE SLOW FOR AGES 1-5 (POSSIBLE REASONS DISCUSSED EARLIER).  THERE APPEARED TO BE A LOWER NUMBER OF LMB GREATER THAN 17 INCHES THAN WAS EXPECTED.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO NATURAL MORTALITY OR HARVEST OF THE QUALITY- TROPHY SIZE BASS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Elkhorn Lake was conducted in late-June of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nElkhorn is a small lake (87 acres) with low productivity located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 41 feet. Invasive species recently found in Elkhorn include Eurasian Watermilfoil (2017) and Zebra Mussel (2018.). Water quality and clarity are excellent for Elkhorn. Water clarity was 13.0 feet deep in June 25, 2018. Dissolved oxygen was less than 5.00 ppm below 21 feet on June 25, 2018. Total phosphorus (0.018 ppm) was low in Elkhorn during June of 2013. Water levels were normal during the 2018 resurvey. Residential development (41 homes) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of the northwest shore area. A new second tier housing development has occurred along the south portion of the lake during the last fifteen years. Hardwoods are present in moderate numbers along the east and north shoreline areas. There are six small inlets/springs that periodically flow into Elkhorn. The largest inlet connects to a small wetland and flows into the lake along the east shore. The second largest inlet drains State Highway #23 road runoff into Elkhorn. Direct agricultural row crop drainage into the lake is limited by upstream buffers and wetlands. Emergent vegetation (i.e. hardstem bulrush) is limited to the shallow outlet bay. Submergent vegetation species (i.e. clasping-leaf pondweed, bushy pondweed, flat-stemmed pondweed, northern milfoil, sago pondweed, coontail, muskgrass, filamentous algae, etc.) are frequently occurring in the littoral area and especially in the shallow outlet bay area. Eurasian Watermilfoil was not found in the 2018 standard vegetation transects. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, rubble and boulder. Elkhorn is known for good Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Northern Pike fishing.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers (post spawn) were abundant (276.92 fish/hour) in the 2018 late-June night electrofishing survey. The 2018 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.26 pounds and 7.3 inches) from spring electrofishing. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush. Largemouth Bass growth rates were below average. The 2016 year class comprised 44% of the 2018 Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2018 (1.40 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (1.76 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie numbers were low in the 2018 gillnets (0.67 fish/gillnet). The Black Crappie average size was small (0.20 pounds and 7.2 inches) from trapnets. Black Crappie adults (480 fish, 120 pounds) were last stocked into Elkhorn during 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2018 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (5.77 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Northern Pike average size was small (2.55 pounds and 22.0 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.99 pounds from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (28.0 inches and larger) Northern Pike was low (0.67 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike growth rates were below average for ages 1-4, but average for older fish. The 2015 and 2014 year classes each comprised 33% of the Northern Pike captured in the 2018 survey nets. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Elkhorn Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were absent in 2018 gillnets. Low numbers of Yellow Perch (0.20 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2018 trapnets. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rates are 17.55 fish/gillnet and 0.73 fish/trapnet. The Yellow Perch average size was small (6.3 inches and 0.11 pounds) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not captured in the 2018 gillnets. Low numbers of Walleye (0.40 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2018 trapnets. Walleye were not captured in gillnets or trapnets during 2013. The Walleye historical catch rates are 0.39 fish/trapnet and 0.98 fish/gillnet. The Walleye average size was moderate (1.46 pounds and 16.4 inches) from trapnets. Walleye natural reproduction is low or nonexistent due to lack of suitable spawning habitat in Elkhorn. Walleye are stocked into Elkhorn as a bonus species for local anglers. Recent Walleye stockings include 2010 (91 yearlings, 100 pounds), 2013 (400 yearlings, 206 pounds), 2014 (158 adults, 155 pounds; 247 fingerlings, 28 pounds), 2015 (97 adults, 121 pounds), 2016 (167 adults, 258 pounds; 111 fingerlings, 3 pounds), 2017 (196 adults, 392 pounds) and 2018 (7 adults, 21 pounds; 813 yearlings, 101 pounds; 30 fingerlings, 2 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2018 (21.80 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 80.32 fish/trapnet. The 2018 Bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.15 pounds and 5.5 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was low (1.60 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were below average for ages 1-5, but average for older fish. The 2015 year class comprised 47% of the 2018 total Bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species captured included low numbers of Hybrid Sunfish (5.20 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (1.60 fish/trapnet) and Green Sunfish (0.20 fish/trapnet). The 2018 average lengths were 6.4 inches, 5.9 inches and 4.8 inches for Hybrid, Pumpkinseed and Green Sunfish respectively. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2018 (0.40 fish/trapnet). The 2018 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.27 pounds and 13.0 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.70 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2018 trapnets included low numbers of Common Carp (0.20 fish/trapnet) and moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead (2.60 fish/trapnet). The Elkhorn historical average catch rates were 0.58 Common Carp/trapnet and 1.43 Yellow Bullhead/trapnet. The 2018 average weights were 1.90 pounds and 0.77 pounds for Common Carp and Yellow Bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elkhorn Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Elkhorn Lake fishery is scheduled for resurvey in the 2023 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elkhorn is a small, moderately deep, and moderately productive lake located in KandiyohiCounty. The Elkhorn shoreline has been completely developed for residential housing in thelast few years. Submergent vegetation is moderately abundant within the shallow areas ofElkhorn Lake. Emergent vegetation (i.e. bulrush) is extremely rare in Elkhorn. Fishingpressure is relatively low in Elkhorn Lake. Anglers generally seek northern pike, largemouthbass, bluegill, or black crappie on Elkhorn. Stunted bluegill were removed from Elkhornduring 1994 (4,430 fish), 1993 (8,935 fish), and 1992 (8,101 fish).     Largemouth bass were abundant (79.66 fish/hour) in the 1999 spring electrofishingsurvey. The 1999 largemouth bass average size was moderately large (11.88 inches). Largemouthbass growth rates appeared average.     Northern pike were also abundant (10.67 fish/gillnet) in 1999. The 1999 northern pikeaverage size was moderately large (23.96 inches, gillnets). Northern pike growth ratesappeared average.     Yellow perch numbers were low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the historicalaverage (27.14 fish/gillnet). The 1999 yellow perch average size was small (6.06 inches,gillnets).     Bluegill were abundant (111.80 fish/trapnet) in 1999 compared to similar lakes, butcomparable to the historical average (102.46 fish/trapnet). The 1999 bluegill average sizewas small (4.91 inches, trapnets). Bluegill growth rates were within the normal ranges forsimilar lakes. There were no black crappie captured in either the trapnets or gillnets during1999. The historical average catch rates for black crappie were 2.35 fish/trapnet and 2.95fish/gillnet.     Walleye numbers were low (1.33 fish/gillnet) in 1999. The 1999 walleye average size waslarge (20.36 inches, gillnets). Intensive large walleye fingerling stockings took placeduring 1993 (9,082 fish, 614 lbs.), 1992 (7,605 fish, 585 lbs.), and 1991 (4,178 fish, 584.5lbs.) in an attempt to increase predation on small bluegill to improve bluegill sizestructure. It did not work, so walleye stocking was discontinued. Three of the four walleyecaptured in the 1999 Elkhorn survey were from the stocked years of 1993 and 1992.     It appears that largemouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike numbers were abundant inElkhorn during 1999. Northern pike average size in 1999 was moderately large, but the lackof forage fish (yellow perch) may limit future growth rates in Elkhorn. Largemouth bassaverage size was also moderately large in Elkhorn. Although the bluegill average size wassmall, growth rates were normal. Selective bluegill removal (fish < 6 inches) by the DNR maybe necessary to promote better bluegill growth rates. It appears that the intensive walleyestockings during the early 1990's were unsuccessful in producing a strong walleye year classin Elkhorn. Black crappie stocking will be considered for Elkhorn when numbers are low. TheDNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor adult fish populations by summer testnetting and spring electrofishing in order to evaluate current management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Elkhorn Lake was conducted in Mid-June of 2013. Elkhorn is a small lake (87 acres) with low productivity located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 41 feet. Water quality and clarity are excellent for Elkhorn. Water clarity was 9.9 feet deep in June 10, 2013. Dissolved oxygen was less than 1.00 ppm below 20 feet on June 10, 2013. Total phosphorus (0.018 ppm) was low in Elkhorn during June of 2013. Water levels were normal during the 2013 resurvey. Residential development (41 homes) has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of the northwest shore area. Hardwoods are present in moderate numbers along the east and north shoreline areas. There are six small inlets/springs that periodically flow into Elkhorn. Direct agricultural row crop drainage into the lake is limited by upstream buffers and wetlands. Emergent vegetation (i.e. hardstem bulrush) is limited to the shallow outlet bay. Submergent vegetation species (i.e. clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, sago pondweed, coontail, muskgrass, filamentous algae, etc.) are frequently occurring in the littoral areas and especially in the shallow outlet bay area. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, rubble and boulder. Elkhorn is known for good largemouth bass, bluegill and northern pike fishing.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (161.25 fish/hour), but the average size was small (0.54 pounds and 9.64 inches) in the 2013 spring electrofishing. The Elkhorn historical average catch rate and weight is 93.80 fish/hour and 1.14 pounds respectively. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>15 inches) largemouth bass was low (2.78 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2011 year class comprised 26% of the 2013 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Other moderate largemouth bass year classes captured in the 2013 spring electrofishing included 2010 (19%), 2009 (21%) and 2008 (21%). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2013 (0.67 fish/trapnet) compared to area lakes and similar state wide lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 1.80 fish/trapnet. The black crappie average size was moderately large (0.55 pounds and 9.34 inches). The 2008 black crappie year class accounted for 50% of the 2013 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults (480 fish, 120 pounds) were recently stocked into Elkhorn during 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (6.50 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range of similar lakes. The Elkhorn historical average catch rate is 6.05 fish/gillnet. The 2013 northern pike average size was moderately large (3.90 pounds and 25.12) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.03 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was high (2.50 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were generally near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. Approximately 31% of the northern pike captured in the 2013 nets were from the 2010 year class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (19.30 fish/gillnet). The yellow perch average size was moderate (6.25 inches and 0.10 pounds) during 2013. The yellow perch historical average length is 5.74 inches for Elkhorn. Yellow perch growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2009 year class comprised 67% of the 2013 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not captured in gillnets or trapnets during 2013. The walleye historical catch rates are 0.39 fish/trapnet and 1.08 fish/gillnet. Recent walleye stockings include 2004 (1,956 yearlings, 163 pounds), 2006 (44 adults, 50 pounds; 150 yearlings, 75 pounds), 2008 (110 yearlings, 11 pounds), 2010 (91 yearlings, 100 pounds) and 2013 (400 yearlings, 206 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2013 (25.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2013 bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 6.02 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>6 inches) bluegill was good (12.50 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but and within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2006 and 2008 year classes comprised 29% and 23% respectively of the 2013 total bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species captured included moderate numbers of hybrid sunfish (7.83 fish/trapnet), pumpkinseed sunfish (3.50 fish/trapnet) and green sunfish (1.17 fish/trapnet). The 2013 average lengths were 6.87 inches, 5.89 inches and 6.11 inches for hybrid, pumpkinseed and green sunfish respectively. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2013 (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2013 black bullhead average size was large (1.37 pounds and 13.02 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.63 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2013 trapnets included low numbers of carp (0.17 fish/trapnet) and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead (1.33 fish/trapnet). The Elkhorn historical average catch rates are 0.61 carp/trapnet and 1.31 yellow bullhead/trapnet. The 2013 average weights are 11.58 pounds and 0.73 pounds for carp and yellow bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elkhorn Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Elkhorn Lake fishery is scheduled for resurvey in the 2018 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elkhorn is a small lake (87 acres) with moderate fertility. It has a maximum depth of41 feet and shoreline length of 1.25 miles. Submergent vegetation was very dense in theshallows and was found as deep as 20 feet. Emergent vegetation species and densities werelimited. There are only a few small stands (< 5 feet square) of hardstem bulrush. Waterclarity was moderate. Total phosphorus levels were low (0.016 ppm). The shoalwater substratesconsisted of mostly mixtures of sand, silt, marl, and gravel. There are three small inletswhich drain marshlands and agricultural crops. The outlet culverts (rising metal stand pipeculvert, and a 1 foot corrugated culvert) are located in a small lagoon along the east shore.These culverts may allow small numbers of fish to leave Elkhorn during high/moderate waterlevels. However, small numbers of fish (northern pike) may also move into Elkhorn from AlvigSlough/Green Lake during high water when the 1 foot culvert outlet may connect to Alvig. Therise of the standpipe culvert prohibits fish movement into Elkhorn from Alvig. Thesurrounding watershed is mostly mixed hardwoods and residential areas (Spicer) with smallareas of agricultural row crops. The shoreline is mostly mixed hardwoods with some grasslandsand moderate shoreline development (23 homes). Historically, growth rates for most fishspecies (especially largemouth bass and bluegill) have been below average. Intensive removalof stunted adult sunfish species has been on going the past ten years in order to improvegrowth rates. Also, heavy predator stocking of large numbers and sizes of walleye fingerlingsoccurred three consecutive years (585 lbs in 1991, 585 lbs in 1992, 614 lbs in 1993).     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (272.2 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (6.1 - 46.6fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and the highest recorded value (historical average=100.9fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size (4.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wassimilar to the historical average (5.0 inches). The largest bluegill caught was 7.7 inches.Growth rates appear below average. There is a strong 1990 year class present. It appears thatintensive bluegill removal over the past ten years has not produced increased bluegill growthrates or reduced population numbers.      Black crappie abundance in 1994 (1.7 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.7 -3.4 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (2.7 fish/trapnet). The1994 average size (7.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was the highest recordedvalue (historical average=7.1 inches). Growth rates appear slightly below average.     Largemouth bass catch rate in 1994 was moderate/good (38.3 fish/hour), but below the1991 survey (65.2 fish/hour). The population size was estimated as 531 fish (> 8 inches) bya mark/recapture study in 1991. The greatest numbers (74.5% of total) and sizes of largemouthbass were captured along the east shore and in the lagoon during the 1994 survey. The 1994average size (1.5 lbs, 12.7 inches) was above the 1991 survey (1.1 lbs, 11.4 inches). Thelargest fish caught electrofishing in 1994 was 20.9 inches. Growth rates appear slightlybelow average. About 82% of the fish captured were at least five years of age.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.5 -10.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to the historical average (2.9 fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (3.1 lbs) was also similar to the historical average(3.2 lbs). The largest fish caught was 30.5 inches. Growth rates appear moderate. It appearsthat northern pike spawning success is rather sporadic because no fish were captured from1991 or 1992 year classes.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (0.7 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (1.3 - 5.0fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 and below the historical average (1.6 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (10.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historicalaverage (16.8 inches). The largest fish captured was 22.0 inches. About 86% of the walleyecaptured were from the 1993 stocked year class. The walleye catch rate during springelectrofishing was good (42.0 fish/hour, average size=7.9 inches), however these fishappeared weak and dying after being released. There were many local reports of anglerscatching walleye fingerlings during the past several years. Although, large numbers and sizes(about 585 lbs per year between 7.1 - 14.8 fish/lb) of fingerlings were stocked from 1991-1993, it appears that these stockings have been unsuccessful.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (31.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.4 -43.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and comparable to the historical average (31.5fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (6.1 inches) was the same as the historical average.Growth rates appear slightly below average. Most of the fish captured were from the 1991 and1990 year classes.     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (0.3 -3.2 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (1.8 fish/trapnet). The1994 black bullhead average size (10.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was abovethe historical average (8.3 inches). Yellow bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.7 fish/trapnet) wasbelow the normal range (1.3 - 9.8 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to thehistorical average (0.8 fish/trapnet). The 1994 yellow bullhead average size (9.7 inches fromgillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly above the historical average (9.1 inches).     The small watershed area that directly drains into Elkhorn makes it ideal for potentialsuccesses for water quality rehabilitation through the implementation of best land managementpractices. In recent years (1985-1994), the water quality has begun to decline (increasedalgae blooms and filamentous algae growth), due in part to a new culvert line installed in1985 to drain excess water from the southeast. There were reports of excessive algae bloomsand submerged vegetation growth following this diversion in 1985. The major flow of thisculvert line was later diverted to Alvig Slough. Previous surveys have indicated thatsubmerged vegetations densities were less abundant prior to 1981. Historically, the bluegillpopulation has been dominated by stunted fish even with intensive removal efforts. Thepresent removal approach (timing, numbers and sizes removed) appears ineffective for bothreducing bluegill numbers and increasing the average size. One option is to apply a differentremoval approach that would postpone harvest after the peak spawning/hatching while releasinglarger bluegill (> 5.5 inches) and increasing the harvest of smaller bluegill (< 5.5 inches)during the later removal period. This approach may favor sustaining larger and geneticallysuperior bluegill while allowing the removal of smaller and potentially genetically inferiorfish. Other options include reducing submergent vegetation densities in addition to somepredator protection (experimental regulations for largemouth bass). It appears that intensivewalleye fingerling stocking (numbers and sizes) has been unsuccessful in improving bluegillgrowth rates as originally planned. Presently, both largemouth bass and northern pikepopulations appear to be in favorable shape with good numbers and average sizes. However,northern pike natural reproduction appears rather sporadic from the year classes capturedduring the 1994 survey. Stocking of winter rescue northern pike may be an option duringsuccessive years of poor natural reproduction. Quality largemouth bass (> 15 inches) arepotentially vulnerable to overfishing, especially since the largemouth bass present inElkhorn appear to be slower growing and the majority are older fish (> 5 years of age).Important habitat work should include transplanting hardstem bulrush around the lakeshore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Elkhorn Lake was conducted in late June of 2008. Elkhorn is a small lake (87 acres) with low productivity located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 41 feet. Water quality and clarity are excellent for Elkhorn. Water clarity was 12.5 feet deep in June of 2008. Dissolved oxygen was above 4.00 ppm from the surface down to 27 feet deep during late June of 2008. Residential development has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of the northwest shore area. A new second tier housing development has occurred along the south portion of the lake during the last ten years. Hardwoods are present in moderate numbers along the east and north shoreline areas. A small wetland flows into the lake along the east shore. Direct agricultural row crop drainage into the lake is limited. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) species is limited adjacent to an entrance of the shallow outlet bay. Submergent vegetation and silt are abundant in the shallow outlet bay area. Submergent vegetation densities (various pondweed species) have been historically abundant in the lake. Elkhorn is known for good largemouth bass and northern pike fishing. Elkhorn is managed primarily for largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were abundant (109.18 fish/hour) in the 2008 spring electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.78 fish/hour) and above the Elkhorn historical average (80.31 fish/hour). The 2008 largemouth bass average size was moderate to small (0.92 pounds and 10.83 inches) from spring electrofishing. The Elkhorn historical average weight is 1.25 pounds for largemouth bass from spring electrofishing. The catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (13.77 fish/hour) in 2008. Largemouth bass growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2003 year class comprised 28% of the 2008 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2008 (0.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Elkhorn (25th=0.33, 50th=1.40, 75th=1.67 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 1.92 fish/trapnet. There were no black crappie captured in the 2008 gillnets (2.30 fish/gillnet historical average). The black crappie average size was moderate (0.45 pounds and 8.76 inches) from trapnets. All black crappie captured in the 2008 resurvey were from the 2005 year class. Black crappie adults (574 fish) were stocked into Elkhorn during 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (7.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Elkhorn Lake (25th=2.33, 50th=4.00, 75th=7.50 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 6.00 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was small (2.30 pounds and 20.93 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.93 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (3.50 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. Approximately 38% of the northern pike captured in the 2008 nets were from the 2004 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were not captured in 2008 (0.00 fish/gillnet). The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 21.17 fish/gillnet. The yellow perch historical average length is 5.62 inches for Elkhorn. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2008 (0.50 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rates are 0.43 fish/trapnet and 1.20 fish/gillnet. There were no walleye captured in the 2008 gillnets. The 2008 walleye average size was large (4.38 pounds and 22.13 inches) from trapnets. Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The three walleye captured in 2008 nets were from the 2005, 2000 and 1998 year classes. Intense walleye stocking took place from 1991-1993 with large fingerlings. However, fish surveys in 1994 and 1999 indicated relatively low numbers of adults, although locals did report some success catching walleye during the late 1990\u0019s. Recent walleye stockings include 2004 (1,956 yearlings, 163 pounds), 2006 (44 adults, 50 pounds; 150 yearlings, 75 pounds) and 2008 (110 yearlings, 11 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (54.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Elkhorn Lake (25th=53.88, 50th=64.83, 75th=111.80 fish/trapnet), but above the normal range for similar lakes. The 2008 bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.23 pounds and 6.30 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.10 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (36.76 fish/trapnet) in 2008. The catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was also high (6.99 fish/trapnet) in 2008. The largest bluegill captured was 9.13 inches in 2008. Bluegill growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but above the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2002 and 2001 year classes comprised 37% and 31% respectively of the total bluegill catch in the 2008 nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Elkhorn Lake (25th=0.20, 50th=0.60, 75th=4.00 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The 2008 black bullhead average size was large (1.27 pounds and 12.93 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.54 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2008 trapnets included low numbers of carp (0.17 fish/trapnet) and yellow bullhead (0.50 fish/trapnet). The Elkhorn historical average catch rates were 0.66 carp/trapnet and 1.31 yellow bullhead/trapnet. The 2008 average weights were 4.63 pounds and 1.12 pounds for carp and yellow bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elkhorn Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Elkhorn Lake fishery is scheduled for resurvey in the 2013 spring and summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Elkhorn Lake was conducted in June of 2003. Elkhorn is a small (87 acres) and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 41 feet. Residential development has occurred around the entire lake with the exception of the northwest shore area. The east and south shore areas have been developed extensively within the last ten years. Hardwoods are present in moderate numbers along the east and north shoreline areas. A small wetland flows into the lake along the east shore. Direct agricultural row crop drainage into the lake is limited. Significant runoff (three inch rain event) was deposited into Elkhorn via a culvert draining State Highway 23 during the four-lane construction project on June 24, 2003. A state public access is located along the east shore. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) species are present in Elkhorn only adjacent to an entrance of the shallow outlet bay. Water quality and clarity are excellent for Elkhorn. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically abundant in the lake. Water levels were normal during the spring and summer, but low by the fall of 2003 due to drought conditions. Elkhorn is known for good largemouth bass and northern pike fishing. Largemouth bass numbers were high (86.67 fish/hour) in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey and above the Elkhorn historical average (67.4 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.59 pounds and 13.3 inches) from the 2003 spring electrofishing survey. The catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass was high (27.5 fish/hour) in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates in Elkhorn were near the low end of normal ranges for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. Black crappie numbers were low in 2003 (0.5 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 2.1 fish/trapnet. The 2003 black crappie average size was small (0.20 pounds and 7.2 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie adults (574 fish) were stocked into Elkhorn during 2000. Northern pike numbers in 2003 (18.5 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.8 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size was small (1.98 pounds and 20.6 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.01 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (6.5 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Elkhorn were generally within or above the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 88% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 survey nets were from the 2001 year class. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (0.5 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 23.8 fish/gillnet. The 2003 yellow perch average length was 4.6 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined. Walleye numbers were low in 2003 (0.2 fish/trapnet, 0.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rates are 0.4 fish/trapnet and 1.4 fish/gillnet. Intense walleye stocking took place during 1991-1993 with large sized fingerlings. However, fish surveys in 1994 and 1999 following the stockings indicated relatively low numbers of adult walleye present, although locals did report some success catching walleye during the late 1990's.Bluegill numbers in 2003 (64.8 fish/trapnet) were high compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2003 bluegill average size was small (0.06 lbs. and 4.4 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.08 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was low to moderate (8.3 fish/trapnet) in 2003. Bluegill growth rates in Elkhorn Lake were generally near the low end of the normal ranges for ages 1-8 compared to area lakes. The 2000 year class comprised 58% of the total bluegill catch in the 2003 survey nets. Black bullhead numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (6.5 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2003 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.55 pounds and 9.0 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.44 pounds from trapnets.Other fish species of special interest captured in the 2003 trapnets included moderate numbers of carp (0.8 fish/trapnet) and yellow bullhead (5.0 fish/trapnet). The historical average catch rates were 0.7 carp/trapnet and 1.4 yellow bullhead/trapnet. Current fish management activities on Elkhorn Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Elkhorn Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Elkhorn Lake was conducted in late-June of 2023. Survey methodology and gears used to sample the Elkhorn fish population included six standard trapnets, two large frame trapnets and June night boat electrofishing. Gillnets are an optional survey gear for lakes under 100 acres. Gillnets were not set in Elkhorn during the 2023 survey. Two large frame trapnets (5 X 6 feet) were set in place of gillnets during 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nElkhorn is a small lake (87 acres) with low productivity located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 41 feet. Invasive species recently found in Elkhorn include Eurasian Watermilfoil (2017) and Zebra Mussel (2018.). Water quality and clarity are excellent for Elkhorn. Water clarity was 24.0 feet deep on June 26, 2023. Dissolved oxygen was less than 5.00 ppm below 25 feet on June 26, 2023. Total phosphorus (0.023 ppm) was low in Elkhorn during late June of 2023. Water levels were below normal during the 2023 survey. Residential development (41 homes, 2013 survey) has occurred around the entire lake except for the northwest shore area. A new second tier housing development has occurred along the south portion of the lake during the last fifteen years. Hardwoods are present in moderate numbers along the east and north shoreline areas. There are six small inlets/springs that periodically flow into Elkhorn. The largest inlet connects to a small wetland and flows into the lake along the east shore. The second largest inlet drains State Highway #23 road runoff into Elkhorn. Direct agricultural row crop drainage into the lake is limited by upstream buffers and wetlands. Emergent vegetation (i.e. hardstem bulrush) is limited to the shallow outlet bay. Submergent vegetation species (i.e. clasping-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, sago pondweed, coontail, muskgrass, filamentous algae, etc.) are frequently occurring in the littoral area (less than 15 feet deep) and especially in the shallow outlet bay area. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, rubble and boulder. Elkhorn is known for good Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Northern Pike fishing. Walleye are occasionally caught mostly during early winter ice fishing. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers (post spawn) were moderate (56.92 fish/hour) in 2023 mid-June night electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass numbers (post spawn) were abundant (276.92 fish/hour, 7.31 inches average length) in the previous 2018 late-June night electrofishing survey. The 2023 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.54 pounds and 9.71 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2023 catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches plus) Largemouth Bass was low (3.08 fish/hour). Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush. Largemouth Bass growth rates are historically slow in Elkhorn compared to other Spicer area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low (0.67 fish/trapnet) from standard trapnets in 2023. The Black Crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 1.67 fish/trapnet. The Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.41 pounds and 8.81 inches) from standard trapnets. The Black Crappie catch rate was 4.00 fish/net with an average size of 8.06 inches from large frame trapnets. Black Crappie adults (480 fish, 120 pounds) were last stocked into Elkhorn during 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was low from large frame trapnets (0.50 fish/net) in 2023. The 2023 Northern Pike average size was small (1.45 pounds and 18.76 inches) from large frame trapnets. Northern Pike abundance in 2018 gillnets (3.00 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average catch rate of 5.77 fish/gillnet. The 2018 Northern Pike average weight and length were 2.55 pounds and 21.95 inches respectively from gillnets. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Elkhorn in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were absent in 2023 and 2018 surveys. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rates are 17.55 fish/gillnet and 0.67 fish/trapnet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low in the 2023 standard trapnets (0.33 fish/trapnet), but moderate in the large frame trapnets (10.00 fish/net). The Walleye average size was small (0.77 pounds and 12.90 inches) from large frame trapnets. Walleye sizes ranged from 10-17 inches from the large frame trapnets. These fish were probably from previous yearling/adult stockings. The Walleye historical catch rates are 0.39 fish/trapnet and 0.98 fish/gillnet. Walleye stockings include 2010 (91 yearlings, 100 pounds), 2013 (400 yearlings, 206 pounds), 2014 (158 adults, 155 pounds; 247 fingerlings, 28 pounds), 2015 (97 adults, 121 pounds), 2016 (167 adults, 258 pounds; 111 fingerlings, 3 pounds), 2017 (196 adults, 392 pounds), 2018 (7 adults, 21 pounds; 813 yearlings, 101 pounds; 30 fingerlings, 2 pounds), 2020 (15 adults, 30 pounds; 115 yearlings, 76.5 pounds), 2021 (72 adults, 114 pounds), 2022 (210 yearlings, 84 pounds) and 2023 (10 adults, 16 pounds; 96 yearlings, 58 pounds). Walleye are stocked in Elkhorn as a put and take type fishery. Walleye are occasionally caught during early winter ice fishing. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (16.33 fish/trapnet) in 2023 standard trapnets. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 74.99 fish/trapnet. Bluegill were moderately abundant (33.50 fish/net) in the 2023 large frame trapnets. The 2023 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.86 inches) from standard trapnets. The Bluegill average size was large (0.32 pounds and 7.14 inches) from the 2023 large frame trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from standard trapnets. The 2023 Bluegill standard catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) was low (2.17 fish/trapnet) from standard trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were slow for ages 1-3, moderate for ages 4-5 and good for ages 6-8. The 2019 year class comprised 34% of the 2023 Bluegill standard trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species captured included low numbers of Hybrid Sunfish (3.33 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (2.33 fish/trapnet) and Green Sunfish (0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2023 standard trapnets. The 2023 average lengths were 6.00 inches, 5.48 inches and 2.56 inches for Hybrid, Pumpkinseed and Green Sunfish respectively. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was low (0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2023 standard trapnets. The 2023 Black Bullhead average size was large (1.28 pounds and 13.07 inches) from standard trapnets. Low numbers of Black Bullhead were caught in the large frame trapnets (3.00 fish/net, 0.81 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2023 standard trapnets included low numbers of Common Carp (0.50 fish/trapnet) and Yellow Bullhead (1.33 fish/trapnet). The Elkhorn historical average catch rates were 0.57 Common Carp/trapnet and 1.42 Yellow Bullhead/trapnet. The 2023 average weights were 7.34 pounds and 0.74 pounds for Common Carp and Yellow Bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Elkhorn Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Elkhorn Lake fishery is scheduled for resurvey in the 2028 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
