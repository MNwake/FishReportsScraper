Anglers can gain access to the lake shore through the park. Boats are not allowed on the lake. Bluegill were the most abundant species sampled during the survey. Their numbers are considered to be average for this type of lake. The average size bluegill was 5.33 inches in length. Pumpkinseed sunfish were also found in average abundance. Their average length was 4.78 inches. Black crappies were found to be in low abundance. The northern pike population is at the highest level since 1979. The average size sampled was 21.7 inches in length. Walleyes are not very abundant in Sucker Lake. Only 2/gill net were sampled. These are most likely fish that have swam upstream from East Vadnais Lake. Largemouth bass were found in low numbers however this species is not effectively sampled in trap nets or gill nets. Yellow perch were found in higher abundance than past surveys. The average size was smaller than what anglers prefer. Yellow bullhead were sampled in the highest rate since the 1984 survey. Individuals exceeding 13 inches were found. Carp, bowfin, and brown bullhead were also caught during the survey but in low numbers.    </p>",

Hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed were present in lower numbers with few fish of sizes to interest anglers.  Black crappie numbers were low with fish of small size.  Yellow bullhead numbers were average for this type of lake with one-fifth of the fish over 12 inches.  Black bullhead numbers were low, much lower than inprevious assessments.Walleye numbers were average with one-pound fish commmon.  Northern pike numbers were low with all fish sampled small in size.  Largemouth bass numbers were below average with none of acceptable size to anglers.  Electrofishing was not done to assess the largemouth bass population.Yellow perch, white sucker, bowfin (dogfish), carp, and golden shiner were all sampled in low numbers.</p>",
