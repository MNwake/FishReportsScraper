                "narrative": "<p>     Latimer Lake is a eutrophic or fertile lake in Todd County whose fish community is dominated by small black crappies and black bullheads.  Water clarity has been an issue in the lake with heavy algae blooms being common by mid-July and lasting until fall.  The lake does support gamefish species such as largemouth bass, northern pike, and wallye as well as bluegills which provide angling opportunities.  \n     The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye with black crappie and bluegills being secondary management species.  Walleye fingerlings typically are stocked in odd-numbered years and numbers appear to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  With the poor water clarity through the summer, night fishing for walleye is probably not necessary.  Anglers who do hook into a walleye are likely to catch a nice one as the walleye caught in the summer survey averaged around 4 pounds.   Northern pike numbers have increased since the last survey which may have a negative impact on the recruitment of the walleye fingerlings to the adult population.  Yellow perch numbers also showed a decrease from the last survey likely due to the higher pike numbers.   Anglers should continue to harvest small northern pike which are more abundant and release those over 24 inches in length to help the fish community balance.\n     Black crappies do well in turbid water and are right at home in Latimer Lake.   Numbers are well above those found in lakes of similar type and small fish dominate the population.  Few of the crappies caught in the summer survey were over 9 inches in length due primarily to poor growth rates.  Bluegill numbers were also high but the size structure of the population may be more appealing to anglers.  Average size of the fish caught was about 6.5 inches with a fair number over 7 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish are also present but most of them were under 6 inches in length.  Largemouth bass are present in low numbers and provide limited opportunity for anglers but some large fish do exist.\n     The black bullhead population has been historically high and is an indicator of the poor water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with turbid water.  Few of the fish sampled were over 9 inches in length with 7 - 8 inches being the most common size.  Some brown bullheads were also caught but were much lower in abundance than the black bullheads.  Some of the brown bullheads did reach lengths of almost 12 inches.   \n     Neascus or black spot was common on yellow perch, northern pike, and pumpkinseeds caught in the survey.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Filleting the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested by neascus.\n     Water quality problems in Latimer Lake likely result from a combination of factors which include an agricultural watershed, heavy development along the west shore, and inlake nutrients.  Shoreline buffers along the inlets and the lakeshore would help to filter some of the incoming nutrients from the watershed and lawns.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Latimer Lake is a 203 acre lake located about two miles south of Long Prairie. The lake is very fertile and algae blooms are common throughout the summer and into the fall. Curly leaf pondweed, a noxious weed, is common throughout much of the shallow areas and can form mats at the surface making fishing difficult in some areas. There is a public access with boat ramp on the northeast corner of the lake.  <br> \n    <br> \nThe present status of the fishery can be described as affording decent fishing for Northern Pike, Walleye and Largemouth Bass. Neither of these species is present in high abundance but there are good-sized individual fish for all three. Pike up to 30.5 inches, Walleye up to 24.6 inches and Largemouth Bass up to 16.7 inches were sampled in 2019. Bluegill and Black Crappie are present in good numbers but are on the small side and fishing quality may be better if done in late-April through late May to avoid poor water-quality conditions. Black Bullheads unfortunately comprise the majority of the fish biomass in Latimer Lake. They can be caught but are not typically regarded as good to eat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Laitimer Lake is a reflection of the its watershed use. The lake is in an agricultural area and has a history of summer algae blooms. Black bullheads have always been abundant which is typical of a fertile lake. Walleye abundance is low and all the fish sampled in nets were less than twelveinches.  Larger walleye up to 29 inches were observed during spring electrofishing.  The population has been maintained primarily through natural reproduction in thepast.  Annual fry stocking  since 1993 has shown limited success.  The northernpike are at normal levels for the lake type, but few fish over 24 inches weresampled.  Laitimer Lake has a high population of small black crappies with anaverage size of around seven inches.  The bluegill population has remainedrelatively stable.  Average size is about five inches, but fish over seven incheswere sampled.  There is a good population of yellow perch with a fair number offish being over 7.5 inches.  The expanded perch population should provide a goodprey base for the walleye and northern pike.     Probably the most noticeable feature of Laitimer Lake is the algae blooms insummer.  Better land practices by lake shore owners and area farmers would need tobe implemented to improve the water quality and fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>         Latimer Lake is a eutrophic or fertile lake in Todd County whose fish community is dominated by Northern Pike, small Black Crappies, and Black Bullheads. Water clarity has been an issue for the lake with heavy algae blooms being common by mid-July and lasting until fall. The lake does support gamefish which provide angling opportunities, species such as Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye as well as Bluegills.  <br> \n        The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye with Black Crappie and Bluegills being secondary management species. Walleye fingerlings typically are stocked in odd-numbered years and while numbers appear to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes, the catch rate was below the management goal. With the poor water clarity through the summer, night fishing for Walleye is probably not necessary. Anglers who do hook into a Walleye are likely to catch a nice one as the average size caught in the summer survey was about 3 pounds. Northern Pike numbers have increased since the last survey which may have a negative impact on the recruitment of the Walleye fingerlings to the adult population.  Despite the higher numbers, some nice sized pike were observed in the survey up to 33 inches.  Average size for the pike in the survey was 22 inches or 2.5 pounds although the fish did show slow growth rates.  Anglers should continue to harvest small Northern Pike which are more abundant and release those over 24 inches in length to help the fish community balance.  <br> \n        Yellow Perch numbers are within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes but higher numbers could benefit both the Northern Pike and Walleye.  Perch can be an important prey species for the two predator species plus higher numbers could help reduce pike predation on Walleye fingerlings.   Black Crappie can become abundant in turbid lakes and this is the case in Latimer. Numbers are well above those found in lakes of similar type and small fish dominate the population. Few of the crappie caught in the summer survey were over 9 inches in length due primarily to poor growth rates. A reduction in abundance through fishing or natural means will be required to improve the size structure of the crappie population.  Bluegill numbers were also high but the size structure of the population may be more appealing to anglers. Average size of the fish caught was about 6 inches with few over 7 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also present but most of them were under 6 inches in length. Largemouth Bass are present in low numbers and provide limited opportunity for anglers but some large fish are present. <br> \n        The Black Bullhead population has been historically high acting as an indicator of the poor water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with turbid water.  Although the average size was under 9 inches some Black Bullhead up to 12 inches were observed.   Some Brown Bullhead were also caught but were much lower in abundance than the Black Bullhead. Some of the Brown Bullhead did reach lengths of almost 13 inches. Neascus or black spot was common on Yellow Perch and Northern Pike, as well as a few Walleye caught in the survey. Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish. The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns. Filleting the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest. Humans cannot be infested by neascus.  Some of the Yellow Perch also were infested with yellow grub. <br> \n      Water quality problems in Latimer Lake likely result from a combination of factors which include an agricultural watershed, heavy development along the west shore, and in-lake nutrients. Shoreline buffers along the inlets and the lakeshore would help to filter some of the incoming nutrients from the watershed and lawns. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Latimer Lake July 23 and 24 of 2019 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted August 19-22.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 10 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.  Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.  The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.  Latimer Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 4 for comparative scoring and evaluation.  FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 28 which is below the impairment threshold of 38 suggesting impairments to the lake from human activities.  These results indicate that the lake is in poor health based on the low FIBI score which falls below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  No species considered intolerant of habitat disturbance was sampled.  Two tolerant fish species were sampled (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish).   Bluegill and Black Crappie made up a majority of the catch in near shore seining, while Black Bullhead were most numerous in the electrofishing efforts.  Black Bullhead were the most numerous species in the gill nets and were also dominant in terms of biomass.  Bluegill were the most abundant species in the trap nets and also accounted for the most biomass.   Golden Shiners were the only minnow/cyprinid species observed.    <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Latimer Lake is a borderline eutrophic lake in Todd County that has a reputation for providing good walleye, crappie, bluegill and northern pike fishing in some years.  The 2001 assessment documented low populations of walleye and northern pike and high populations of black crappie and bluegill.  The lake typically has high turbidity from heavy algae blooms caused by high nutrient loading from the surrounding watershed.  The lake has historically had a high black bullhead population that is targeted by some anglers.    Walleye abundance is low despite a change in management strategy from fry stocking to fingerling stocking in 1997.  Walleye from three different year classes were sampled in the lake and ranged from 19.4 to 25.6 inches.  Large walleye are present in the lake and angler reports suggest fishing for this species can be good in spring and summer.  Several large walleye were reported caught in July of 2001 before this assessment.  The present population is the result of both natural reproduction and stocking of walleye fry and fingerlings.  Future fingerling stockings should provide good angling opportunities in coming years as yellow perch prey are at high levels and northern pike abundance is at an all time low.  Northern pike in high numbers can be a detriment to walleye management by reducing yellow perch abundance and by direct predation on stocked fingerlings.    Conversations with anglers during the 2001 assessment revealed that winter angling for northern pike has been popular in recent years with some large individuals being caught.  Pike were sampled in very low numbers in the assessment and average size (23.4 inches) was fairly large.  Northern pike growth was fast and probably a result of the existing healthy yellow perch prey base.  Maintaining pike at low population levels will aid in establishing a higher walleye population and a stable, healthy yellow perch population.  Anglers should continue to harvest small northern pike and release fish over 24 inches in length.    Black crappie show consistent recruitment on Latimer Lake and catch rates are historically above lake class means.  Growth rates for this species were normal to slow, however, and keepers over nine inches were rare.  Historically, crappie angling was popular in winter.  Few angling reports have been received in recent years and probably reflect the existing undesirable size structure of this species.  Bluegill abundance (59.44 per trapnet) was high when compared to similar lakes and was dominated by the 1997 year class.  Growth rates were normal to slow which is a change from previous surveys when growth rates were fast.  It is unknown why the growth rate changed but may be due to concurrent high populations of competing bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegills over seven inches (keeper size) were not sampled in this assessment and few angling reports have been received.    The black bullhead population has been historically high, and bullheads were extremely abundant in both gillnets and trapnets during this assessment.  Black bullheads are a popular target for some local anglers and past commercial harvest has generated negative comments.  Largemouth bass are present in low numbers and provide limited opportunity for anglers.  Some very large individuals are present.  High turbidity due to algae blooms probably limits reproductive success of bass.  Past surveys typically documented high yellow perch abundance in Latimer Lake and this assessment was no exception.  Yellow perch provide a stable, abundant prey base for walleye and northern pike, assuring fast growth for these predator species.</p>",

Pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish and bluegills are present with bluegills being the dominant sunfish at four times the state average numbers but below average size.  Largemouth bass are present in average numbers and size.  Black crappies are present in above average numbers and average size with a fair year class about every other year.  Yellow perch seem to be at the highest levels recorded for the lake and at about 3 times the state average.  The walleye fingerlings and yearling stocking of 1970 - 1976 provided some fair walleye fishing and apparently some natural reproduction.  Most of the walleyes captured were naturally reproduced.</p>",

Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 64.9 (?3.5) out of 100 possible. Approximately 89 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 61.5 (?3.3), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 93.3 (?3.8).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Latimer Lake was conducted on July 8-9, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including none that are intolerant of disturbance and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net data from an August 2019 survey and trap net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
