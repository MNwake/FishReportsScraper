Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. The dissolved oxygen did not reach 3.0 mg/L or less throughout the profile, and therefore there was sufficient oxygen from the surface to the bottom of the lake at the time of sampling. Since no TDO3 value can be calculated, the lowest dissolved oxygen level recorded was 3.3 ppm at 5.5?C (41.9?F) which was found at the deepest depth of the profile (91.9 feet). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Lake Trout. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Trout was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Daniels Lake is a native Lake Trout lake where Walleye and Northern Pike have rarely or never been taken in surveys, or by anglers.  Smallmouth Bass were first found in this lake in 1979, and have since provided some good summer fishing, producing fair numbers of larger fish.  From 1941 through 1996 Lake Trout were frequently and sometimes regularly stocked, but stocking was discontinued after 1996 because it appeared that natural reproduction alone could sustain the Lake Trout population and fishery.  Daniels Lake is one of the Grand Marais area's most heavily fished Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Lake Trout lakes, and anglers have typically enjoyed good success.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current (2015) lake management plan for Daniels Lake set long-range goals for Lake Trout of maintaining a naturally produced population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set (in deep and shallow sets combined), with some fish over 25 inches present.  The plan's long range goals for Smallmouth Bass were maintaining a minimum gill net catch of 0.7 fish/set (deep and shallow sets combined), with some fish over 16 inches present.  This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2015 plan to determine whether the Lake Trout population could meet the long range goal with no stocking. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout numbers appeared to have been relatively high in 2018, with many natural year classes contributing to the catch.  Results of this survey indicated the Lake Trout population in this lake could sustain itself with no need for stocking.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (7.67 fish/set) was the second-highest ever seen in Daniels Lake, and was well above average for a lake of this type.  With just one exception, all of the Lake Trout taken in this survey had been produced naturally since 1996, when the lake was last stocked.   Fifteen year classes contributed to the catch, including one fish that was determined, fairly confidently,  to have been 52 years old (34.3 inches in length).  Two recent year classes (2015 and 2016) appeared to have been relatively strong, and no year classes from 2003 through 2016 were missing from the catch.  Lake Trout growth appeared to have been relatively slow.  Fish reached a mean length at the end of their sixth year of 14.5 inches, compared to an area average of 16.2 inches.  Slow growth was likely due to the lack of any cold-water forage species (reliance on an invertebrate diet), coupled with high competition between Lake Trout in this relatively dense population.  Smallmouth Bass likely competed for near-shore forage fish that might otherwise have been seasonally available to Lake Trout. <br> \n <br> \nAs has been the case in recent surveys, the 2018 Smallmouth Bass catch (0.44 fish/set; deep and shallow combined) fell short of the goal from the 2015 plan, and no bass over 16 inches in length were taken.  Management of a non-native species like Smallmouth Bass in a wilderness lake like Daniels has generally been given a low priority, particularly when a high-value native species like Lake Trout is also present.  Smallmouth Bass will likely remain present in Daniels Lake, and will continue to provide good summer fishing opportunities, but it is unlikely we will take any steps to improve their numbers or size. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of Burbot, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch in 2018 were similar to past catches in this lake, which have typically been low.  Although some larger Yellow Perch were present, their numbers were likely too low to offer much fishing opportunity. <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",
