                "narrative": "<p>Haskell is a small lake located 15 miles north of Bovey, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Haskell Lake has relatively clear, hard water and moderate productivity.  Haskell is part of a chain of lakes including Scrapper and Balsam.  Small boats are able to navigate between the lakes through a shallow channel. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 lake management plan listed Northern Pike as a primary management species due to angler interest and habitat suitability.  The lake is also well suited to Black Crappie, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass and these were considered secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in July 2016 to collect updated information on the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most abundant fish in the gill nets.  The catch was well above the typical range for lakes with similar habitats.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 6.6 to 13.2 inches and averaged 10.1 inches.  Tullibee in Haskell Lake are probably not targeted often by anglers, but are important as a prey base for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in numbers comparable to the previous survey and lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was favorable for anglers; sampled pike ranged from 18.2 to 32.3 inches and averaged 26.4 inches and 4.6 pounds.  Nine year classes were represented, indicating regular natural reproduction.  Growth was considered average, with pike averaging 25.7 inches after six years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch was higher than expected compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor as only one crappie exceeded 10 inches.  Black Crappie ranged from 4.7 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Five year classes were identified but age 2 and 5 fish made up the majority of the sample, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was slower then the  lake class average; crappie averaged 8.0 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was typical for lakes with similar habitats and average for Haskell Lake.  Size structure was moderate; only three fish exceeded eight inches although 42% of the sample exceeded seven inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Nine year classes were identified indicating regular natural reproduction.  Growth was average compared to similar lakes with Bluegill averaging 6.4 inches after six years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nA few quality sized Largemouth Bass were captured in the test nets.  Largemouth Bass averaged 18.4 inches from gill nets and 17.0 inches from trap nets.  Electrofishing would provide better information on the bass population, but a low bridge over the access channel prevents access to the lake with an electrofishing boat. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Rock Bass and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
