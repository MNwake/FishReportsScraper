Average length was 21.6\", with 22% in the protected 22-26\" slot.  Some larger Northern Pike are present with 27% measuring at least 26\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in high numbers in gill nets (5.0/net), and average numbers in trap nets (3.0/net).  Average length was 9.2\" in gill nets and 8.8\" for trap net sampled fish.  For both gears combined 89% were at least 8\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average number at 12.2/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with and average length of 5.6\", with only 6% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a rate of 72.0/hr run time. Average length was 12.6\", with 71% at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets at 3.3/net.  Average length was 13.0\".   <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Partridge, but they are in the area.

The bluegill structure is poor with one 1 of the 212 bluegills sample greater than 7.0 inches. Growth is slow. The yellow perch population has declined drastically since being stocked as adults in 1982 and 1983. The gillnet CPUE in 1984 was 12 fish/net while only 0.2 fish/net in 1987. No walleyes were sampled during the survey. The white sucker, yellow bullhead and largemouth bass populations are average for the lake group, while the pumpkinseed and black crappie populations are lower than average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Partridge Lake is a 187 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 42', located three miles north of Garrison in Crow Wing County.  Partridge is in the Rum River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 10-31, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other sampling site.  Fifteen species were sampled, including 4 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Iowa Darter.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 31-August 2, 2023, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",
