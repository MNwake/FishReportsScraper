                "narrative": "<p>Big Rice Lake is a 633 acre lake on the Turtle River Chain with a maximum depth of 13 feet. It is upstream of Kitchi and Little Rice lakes and is accessible via the Turtle River from either upstream or downstream.  The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped wetland with an abundance of bog and marsh.  Big Rice is primarily managed for Northern Pike followed by panfish and Walleye. Walleye fry are stocked on alternating years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Big Rice is highly dependent on seasonal migrations. A total of 11 Walleye were captured in 2019 resulting in a catch rate just short of 3 fish/net which is typical for this type of lake. Lengths ranged from 10 to 25 inches and averaged just over 18 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is likely more residual than the Walleye population.  A total of 21 pike were captured in 4 nets resulting in a catch rate of about 5 fish/net. Pike lengths ranged from 13 to 27 inches and averaged about 20 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are fairly abundant with 146 fish captured in trap nets.  Size quality is excellent with fish over 10 inches in length present.  The Bluegill in Big Rice grow relatively fast, reaching lengths over 7 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured in good abundance.  Perch larger than 11 inches were observed and average size was just short of 8 inches. The perch population appears to have remained relatively stable over the past decade or more. <br> \n</p>",
