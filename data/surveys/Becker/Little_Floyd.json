                "narrative": "<p>Little Floyd Lake with its physical and chemical makeup, is best suited for bass, panfish, and northern pike.  Consequently, those species are abundant in the lake.  However, other fish species like walleye and tullibee are also present in significant number.  Although walleyes are currently stocked on a regular basis, net catches were actually higher during the 1960s, when walleyes were not stocked in Little Floyd.  Fisheries personnel are not able to say for certain that walleyes were reproducing naturally because of better spawning habitat in Little Floyd thirty years ago.  It is quite possible that walleyes migrated into the lake from Big Floyd, which was being periodically stocked with walleye fry at that time.It is clear that Little Floyd and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  In its 1995 report, the Pelican River Watershed District (PRWD) urged that \"best management practices\" be followed.  Increasing concern has been expressed by the PRWD, Floyd Shores, Inc., and by individual landowners over recent water chemistry changes.  Individuals from both Big and Little Floyd help monitor these changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations  and asking advice about how to achieve water use goals without sacrificing water quality, fish communities and, eventually, property values.  Guides are available for riparian owners who desire to alter shoreline areas while doing the least harm to the lake.The diverse fish community in Little Floyd Lake currently reflects relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads.  There are tullibees present.  Tullibees require dissolved oxygen in the cool water of the thermocline, not possible in highly polluted lakes.  There is an average population of larger than normal walleyes in the lake compared to ecologically similar lakes.  There are large numbers of small northern pike and bluegill.  There are largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin, white sucker, and rock bass present in Little Floyd.  Still, the lake is small enough to be vulnerable to additional nutrient input and sedimentation.</p>",

A short inlet channel from Big Floyd Lake is present under C.S.A.H. #21, on the northwest shore of the lake.  An outlet, which is partly county ditch #12, is present on the southeast shore.  This outlet is one of the major headwater tributaries of the Pelican River.  The surrounding watershed is gently rolling, partially wooded farm land.Shoreline development is quite heavy, with 3 resorts with 19 cabins, and 66 private home and cabins present.At the time of the survey, the lake was quite clear.  However, later on in the summer algal blooms may cause some turbidity.Emergent aquatic vegetation was common along the undeveloped shoreline areas, and submerged vegetation was moderately abundant along the entire shoreline.A large variety of fish were taken in the test nets, with common suckers, northern pike, walleyes, bullheads, sunfish and rock bass being taken in highest numbers.Spawning conditions were considered fair to good for the gamefish species present.Local residents reported that fishing in general has been fair to good in recent years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff on Little Floyd Lake (03038600) on July 12, 2016.  Little Floyd Lake is 205 acres, located 4 miles north of Detroit Lakes, MN.  During this survey, 1 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with either a 50-foot or a 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this survey, four sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and three were was sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish, including five species intolerant of disturbance and/or poor water quality.  Intolerant species sampled were Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Redbelly Dace, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Floyd Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Floyd Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater and coolwater species like bullheads, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye, but also coldwater species like cisco (tullibee), which require cool, well-oxygenated water.  The average size of the abundant northern pike was small (1.5 pounds) but there were also some larger pike present.  Although northern pike have not been stocked in the lake for twenty years, the availability of good pike spawning habitat keeps numbers high.Test net catches of walleye nearly tripled since 1996 to a level that was near the all-time high for Little Floyd (9.0 walleyes per gill net in 1967).  Although walleyes are periodically stocked in this lake, most of the recent increase in abundance was due to natural reproduction, as was the case during the 1960's.  The relatively young walleye population now present in Little Floyd (most are from the non-stocked 1997 year class) averaged just under a pound each in 2001.Largemouth bass and panfish were also fairly plentiful.  The abundant bluegills averaged much smaller in 2001 than in 1978, when over 30% of them were larger than eight inches.  Average length of bluegills sampled in 2001 was 6.3 inches, but a few over 9.0 inches were still found.  Black crappie, while less abundant, averaged nearly 10 inches in length.Fish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Little Floyd Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  In its 1995 report, the Pelican River Watershed District (PRWD) urged that \"best management practices\" be followed.  Increasing concern has been expressed by the PRWD, Floyd Shores, Inc., and by individual landowners over recent water chemistry changes.  Individuals from both Big and Little Floyd help monitor these changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents lik bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  In addition, anglers can help sustain fish populations by voluntarily reducing their harvest of medium and large size fish.The diverse fish community in Little Floyd continues to reflect relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads, a species that is favored by turbid water.  There are cisco present, a species which requires dissolved oxygen in the cool water of the lower thermocline (not possible in highly polluted lakes).  In addition, there are good numbers of catchable-sized walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 14, 2016 by Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including a few that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Little Floyd Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Otter Tail River watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Floyd Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater and coolwater species like bullhead, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye, but also coldwater species like cisco (tullibee).  Tullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality.  Significant declines in catch rates of these species can signal problems with water quality.  Although net catches of cisco in 2011 declined, this species was still present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike has been in effect on Little Floyd lakes since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.  Although pike population shifts are not always easy to detect after eight years of a regulation, there are some indicators that the regulation is having a positive impact on the size structure of northern pike in this lake.  For example, the average length of sampled pike was longer in 2011 (22.0 inches) than in any of the nine previous studies since 1967.  The portion of pike smaller than 24 inches was also smaller than at any time in the past.  Hopefully, these pike will grow to trophy sizes in the near future and opportunities will exist to catch fish over 30, or even 36 inches.  With the presence of cisco, this lake has the potential to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked regularly in this lake.  Some limited natural reproduction also takes place.  Walleyes are a modest part of Little Floyd's fishery, and catch rates have not been high historically.  However, in 2011 walleye catches were higher than during any assessment since 1967 at 8.8 per set.  The mean walleye size was a very nice 17.1 inches in length and 2.1 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and panfish remained plentiful.  The abundant bluegills averaged smaller in 2011 than in 1978, when over 30% of them were larger than eight inches in length. However, bluegill sizes have improved somewhat since the last study.  The average length of bluegills sampled in 2011 was 6.5 inches and several over 8.0 inches were found.  Black crappies were sampled most effectively by spring electrofishing.  Generally speaking, they were not as abundant as the bluegills.  The average crappie size was 9.7 inches, but a couple over 11 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Little Floyd Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (premature aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  In its 1995 report, the Pelican River Watershed District (PRWD) urged that \"best management practices\" be followed.  Increasing concern has been expressed by the PRWD, Floyd Shores, Inc., and by individual landowners over recent water chemistry changes.  Individuals from both Big and Little Floyd help monitor these changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition, anglers can help sustain fish populations by voluntarily reducing their harvest of medium and large-sized fish and by complying with special fishing regulations.  Remember for example, it takes over nine years to grow an eight-inch bluegill in Little Floyd Lake.  With traditionally high rates of northern pike recruitment in Little Floyd, anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (those under 24 inches) to help balance the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Floyd Lake is a 215-acre lake located in southwestern Becker County just north of the city of Detroit Lakes. The lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and receives heavy recreational use and fishing pressure from the surrounding area. Zebra mussels were discovered in Big Floyd Lake, upstream of Little Floyd Lake, in 2018. Little Floyd Lake provides angling opportunity for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Little Floyd Lake in June 2021.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked into Little Floyd Lake annually at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre. Despite stocking, the catch rate of Walleye in 2021 was only two Walleye per gill net. Walleye sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 15.1 to 24.6 inches, averaging 19.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Little Floyd Lake. During the 2021 survey a record high catch rate of roughly 31 pike per gill net was observed. Beginning in 2003, a special regulation (all pike from 24 to 36 inches must be released, daily limit 3, only one pike over 36 inches allowed) was put in place with the goal of improving size structure of pike in the lake.  Pike sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 11.6 to 35.3 inches, averaging 20.4 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Bluegill in Little Floyd Lake were relatively high between 1996 and 2006, and have since declined. Catch rates dropped from 49 fish per trap net in 2011 to approximately 17 fish per trap net in 2021.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged in length from 3.2 to 8.2 inches, averaging 5.4 inches long. Approximately 1% of Bluegill in trap nets were eight inches or longer. Age structures show that Bluegill do not reach eight inches until they are about nine years old. <br> \n <br> \nFew Black Crappie have been sampled during fisheries surveys in Little Floyd Lake. In 2021, a total of 15 crappie were sampled in combined gears ranging in length from 5.1 to 10.8 inches. Four Largemouth Bass were caught in trap nets, ranging in length from 13.2 to 17.2 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch rate of Yellow Perch in 2021 was about two perch per net, slightly higher than the previous survey (2016). Sampled perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 5.9 inches, averaging 5.5 inches long. Additional species sampled in 2021 included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and White Sucker. Although documented in previous surveys, no Cisco were caught during the 2021 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain and improve Little Floyd Lake's fishery by practicing selective harvest of fish, as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habit in the lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving native aquatic vegetation stands intact.  </p>",

YEBS ARE ALSO VERY ABUNDANT AND MAY HAVE POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING.  THE GILLNET CATCH OF WAES INCREASED SOMEWHAT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE POPULATION.  THEY REMAIN AT A MODERATELY LOW LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THIS LAKE CLASS.  YEP, SURPRISINGLY, IN VIEW OF THE NOP ABUNDANCE, APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  THE PRESENCE OF TLC AS AN ALTERNATE FORAGE BASE FOR NOP MAY ENABLE YEP TO REBOUND PERIODICALLY.  NO LMB WERE TAKEN IN TEST NETS BUT YOY WERE FOUND DURING SHORELINE SEINING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Floyd Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater and coolwater species like bullhead, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye, but also coldwater species like cisco (tullibee).  Tullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality.  Significant declines in catch rates of these species can signal problems with water quality.  Fortunately, this has not yet occurred in Little Floyd.  Net catches of cisco in 2006 remained strong and somewhat higher than the lake's historic average at 4.3 per net. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike has been in effect on both Floyd (including the north basin) and Little Floyd lakes since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.  Although population changes are not always easy to detect after just three years of a regulation, there are some indicators that the regulation is having an impact on the size structure of northern pike in this lake.  For example, the average length of sampled pike was longer in 2006 (20.9 inches) than in any of the eight previous studies since 1967.  Another measure used to define size structure is the proportional stock density (PSD).  For pike, this is simply the percent of stock (sexually mature) fish at least 21 inches in length.  In Little Floyd in 2006, the northern pike PSD was higher than any previously recorded at 50%.  The previous high PSD was 35% and the lake's historic mean is just 22%.  Hopefully, these pike will grow to trophy sizes in the future and opportunities will exist to catch fish over 30, or even 36 inches.  With the presence of cisco, this lake has the potential to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked regularly in this lake.  Some very limited natural reproduction does take place.  Walleyes are a modest part of Little Floyd's fishery, and catch rates have not been high historically.  In 2006, catches were down from the previous survey to 2.2 per net.  The mean walleye size was a very nice 18.7 inches in length and 2.3 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and panfish remained plentiful.  The abundant bluegills averaged much smaller in 2006 than in 1978, when over 30% of them were larger than eight inches in length. The average length of bluegills sampled in 2006 was just 5.4 inches and very few over 8.0 inches were found.  Black crappies were sampled most effectively by spring electrofishing.  Generally speaking, they were not as abundant as the bluegills.  The average crappie size was 9.5 inches, but a couple over 12 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Little Floyd Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (premature aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  In its 1995 report, the Pelican River Watershed District (PRWD) urged that \"best management practices\" be followed.  Increasing concern has been expressed by the PRWD, Floyd Shores, Inc., and by individual landowners over recent water chemistry changes.  Individuals from both Big and Little Floyd help monitor these changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  In addition, anglers can help sustain fish populations by voluntarily reducing their harvest of medium and large size fish and by complying with special fishing regulations.  However, with traditionally high rates of northern pike recruitment in Little Floyd, anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (those under 24 inches) to help balance the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was completed on Little Floyd Lake in 2016, beginning on June 20, 2016, using standard survey gear, including gill nets and trap nets.  Little Floyd Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater and coolwater species like bullhead, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye, but also coldwater species like Cisco (Tullibee).  A special regulation for Northern Pike has been in effect on Little Floyd Lake since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population in Little Floyd Lake is higher than the historical average.  Mean length of pike sampled during the 2016 assessment was 20.8 inches.  The percentage of pike sampled that were larger than 24 inches (13.4%) is less than sampled during the 2011 assessment, but still above historical average.  After 13 years, the pike population shows indications of improvement in the size structure of the population, but the results are not dramatic.  The average length of sampled Northern Pike has increased with the regulation in place, and there have been more Pike over 24\" Pike present than before the regulation was in place.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality.  Significant declines in catch rates of coldwater species can signal problems with water quality.  Tullibee catch rates have declined during the last three surveys, and are currently at a historical low catch rate of 0.17 per gill net.  One Tullibee was sampled in 2016, with a length of 16.7 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually in Little Floyd, and some limited natural reproduction may occur.  Walleyes are a modest part of Little Floyd's fishery, and catch rates have been within normal range of lakes with similar characteristics.  In 2016, Walleye catch rates were near the historical average for the lake, at 5.0 per net.   Average length of fish sampled in 2016 was 16.0 inches, and fish up to 23.5 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rates were above the historical average for Little Floyd, with an average length of 10.7 inches.  The Bluegill catch rate has declined since the population peak in 2006.  The current catch rate of 31.9 was below the historical average for Little Floyd.  Average size of Bluegills sampled was 5.5 inches, and some fish over 9 inches are present.   Trap net catch rates of Black Crappie were near the historical average for Little Floyd, with 0.33 fish per net.  The average crappie size was 8.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Little Floyd Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (premature aging), due to high surface runoff and increased nutrients coming into the lake.  Following shoreland regulation established by the DNR, PCA, Becker County, and the Pelican River Watershed District can help ensure that the water quality and overall health of Little Floyd Lake withstands the environmental pressure within the watershed.   <br> \n</p>",
