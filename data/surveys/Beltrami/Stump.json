                "narrative": "<p>Stump Lake is a 290-acre impoundment of the Mississippi River located approximately four miles downstream of Lake Bemidji in Beltrami County.  The maximum depth is 24 feet but most of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Most of the shoreline of the lake is in private ownership.  There is no direct Public access to Stump Lake.  Most boaters access Stump Lake via the Mississippi River from Lake Bemidji.  This stretch of the river has a no-wake limit to boat speed, which makes the four mile trip from Lake Bemidji an hour-long boat ride.  Stump Lake is a popular destination for canoeists, accessing from Lake Bemidji, traversing the Mississippi to Stump Lake and exiting by portage around the Ottertail Power Dam off of CSAH 12 (four miles east of Bemidji).  There is a remote campsite on Stump accessible by canoe.  Anglers who make the effort to access Stump Lake often find it worthwhile, as accessibility tends to keeps fishing pressure at low levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Stump Lake consists of panfish (including black crappie), northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, largemouth bass, walleye, muskellunge, sucker/redhorse and bullhead species.  There are no special regulations implemented on Stump Lake, and statewide fishing regulations apply to all species. <br> \n <br> \nResults of the 2011 Stump Lake population assessment show a good bluegill population with the trap net  catch rate (21.5/TN) approaching the upper quartile value for class 35 lakes (28.1/TN).  Average size was 7.7 inches in length and 0.41 pounds, which is very respectable.  The size distribution of the catch shows a good proportion of the population over 8 inches in length, and a majority of the catch between 7 and 8 inches in length.  These fish should provide good angling opportunity in the near future.  The absence of smaller bluegill in the assessment (< 5 inches in length) suggests that natural reproduction has been inconsistent in recent years, which is likely related to cold spring and early summer weather patterns.  This is not unusual and happens from time to time here near the northern limit of this species' distribution.  Growth rates for bluegill have slowed somewhat from the last assessment (2001) but are still comparable to other class 35 lakes in the area.  Growth rates tend to fluctuate with population density and slow as the population level increases, which has been the case in Stump Lake.  Stump Lake bluegill are capable of reaching 8 inches in length at age-6, and 9 inches in length at age-9.  Bluegill can live over 10 years.  The 2011 population assessment also turned up large pumpkinseed sunfish (up to 8 inches in length) and hybrid (bluegill X pumpkinseed) sunfish up to 9.5 inches in length in good numbers.  Stump Lake contains diverse and high quality fish habitat for sunfish, such as abundant aquatic vegetation, bulrush, and fallen trees. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at 0.9/TN in 2011, which is above the third quartile value for lake class (0.7/TN) but below the historic average of 1.2/TN.  Historically, black crappie have never been present in high numbers in Stump Lake, but the population has provided consistent fishing through the years with quality-size fish.   Black crappie captured in 2011 had an average length of 10.4 inches, with fish up to 11.3 inches in length present in the sample.  As with sunfish, habitat for black crappie in Stump Lake is very good, although the amount of deepwater habitat, which crappie utilize extensively throughout the year, is relatively small. <br> \n <br> \nStump Lake has a reputation for producing quality largemouth bass fishing.  Bass are a primary management species, along with bluegill and black crappie.  No assessment of the bass population was conducted in 2011, but previous assessments have documented a good size structure and large fish present.  Virtually the entire lake is quality bass habitat, and bass anglers should find no shortage of spots or potential fishing techniques.  As with most Bemidji area lakes, fishing pressure for largemouth bass on Stump Lake is low to moderate, and bass anglers can often have the lake to themselves. <br> \n  <br> \nAlthough not considered a high quality walleye lake, Stump Lake does hold a population of walleye and likely benefits from its direct connection to Lake Bemidji, which is one of the best walleye lakes in the area.  Trap net catch rates for walleye (0.4/TN) were above the first quartile value for lake class (0.25/TN).  Walleye captured in the 2011 assessment had a large average size of 24.1 inches in length and 4.6 pounds/fish.  Trap nets tend to catch walleye at night, and their presence in the catch indicates that walleye are actively cruising shallow shoreline areas after dark.  The inundated channel of the Mississippi River, with its drop offs and sharp outside bends provides some of the best walleye habitat in Stump Lake, although there are numerous rock outcroppings and walleye will often utilize weedlines in the summer and early fall. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population of Stump Lake is currently being impacted by very low densities of yellow perch, which are a primary forage species for pike.  Pike captured in the 2011 assessment were thin and in poor condition.  Hopefully yellow perch abundance in Stump Lake will rebound in the near future and help to bolster the beleaguered pike population. <br> \n <br> \nNo muskellunge were captured in the 2011 assessment, but muskellunge are known to be present in Stump Lake.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stump Lake is in class 35, a group of about 45 lakes, with primary distribution through north-central Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes included in this group are Rabideau, Gull, Big and Little Bass and Moose Lake, south of Shevlin.  Typically lakes in this class are very irregular in shape and have a high percentage of littoral area (less than 15' deep).    Stump Lake is a riverine system and lies about two and one-half miles downstream from Lake Bemidji so the fish community can be influenced by river flows.  Access is from Lake Bemidji or a private access owned by Otter Tail Power Company off County Road 12.    Walleye are present, but abundance is below that of most comparable lakes.  Walleye present are probably migrants from adjacent Lake Bemidji.    Northern pike abundance has increased and the average weight of 2.1 pounds (21 inches) makes them attractive to some anglers.  More than half of the pike examined had Neascus (black spot).    Yellow perch are also abundant but with an average size of seven inches and about one-fifth pound they are probably not attractive to anglers.  Most perch also have Neascus (black spot).    Three species of bullheads are present with yellow the most abundant and largest, followed by brown and black bullheads.    Black crappie abundance has fallen considerably over the past three years based on angling/fishing reports although a few crappies near one-half pound are still available.    Largemouth bass abundance was not as high as expected possibly due to weather conditions during the assessment.  An average length of about 13 inches can be attractive to anglers.  The largest bass sampled was 19 inches in length.    Bluegill abundance is also low but with a mean weight of nearly one-half pound (7.5 inches) they are attractive to anglers.    Other panfish species, including pumpkinseed, rock bass and hybrid sunfish, are present though not abundant.    Muskellunge are present as migrants from Lake Bemidji though none were sampled in 1996.    Other species found in Stump Lake would include suckers, redhorse, burbot (eelpout) and tullibee (cisco).     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stump Lake is a 290-acre rservoir with a maximum depth of 24 feet created by a power dam on the Mississippi River.  The dam is located four miles east of Lake Bemidji with impoundment effecting the entire stretch of river back to the outlet of Lake Bemidji. There is no direct public access on the lake, but boats can navigate down stream from Lake Bemidji.  Although Stump Lake is closely connected to Lake Bemidji, their fish communities are      quite different.In 2001 northern pike were very abundant which was typical of past assessments.  Pike  ranged in length from 10 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 2 pounds.  These averages are the lowest for the past three assessments.  In 2001 there were fewer pike over 21 inches sampled compared to 1996 and 1988.  The decline in pike size is typical of a trend in many area lakes and is likely the result of angling harvest.The principle forage fish for northern pike in Stump Lake is yellow perch.  They are present in moderate numbers and range in length from 5 to 11 inches.Sunfish species are the main attraction drawing anglers to Stump Lake.  A mix of bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrids of the two species provide a very good panfish fishery.  The lake has typically maintained good numbers and quality size.  However, there does appear to be some decline in quality.  For example, in the 1979 assessment, 97% of the bluegill were eight inches or longer.  By 2001, only 15% were eight inches or longer. This reduction in quality is a result of angler harvest since anglers naturally select for the larger fish.  Bluegill in a lot of lakes have seen a reduction in quality because of over harvest.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.  Yellow and brown bullhead are both found in Stump Lake and can offer anglers some quality fishing.  Bullheads up to 14 inches were sampled.Few walleye were sampled.  Even though the connectivity between Stump and Bemidji allows for free interchange, their fish communities are distinctly different.  While the large wind swept basin of Lake Bemidji maintains an excellent walleye population, few reside in Stump Lake.  Conversely, the habitats of Stump Lake support a very good sunfish fishery while very few are found in Bemidji.  One muskellunge was sampled that was 17.2 inches long.  This was the first time that a muskellunge was sampled in Stump Lake though they are actively managed for in Lake Bemidji.Riparian development in the form of new lake homes continues to occur on Stump Lake.  Shoreline development can negatively affect water quality and can impact aquatic habitat necessary for fish at various life stages.  Undeveloped shoreline is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  Shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Stump Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Stump Lake since most of the lakeshore is privately owned.  While future shoreline development may be inevitable, there are ways to minimize disturbances to sensitive aquatic habitats.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.                </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stump Lake is a 323 acre impoundment of the Mississippi River located approximately four miles downstream of Lake Bemidji in Beltrami County. The maximum depth is 24 feet but most of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. There are no public boat ramps on Stump Lake but many access the lake via the Mississippi River from Lake Bemidji. This stretch of the river has a no-wake restriction on boat speed which results in a lengthy trip. Stump Lake is a popular destination for canoeists navigating the Mississippi to Stump Lake and exiting by portage around the Ottertail Power Dam off of County Hwy 12. There is a remote campsite on Stump available on a first come, first served basis. Anglers who make the effort to access Stump Lake often find it worthwhile, as accessibility tends to keeps fishing pressure at low levels. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass is one of the most popular species in Stump Lake. The 2022 survey only captured 8 which isn't unusual for mid-summer surveys. The largest captured was just below 16 inches in length, but they are known to achieve much larger sizes in Stump. Bass habitat is abundant as much of the shoreline is comprised of waterlily, wild rice, and various other emergent and submerged vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nA number of Black Crappie were captured during the survey with some exceeding 13 inches in length. The low angling pressure allows crappies a chance to achieve quality sizes. The deep weed lines and steep drops in Stump provide anglers the opportunity to target them while they congregate on these habitat transitions. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are present in average numbers but size quality is higher than most lakes in the area. The largest captured in 2022 was just short of 10 inches and lengths over 8 inches were not uncommon. Because of the time required to traverse the river, Stump has remained an out-of-the-way refuge for a great panfish population. <br> \n <br> \nOn occasion, Walleyes will travel downstream from Lake Bemidji but the resident population is relatively low. Few fish were captured in 2022 but lengths were measured up to almost 25 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIf you're fishing Stump Lake during the day, there is a good chance you'll encounter Northern Pike. The population is doing well and pike captured in the survey averaged over 2 lbs./fish with fish observed over 34 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was higher than the previous gill net survey and sizes have improved. About 30% of Perch measured were over 9 inches in length and the largest was over 12 inches. Perch are not only popular with anglers, but also one of the most important forage species for Walleye and pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Rock Bass, White Sucker, Bowfin, Bullhead species, and a variety of sunfish species. <br> \n</p>",
