                "narrative": "<p>Number of northern pike sampled (6.00/gillnet) was within the normal range, whereas 23.40 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for lake class 20.  These numbers result in a high mean weight of 3.9 pounds.  The density of northern pike has increased since 1961, however, the mean weight of individual northern pike remained unchanged.  The size structure (PSD=82, RSD-P=27) is indicative of a large-sized northern pike population.  Few northern pike are less than 21 inches and most (80%) are > age 6.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, averaging only 16.19 inches at age 4.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests low and inconsistent recruitment.Pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, black crappie and yellow perch catch rates were all within the normal ranges for this class of lakes.  Pumpkinseed and yellow perch were not sampled prior to 1992 and densities of largemouth bass and black crappie have remained stable.  No fish of these species reach their respective preferred lengths, even though quality-length fish are abundant (pumpkinseed PSD=50, black crappie PSD=77).  The small size structures may be the result of slow growth rates.  Black crappie mean length at age 4 is 6.36 inches.  Bluegill size structure and growth rates are similar to the other panfish species (PSD=50, RSD-P=0), mean length at age 4 = 3.78 inches).  However, trapnet catch rates were above the third quartile and have been since 1961.Brown bullhead were the only other fish species sampled in Coon Lake in 1992.  Trapnet catch rates have remained within the normal range since 1961.  Golden shiner were present in 1961, however, none were sampled in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake is located in west central Hubbard County, 15 miles north of Park Rapids. Coon Lake has a surface area of 95 acres and a maximum depth of 69 feet. A county owned carry in public access is located on the North side of the lake off of Coon Lake Drive.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Coon is in Lake Class 32. Class 32 lakes are generally large, shallow, and have hard and turbid water with an irregularly shaped shoreline. Other class 32 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Gillette, Island and Skunk.  <br> \n <br> \nCoon provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of Northern Pike in Coon. Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.2 inches.  Yellow Perch are an important forage species, and were sampled in good numbers.  The Yellow Perch are generally small in size, with only one sampled over 8 inches.  Largemouth Bass size has increased recently with an average size of 13.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was on the high end of the range for similar lakes.  Average length was 5.2 inches, with fish sampled up to 8.9 inches.  Anglers can expect to find a fair number of Black Crappie also.  The average size was 7.9 inches with the largest being 9.7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Coon. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Coon Lake is located in Hubbard County, 15 miles north of Park Rapids.  Coon Lake has a surface area of 80 acres and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a county-owned, carry-in access on the north shore of the lake.  Coon Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Coon Lake is in lake class 32.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Upper Bass, Scienco (Coon), Gillette, and Skunk.Anglers can expect to find a low to moderate northern pike population composed of medium to quality sized fish.  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 24.6 inches and 3.8 lbs.  Coon Lake supports a good panfish population.  Good numbers of black crappie were found with a few larger fish present, however, most of the fish are in the 8-9 inch range.  Bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range are common, however, the number of lager bluegill (> 8.0 inches) was low.  Coon Lake also supports a good largemouth bass population.  Age analysis showed that the gamefish population in Coon Lake has very slow growth rates.  Due to its small size and slow growth rates, Coon Lake is susceptible to over-harvest of gamefish.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to maintain or improve the fishery in Coon Lake.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 69 feet, and about 68 percent of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  There are many dead willows around the shoreline indicating that the water level was somewhat lower in the past.The shoal-water soil type on this lake is of boulder-rubble, gravel, and sand.  There is a shallow marsh area on each end of the lake.During water chemistry done on July 5, 1961, there was oxygen available in a quantity to sustain fish life to about 55 feet.  Test netting indicated above-average numbers of brown bullhead, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Fair numbers of crappie and northern pike were also taken.Fishing pressure is fairly light at the present time with one to two boats noticed using the lake on the days it was surveyed.  There were six boats located at the access area, and only one cabin is located on the lake.</p>",
