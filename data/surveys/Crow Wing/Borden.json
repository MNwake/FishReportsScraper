                "narrative": "<p>Borden lake is 957 acres in size and is located one mile wast of Garrison, in eastern Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located off MN Hwy.18, along the east shore.  The lake has a maximum depth of 84 feet and about 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.Borden Lake was test netted in 1998.  Northern pike catch rates were low, when compared to similar type lakes, but were similar to results from the two previous surveys.  Size averaged 23 inches and 3.2 lbs.  Several year classes were present and growth was good.  Walleye catch remained low but similar to 1993 and 1941 catch rates.  Size averaged 21 inches and 3 lbs. The majority of walleyes in Borden probably migrated from Mille Lacs Lake.  Largemouth bass were caught in numbers which were high compared to similar lakes and when compared to catches in past nettings of Borden.  Most fish were from the 1997 year class and had good growth.  Gillnets showed that larger bass were also present in reasonable numbers.  Smallmouth bass were caught for the third netting in a row, although in rather low numbers.Black crappie numbers were typical for both similar type lakes and for Borden Lake.  Several year classes were present, in similar numbers, and growth was good.  Crappies were the most highly sought species in a recent winter season creel survey.  Bluegills were caught in numbers which were typical for Borden Lake, and similar type lakes.  Several age classes were found and growth was good.  About 7% of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.Major forage species include yellow perch and tullibee.  Yellow perch were present in low numbers in 1998, typical for the lake.  Tullibee catches were in the \"typical\" range, and similar to most past nettings of the lake.  Common carp were not sampled in 1998, suggesting they remain an insignificant, but visible, part of Borden Lake's fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Borden is a 957 acre lake located just west of Mille Lacs Lake at Garrison.  A public access is located off State Highway #18 on the northeast side of the lake.  The 11 mile shoreline contains 136 homes/cabins and two resorts with 9 cabins, 15 camper trailers, and 15 mobile homes (lake development information is from 1993).  The maximum depth is 84 feet and 32% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The aquatic plant community is diverse and consists of 53 species (1993) with muskgrass being the most common.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other species.Walleye were caught in below average numbers when compared to similar lakes (0.6/gill net).  Average length and weight were 21.5\" and 3.0 lbs.  All of the walleyes were age 8 or older and it is believed they migrated from Mille Lacs Lake.Northern pike were caught in average numbers when compared to similar lakes (3.5/gill net).  Almost half (48%) of the catch was from the 2001 year class with most of these fish measuring 17.5\" to 23.2\".  Average length and weight were 22.8\" and 2.7 lbs.  These fish were fast growing with 33% measuring 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets at above average rates (1.5/gill net).  The trap net catch rate was below average at 0.1/trap net.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 107.5/hr.  The average length of these fish was 11.2\" and 37% were 12\" or larger.  Growth was average, with 27% of the catch coming from the 2000 year class.  Smallmouth bass were captured as well.  The gill net catch showed average numbers of smallmouth at 1.0/gill net.  The average length and weight were 15.1\" and 1.9 lbs.  Of these fish, 92% were 12\" or larger.  These fish were slow growing.  Smallmouth were also caught while electrofishing, at the rate of 1.5/hr.The bluegill catch in 2003 was the lowest in four nettings, at 12.2/trap net.  Average length was 5.4\", with only 2% measuring 7\" or larger.  Growth was slow.  Bluegills were also caught in gill nets at the rate of 8.0/net.The black crappie catch rate was above average, at 3.6/trap net.  The average length was 6.3\".  Black crappies were also caught in gill nets at the rate of 3.3/net and had an average length of 7.8\".  Combining both nets showed that 35% of the fish were from the 2001 year class and 33% were 8\" or larger.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Borden Lake is a 957 acre lake located just west of Mille Lacs Lake near Garrison in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake just off highway 18.  The lake is moderately developed with 158 homes/cabins and one seasonal use camper/trailer area along 12.7 miles of shoreline (12.4 homes/mile).  The maximum depth is 84' and 32% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 52 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and pickerelweed are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 walleye catch of 1.8/gill net is average when compared to similar lakes and represents an increase over the 2003 catch of 0.6/gill net.  Average length and weight were similar to 2003 at 22.1\" and 4.0lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been increasing in abundance since 1993, though the 2008 catch of 5.1/gill net is typical when compared to similar lakes.  Average length and weight were 23.2\" and 2.8 lbs with 38% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  The 2005 and 2006 year classes (age 2 and 3) were most abundant, representing 64% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in trap and gill nets was typical of past catches on this and similar lakes, although variable in both gears.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 72/hr.  Average length of these fish was 10.1\".  Similar sampling in 2003 resulted in catch statistics of 108/hr with a mean length of 11.2\".  Smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 9/hr.  Average length of these fish was 11.9\".  Sampling in 2003 yielded 2/hr with an average length of 11.0\". <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 bluegill catch of 17.9 /trap net is the typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  However, only 4% measured at least 7\".  Black crappies were also present in average numbers with 31% measuring at least 8\". <br> \n <br> \nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Both were caught in low numbers compared to similar lakes. <br> \n</p>",

Both were sampled by night electrofishing on June 1st, with catch rates of 66.5/hr. (Largemouth) and 10.2/hr. (Smallmouth); both of these numbers were higher than the previous survey in 2014.  Average size of the Largemouth was 10.2\", with fish ranging from 4.9\" to 19.7\".  The Smallmouth Bass were a bit larger, with an average size of 15.3\" and fish ranging from 9.1\" to 19.3\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average (6.3/gill net) for this type of lake.  Most of the fish were below the 22-26\" protected slot (64%). <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked into Borden Lake, but numbers were still average at 2.4/gill net.  Size was decent too, with an average length of 21.5\" and all of the fish measuring over 14\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish have historically offered great opportunities on Borden.  In fact, new regulations were adopted in 2021 that reduce the daily possession limit to five Sunfish and five Crappies.  This year, however, size appeared to be smaller in our summer netting.  While both were still caught in average numbers, 48% of Black Crappies were 8\" or larger and only 14% of Bluegills were 7\" or larger.  Larger Black Crappies, up to 13.1\", were measured while bass electrofishing and in our spring panfish assessment (separate survey report), showing that they are still present in the system. <br> \n</p>",

The bowfin, northern cisco, white sucker, black and brown bullheads, pumpkinseed and yellow perch net catches indicate low abundance with catches below the first quartile of the region median. The northern pike population has shown very little change with slight decrease in numbers since the 1972 survey. The length frequency range was from 10.5 - 29.9, with the median size at 20.0. Year classes 1 thru 6 were present in the nets with 1 thru 4 annulus exhibiting fast growth rates 5 and 6 showing average or normal growth rates as compared to statewide averages. The black, yellow and brown bullhead populations show no change in abundance since the 1972 survey, with most of the yellow bullheads in the marketable size range. The bluegill population shows a steady increase in abundance in surveys from 1972, 1982 and 1987, with length frequency from 3.0 - 8.4 and the bulk of the population from 4.0 to 6.4 inch range. Year classes 1 thru 7 were represented in the nets, with the annulus in all classes indicating slow growth rate. The largemouth bass population remains stable, above the state median catch rates for both trap and gillnets. The net catches had year classes 1 thru 5 present for largemouth bass and the annuli indicate normal growth rates compared to statewide averages. The black crappie population was up in the net catches over the catches in the 1982 survey in both traps and gills. The length frequency was from 3.9 to 12.0 and they exhibited normal growth rates. The yellow perch net catches indicate low abundance with catch rates below the statewide median, yet the catch rates are up from the 1982 survey catch rates. The walleye net catches indicate a steady rise in abundance thru the 1972, 1982 and 1987 survey period. The catch rates indicate average populations for group 7 lakes in the Brainerd area. The length frequency was from 15.0 to 23.4 with year classes 3 thru 7 being present. The annuli indicate above average growth rates compared to the statewide average.</p>",

Bluegill numbers were also average (10.7/trap net), but size was not impressive with an average length of 5.9\" and only 19% measuring 7\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers (28.6/hr) were down from previous electrofishing surveys, but size was good with 69% measuring 12\" or larger.  Smallmouth bass were caught in lower numbers (6.1/hr), but average size was quite large at 16.3\".  All of the smallmouth were 14\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were relatively high in 2014 at 7.8/gill net.  Average size was good at 22.4\" and 30% were 24\" or larger.  The largest fish measured was 34.4\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are currently not stocked into Borden, though they may find their way in from connected Mille Lacs Lake.  They were caught at a low rate in the 2014 netting (1.2/gill net).  Average size was 21.5\". <br> \n <br> \nAbundant emergent vegetation around the lake provides spawning opportunities for many of these species and an effort needs to be made to protect it.  To help ensure these fishing opportunities exist into the future, please practice selective harvest by releasing larger panfish as well as northern pike over 24\".   <br> \n</p>",

In 1993 only black crappies were found in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Smallmouth and largemouth bass, bluegills, rock bass, yellow perch and tullibees were found in \"average\" numbers.  Northern pike, walleyes, white suckers and three bullhead species were taken in \"low\" numbers.With over 130 homes/cabins along its shoreline, protection of aquatic plants is vital.  Sand - gravel shoal areas and bulrush beds provide important spawning habitat for bass, sunfishes and perch.  Areas of wild rice and sedges provide spawning habitat for northern pike.  The large variety of aquatic vegetation provides important fish habitat and helps support the diverse fish population found in Borden Lake.</p>",

The regulations consist of a 5 fish bag limit for black crappies and bluegill.  A special trap net assessment was conducted on May 28-30, 2014 to collect data for black crappie and bluegill for comparison for theses 2 special regulation lakes.   A total of 165 black crappies were sampled, of which 76% were at least 8\" and 21% were at least 10\".  This compares to 84% and 25% respectively in the previous netting in 2011.  The average length was 9.0\" in 2014 compared to 9.1\" in the previous netting in 2011.  A total of 118 bluegills were sampled, with 72% being at least 7\" and 9% at least 8\".  This compares to 25% and 5% respectively in the previous netting in 2011.  The average length was 7.0\" in 2014 compared to 6.1\" during the netting in 2011.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Borden Lake was conducted on August 16-17, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and dense aquatic vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-one species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore were combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Borden Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Borden Lake is fully supporting aquatic life use. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Rum River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nTemperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were also collected in the deepest basin on Borden Lake on August 16, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 18 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 19.3 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 17.9 degrees C (64.2 degrees F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5 degrees C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. </p>",
