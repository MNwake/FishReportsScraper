                "narrative": "<p>The test netting on Mahnomen Lake indicated average populations of bowfin, northern pike, white sucker, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill and walleye when compared with the area medians. Low populations of black and yellow bullheads, black crappie and yellow perch were indicated by the test netting. The northern pike sample indicated age classes two thru eight were present, with the two and three year old fish comprising 73% of aged fish. Growth rates appear to be good. There were some com- plaints that all the northerns are small but it appears most are just young fish. Age classes 1 to 4 were sampled for bluegill sunfish. Ages three and four were strongest comprising 61% of fish taken. Growth rates of ages one and two were average, while ages three and four appear to be somewhat stunted. Only three largemouth bass were taken during the survey, two four year olds and a five year old. Growth rates were average. Fall 1/4 inch trap netting produced a high catch of young-of-year largemouth bass. Largemouth bass reproduction was apparently excellent in 1988. Trapnet catches indicated a low population of black crappies. Most age classes were represented with only the six year age class missing. The two, three and four year old fish have slow growth rates while the five, seven and eight year olds indicate average growth rates. A low population of yellow perch was indicated when compared to catch rates of similar lakes in the area. Age classes two thru six were represented with ages 2, 3 and 4 making up 87% of the fish sampled. Growth rates appear to be average. The walleye population was average for lake group 5 in the Brainerd area. Age classes five and six were represented and showed average growth rates.</p>",
