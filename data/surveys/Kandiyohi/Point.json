                "narrative": "<p>A summer re-survey was conducted on Point Lake in June of 2009. Point is a small (164 acres), moderately deep (32 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A small island is present in addition to numerous standing dead hardwood trees in the water due to higher water levels in recent years. An extensive winterkill occurred in Point Lake during the 1996-1997 winter due to low oxygen levels. Winterkill is generally rare for Point Lake, but it is susceptible during winters with high snowfall accumulations. Water levels were low during the 2009 summer, but returned to normal by the late fall of 2009. The immediate watershed is comprised mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, highway frontage, and 22 residential homes. There are four small inlets and one outlet to Eagle Lake. Fish movement is minimal to none between Point and Eagle due fish barriers and the steep drainage slope of the culvert. Total phosphorus was low to moderate (0.028 ppm) on June 8, 2009. Water clarity was moderate (secchi=8.00 feet) for Point Lake on July 6, 2009. Filamentous algae were abundant throughout Point Lake during 2009. Aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, bulrush, chara, coontail) was abundant throughout the lake. Shoalwater substrates were mostly silt, sand, gravel, and muck. Pelicans and cormorants are commonly observed on the lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Point Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not captured in re-survey nets during 2009. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.13 fish/gillnet. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. Adult pre-spawn black crappie were stocked during 2001 (114 fish, 38 pounds) and 2002 (158 fish, 79 pounds) in Point Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2009 (122.38 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Point Lake during early July of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nPoint is a small (174 acres), moderately deep (32 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Point is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. A small island is present in addition to numerous standing dead hardwood trees in the water due to higher water levels in recent years. An extensive winterkill occurred in Point Lake during the 1996-1997 winter due to low oxygen levels. Winterkill is generally rare for Point Lake, but it is susceptible during winters with high snowfall accumulations. Water levels were low during 2020. The immediate watershed is comprised mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, highway frontage, and 23 residential homes (2020 survey). There are four small inlets and one outlet to Eagle Lake. Fish movement is minimal to none between Point and Eagle due to fish barriers and the steep drainage slope of the culvert. Total phosphorus was low to moderate (0.028 ppm) on June 8, 2009. Water clarity was fair (secchi=5.00 feet) for Point Lake on July 15, 2020. Dissolved oxygen levels were less than 2.0 ppm in depths greater than 13 feet. Filamentous algae densities were abundant throughout Point Lake during 2020. Aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed, muskgrass \"chara\", northern milfoil, hardstem bulrush and coontail) was abundant throughout the lake in 2020. Shoalwater substrates are mostly silt, sand and gravel. Pelicans and cormorants are commonly observed on the lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Point Lake for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2020 (0.44 fish/trapnet).

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Point Lake during late June and early July of 2014. Point is a small (174 acres), moderately deep (32 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Point is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. A small island is present in addition to numerous standing dead hardwood trees in the water due to higher water levels in recent years. An extensive winterkill occurred in Point Lake during the 1996-1997 winter due to low oxygen levels. Winterkill is generally rare for Point Lake, but it is susceptible during winters with high snowfall accumulations. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 from inlets due to rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. The immediate watershed is comprised mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, highway frontage, and 22 residential homes. There are four small inlets and one outlet to Eagle Lake. Fish movement is minimal to none between Point and Eagle due fish barriers and the steep drainage slope of the culvert. Water clarity was moderate (secchi=9.00 feet) for Point Lake on June 30, 2014. Aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, bulrush, chara, coontail) was abundant throughout the lake in previous surveys. Shoalwater substrates are mostly silt, sand, gravel, and muck. Pelicans and cormorants are commonly observed on the lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Point Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not captured in survey nets during 2014 or other previous surveys except for 1978 and 1983. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.11 fish/gillnet. Adult pre-spawn black crappie were stocked during 2001 (114 fish, 38 pounds) and 2002 (158 fish, 79 pounds) in Point Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2014 (66.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 40.90 fish/trapnet. The bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.06 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of moderate sized (6.00 plus inches) bluegill (17.1 fish/trapnet) from trapnets in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (72.97 fish/hour) in a 2014 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass average size was small (0.74 pounds and 9.90 inches) from spring electrofishing. There were abundant numbers of largemouth bass 12.00 plus inches (15.68 fish/hour) and moderate numbers of largemouth bass 15.00 plus inches (8.11 fish/hour) in 2014. Largemouth bass growth rates were moderate to excellent. The 2012 year class comprised 77% of the 2014 largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2014 (4.50 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average of 4.20 fish/gillnet. The 2014 northern pike average size was moderate (4.42 pounds and 26.11 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.46 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were moderate. The 2010 year class comprised 38% of the 2014 northern pike catch. There were moderate numbers of larger sized (28.00 plus inches) northern pike (1.00 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2014 gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2014 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 4.06 fish/gillnet. The 2014 walleye average size was moderate (1.98 pounds and 16.67 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.03 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were moderate. The 2010 and 2011 year classes (stocked) comprised 64% and 36% respectively of the 2014 walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2014 (35.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 17.00 fish/gillnet. The 2014 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.12 pounds and 6.35 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 49.16 fish/gillnet. Black bullhead abundance was also low in the 2014 trapnets (0.22 fish/trapnet, 1.46 pounds average weight). The 2014 black bullhead average size was large (1.63 pounds and 14.06 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Point include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, periodic winter oxygen monitoring, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species in Point Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2019. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Point Lake during May and September of 2023 to determine the extent of winterkill and stocking success. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).\n\nPoint is a small (174 acres), moderately deep (32 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Point is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. A small island is present in addition to numerous standing dead hardwood trees in the water due to higher water levels in recent years. An extensive winterkill occurred in Point Lake during the 1996-1997 winter due to low oxygen levels. Other previous winterkills occurred during the 1974-75 and 1988-89 winters during low water years. Winterkill is generally rare for Point Lake, but it is susceptible during winters with high snowfall accumulations and low water years. Water levels were low during 2020-2023. A significant winterkill occurred during January-March of 2023 on Point Lake. High snowfall events and a prolonged winter (mid-March ice out) contributed to low winter oxygen levels in many shallow area lakes during 2023. \n\nSpring night electrofishing was conducted on 5/2/2023 to assess winterkill extent after numerous dead fish of all species was reported seen after ice out. No live fish were sampled after 15-20 minutes of electrofishing. That night we transferred 80 adult pre-spawn Largemouth Bass and 40 adult pre-spawn Black Crappie from nearby Long Lake. We transferred a total of 160 adult Bluegill (4-8 inches) and 70 adult Black Crappie (8-12 inches) to Point on 5/26/2023 and 6/1/2023 from Willmar Lake. We stocked Walleye fry (50,842 fish) on 5/15/2023. Three single frame trapnets (1/2-inch bar measure) were set on 5/30/2023 to further evaluate the fishery. A total of eight adult Bluegill, one Black Bullhead and one Green Sunfish were sampled. The adult Bluegill were assumed to be from the recent stocking of 5/26/2023. \n\nA fall electrofishing survey was conducted on 9/12/2023 to assess young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers due to the fry stocking. No YOY Walleye were observed in the fall night electrofishing survey. We observed other fish species present in the fall electrofishing survey which included ten Northern Pike (7-15 inches), three adult Largemouth Bass, numerous YOY Largemouth Bass (3+ inches), four Adult Black Bullhead (7-12 inches), 25 YOY Black Bullhead, one Yellow Perch (4 inches), five YOY Black Crappie (4 inches) and numerous YOY Bluegill (1-3 inches). Additional fish stockings occurred after the 2023 fall electrofishing survey which included Yellow Perch (1,245 fish, 143.5 pounds) and yearling Walleye (101 fish, 61 pounds).\n\nCurrent fish management activities on Point include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A standard survey will be conducted on Point Lake for all fish species in 2027. Additional targeted surveys and stockings may occur prior to 2027.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Point is a small, moderately deep, moderately productive lake located in KandiyohiCounty. Water levels were low in Point during 2000. The immediate watershed is small comparedto many other area lakes. There are three small inlets entering the lake. All three inletswere dry during the 2000 summer survey. The outlet is a high velocity culvert with a gatethat drains into Eagle Lake. The shoreline characteristics are mostly cedars and hardwoodswith some adjacent wetlands and homes. There are 23 homes on Point Lake. Submergent(muskgrass, filamentous algae, sago pondweed) and emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, reedcanary grass) stands are abundant to common in Point Lake. Shoalwater substrates were mostlysand, silt, and gravel. The water clarity was excellent (12.2 ft secchi disc) on June 12,2000. Nutrient levels were low to moderate (0.029 ppm total phosphorus) in Point. Asignificant winterkill of gamefish occurred during the 1996-97 winter. The only gamefish thatsurvived in moderate numbers from Point was yellow perch. Point Lake was restocked withlargemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, and walleye the following 1997spring through fall.     Northern pike numbers were low (1.75 fish/gillnet) in 2000 and below the historicalaverage (3.02 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pike average size was large (4.19 lbs. and25.67 inches, gillnets). The largest northern pike captured was 30.71 inches in the 2000survey nets.     Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2000 (28.25 fish/gillnet) and above the historicalaverage (13.00 fish/gillnet). The 2000 yellow perch average size was small (0.09 lbs. and5.83 inches, gillnets). The 1999 yellow perch year class comprised 75% of the 2000 yellowperch catch.     Walleye numbers were low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2000. The 2000 walleye average size wasmoderate (2.72 lbs. and 18.48 inches, gillnets). The 1996 year class (stocked as yearlingsin the spring of 1997) comprised 63% of the 2000 walleye catch. A small number of adultwalleye (85 fish at 1.0 lbs. each) were stocked into Point during the fall of 2000.     Bluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (28.44 fish/trapnet) and above thehistorical average (16.62 fish/trapnet). The 2000 bluegill average size from the trapnets wassmall (0.07 lbs. and 4.38 inches). The 1998 bluegill year class comprised 56% of the 2000bluegill catch.     Largemouth bass were abundant in the 2000 spring electrofishing survey (94.80fish/hour). The 2000 spring electrofishing largemouth bass average size was small (0.99 lbs.and 9.95 inches). The 1998 year class comprised 54% of the 2000 spring and summer surveycatch. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" largemouth bass were captured in the August2000 shoreline seine hauls (38.33 YOY/seine haul,  1.63 inches average size).     Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2000 (159.25 fish/gillnet) and above thehistorical average (69.34 fish/gillnet). The 2000 black bullhead average size was moderateto large (8.67 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined).     The gamefish populations in Point Lake have rebounded since the 1996-97 winterkill.Although, additional northern pike and walleye stocking may be necessary. The positive noteconcerning the 1996-97 winterkill was the eradication of undesirable species such as carp andgreen sunfish from Point Lake. It appears that species such as largemouth bass, yellow perch,and bluegill have adequate numbers present in Point. Black crappie were not sampled in the2000 survey. Additional black crappie stocking will be a priority during the next severalyears for Point Lake. Point Lake is scheduled for a spring electrofishing survey and a summerpopulation assessment in 2004 to determine gamefish abundance, size, and growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A WINTER KILL OCCURRED IN POINT LAKE DURING THE 1988-89 WINTER.  ONLY ONE NOP WAS CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS COMBINED IN 1992.  THE 1992 NOP GILLNET CATCH INDEX (0.20 PER GN, 0.06 LBS PER GN) WAS BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (2.84 PER GN, 6.78 LBS PER GN).  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT (0.30 LBS FROM GN) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (1.47 LBS FROM GN).  THE 1992 PMK SUNFISH TRAPNET INDEX (4.00 PER TN, 0.18 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (2.99 PER TN, 0.20 LBS PER TN) FOR NUMBERS.  THE 1992 PMK MEAN WEIGHT (0.05 LBS FROM TN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.07 LBS FROM TN).  THE 1992 YOY INDEX (0 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (15.0 PER SEINE HAUL).  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET INDEX (15.78 PER TN, 1.28 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX, BUT ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (11.57 PER TN, 1.13 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT (0.10 LBS FROM GN, 0.05 LBS FROM TN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.09 LBS FROM GN, 0.07 LBS FROM TN).  THE 1992 PSD (8) WAS BELOW THE RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (28).  THE BLG PSD'S FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS WERE VARIABLE WITH EITHER HIGH (100) OR LOW (< 19) VALUES.  THE BLG YOY INDEX (1.3 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (7.9 PER SEINE HAUL).  BLG GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1 AND 3, ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGE 2.  THE BLG AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IS COMPOSED OF FISH FROM THE 1989,1990, AND 1991 YEAR CLASSES.  THE 1991 YEAR CLASS APPEARS TO BE MODERATE TO STRONG.  THE 1992 SPRING LMB INDEX (34.18 PER HOUR, 6.69 LBS PER HOUR) APPEARS AVERAGE FOR NUMBERS, BUT BELOW AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO LOCAL AREA LAKE.  THE 1992 SUMMER LMB TRAPNET INDEX (4.78 PER TN, 1.78 PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (1.27 PER TN, 0.50 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT (0.37 LBS FROM TN, 0.20 LBS FROM EF) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE FOR TRAPNETS (0.57 LBS). GROWTH RATES APPEAR ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-4 AND 6, AVERAGE FOR AGE 5.  THE AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FISH OF THE 1991 YEAR CLASS.  THE LMB YOY INDEX (55.0 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (19.0 PER SEINE HAUL).  BLC WERE NOT CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS, TRAPNETS, OR SEINES IN 1992 EVEN THOUGH YEARLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1989 AND ADULTS IN 1990. THE 1992 YEP GILLNET CATCH INDEX (6.60 PER GN, 1.35 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (2.57 PER GN, 0.47 LBS PER GN).  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT (0.20 LBS FROM GN) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (0.16 LBS FROM GN).  THE 1992 YEP PSD (18) WAS BELOW THE RANGE (30-50) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION, BUT ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (9). THE 1992 RSD-P WAS 0. THE YEP YOY INDEX (0 PER SEINE HAUL) WAS THE SAME AS PREVIOUS SURVEYS. THE 1992 WAE GILLNET CATCH INDEX (1.00 PER GN, 1.53 LBS PER GN) WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR POUNDS COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (5.67 PER GN, 13.54 LBS PER GN).  THE 1987 SURVEY HAD THE HIGHEST CATCH INDEX, MEAN SIZE, PSD, AND RSD-P VALUES (19.67 PER GN, 51.37 LBS PER GN, MEAN SIZE =2.61 LBS FROM GN, PSD=99, RSD-P32) OF WAE IN POINT LAKE.  THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT (1.53 LBS FROM GN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (1.59 LBS FROM GN).  THE 1992 PSD (64) WAS ABOVE THE RANGE (30-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  THE 1992 RSD-P WAS 7. GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-4, AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 5-6.  THERE APPEARS TO BE NO DOMINANT YEAR CLASS, BUT SOME WAE APPEAR TO HAVE SURVIVED THE 1988-89 WINTER KILL.  THE 1992 BLB GILLNET INDEX (50.40 PER GN, 8.03 LBS PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX, BUT BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (63.89 PER GN, 16.10 LBS PER GN).  THE 1992 BLB TRAPNET INDEX (3.78 PER TN, 0.43 LBS PER TN) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (223.46 PER TN, 18.81 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 BLB MEAN WEIGHTS (0.16 LBS FROM GN, 0.11 LBS FROM TN) WERE BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGES (0.36 LBS FROM GN, 0.17 LBS FROM TN). THE 1992 PSD (1) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (31).  THE 1992 RSD-P WAS 0. YOY BLB WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE 1992 SEINE HAULS (HISTORICAL AVERAGE=1.4 PER SEINE HAUL) THE 1988-89 WINTER KILL HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF ALL FISH SPECIES PRESENT.  GROWTH RATES FOR MOST SPECIES APPEAR TO HAVE IMPROVED.  PRESENTLY IT APPEARS THAT BLG AND LMB HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT REPRODUCING IN POINT LAKE FOLLOWING THE WINTER KILL.  IT APPEARS THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR OTHER SPECIES SUCH AS NOP BLC AND YEP HAVE BEEN MINIMAL.  WAE FRY SHOULD BE STOCKED EVERY OTHER YEAR IN POINT LAKE TO PROVIDE BOTH FUTURE FISHING OPPORTUNITIES AND A CHECK ON THE BLB POPULATION.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Point is a small lake (164 acres) with a maximum depth of 32 feet. About 75% of the lakeis less than 15 feet deep. Nutrient levels are moderate. Water clarity was excellent (secchidisk=17.4 ft on 6/12/95). Submergent vegetation has been historically abundant within thelake. Commonly occurring submergents include sago pondweed, coontail, northern watermilfoil,muskgrass \"chara\", and duckweed species. Filamentous algae was abundant on the shoalwatersubstrates and flooded timber. Emergent vegetation (reed canary grass, hardstem bulrush,cattail species) was common throughout the surrounding lake and island shoreline areas.Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, muck, and gravel. The immediate shoreline areais composed mostly of mixed hardwoods on gradual to steep slopes with some grasslands. Asmall marsh originated inlet enters the northeast portion of the lake. This inlet is dammed(2 ft head) with boards. This inlet has been used as a northern pike spawning area in thepast. The outlet (east side of lake, drains into Eagle Lake) was constructed in the early1970's to alleviate high Point Lake water levels. The outlet is a high gradient culvert whichprevents fish migration into Point via Eagle Lake. The outlet was plugged during theconstruction of the four lane highway (U.S. Highway 71/23) causing the water level to rise5 feet above the normal level in 1971. Many standing and fallen dead trees are located in thewater adjacent to shoreline areas. Present water levels are high to moderate on Point Lake.Partial winterkills have occurred on Point Lake in 1974-75 and 1988-89 during periods of lowwater levels. There are 15 homes located adjacent to the lake (11 homes, 1 campground 1978survey). The old campground area is presently being developed for homes. Numerous fish eatingbirds (cormorants, pelicans) were observed either on the lake or flying overhead. In thepast, Point Lake has received relatively low fishing pressure. Black bullheads were abundantin the past, however, few are now present. Prior fish management activities on Point Lakehave included the operation of a northern pike spawning area, winter dissolved oxygentesting, commercial removal of bullheads in the 1980's, winter rescue of fish during the 1975winterkill, and the stocking of various species (bluegill, northern pike, walleye, yellowperch, black crappie). Presently, Point is managed for northern pike, walleye, bluegill,largemouth bass, and black crappie.     Walleye abundance in 1995 (1.0 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (1.2 - 5.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (4.7 fish/gillnet). Walleyeabundance was the highest in 1987 (19.7 fish/gillnet, average size= 2.6 lbs.). However, awinterkill decimated the walleye population in 1988-89 and have failed to recover even withintense walleye stocking (fry, fingerling) within in recent years. The average size in 1995(12.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was below the historical average (15.1 inches). Thelargest fish caught was 21.8 inches. Growth rates appear good. There were no young of year\"YOY\" or Yearling \"YRL\" walleye caught during fall electrofishing in 1995. In 1994, the fallelectrofishing catch rate was 0.8 YOY/hour and 0.0 YRL/hour. About 56% of the walleyecaptured in summer survey nets were from the 1994 year class.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (5.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.3 -9.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (3.3 fish/gillnet). Thehighest northern pike abundance was in 1987 (8.3 fish/gillnet, average size=21.8 inches). The1995 average size (18.8 inches) was similar to the historical average (18.6 inches). Thelargest fish caught was 30.0 inches. About 95% of the fish captured in the summer survey netswere from the 1994 year class. There were no YOY northern pike captured during the 1994 or1995 fall electrofishing surveys. The northeast inlet water control structure was used as anorthern pike spawning area from 1972-75 and 1978-1980. The average northern pike YOYproduction was 16,443 fish (range= 4,000 - 26,400) from the spawning area. Current plans areto resume managing the spawning area upon consent of adjacent landowners.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (39.5 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (3.7 -28.4 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value for Point Lake(historical average=10.0 fish/gillnet). The 1995 average size (7.9 inches, 0.24 lbs) wasabove the historical average (7.3 inches). The largest fish caught was 9.4 inches. Growthrates were excellent. About 97% of the yellow perch captured were from the 1993 year class.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (25.0 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (5.9 - 43.3fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (14.3 fish/trapnet). The1995 average size was (5.3 inches) was the same as the historical average. The largest fishcaught was 7.6 inches. Growth rates appear slow. About 55% of the fish captured were from the1992 year class.     Pumpkinseed sunfish abundance in 1995 (13.4 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range(1.5 - 9.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical range (5.1fish/trapnet). The 1995 pumpkinseed sunfish average size (4.6 inches) was slightly below thehistorical average (4.3 inches). Other sunfish species were also abundant within Point Lake.Green sunfish abundance in 1995 (134.7 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.2 - 1.2fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value (historical average=28.1fish/trapnet). The 1995 green sunfish average size was 3.9 inches (historical average=5.0inches). Hybrid sunfish were also abundant in 1995 (9.6 fish/trapnet, average size=5.1inches) compared to the historical average (2.1 fish/trapnet, 4.6 inches).     Largemouth bass abundance in the 1995 spring electrofishing survey (47.3 fish/hour) wasabove the 1990 survey (34.2 fish/hour) and the area average (41.7 fish/hour). The 1995average size from spring electrofishing (6.9 inches) was similar to the 1990 survey (5.8inches). The largest fish caught was 18.7 inches. About 61% of the largemouth bass caught inthe spring survey were from the 1994 year class. This 1994 year class composed 98% of thesummer trapnet catch (5.6 fish/trapnet, 50 fish total).     Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (0.9 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.0 -29.9 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and the lowest recorded value for Point Lake(historical average=178.9 fish/trapnet). The highest numbers occurred prior to the 1988-89winterkill with 538.4 fish/trapnet in 1978 and 273.3 fish/trapnet in 1987. Black bullheadnumbers have significantly declined in most Kandiyohi County lakes within the last fiveyears. The 1995 average size (8.0 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was above the historicalaverage (6.9 inches).     Water quality and clarity of Point Lake is relatively good compared to other lakes.Point Lake has a small watershed with relatively no/minor agricultural nutrient runoff. Themajor sources of nutrient/pollution inputs are probably from lakehome septic leachate,highway runoff (road salt), and fecal wastes from cormorants/pelicans that inhabit the lakeand adjacent shoreline areas. Presently, positive aspects of the fishery include low bullheadnumbers, abundant numbers of large fast growing yellow perch, a good upcoming 1994 year classof northern pike. Negative aspects about the current fishery include the low numbers ofwalleye present; low numbers of largemouth bass over 12 inches present, high numbers of greensunfish, high numbers of small slow growing bluegill and pumpkinseeds. In the past someanglers have complained about the taste of various fish species (i.e. walleye) caught fromPoint Lake. This may be due in part to high amount of dissolved solids in the water and thebyproducts from decaying wooded (flooded trees) debris in the lake. It appears that walleyefry stocking is not a viable option for maintaining walleye numbers due to the good waterclarity in Point Lake. Walleye fingerling stocking did not appear successful in 1994. Walleyefry and fingerling stocking will be discontinued due to a lack of success, however, a limitedwalleye fishery in Point may be maintained with periodic stocking of adult walleye whenavailable from rearing ponds. Presently, it is unknown what influence the cormorantpopulation is having on fingerling and yearling walleye numbers. Future management prioritieswill include maintaining present water quality, encouraging nondestructive development of thesurrounding lakeshore, increasing walleye and northern pike numbers, maintainingmoderate/abundant numbers of forage fish (yellow perch), reducing green sunfish numbers,increasing quality size (>12 inches) of largemouth bass, improving bluegill growth rates, andmaintaining low black bullhead numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer population assessment was conducted on Point Lake in June of 2004. Point is a small (164 acres), moderately deep (32 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. An extensive winterkill occurred in Point Lake during the 1996-1997 winter due to low oxygen levels. Winterkill is generally rare for Point Lake, but it is susceptible during winters with high snowfall accumulations. Snow accumulation on a lake blocks out sunlight, which prohibits algal/plant growth and corresponding oxygen production in the lake. Water clarity was poor to moderate (secchi=5.83 feet) for Point Lake during the 2004 assessment compared to previous surveys. Algae blooms were common on Point Lake during 2004. Aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed, narrowleaf pondweed, chara, bulrush, filamentous algae) was sparse to moderate in density within the lake. The immediate watershed is comprised mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, highway frontage, and minimal number of residential homes. Numerous pelicans and cormorants were observed on the lake during the 2004 summer assessment. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Point Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. Black crappie were not captured in survey nets during 2004. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.14 fish/gillnet. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.08 pounds from gillnets. Adult pre-spawn black crappie (114 fish, 38 pounds) were stocked during 2001 in Point Lake.Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2004 (79.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and above the Point historical average catch rate (25.63 fish/trapnet). The 2004 bluegill average size was small (0.05 pounds and 4.14 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 6.81 inches from the Point 2004 summer assessment. Bluegill growth rates in Point Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2001 bluegill year class comprised 46% of the 2004 summer assessment bluegill catch.Largemouth bass numbers were abundant in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey (78.00 fish/hour) compared to the Spicer Area historical average (47.22 fish/hour) and the Point Lake historical average (63.57 fish/hour). The largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.34 pounds and 12.36 inches) from the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average size is 0.70 pounds and 8.51 inches from spring electrofishing in Point. The largest bass captured was 18.11 inches from the Point 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The catch rate of 15.00 inch and larger largemouth bass was high (17.91 fish/hour) in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6 in Point. The 2001 largemouth bass year class comprised 55% of the 2004 spring electrofishing catch. Northern pike numbers in 2004 (6.50 fish/gillnet) were within the normal range of similar lakes, but abundant compared to the Point Lake historical average catch rate (3.52 fish/gillnet). The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (2.89 pounds and 23.07 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.09 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured was 31.38 inches from the Point 2004 summer assessment. Northern pike growth rates in Point were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2002 northern pike year class comprised 59% of the 2004 summer assessment northern pike catch. Walleye numbers were moderate in 2004 (4.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the Point Lake historical average (4.31 fish/gillnet), but above the normal range of similar lakes. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.29 pounds and 17.68 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.80 pounds from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 22.44 inches from the Point 2004 summer assessment. The catch rate of 15.00 inches and larger walleye was moderate (4.50 fish/gillnet) in 2004. Walleye growth rates in Point were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2 and ages 6-8, but above the normal ranges for ages 3-5. The 2001 walleye year class (stocked in 2002) comprised 67% of the 2004 summer assessment walleye catch. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 1997 (480 yearlings, 24 pounds), 1999 (428 fingerlings, 66 pounds; 930 yearlings, 216 pounds), 2000 (85 adults, 80 pounds), 2002 (8,530 yearlings, 254 pounds), and 2004 (8,980 yearlings, 371 pounds; 51 adults, 17 pounds). Yellow perch numbers were low in 2004 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (11.86 fish/gillnet). The 2004 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.30 pounds and 8.12 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.19 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in Point Lake were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2001 yellow perch year class comprised 40% of the 2004 summer assessment yellow perch catch.Black bullhead numbers were moderate in 2004 (19.50 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range of similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 62.22 fish/gillnet in Point. The 2004 black bullhead average size was large (0.98 pounds and 11.69 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.45 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Point include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, periodic winter oxygen monitoring, and stocking walleye fingerlings or yearlings as warranted. All fish species in Point Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2008.</p>",
