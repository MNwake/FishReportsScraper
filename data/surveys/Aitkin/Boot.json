There is no public land or access on the lake but in the past some anglers have been able to gain access across private property.  The lake has a large but very well structured northern pike population.  Northern pike up to 32 inches were sampled in the survey with an average size over 24 inches long and average weight of 3.5 pounds.Panfish are very abundant in Boot Lake.  The catch rate for bluegill in trapnets was more than twelve times the statewide average for lakes in lake class 20.  Because of the large number of fish and the low fertility of the water, the growth rate for these fish is poor.  The largest bluegill sampled was just over 7 inches in length with the average length being only four and three-quarters inches.Black crappie, like the bluegill, are abundant and slow growing.  The average black crappie sampled in this survey was less than eight inches long and weighed less than a quarter of a pound.  The largest black crappie sampled weighed about one-half pound.Largemouth bass, while slow growing, do reach respectable size.  Although only six largemouth bass were sampled in the survey one was over 17 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boot Lake is a small, infertile, bog stained lake located in northeastern Aitkin County.  In the past anglers have had to get permission to cross private property to access the lake, but now there is a county administered carry-in access on the north side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, the lake has had a well-structured northern pike population.  The 2012 pike catch of 9.8 per gill net was similar to previous assessments, which have been above normal compared to similar lakes.  Size decreased from the last assessment with the average length of pike changing from 24 inches in 2002, to just 20 inches in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are typically abundant in Boot Lake.  Because of the large number of fish and the low fertility of the water, growth rates for these fish are slow and typically below county averages.  Bluegill trap net catches were low in 2012, in part because the lake was sampled in August instead of June when water temperatures are high and fish are less susceptible to survey nets.  In addition, unusual precipitation patterns may have also negatively influenced the bluegill catch.  Bluegill size averaged 5.3 inches with fish up to 7.1 inches sampled.  Panfish anglers may catch respectable sized hybrid sunfish which averaged 7.0 inches with fish measuring up to 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to bluegill, black crappie can be abundant, but are slow growing in Boot Lake.  Survey nets indicate a decrease in abundance of black crappie from 2002, but still within the normal range for this type of lake.  The average black crappie caught in this survey was about 8\" long and weighed approximately a quarter of a pound.  The largest black crappie caught was 10\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass also provide angling opportunities in Boot Lake.  Standard survey nets do not sample bass in large numbers and only seven largemouth bass were sampled in 2012.  While bass grow slowly, they do reach respectable size with fish up to 15.5 inches captured in this survey.   <br> \n</p>",

The gill net indices for white sucker and brown bullhead were below their respective lake class 20 first quartile.  The trap net indices for pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie were above their respective lake class 20 third quartiles.  Northern pike (16 of 16 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age.  All northern pike sampled, with the possible exception of one, were from natural reproduction.  Although the sample is small it appears that the 1989 year class is missing from the population.  Growth rates for the first and second annual increments were faster than normal.  Growth rates for the third through the sixth annual increments were slower than normal.  Bluegill (33 of 165 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988.  Growth rates for the second through the fifth annual increments were slower than normal.  Largemouth bass (21 of 21 aged) ranged from one to six years of age.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  The growth rate for the third annual increment was faster than normal.  Total length at formation of the fourth, fifth, and sixth annuli was normal.  Black crappie (37 of 131 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987. Growth rates for the first and third were normal, all other annual increments checked had slower than normal growth.  Yep (19 of 50 aged) were three and four years of age with most of the fish sampled from the 1988 year class.  Growth rates for the second and third annual increments were slower than normal.</p>",
