The lake has a maximum depth of 4.0 feet and in 2006 was mostly covered with a dense stand of wild rice, making outboard motor travel impossible after mid-summer. A lake survey was conducted on the lake in 2006; however, due to low water and abundant vegetation, netting gear could not be used to evaluate fish populations. The most recent information on fish populations in this lake is from a 1986 assessment: average numbers of walleyes, northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass and white suckers were collected. There is no developed public access on this lake.  Most of the angling on this lake occurs before mid-summer, after which water levels and vegetation make watercraft travel more difficult.</p>",
