                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda Lake is one of two lakes within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park that is stocked with lake trout.  The current stocking plan is about 3800 yearlings every other year.  All stocked lake trout received a fin clip, either the adipose fin or one of the paired fins, that indentified the year class.  Of the 22 lake trout sampled, 9 had adipose clips.  The gill net catch rate was the second highest observed in Mukooda Lake.  The average length of lake trout was 16.7\".Many other game fish species were sampled, but most were present in low numbers.  Black crappie and largemouth bass catch rates were higher in Mukooda Lake than in other similar lakes.  Northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, and smallmouth bass catch rates were lower than in most other similar lakes.  A number of sunfish species were also sampled in low numbers, including bluegill, pumpkinseed, and long-eared sunfish.  Long-eared sunfish were new to Mukooda Lake this year, and bluegill were first collected in 1994.  Both these species were probably illegally introduced by visiting anglers.  Recruitment for all these species is sporadic, and catch rates fluctuate from year to year.The most abundant species sampled was tullibee, with an average of 38 per gill net.  This forage species was typically the most abundant species in earlier surveys as well.  White sucker were also present. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda is a clear, deep, class 5 lake located about 5 miles north of the town of Crane Lake, MN.  The lake is within Voyageurs National Park (VNP) and can be accessed by portage trails or float plane.  Mukooda is one of the two lakes within VNP's boundaries that is stocked with lake trout.  Stocking began in 1942.  Since 1980, the lake has been stocked on even numbered years with lake trout yearlings at a rate of five fish per acre.  The lake is managed for lake trout, but also provides sport fisheries for numerous other species.  Black crappie gill-net abundance was 2.17 fish/set, which was greater than median of 1.50 fish/set for class 5 lakes and the second highest ever recorded in Mukooda Lake.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-10 years.  Total length (TL) ranged from 5.1-13.0 inches and the mean was 10.9.  The mean weight of black crappies captured was 0.80 pounds, much greater than the third quartile of 0.50 for class 5 lakes.  Cisco are abundant and generally small.  The mean total length was 8.6 inches, which provide a great food source for larger gamefish.    Lake trout gill-net abundance was 0.83 fish/set, which was lower than the two previous investigations and the mean since 1969 of 1.38 fish/set.  Total length ranged from 7.6-33.3 inches.  Anglers report good fishing for lake trout.Largemouth bass gill-net abundance was 4.42 fish/set, which is the highest level ever recorded for Mukooda Lake and much greater than the third quartile for class 5 lakes.  Age ranged from 3-6 years.  Mean weight and growth was below the area and statewide averages.  Northern pike gill-net abundance (1.83 fish/set) was the highest ever recorded for Mukooda Lake; however, abundance was still well below the median of 3.18 fish/set for class 5 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-6 years.  The 1999 and 2000 year-classes composed 91% of the sample.  Mean TL was 22.8 inches with a range from 17.8 to 31.8.  Growth was greater than the statewide and area averages.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets remained greater than most class 5 lakes.  However, mean weight was the lowest ever recorded on Mukooda Lake, partly due to the strong year-classes of young fish.Walleye gill-net abundance was 1.17 fish/set, which was low for this lake type.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 4-16 years.  Total length ranged from 21.2-31.4 inches and the mean was 24.3.  Mean weight was 6.01 pounds, which greatly exceeded the third quartile (2.01) for class 5 lakes.  Growth rate for walleye was exceptional.  Length at age 4 was 20.5 inches, which was 6 inches larger than the average age-4 walleye in the International Falls management area.Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 1.50 fish/set, which was low for this lake type.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 4-9 years.  Total length ranged from 6.0-10.9 inches and the mean was 7.8.  Growth was below the area and statewide averages.  Mean weight was above average for class 5 lakes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda is a 773 acre lake located within Voyageurs National Park. The lake is accessed from Sand Point Lake, where the National Park Service maintains a dock at the beginning of the short portage into Mukooda. This isolated lake can also be accessed via snowmobile trails in the winter. Presently, there are several campsites as well as boats available for rental on Mukooda. This diverse fishery supports populations of several species of gamefish that may be of interest to anglers. The deep, cold water supports fish such as Lake Trout and Cisco, while the warmer waters hold quality populations of Bass, Northern Pike, and several other species. A fish population survey was completed on Mukooda in 2017 as part of a regular rotation of investigational surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe methods used to survey the fish community in Mukooda do not typically produce many panfish, however there were still Bluegill and Black Crappie in the samples. Crappie up to 12 inches were caught during the 2017 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nConcerns about low catch rates of Lake Trout, specifically the 2012 survey which produced no Lake Trout, prompted the enactment of a catch-and-release only regulation for Lake Trout in Mukooda. Lake Trout were present again in the 2017 sample, however the catch rate was still less than the historical average. The 2017 catch ranged from 15 to 28 inches and averaged 22 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nMukooda supports high quality populations of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Similar to panfish, bass are not typically caught in large numbers in the nets used to sample Mukooda. However, there were still a good number present in the samples in 2017. Largemouth ranged from 13 to 16 inches, while Smallmouth Bass up to about 20 inches were caught. Aging revealed that some of the Smallmouth live to be quite old. One individual was estimated to be 18 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are fairly abundant in Mukooda Lake. Unlike most lakes with a high abundance of Northern Pike, Mukooda has the potential to produce trophy fish. The average size of Northern Pike in Mukooda during the 2017 survey was over 26 inches, and fish up to nearly 42 inches were caught. Historical catch data shows that the Northern Pike population has increased over the past two decades. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye catch rates dating back to 1969 have shown that Mukooda supports a low density population, and the 2017 survey was no exception. The sample from 2017 included fish up to 25 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were caught at rates similar to the historical average for Mukooda, and they averaged 7 inches. Other fish sampled during the 2017 survey include Rock Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda Lake is a 774 acre lake located within Voyageurs National Park. The lake is accessed from Sand Point Lake, where the National Park Service maintains a dock at the beginning of the short portage into Mukooda Lake. This isolated lake can also be accessed via snowmobile trails in the winter. The National Park Service maintains several campsites as well as boats available for rental on Mukooda Lake. This diverse fishery supports populations of several species of gamefish that may be of interest to anglers. The deep, cold water supports fish such as Lake Trout and Cisco, while the warmer waters hold quality populations of Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and several other species.  To prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species and exotic viruses, anglers are only allowed to use artificial baits. In addition, no privately-owned watercraft (boats, canoes, kayaks, etc.) or float planes are allowed in interior lakes such as Mukooda Lake. A fish population survey was completed on Mukooda Lake in 2022 as part of a regular rotation of investigational surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nSpecial regulations protecting Lake Trout were implemented in January of 2014. The regulation prohibits harvest of Lake trout, while still allowing catch and release angling during the open fishing season. No Lake Trout are allowed in possession while fishing on Mukooda Lake. The regulation does allow transport of Lake Trout across Mukooda Lake (taking the most direct route and not fishing) if the Lake Trout were legally taken from connected waters. All other species present in Mukooda Lake follow the statewide regulations for inland waters.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout abundance was 0.6 fish per net, which was similar to other recent surveys, but below the historical average on Mukooda Lake. Length ranged from 19.7 to 28.3 inches, with an average of 24.0 inches. Average weight 5.1 pounds, which was above the average weight of Lake Trout caught in recent surveys. A total of three year-classes were present, and ranged from 8-16 years. Although present in low numbers, Lake Trout in Mukooda Lake provide a unique fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was 1.2 fish per net, which was similar to other recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Length ranged from 18.2 to 29.5 inches, with an average of 23.0 inches. Average weight was 4.3 pounds, which was above the average weight of Walleye caught in recent surveys. A total of five year-classes were present, and ranged from 3-19 years. Although Walleye abundance is lower than similar lakes, growth is exceptional, providing anglers with a shot at a trophy Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was 3.6 fish per net in shallow gill nets, which was below average compared to other recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length in shallow gill nets ranged from 21.1 to 33.7 inches, with an average of 26.1 inches. Average weight in shallow gill nets was 4.0 pounds, which was slightly below the average weight of Northern Pike caught in 2017. A total of eight year-classes were present, and ranged from 2-9 years. Northern Pike abundance in Mukooda Lake has increased over time, and have become fairly abundant. Unlike most lakes with a high abundance of Northern Pike, Mukooda Lake has the potential to produce trophy fish.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was 9.8 fish per net, which was above average compared to recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length ranged from 7.2 to 16.4 inches, with an average of 11.7 inches. Average weight was 1.0 pounds, which was similar to the average weight of Largemouth Bass in recent surveys. A total of 12 year-classes were present, and ranged from 2-24 years. There are good numbers of Largemouth Bass greater than 12\" providing good fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance was 2.2 fish per net in shallow gill nets, which was slightly below average compared to recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length in shallow gill nets ranged from 10.9 to 19.6 inches, with an average of 14.9 inches. Average weight in shallow gill nets was 2.0 pounds, which was similar to the average weight of Smallmouth Bass caught in recent surveys. A total of six year-classes were present, and ranged from 3-18 years. Overall, the Smallmouth Bass population in Mukooda Lake looks healthy. There are good numbers of 12\" - 20\" Smallmouth Bass present providing good fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was 2.0 fish per net, which was below average compared to recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length ranged from 4.6 to 13.7 inches, with an average of 9.6 inches. Average weight was 0.7 pounds, which was similar to the average weight of Black Crappie caught in recent surveys. A total of six year-classes were present, and ranged from 2-11 years. There are decent numbers of Black Crappie greater than 7\" providing good fishing opportunities with the potential of catching a Crappie over 13\".  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was 13.6 fish per net, which was well above average compared to recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length ranged from 3.8 to 9.5 inches, with an average of 4.7 inches. Average weight was 0.1 pounds, which was similar to the average weight of Bluegill caught in 2017. A total of five year-classes were present, and ranged from 4-18 years. Although bluegill abundance is high, average size is low. Anglers looking to harvest Bluegill will likely have to sort through lots of small individuals, but the potential for larger Bluegill is present in Mukooda Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was 5.6 fish per net, which was above average compared to other recent surveys on Mukooda Lake. Total length ranged from 6.4 to 12.6 inches, with a mean of 9.0 inches. Mean weight was 0.3 pounds, which was above the average weight of Yellow Perch caught in recent surveys. There are good numbers of Yellow Perch present providing good fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, Cisco, and White Sucker provide quality forage for top predators within Mukooda Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda is a clear and deep class 5 lake located four miles north of Crane Lake, Minnesota within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park.  Mukooda Lake is located within the interior of the Park but outside the Proposed Designated Wilderness.  Access can be gained in one of three ways; 1) portage trail from Sand Point Lake, 2) floatplane or 3) during safe ice, via snowmobile trail from Crane Lake.  The Park maintains a campsite on the east shore of Mukooda Lake.  Mukooda is managed as a two-story fishery.\n\nWith its favorable coldwater habitat, Mukooda Lake has been stocked with yearling lake trout every other year since 1980.  During the 2007 investigation, assessment gill nets caught 0.71 lake trout per net.  This was the lowest gillnet abundance in 20 years.  The average abundance since 1969 was 1.29 fish/net.  Lengths of lake trout ranged from 14.1 to 31.8 inches.  The average weight of trout caught in this investigation was 3.4 pounds.\n\nThe warmwater fishery in Mukooda Lake is diverse.  Largemouth bass were the most common species in the shallow-water nets.  The gillnet abundance (11.00/net) in 2007 greatly exceeded all previous records from Mukooda Lake and was the highest on record for the International Falls Management Area.  Largemouth bass in this assessment ranged in length from 5.6 to 16.2 inches with an average of 12.2 inches.  Growth of Mukooda Lake largemouth bass was slow.\n\nNorthern pike abundance in Mukooda Lake has increased substantially.  The 2007 gillnet abundance (4.17/net) greatly exceeded all previous estimates.  The average gillnet abundance from 1969 to 2002 was 0.42/net.  Mukooda Lake pike grow fast and fish up to 35.3 inches were caught in our survey.  \n\nWalleye abundance (0.75/net) was the second lowest recorded for Mukooda Lake.  Large fish dominated the 2007 catch.  Lengths ranged from 19.5 to 27.6 inches.  The average weight of walleye was 4.25 pounds.  Growth rates of Mukooda Lake walleye was fast.\n\nA number of other species were present in the 2007 survey including black crappie, bluegill, burbot, cisco, green sunfish, longear sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker and yellow perch.  For the angler willing to put a little more effort into getting to a lake, Mukooda offers a variety of fishing opportunities for a variety of species.  Please note: Voyageurs National Park rules prevent the portaging of boats into Mukooda Lake to prevent the spread of spiny waterflea into this lake.    \n\n</p>",

The average size trout sampled was 11.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The largest trout sampled was 33.1 inches and 16.5 pounds.  Five age classes were sampled, and some natural reproduction may be occurring.    Walleye and northern pike were sampled in small numbers, but their size was above average.  Average size for walleye was 22.4 inches and 5.0 pounds.  Average size for northern pike was 26.4 inches and 4.3 pounds.    Largemouth and smallmouth bass are common, and are present in numbers comparable to other lakes of this type.  Average size was 15.0 inches and 1.8 pounds for largemouth bass, and 12.0 inches and 1.1 pounds for smallmouth bass.    Black crappie, sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch are also available for anglers.  None are abundant, but size is good.  The largest black crappie sampled was 11.1 inches, and the largest bluegill was 8.2 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mukooda Lake includes cold, cool, and warmwater species.  As a result, nets were stratified into two different depth zones (deep and shallow).  Special attention was given to make sure some nets target lake trout in deep, cold water with adequate dissolved oxygen levels.  <br> \n <br> \nTwelve species were captured during the 2012 assessment.  Alarmingly, no lake trout were captured.  However, enforcement officers have verified lake trout catches by anglers during the winter following the population assessment.  Mukooda has an unusually diverse fish community that has likely been altered by the introduction of non-indigenous species.  Generally, it appears that populations of cold water species are declining and more tolerant species are increasing.  For example, bass, crappie and panfish are at or near record highs while cisco and lake trout are at or near record lows.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was the highest ever recorded for Mukooda Lake and noticeably higher than the previous record observed in 2007.  Catches in recent investigations were at least 10 times higher than historic catches in Mukooda Lake.  In 2012, eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-11 years.  Recruitment appears consistent, with no year-classes more prominent than the others.  Northern pike up to 35.8 inches were found in the sample.     <br> \n <br> \nOnly six walleye were captured during the 2012 investigation, which was tied for the lowest abundance level observed in the eight investigations dating back to 1969.  The walleye catch was entirely made up of large fish with lengths ranging from 17.5 to 27.2 inches.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-16 years.  Walleye in Mukooda Lake grow exceptionally fast, the fastest in the International Falls Management Area.  </p>",
