                "narrative": "<p>North Lindstrom Lake is a fertile 137 acre basin located in southern Chisago County within the city of Lindstrom.  The lake is connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a narrow channel that is navigable by small boat (<14'), but low water levels may prevent navigation during dry conditions.  The current lake management plan lists northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the primary management species.During the open water season of 2000, a fish population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in North Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  Northern pike numbers were below normal for this lake type, while the average weight, at 3.4 pounds, was within a normal range.  Historical abundance levels dating back to 1973 have been either below normal or average.  Measured northern ranged from 22.1 to 29.1 inches.  Growth of northern pike was typical of normal when compared to average northern growth statewide.  Spring night electrofishing found an excellent abundance of largemouth bass that had a small average size of 0.5 pounds.  Lengths extended from 4.1 to 17.1 inches.  Bass growth was average at all ages.  The number of bluegill sunfish and black crappie were found within a normal range, but the average size for both species was small.  Their lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.2 and 4.7 to 9.1 inches, respectively.  Panfish growth was normal at all ages except ages 3-4 for bluegill.  Walleye have not been stocked in North Lindstrom Lake since 1978 and natural reproduction has most likely been minimal.  The current abundance of nice walleye captured during the 2000 survey was at a normal level with an average weight, at 3.1 pounds, well above normal.  The lakes connection to South Lindstrom Lake, which has been stocked on a consecutive or biannual year basis since 1986, is the most likely origin.  Historically, walleye numbers have been up and down depending on the success of year classes stocked in South Lindstrom.  Measured walleye ranged from 16.3 to 27.2 inches with an average length of 20.6 inches.  All walleye sampled were greater than 16 inches in length.  Walleye growth was found to be representative of normal.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were found at below normal levels.  Previous surveys indicate that perch numbers have historically been low and may easily be affected by the abundance of northern pike or walleye.  The fish community was also made up of bowfin (dog fish), brown bullhead, green sunfish, johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  Excellent reproductive success was found for bluegill sunfish while largemouth bass showed some success.  An angler fishing North Lindstrom Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized walleye or an occasional larger northern pike.  An abundance of smaller largemouth are available for an angling thrill with some quality sized bass also possible.  Currently, a good number of smaller bluegill sunfish and black crappie will keep panfish anglers busy removing them from their hook.  In the past, shoreline fishing has accounted for a lot of the open water fishing pressure on North Lindstrom Lake.  Individuals who do not have access to a boat may want to consider this lake for bank fishing.  Bank anglers primarily target panfish and northern pike.  Fishing enthusiasts are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Because North Lindstrom Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, agricultural crop land, and livestock/pasture land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Since nutrient input can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient loading may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Land users within the watershed can prevent or maintain the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes withnative plants, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish; Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Common Carp, Yellow Perch, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Bluntnose Minnow, Spotfin Shiner, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from the July 2019 lake survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for North Lindstrom Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. North Lindstrom Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lindstrom Lake is a fertile 137 acre basin located in southern Chisago County within the city of Lindstrom.  The lake's south shore is connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a narrow channel, navigable at normal water levels.  North Center Lake connects to the north east end of the lake by a 3/4 mile stream.  The shore is predominately sand and the water clarity is relatively good compared to other area lakes.  Development is lighter than nearby lakes.  Fishing pressure has likely increased in recent years due to the higher water levels increasing the ease of navigation from South Lindstrom Lake.  The current lake management plan lists Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nDuring July of 2019, a lake survey was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in North Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing to sample Largemouth Bass and standard gill and trap nets to sample the remaining fish species.  Northern Pike numbers reached another historic high, eclipsing the management goal and the norm for the lake type while maintaining an average size above both as well. Northerns averaged 25 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Nearly two thirds of the Pike surpassed 26 inches in length.  Spring night electrofishing found a high abundance of Largemouth Bass with an average size of 1.3 pounds and 12.8 inches.  Lengths extended from 5.8 to 19.9 inches.  The number of Bluegill Sunfish and Black Crappie sampled were within the normal range.  Both species decreased moderately in size since the last evaluation.  Seventeen percent of the Bluegill exceeded 7 inches while only 13% of the Crappie catch topped the 8 inch mark.  Walleye have not been stocked in North Lindstrom Lake since 1978.  The 2019 gill net catch rate for Walleye was below the lake type norm and likely the result of migration from neighboring lakes.  Walleye averaged 21.1 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Northern Pike and Walleye, were again sampled at a very low level.   <br> \n <br> \nAn angler fishing North Lindstrom Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized Northern Pike or an occasional larger Walleye.  Good numbers of good sized Largemouth Bass are also available while pan fish anglers will be busy but may have to sort through smaller fish to get a meal.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lindstrom Lake is a fertile 137 acre basin located in southern Chisago County within the city of Lindstrom.  The lake's south shore is connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a narrow channel that is navigable by small boat (<14') at normal water levels.  North Center Lake is connected to the northeast end of the lake.  The shore is predominately sand and the water clarity is relatively good compared to other area lakes.  Development is lighter than nearby lakes.  Fishing pressure has likely decreased in recent years.  An access previously used by the public has been closed by the landowner, leaving only a city street end access which has no parking.  The current lake management plan lists northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the summer of 2010, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in North Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing to sample largemouth bass and standard gill and trap nets to sample the remaining fish species.  Northern pike numbers were at a historic high but within the normal range for the lake type, while the average weight, at 3.7 pounds, was above the normal range.  Two thirds of the captured northern pike surpassed 24 inches in length.  Spring night electrofishing found a high abundance of largemouth bass with a somewhat small average size of 0.6 pounds.  Lengths extended from 6.3 to 17.1 inches.  The number of bluegill sunfish and black crappie sampled were within the normal range in all gear types.  Both species have shown improvement in size since the last evaluation.  Over one fourth of the bluegill exceeded 7 inches while more than half the crappie catch topped the 8 inch mark.  Walleye have not been stocked in North Lindstrom Lake since 1978.  The 2010 gill net catch rate for walleye was within the normal range and their average size was 2.8 pounds.   Measured walleye ranged from 16.6 to 26.2 inches with an average length of 19.5 inches.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were at a very low level   Previous surveys indicate that perch numbers have historically been low and may easily be affected by the abundance of northern pike or walleye.  The fish community was also made up of black, yellow, and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, hybrid and green sunfish, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAn angler fishing North Lindstrom Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized northern pike or an occasional larger walleye.  An abundance of smaller largemouth are available with some quality sized bass also present.  A good number of bluegill sunfish with bonus black crappie will keep panfish anglers busy.  In the past, shore fishing has accounted for a lot of the open water fishing pressure on North Lindstrom Lake.  Individuals who do not have access to a boat may want to consider this lake for bank fishing.  Bank anglers primarily target panfish and northern pike.  Because North Lindstrom Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, agricultural crop land, and livestock/pasture land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Such nutrient input can influence a lake's water clarity.  Land users within the watershed can help maintain or improve the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lindstrom Lake has the characteristics of a good bass-panfish lake.  Bluegills, black crappies and largemouth bass are the most sought-after gamefish; northern pike and walleye are present, but are not as abundant as other species in this lake.        DNR Fisheries crews used night electrofishing to sample largemouth bass in the spring of 1993.  This was the first time that this method had been used on this lake, and it proved to be very effective in sampling bass, which are difficult to capture in nets.  98 bass were captured in 57 minutes of electrofishing; this indicates an abundant largemouth bass population.  The sample showed a good range of sizes, from 4 to 17 inches.         Numbers of black crappies caught in trap nets were average for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 4-10 inches, with the highest numbers of fish in the eight inch range. In past surveys, numbers of crappies caught have varied considerably; this is typical of black crappie populations, which tend to run in cycles.        Bluegills were abundant in trap nets; this lake appears to have always had high numbers of bluegills.  The average length was 5.8 inches, and average weight was 0.1 pound.  The average weight is somewhat small but still within the normal range for this lake type.          Northern pike numbers have usually been low in this lake, but the average size of northerns tends to be high.  Northerns caught in gill nets in 1993 ranged in length from 20.5-33.9 inches, and the average weight was nearly 4 pounds.          Walleyes are not stocked in this lake, but are present in numbers considered normal for this lake type.  Sizes of walleyes tend to be large; the average weight of eight fish was 2.8 pounds.  Most of the walleyes probably are migrants from South Lindstrom Lake, which is stocked every three years.  A limited number of walleyes might be the result of natural reproduction.          Yellow perch have shown a thirty fold increase in abundance during the last 5 years, and catch rates in gill nets are in the average range for this lake type.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.2-8.6 inches.        Bullhead numbers are generally low to average in this lake, but average sizes are large enough to merit some interest to anglers.  All three species (black, brown, and yellow) are present.        Other species caught during 1993 survey work include: white sucker, bowfin (dogfish), sunfish species (green, pumpkinseed, and hybrids), golden shiner, and several other minnow species.</p>",

FOUR GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET ALONG WITH SHORELINE SEIN- ING EFFORTS TO OBTAIN DATA ON THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION. BASED RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IS AS  FOLLOWS:THE NORTH- ERN PIKE NET CATCH EXHIBITED A REAL INCREASE FROM THE NET CATCH OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1983. THIS WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 21.0 TO 24.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 22.0 - 22.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.42 POUNDS. GROWTH RATES OF THE FOUR NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED WERE JUST ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATES. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE MA- JORITY OF THIS WALLEYE POPULATION WAS MOST LIKELY CREATED BY MIGRATION FROM SOUTH LINDSTROM LAKE AND CHISAGO LAKE. SOME LIMITED NATURAL REPRODUC- TION MAY OCCUR, ADDING TO THE PRESENT POPULATION. THE LAST STOCKING IN THIS LAKE WAS IN 1978 AND 1973. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 11.0 TO 19.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 15.0 - 15.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS 1.33 POUNDS. ONE 25 INCH WALLEYE WAS CAPTURED IN THE TRAPNETS. GROWTH RATES OF THE WALLEYES CAP- TURED WERE SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATES. THE YELLOW PERCH NET CATCH SHOWED A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND WAS STILL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. A TOTAL OF THREE YELLOW PERCH WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS. NET CATCH NUMBERS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LOW. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS FOUND 56 YOUNG-OF-YEAR IN THE 0.29 ACRE AREA SEINED,. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PRE- VIOUS SURVEY AND ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. NINE FISH WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS WHICH WAS ABOVE THE CATCHES OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND THE LOCAL MEDIAN. OF THE TWELVE FISH AGED, SEVEN WERE AGE I AND FIVE WERE AGE II. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS FOUND 167 YOUNG-OF-YEAR. THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCH WAS AT ITS LOWEST MARK IN COMPARISON TO THE PAST SURVEYS BUT NONE WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE PREVIOUS SURVEY NET CATCH WAS 106.00/SET, WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO NET CATCHES OF THE OTHER SURVEYS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 4.0 - 4.4 INCHES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH HAS DROPPED FROM 1983 AND WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE 1988 AND 1983 NET CATCHES REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AS COMPARED TO ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCHES IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS. THE GILLNET CATCH ALSO SHOWED A DROP FROM PAST SURVEYS WHERE CATCHES WERE ALWAYS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DIS- TRIBUTION FOR ALL NETS WAS BETWEEN 4.0 - 8.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.5 - 5.9 INCHES. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS FOUND 38 YOUNG- OF-YEAR. NINE OTHER SPECIES WERE TAKEN BY TEST NETS (BOWFIN GOLDEN SHINER, WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, HYBRID SUNFISH, GREEN SUNFISH, AND PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH) AND WERE ALL BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIAN NET CATCH, EXCEPT THE BOWFIN. THE BOWFIN NET CATCH WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE BLACK BULLHEADS WERE LARGE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lindstrom Lake is a fertile 137 acre basin located in southern Chisago County within the city of Lindstrom.  The lake's south shore is connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a narrow channel that is navigable by small boat (<14') at normal water levels.  North Center lake is connected to the northeast end of the lake.  The shore is predominately sand and the water clarity is relatively good compared to other area lakes.  Forty five lake homes are present on the 2.2 miles of shore.  Developement is therefore lighter than nearby lakes.  Fishing pressure has likely decreased in recent years.  An access previously used by the public has been closed by the landowner, leaving only the city street access which has no parking.  The current lake management plan lists northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as the primary management species.During the summer of 2005, a lake survey was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in North Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, gill nets, trap nets, shoreline seining, and vegetation transects.  Northern pike numbers were normal for the lake type, while the average weight, at 5.3 pounds, was above the normal range.  Historical abundance levels dating back to 1973 have been either below normal or average.  All but one measured northern exceeded 27 inches.  Spring night electrofishing found a high abundance of largemouth bass that had a small average size of 0.7 pounds.  Lengths extended from 5.5 to 21.3 inches.  The number of bluegill sunfish and black crappie were found within the normal range in all gear types, but the average size was small for both species.  Their lengths ranged from 1.8 to 7.8 and 4.1 to 8.7 inches, respectively.  Walleye have not been stocked in North Lindstrom Lake since 1978 and natural reproduction has most likely been minimal.  The 2005 walleye abundance was high with an average weight of 2.2 pounds.   The lakes connection to South Lindstrom , which has been stocked on a consecutive or biennial year basis since 1986, is the most likely origin.  Historically, walleye numbers have been up and down depending on the success of year classes stocked in South Lindstrom.  Measured walleye ranged from 11.5 to 28.8 inches with an average length of 18.3 inches.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were at a very low level   Previous surveys indicate that perch numbers have historically been low and may easily be affected by the abundance of northern pike or walleye.  The fish community was also made up of brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, golden shiner, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  Good reproductive success was found for bluegill, crappie, and largemouth bass.  Fingerling yellow perch were also present.  An angler fishing North Lindstrom Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized walleye or an occasional larger northern pike.  An abundance of smaller largemouth are available with some quality sized bass also possible.  Currently, a good number of smaller bluegill sunfish and black crappie will keep panfish anglers busy.  In the past, shoreline fishing has accounted for a lot of the open water fishing pressure on North Lindstrom Lake.  Individuals who do not have access to a boat may want to consider this lake for bank fishing.  Bank anglers primarily target panfish and northern pike.  Fishing enthusiasts are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the small ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Because North Lindstrom Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, agricultural crop land, and livestock/pasture land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Since nutrient input can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient loading may decrease this lakes water quality.  Land users within the watershed can help maintain or improve the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plants, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",
