                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey (spring trap netting) was conducted on Beatty, to evaluate the lake's potential for rearing Walleye for statewide stocking purposes.  Spring trap netting catch rates were not directly comparable to summer trap netting catch rates; which have standardized net locations, sampling date, and mesh size.  The water clarity was turbid.  A total of two trap nets were set to evaluate the fish population.  A total of five different species were captured.   <br> \nThe three eights inch trap net sampled Black Bullhead (63), Brassy Minnow (1), Common Carp (7), and White Sucker (11).   <br> \nThe three quarter inch trap net sampled Black Bullhead (53), Common Carp (5), and Northern Pike (1).   The Northern Pike was 26.7 inches long.   <br> \nThe lake was not used for rearing Walleye for multiple reasons.  Species composition was typical of shallow lakes that were prone to winterkill and there was very little angling opportunity available.  <br> \n</p>",
