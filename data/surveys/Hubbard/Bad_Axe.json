                "narrative": "<p>As compared with the statewide figures, the net catches are as follows: (1) The catches of common suckers, yellow perch, and black crappies were significantly above average; bass were near average; and (3) the catch of northern pike was below average.  In addition to the species of fish mentioned above, 7 muskellunge and 603 mixed pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish were taken in the nets.  The growth rate of the largemouth bass was above average, and the growth rates of the sunfish and black crappie were below average, when compared with the statewide growth rate figures.Discussion and SummaryIn its primitive state, Bad Axe Lake is reported to have provided good muskellunge fishing, but with predation and competition from introduced crappies and northern pike not native to the lake, the musky population declined and virtually disappeared.In recent years (1952 through 1959) 3,417 musky fingerlings have been stocked.  Test netting captured two muskies from the 1958 year class, two others from the 1955 year class, and one from the 1952 year class.  It is likely that these muskies were stocked fish.  One musky was aged to the 1956 year-class, a year in which no muskies were stocked.Stocking has apparently produced a population of muskies in Bad Axe Lake and may eventually yield a few \"trophy-sized\" fish to the angler.  However, it is doubtful that a sustained population will develop unless the factors responsible for the original decline of the musky are corrected.Fish StockingLargemouth bass and panfish stocking is unnecessary.  Walleye stocking is not recommended.  Future musky stocking is contigent on the acquistion of a public access and should also consider the results of former stockings in terms of \"trophy-sized\" muskies caught by anglers.Special RegulationsThe following regulations have been in effect on this lake during the past ten years: closed to darkhouse spearing during the winters of 1947-48, 48-49, 49-50, and 1950-51.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Axe Lake is located in central Hubbard County near the town of Emmaville. The lake surface area is 271 acres with a maximum depth of 39 feet. There is no public access. Bad Axe supports good populations of northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass. Minnesota lakes are classified into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Bad Axe is in Lake Class 25. Other area lakes in this class include neighboring Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Eagle, Island, Belle Taine, and Spider.  The 2000 netting showed northern pike at their highest recorded abundance ever, 7.8/gill net, which is at the upper end of the normal range for this lake class. Increased northern pike abundance often leads to smaller average sizes, but the average in Bad Axe Lake was 4 pounds.  Two 30-inch muskie were sampled in gill nets. This species, native to Bad Axe Lake, declined in number when other gamefish species such as northern pike were introduced in the early 1900's. A stocking program from 1950-1969 attempted to restore the muskie fishery, but was discontinued due to lack of a public access. It is likely a few breeding muskie are present, but muskie fry are highly vulnerable to predation and competition from other species. Bad Axe is still a designated muskie lake. Black crappie were abundant in trap nets. Historically this species has been abundant in Bad Axe lake. The average length was 8.7 inches, with good numbers up to 13\" present.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were abundant, although there were few individuals of either species above eight inches. Growth rates of bluegill were good, so it does not appear that sunfish populations are \"stunted\" despite their high numbers. Selective harvest of larger sunfish by anglers may account for the scarcity of larger individuals.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass are both present in Bad Axe. Numbers of largemouth bass seen in trap nets were higher than average; most of these bass were eight inches or less, but trap nets do not catch larger bass very well. The bay on the southwest side of the lake provides largemouth bass habitat while the main lake basin has enough rocky shoreline to attract smallmouth bass.  Other species present in Bad Axe Lake include brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bad Axe Lake is located in central Hubbard County, north of the town of Emmaville.  Bad Axe has a surface area of 271 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet.  There is no public access.  Bad Axe provides angling opportunities for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Bad Axe is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Eagle, Island, Belle Taine, and Spider. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that the northern pike population in Bad Axe fluctuates from low to moderate numbers.  Northern pike abundance (2.0 pike/gillnet) was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Surveys from 1982 to 2000 had higher northern pike abundance, with gillnet catch rates fluctuating within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find that the proportion of large northern pike (> 28.0 inches) is high when compared to other area lakes.  Northern pike exhibited fast growth rates when compared to other class 25 lakes.  Muskellunge are present in Bad Axe and have been sampled in past surveys in low numbers.  Bad Axe was stocked with muskellunge by the DNR from 1950 to 1969.  Private, permitted stockings of muskellunge were done in 2002, 2005, and 2007 by the lake association.  Success of these muskellunge stockings is unknown, as angler reports have been very limited. <br> \n <br> \nBad Axe has an abundant panfish population of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Present and past surveys have shown black crappie and bluegill abundance to be above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find a healthy black crappie population with fish in the 9-12 inch size range.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed tend to run smaller, with fish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Yellow perch are also abundant in Bad Axe; however, average size is small (7.2 inches).  A few larger yellow perch are present with perch measured up to 11.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are present in Bad Axe, with largemouth bass being the more abundant of the two species.  No specialized sampling for bass such as spring electrofishing has been conducted on Bad Axe.  Largemouth bass catch rates with gillnets and trapnets are above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Smallmouth bass were not sampled in 2010, but have been sampled in past surveys in low numbers.  Bad Axe has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white sucker, and moderate numbers of rock bass and yellow bullhead.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",
