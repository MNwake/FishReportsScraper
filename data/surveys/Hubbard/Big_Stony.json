The pounds per catch of northerns was 21.80 compared to the state median of 5.62, which is a very large weight per catch.  Amount of largemouth bass that were netted were three times larger than the state median.  The yellow bullhead catches were quite high above the state median.  The bluegill population is substantially high, but seem to be small in size.Management Recommendations:Continue to manage as a largemouth bass, northern pike, panfish lake.  The spawning facilities for these species are good and the net catch indicates this.  Stocking should not be necessary.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates have been increasing since 1975 and were above the third quartile in 1992 (4.83 fish/set and 9.98 lbs/set).  Mean weight in 1992 was 2.07 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=72, RSD-P=17, RSD-M=3) is dominated by quality-length fish; however, good proportions of walleye are reaching perferred (20.0 inches) and memorable (25.0 inches) in lengths.  Good early growth rates contribute to the high number of quality-length walleye.  Mean length at age 4 is 15.24 inches.  After age 5, however, growth rates decline.  Some walleye natural reproduction is occurring in Big Stony Lake, as evidenced by the 1987 and 1989 year classes, which accounted for 29% of the sampled walleye.  A dominant 1988 (age 4) year class comprised 33% of the sampled walleye.Northern pike gillnet catches (7.33 fish/set and 17.10 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 29.  1982 was the only year in which northern pike abundance was above the third quartile.  However, differences in sampling date may cause some observed fluctuations in net catches for all species.  Mean northern pike weight in 1992 was 2.33 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=30) indicates a small-sized population, but a large proportion of the quality-lenght (>21.0) northern pike are also preferred-length (>28.0 inches).  A gap in the northern pike length-frequency is observed between 19.0 and 26.0 inches.  This gap is the result of varying growth rates between fish of different year classes.  Northern pike age 6 and older averaged 19.54 inches at age 3, whereas northern pike from recent year classes averaged 15.03 inches at age 3.  Analysis of northern pike age structure also suggests consistently high annual recruitment.The number of largemouth bass sampled in 1992 was the highest ever sampled and was above the third quartile for lakes in Class 29.  However, pounds per trapnet were within the normal range.  These catch rates are an indication of the small size structure of the largemouth bass (gillnet PSD=25, trapnet PSD=0).  Slightly slow growth rates (mean lenght at 3 = 8.80 inches) and high densities contribute to small largemouth bass sizes.Pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch were within the normal ranges in 1992.  Only yellow perch have experienced a population increase since 1962.  Pumpkinseed and bluegill densities have declined.  Both of these sunfish species have similar size structures (pumpkinseed PSD=57, bluegill PSD=44).  Although good proportions of the population are quality-length, no pumpkinseed or bluegill sampled were > 8.0 inches.  Slow growth causes the small size structures.  Bluegill average 3.67 inches at age 4.  Black crappie have a higher proportion of quality-length fish (PSD=80) than pumpkinseed and bluegill, but still none of perferred-length (10.0 inches).  Black crappie also exhibit slow growth, averaging 6.32 inches at age 3.  Yellow perch have the smallest size structure (PSD=38) of the panfish species.Gillnet catches of white sucker, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were within the normal ranges, wheras those of black bullhead were below the first quartile for Lake Class 29.  White sucker were first sampled in 1982 and have had no population changes since that time.  Densities of all three bullhead species were above the third quartile in 1987 and have experienced large decreases the past 5 years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Big Stony Lake was conducted on August 2, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations and a 15-foot seine was used at four stations due to deep drop offs. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey conducted the week of July 31, 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Big Stony Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

A public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Anglers will find Big Stony to be a good \"multi-species\" lake, with fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Stony is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Alice, Schoolcraft, and Stocking. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (6.4 walleye/gillnet) was the highest recorded for all surveys dating back to 1962 and above the current management goal of 3 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in previous surveys has generally fluctuated around the current management goal.  Good numbers of walleye in the 10-14 inch size range were sampled and should provide good fishing opportunities the next few years.  Walleye up to 28.0 inches were sampled.  Big Stony is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Northern pike abundance (1.7 pike/gillnet) was down from past surveys, and the lowest recorded for all surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 24.3 inches and 3.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 39.9 inches.  Northern pike exhibited fast growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  Big Stony supports good populations of panfish and largemouth bass.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled in high numbers, however, size ran small with most fish in the 6 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, with crappie in the 9-10 inch range.  Big Stony has an excellent largemouth bass population, known both for numbers and size of fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low to moderate numbers included yellow perch, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and rock bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Stony Lake is located ten miles southeast of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Big Stony has a surface area of 319 acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet.  A public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department  of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Stony is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Alice, Schoolcraft, and Stocking.  Anglers will find Big Stony to be a good \"multi-species\" lake, with fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.Walleye were sampled (3.6 walleye/gillnet) within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and at the current management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  Surveys since the late 1980's have had very stable and similar walleye abundance, while walleye were found in low numbers in surveys prior to the early 1980's.  While all sizes of walleye were sampled, anglers will find good numbers of 12-15 inch walleye (1999 and 2000 year classes) present in the lake.  The walleye population in Big Stony is being maintained by an aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR.  Big Stony is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.Northern pike numbers (4.8 pike/gillnet) were similar to past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2 pounds, however, larger pike are present with fish measured up to 39.0 inches.  Big Stony supports good populations of panfish and largemouth bass.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers and anglers will find lots of fish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low to moderate numbers with crappie in the 9-10 inch range.  Big Stony has an excellent largemouth bass population, known both for numbers and size of fish.Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and pumpkinseed and low numbers of yellow perch, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Stony is located in southern Hubbard County, seven miles south-east of Park Rapids. Big Stony has a surface area of 343 acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet. A DNR owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake. Big Stony provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Stony is in class 34. Class 34 lakes are generally characterized as regularly shaped, shallow, turbid lakes with hard water. Other class 34 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Alice, Schoolcraft, and Stocking. <br> \nWalleye abundance was the highest ever recorded on Big Stony, with two strong year classes of fish that are 12 to 16 inch in length.  These fish should provide good angling both now and in the near future. Walleye sampled had an average length of 14.4 inches with fish measuring up to 23.6 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in low numbers and generally too small for anglers. <br> \nBig Stony supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  The 2022 sample was in line with recent surveys, with an average length of 10.6 inches and the largest at 16.9 inches.  <br> \nBig Stony supports a good Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year-round. Anglers will find good numbers of Black Crappie in the 7.5 - 10 inch size range, with fish up to 11.7 inches sampled. Big Stony also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed, with most fish in the 6 - 7.5 inch size range. <br> \nTo avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Stoney Lake is a 319-acre lake which lies about ten miles southeast of Park Rapids, Minnesota.  It has a maximum depth of 24 feet with about 70% of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  The shoreline is comprised mainly of sand, rubble, and gravel.  The inlet is from a slough on the southwest which also furnishes some good northern pike spawning area.  There is no outlet.  Fishes which were taken at numbers greater than the statewide median catch per set were bullhead, northern pike, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and crappie.  The walleye taken were large in size and few in number.  There are two resorts on this lake with 12 units, 14 private cabins and 29 boats.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were three fish houses on the lake.Fish Stocking:No walleye were taken under 20 inches in length which shows a lack of natural reproduction.  To build up a good population, it will be necessary to stock this species periodically.</p>",

Big Stoney has a surface area of 319 acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet.  A public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Stoney is in lake class 34.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Alice (6 miles northwest of Lake George), Schoolcraft (18 miles north of Park Rapids), and Stocking (10 miles northeast of Park Rapids).Walleye were sampled at a rate of 3.5/gillnet, within the range typical for lake class 34.  Walleye gillnet catch rates have increased and remained stable since the 1980's: 1.8/net (1982), 4.0/net (1987), and 4.8/net (1992).  Walleye gillnet catch rates were lower in earlier surveys, 1.3/net (1962) and 0.0/net (1975).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 6.6 to 29.1 inches with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The walleye population in Big Stoney is maintained by fingerling stockings in even calendar years.  Eighteen of the twenty-one walleye that were aged (86%) corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other area lakes.The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 5.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 34.  Historical northern pike gillnet catch rates have ranged from 5.8/net (1962) to 13.0/net (1982).  Average size of northern pike was fair, averaging 19.0 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Larger northern pike are present, however, with fish sampled up to 37.6 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were similar to other class 34 lakes.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 9.5/net is within the range typical for lake class 34 and similar to past surveys.  With the exception of 1962 (0.3/net), historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have been stable, ranging from 5.8/net (1978) to 26.0/net (1974).  The yellow perch population in Big Stoney  primarily provides a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations and are generally an unacceptable size to anglers.  Sampled yellow perch were an average length of 7.1 inches with fish measured up to 9.4 inches.Black crappie were sampled at low rates (0.2/gillnet and 0.7/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 34.  Black crappie catches have dropped from earlier surveys for both gear types.  Black crappie trapnet catch rates were 3.8/net (1962) and 4.3/net (1975), while latter survey trapnet catch rates ranged from 0.0/net (1982) to 1.1/net (1992).  Black crappie up to 9.4 inches were sampled with growth rates similar to other area lakes.Bluegill were sampled at moderate rates (26.7/net), within the range typical for lake class 34. Historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have been higher, ranging from 39.4/net (1974) to 118.3/net (1962).  Sampled bluegill were an average length of 6.3 inches, with fish sampled up to 8.3 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 34 lakes.Largemouth bass were sampled within the typical range for lake class 34, and similar to past surveys.  Largemouth bass up to 19.4 inches were sampled.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass population, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Big Stoney.  Big Stoney has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass population.Pumpkinseed were sampled at low rates (2.2/trapnet), but within the range typical for lake class 34.  Historical pumpkinseed trapnet catch rates have fluctuated from 1.0/net (1974) to 22.8/net (1984).  Pumpkinseed up to 7.6 inches were sampled.White sucker were sampled at high rates (11.8/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 34.  Yellow and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Big Stoney and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sony is located ten miles southwest of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Big Stony has a surface area of 343 acres and a maximum depth of 24 feet.  A public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake.  Big Stony provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Stony is in lake class 34.  Class 34 lakes are generally characterized as small, shallow lakes with hard water. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the range for similar type lakes and at the current management goal.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-16 inch size range.  Big Stony is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Northern pike abundance was within the range for similar type lakes, and comparable to historical surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 34 inches.  Present and past surveys have shown Big Stony to support good populations of panfish and largemouth bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Past surveys have shown bluegill abundance to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers, while black crappie have cycled from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find an excellent largemouth bass population, known for both numbers and sizes of bass.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetative cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Big Stony. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in moderate numbers included white sucker, yellow bullhead, and rock bass.  Black and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Stony.  Boaters should take extra care and precaution to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Stony Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, ten miles southwest of Park Rapids. Big Stony is 343 acres with a maximum depth of 24 feet. A state-owned public access is located on the southwest shore off of 209th Avenue.  Big Stony provides angling opportunities for panfish, Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Big Stony is in lake class 34. Class 34 lakes are generally characterized as regularly shaped, shallow, turbid lakes with hard water.  Other class 34 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Alice, Schoolcraft and Stocking. <br> \nBig Stony is a popular lake for panfish.  Angling opportunities include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed.  Black Crappies were small, and sampled from 4-9 inches in length.  Most Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were from 3-7.5 inches, with a few fish exceeding 8 inches.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was good, with a great average size for anglers of 15.5 inches and 1.25 pounds.   Most fish sampled were suitable for anglers ranging from 14-19 inches. <br> \nAnglers can also expect to find Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike in Big Stony.  Largemouth Bass were an average size of 11 inches, with fish sampled up to 16 inches.  Northern Pike had an average size of 24 inches, with fish sampled up to 33 inches. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Stony. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
