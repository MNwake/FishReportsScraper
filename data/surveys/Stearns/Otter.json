Until such time as land is purchased and a public access constructed, the lake should be managed as a waterfowl lake. Any work, such as stocking, is a waste of time, resources, and manpower in view of the limited fishing pressure and the proximity of Clearwater Lake, offering better & more varied fishing.  Otter Lake is also not suitable as a rearing area due to the difficulty in gaining access and the deep median depth making trapping & seining difficult. Few desired fish species were found and those present were small in size.</p>",

Public access is through a navigable channel from Clearwater Lake. Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are present in the lake. Otter Lake was surveyed in August 2011. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was lower than the last survey in 2001, but typical for lakes similar to Otter. The average size was 20 inches and two pounds. The largest northern pike caught was 37.5 inches. Northern pike growth was similar to other lakes statewide.  Northern pike grew 18 to 19 inches in three years. Fifteen percent of northern pike were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May. The catch rate was average, but 49% of bass were greater than 15 inches. The average size was 14 inches and two pounds. The largest bass captured was 18 inches and growth was fast. Largemouth bass grew to 11 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate was lower than in 2001, but within the expected range for lakes similar to Otter. Walleye size was good; the average length was 21 inches and three pounds. The largest walleye caught was 28.5 inches. Growth was fast; walleye grew 15 to 17 inches in three years. Otter lake is not stocked, but walleye migrate from Clearwater Lake, which is stocked with walleye fry every other year. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were higher than 2001 and higher than expected for lakes similar to Otter. The average size was half a pound and 8.5 inches. The largest crappie caught was 10.5 inches. Growth was fast. Black crappie grew to nine inches in three years <br> \n. <br> \nBluegill numbers increased from 2001, but were in the expected range for similar lakes. The average size was six inches and 0.2 pounds. The largest bluegill captured was 8 inches.  Growth was average and bluegill grew to seven inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were captured in 2011 or 2001. Other species caught in 2011 included: bowfin, green and hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill abundance (18.7/trap net) is average and similar to that found in 1972. Growth in 1972 was above average but is now below average. Most are small and either age 2 or 4. Black Crappie numbers (9.7/trap net) are twice the local average and much higher than in 1972 (1.0/trap net). Most were small with below average growth. Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Green Sunfish, not caught in 1985, occurred in low numbers in 1972. Rock Bass, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and Cisco numbers were below average, with the Pumpkinseed catch of Ciscoes in 1972 may be due to the netting being done in September. The abundance of White Suckers appears to be close to the local median of 1.0/ gill net. Yellow Bullhead (10.0/trap net) numbers are four times the 1972 catch and more than twice the local average. Bowfin were again caught in average numbers. Black Bullhead abundance is below average while Brown Bullheads and Common Carp were not netted in 1985.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Otter Lake is located 2.5 miles east of the town of Fairhaven. The lake is 96 acres in size, has a maximum depth of 51 feet and is largely undeveloped. An extensive cattail fringe surrounds most of the lake and the lake bottom drops off sharply beyond the cattails. Water quality is good. Otter Lake is attached to Clearwater Lake by a navigable channel and a public access is located nearby on Clearwater Lake. A high quality fishery exists for both northern pike and walleye.Northern pike were more numerous and larger than expected compared to similar lakes. Both size and number of pike have increased since the last survey in 1985; average length and weight were 22.6 inches and 3.4 pounds. The largest individual was 37.6 inches and several fish over 30 inches were caught. Walleye numbers appeared to be within the expected range for a lake like Otter, but average size was high. Mean length and weight were 23.3 inches and 4.6 pounds; the largest walleye captured was 27.6 inches.Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing at less than half the median rate for the area. However, the sharp drop-offs along the cattails that line the lakeshore made sampling difficult. The average length for bass was 12.1 inches, the largest individual was 15.4 inches and growth was slow compared to other populations in the state. Bluegill numbers were within the range expected for a lake like Otter, but average size was low (4.3 inches). Bluegill growth was also slow. The low abundance of bluegill may be hindering largemouth bass growth and both species may suffer from a lack of spawning habitat. Black crappie numbers were typical for lakes like Otter, but larger than average. No yellow perch were captured in the 2001 survey. Otter Lake should continue to provide a quality fishery if development and angling pressure remain low. Good land management practices in the watershed should be encouraged and may improve water quality. To maintain the high quality fishery for northern pike and walleye, anglers should practice selective harvest by keeping smaller fish to eat and releasing most large fish (pike >24 inches, walleye >20 inches).</p>",
