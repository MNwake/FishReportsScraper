THERE WERE SOME CISCO (2.50/LIFT) AND ONE WHITE SUCKER CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS.THERE WAS A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF BLUEGILL (58.0/TRAPNET LIFT).  THIS WAS ALSO THE HIGHEST ABUNDANCE OF BLUEGILL FOR LAKES IN THIS CHAIN.   THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM <3.0 TO 7.5 INCHES, WITH BIMODAL LENGTH GROUPS OF 5.5-5.9 INCHES AND 6.0-6.4 INCHES.  THE PSD FOR BLUEGILL WAS 34 AND WAS SIMILAR TO OTHER LAKES IN THE CHAIN (21-52).  THE GROWTH WAS SLOW FOR ALL AGES.  TWO BLACK CRAPPPIE WERE CAUGHT, FOR A CATCH RATE OF 0.5/TRAPNET LIFT.  THEY WERE 7.5 AND 9 INCHES LONG.  TWO LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE ALSO CAUGHT (0.5/TRAPNET LIFT).  THEY WERE 7.5 AND 9.5 INCHES LONG.  ICE OUT TRAPNETTING AND/OR NIGHT ELECTROFISHING WILL NEED TO BE CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO BETTER ASSESS LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLACK CRAPPIE.</p>",
