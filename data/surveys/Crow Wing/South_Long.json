The lake reaches depths of 47', with 35% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Emergent vegetation such as bulrush and water lilies surround much of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked as fingerlings every other year.  In addition, 600,000 surplus walleye fry (newly hatched) from the Brainerd DNR hatchery were stocked in 2019.  The walleye gill net catch was the lowest to date in 2022 at 2.5/net.  Average length was 16.1, with 77% at least 12\" long.  There does seem to be a good crop of young walleyes present as 16% of the fish caught were under 8\", a size not frequently caught in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in low numbers as well at 2.6/gill net.  Average size was 24.3\" with 53% of the fish in the 22-26\" protected slot and 8% over 26\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers (0.7/gill net) in 2022.  Average length was 8.8\" and 50% were at least 8.0\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe invasive species faucet snails and zebra mussels were both discovered to be in South Long in 2021. Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower South Long lake is a 1313 acre lake about 7 miles southeast of Brainerd.  A public access is present on the southwest shore.  The lake is classified as a hardwater lake.  About 35% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is slightly below average for the area.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand, with areas of rubble-sized rock present as well.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse.  Emergent plant species such as bulrush provide spawning, feeding and cover sites for many fish species, most notably largemouth bass, black crappies and bluegills.  Wild rice can provide spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged plants grow to a depth of about 15 feet in the lake.  Because they provide these important features, all vegetation removal permits should be carefully considered before being granted.Walleyes were the most abundant gamefish in the 1999 test netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, their abundance was high, but not much different from rates found in previous nettings.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year since 1984.  A variety of walleye stockings have been done since about 1950.  Walleyes from both stocked and nonstocked years were taken in the nets in 1999.  Walleye averaged 1.2 pounds in 1999, similar to the 1.5 pound average in 1995 and 1.4 pounds in 1989.Other game species taken in 1999 included northern pike and largemouth bass.  Northern pike numbers were average compared to similar lake types and typical for this lake, based on previous nettings.  Growth was good.  About 70% of sampled northern pike were from the 1996 and 1997 year classes.  Largemouth bass were caught in average numbers in 1999 by trapnets, gillnets, special spring trapnets and electrofishing.  The majority of the bass sampled were from the 1997 year class and had good growth.Panfish species present in the 1999 netting included bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, hybrid sunfish and black crappies.  Bluegills were found in high numbers compared to other similar lake types.  About 3% of the bluegills caught were 7.0 inches long or more.  Bluegill growth was average.  Black crappies were caught in above average numbers.  Most were from the 1997 year class and had good growth.Several forager species were present in 1999 netting.  All provide important food sources for the lake's gamefish.  Yellow perch were caught in average numbers.  They ranged from 5.0 to 8.4 inches in the gillnets and average 6.0 inches long.  Tullibees were present in average numbers, as were white suckers.Other species present in 1999 included high numbers of bowfin, yellow bullheads and brown bullheads.  Catch rates for these species were similar to previous nettings.  No carp were sampled, even though they are present in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower South Long Lake is a 1,313 acre lake located about 7 miles southeast of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the southwest shore.  The lake is heavily developed with 29.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1999 data.  Many of these are small seasonal cabins and conversion of these may be an issue in the future.  The maximum depth is 47' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders, and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 40 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nThe 2007 walleye catch of 5.3/gill net is average when compared to similar lakes and represents an increase over the 2004 catch of 3.0/gill net which was the lowest to date.  Seven different year classes were represented with the 2001, 2004, and 2005 year classes accounting for 85% of the current population.  Average length and weight were similar to 2004 at 15.8\" and 1.5lbs.\n\nNorthern pike were caught in above average numbers for the second consecutive netting at 14.5/gill net.  This is the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight were 20.1\" and 1.8lbs.  Only 9% of these fish measured at least 24\".  The 2004 and 2005 year classes were most abundant, representing 84% of the catch and measuring approximately 16-23\".  \n\nThe largemouth bass abundance of 1.1/trap net and 1.2/gill net is typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 186/hr with an average length of 10.4\" and 24% measuring at least 12\". \n\nThe 2004 bluegill catch of 34.4/trap net, it is average when compared to similar lakes, however only 3% measured at least 7\".  Black crappies were also present in average numbers when compared to past catches on this and similar lakes.\n\nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Tullibee abundance was below average and the lowest to date at 0.3/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance has varied widely in the past, ranging from 2.1 to 49.2/gill net.  The 2007 catch was somewhat low at 7.5/gill net, likely due in part to relatively high numbers of other game fish.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower South Long is a 1313 acre lake located about seven miles southeast of Brainerd.  A public access is present on the southwest shore.  The lake is classified as a \"hardwater\" lake.  About 35% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Water clarity is slightly below average for the area.  Shallow water soils are predominately sand, with areas of rubble-sized rock (3-10\") present as well.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species, especially bulrush, provide preferred spawning sites for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice can provide spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submergent plants grow to a depth of about 15 feet in the lake.  They provide important areas for shelter and feeding for a wide variety of fish species.Walleyes were the most abundant gamefish found in the 1994 test netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, their abundance was \"high\" but not much different from the \"average\" catch rate found in the 1989 netting.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year since 1984.  A variety of walleye stockings have been done since about 1950.  Walleyes from years when stocking was done were about as abundant in the catch as were fish from years when no stocking was done.  Walleyes averaged 1.5 lbs. in '94, similar to the 1.4 lb. average in the '89 netting.Other game species taken in '94 included northern pike and largemouth bass.  Northern pike numbers were \"low\" compared to similar type lakes but were typical for the lake, based on results of past nettings.  Average size was 3.3 lbs. and growth was good.  About 56% of sampled northern pike were from the 1991 year class.  Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers in '94.  Most bass sampled were from the 1990 year class and had good growth.Panfish species present in the '94 netting included bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, hybrid sunfish and black crappies.  Bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers compared with similar type lakes.  About 7% of of bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.  Bluegill growth was slow until age 6, then improved.  Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers, as well.  Most were from the 1990 year class and had good growth.Several \"forage\" species were present in the '94 netting.  All provide important food sources for the lake's gamefish.  Yellow perch were caught in \"average\" numbers.  They ranged from 5.3-11.3 inches long in the sample from gillnets and averaged 7.8 inches.  Tullibees were present in \"average\" numbers, as were white suckers.Other species present in '94 included \"high\" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullheads and \"low\" numbers of black and brown bullheads.  Catch rates for these species were similar to catches made in '89.  One common carp was sampled; the first since the '79 netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Long Lake is a 1295-acre lake with a maximum depth of 47 feet.  Residential development is evident along much of the shoreline. The riparian zone has been altered; trees have been removed along much of the shoreline and manicured lawns extending to the water's edge and rip rap is common.  Emergent vegetation is still abundant in select portions of the lake.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted on South Long Lake beginning on June 26th, 2013 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Eighteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 18 stations around the perimeter of South Long Lake.  Sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining (15 ft or 50ft) was conducted at 14 sites. Depth, emergent vegetation as well as soft sediments prevented seining at four sites.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured a large number of species of fish including: (in alphabetical order) Banded Killifish, Black crappie, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, Common Carp, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Greater Redhorse, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least darter, Logperch, Northern Pike, Pugnose Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore survey of South Long Lake captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality including: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Greater Redhorse, Iowa Darter, Least darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass. Three tolerant species, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish, were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data to develop an IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) score which is indicative of the health of South Long Lake. This sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in development in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Long is a 1,309 acre lake located seven miles southeast of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 47', with 35% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Emergent vegetation such as bulrush and water lilies surround much of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked as 5-6\", 5-month-old fingerlings every other year.  In addition, 600,000 surplus walleye fry (newly hatched) from the Brainerd DNR hatchery were stocked in 2019.  The walleye gill net catch of 4.0/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 17.5\", with 79% measuring at least 12.0\" in length.  Walleyes up to 28.3\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also sampled in average numbers at 6.0/gill net.  Average length was 22.9\", with 44% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern pike at least 26.0\" made up only 8% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a good rate of 127.5/hr run-time.  Average length was 12.0\", with 56% at least 12.0\" in length.  Largemouth bass were sampled in above average numbers in gill nets at 2.1/net.  Average length was 13.1\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill nets (2.4/net) and trap nets (1.3/net).  Average length was 8.2\" in gill nets and 7.9\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 41% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were also captured in average numbers at 8.8/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with an average of 4.9\".  Only 5% measured at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in South Long Lake, but Upper South Long has Eurasian watermilfoil.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower South Long Lake is a 1,313 acre lake located about 7 miles southeast of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the southwest shore.  The lake is heavily developed with 29.6 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1999 data.  Many of these are small seasonal cabins and conversion of these may be an issue in the future.  The maximum depth is 47' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders, and muck are also present.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 40 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2004 walleye catch of 3.0/gill net was below average and the lowest catch to date.  Nine different year classes were represented with both natural reproduction and stocking accounting for the current population.  Average length and weight were similar to 1999 at 15.6\" and 1.3lbs.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2004 at 13.5/gill net.  This is the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight decreased from 23.6\" and 3.2 lbs in 1999 to 21.3\" and 2.1 lbs in 2004.  Growth was average with 14% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  The 2000 and 2001 year classes were most abundant, representing 65% of the catch and measuring approximately 16-23\".  The largemouth bass abundance of 0.7/trap net was typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 95.3/hr with an average length of 11.3\" and 50% measuring at least 12\". The 2004 bluegill catch declined from 1999, but at 21.3/trap net, it is typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in low numbers (0.3/gill net and 0.4/trap net) when compared to similar lakes and were among the lowest catches to date on this lake.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The 2004 tullibee catch was average at 2.1/gill net and is comparable to similar lakes.  Yellow perch abundance has varied widely in the past, ranging from 2.2 to 49.2/gill net.  The 2004 catch was below average and the lowest to date, likely due in part to an increase in northern pike abundance.  </p>",

However, with a rate of 65.4/hr it still seems plenty healthy.  Size was nice, with an average length of 13.1\" and 70% measuring 12\" or longer.  The largest fish measured 19.8\". <br> \n <br> \nAverage numbers of bluegill and black crappies were caught, but size appeared to be small.  The average size bluegill was only 5.2\" and 37% of the black crappies were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species and they were at their lowest numbers ever at 1.9/net.
