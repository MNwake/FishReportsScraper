                "narrative": "<p>Northen cisco have been collected in Kid Lake during the past two assessments, but not during the previous two.The northern pike gillnet catch of 5.0 is within the historical range of 2.5 to 7.0.  All of the fish collected during this assessment were less than 26 inches long.  Previous assessments sampled fish larger than 30 inches.The bluegill trapnet catch of 48.4 is near the historical range of 10.8 to 36.3.  There is a decline in PSD and RSD-7 values when compared to the 1959 values (PSD: 1959-76; 1990-51 and RSD-7: 1959-31 and 1990-15).  The growth rate determined from the 1990 sample of bluegill is slower than the growth rate reported for the 1959 sample.Largemouth bass and black crappie are present in Kid Lake, probably in greater abundance than indicated by mid-summer gillnetting and trapnetting.The yellow perch gillnet catch of 10.0 is within the historical range of 6.5 to 13.2.The gillnet catch of walleye (6.0 in 1990; historical range of 5.5 to 10.2) is high when considering the type of shoal water soils present in Kid Lake and that no walleye stocking is done.  This past assessment, as well as all previous, sampled several year classes of walleye indicating excellent natural reproduction even though classic walleye spawning substrate appears very limited in Kid Lake.  Walleye could immigrate into Kid Lake from downstream lakes.  Immature fish have been present in every assessemnt, thus immigration is not likely the only source of walleye for Kid Lake.</p>",

There were above average catches of yellow perch, walleye, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegills, and rock bass. 2. The catches of dogfish and northern pike were about average. 3. The catches of common suckers, brown bullheads, yellow bullheads, and black crappie were below average.  The growth rate of northern pike was above average.  Growth rates of walleye and largemouth bass were about average and the growth rates of pumpkinseed and bluegill were slightly below average when compared with the statewide average growth rate figures.The methods of fishing most commonly used on the lake are trolling for northern pike and walleye and still-fishing for panfish.  The angling success for the current season has been good for walleye and panfish.  Reports on past angling history indicate that fishing success has remained quite constant during the past ten years, except crappie fishing success has declined during the past two years.</p>",
