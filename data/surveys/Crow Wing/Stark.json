The lake has a maximum depth of 66'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on 02 August 2016, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at one station, and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional four stations.  Five stations had heavy vegetation which would not allow for seining.  Six species were sampled including blacknose shiner and blackchin shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 18-21 July 2016 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Stark Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stark Lake is a 215 acre lake located 9 miles southeast of Emily in northeast Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 66', with areas 15' deep or less making up 53% of the lake.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake. Water lilies and bulrush surround much of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 5.0/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 20.1\", with 10% at least 24\" in length.  Northern pike up to 34.8\" were sampled.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger pike will help maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked by the DNR into Stark, but fingerlings were stocked by the lake association in 2004 and 2006.  A few of these fish are still present and may present a bonus catch to anglers.  Four walleyes were sampled in 2016 with an average length of 22.9\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in gillnets (3.0/net), and in high numbers in trapnets (7.8/net).  Average length for black crappies in gillnets was 7.5\", and 7.9\" for trapnet sampled fish.  For both gears combined 43% were at least 8\" in length with the largest measuring 9.7\".  The 9\" crappies sampled were 5 or 6 years old.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers in trapnets at 27.6/net.  Average length was 6.6\", with 48% at least 7\" in length.  The 9\" bluegills sampled were 12 years old.  Catch and release of some of these larger bluegills can help to maintain quality bluegill populations. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Stark Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
