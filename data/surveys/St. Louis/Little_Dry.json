                "narrative": "<p>Little Dry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 9, which consists of 48 lakes in northeastern Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Dry Lake thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of about 13 ft, where the water temperature is about 62 F.  Partial winterkills have occurred in Little Dry Lake.Little Dry Lake has no inlets.  The outlet is a short channel, 4 ft deep and 10 ft wide, that was blasted through a gravel ridge to adjacent Dry Lake in 1988 to provide an escape route for fish during winters with poor under-ice oxygen.  Little Dry Lake has been stocked with trout since 1967, but has not often been directly stocked since 1988.  Instead, trout are stocked in Dry Lake and migrate in via the connecting channel.  Brown trout or splake have been stocked annually in these lakes since 1992.This special assessment, like many of the previous assessments, consisted of gillnets set early in the spring.  Trapnets were not used due to the difficult portage access.  The purpose of the assessment was to evaluate stream trout populations without undue mortality, and to examine populations of other fish species.The total catch of trout in 2001 (all species combined) of 2.5 lb/gillnet was lower than the long term average catch in this lake of 4.7 lb/gillnet and was lower than the median catch of 5.0 lb/gillnet in recent investigations on 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.The three brown trout captured in 2001 ranged in length from 11.6\" to 13.6\" and had grown from 7\" yearlings in the 12 months after being stocked in the spring of 2000.  No brown trout from the 1997 or 1993 stockings were captured.  Two brown trout stomachs contained minnows and one contained midge larvae.The four splake captured in 2001 ranged in length from 10\" to 14\" and had been stocked as fingerlings in 1998 or 1999.  Two splake stomachs contained minnows and insects; the other two splake were released alive.Sucker and cisco numbers in 2001 were higher than in most previous investigations.  The numbers of these species have been generally higher since the channel to Dry Lake was made in 1988.    </p>",

Little Dry Lake thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of about 13 ft, where the water temperature is about 62 F. Little Dry Lake has no inlets.  The outlet is a short channel, 4 ft deep and 10 ft wide, which was blasted through a gravel ridge to adjacent Dry Lake in 1988.  This was done to provide an escape route for fish during winters with poor under-ice oxygen, something that had been observed twice in the 1980's.  Little Dry Lake was poisoned in 1966 to remove populations of sucker, rock bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch, and has been stocked with trout since 1967.  Since 1988 the trout quota for Little Dry Lake has been stocked in Dry Lake and trout migrate in via the channel connecting the lakes.  Brown trout (one year of every three) or splake (two years of every three) have been stocked in these lakes since 1992.This trout assessment, like most of the twelve previous trout assessments, consisted of low numbers of gillnets set early in the summer when surface waters are still cool.  Trapnets were not used due to the difficult portage access.The total catch of trout in 2005 of 4.4 lbs/gillnet was similar to the median trout catch of 4.2 lbs/gillnet in all trout assessments on this lake and was also similar to the median trout catch of 3.9 lbs/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Nine brown trout ranging in size from 11.6\" to 18.0\" were captured in the 2005 assessment.  These fish were in good condition, and although three had empty stomachs, food items in the others included snails, fish (minnows, darters, small white sucker), crayfish, and dragonfly nymphs.One small (7.7\") splake, from the fall, 2004 fingerling stocking, was captured in 2005.  Other recent assessments captured more splake than in 2005.High numbers of sucker and low numbers of cisco and bluegill sunfish were also captured in the 2005 assessment.  The suckers and bluegill were mostly small, while the cisco were fairly large.   </p>",

No improved shore fishing sites are present, but the lake is accessible from the trail in spots. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey consisted of one standardized gillnet set. Sampling was done in tandem with Dry Lake. Splake, bluegill, and white sucker were sampled. Splake abundance (7/net) was above average. Lengths ranged from 7 to 19 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Splake from three years appeared to be present, and most of the fish were yearlings from the previous stocking. No brown trout were captured in this survey, but they were sampled in good numbers in connected Dry Lake. <br> \n</p>",

Either brown trout yearlings or splake fingerlings are currently being stocked annually by float plane in adjacent Dry Lake.\n\nBrown trout (3.5/gill net) and splake (3.5/gill net) were sampled in the 2013 population assessment. The average length of the brown trout was 12.1 inches while the splake averaged 9.9 inches long. White sucker were sampled in good numbers (23.5/gill net) and their average length was 10.6 inches long. Golden shiner and cisco are also present.

The access to the lake is by water from Dry Lake on the lake's north side.  There are no substantial inlets and no outlet, other than its connection with Dry Lake.  The surrounding landscape of Little Dry is rolling forest land.  It has a maximum depth of 27 feet and clear water.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Little Dry Lake is listed as a separate lake, it was surveyed at the same time as Dry and we assume the fish move freely between the two lakes.  Information on the Dry Lake survey can also be found in LakeFinder.   <br> \n <br> \nTypical mid-summer dissolved oxygen levels are generally adequate for trout to moderate depths.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline were dominated by boulder and rubble with some areas of sand and gravel.  The lake is completely undeveloped and is surrounded by US Forest Service land.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 1966 and 1976 reclamation projects were done on Little Dry.  Since 1967 Little Dry has a long history of being stocked at different times with brook trout, brown trout, and splake.  Brown trout and splake are the two species currently being stocked in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly brown trout and white sucker were sampled in this survey.  The gillnet catch of brown trout by weight was 2.1 pounds/net which was below average compared to past surveys on the lake as well as other surveys of trout lakes in the area.  Note that trout abundance is expressed in terms of pounds/net rather than number/net to reduce the influence of occasional high catches of just-stocked fingerlings.  Lengths ranged from 10 to just over 17 inches with an average of just over 13 inches which was comparable to past Little Dry surveys.  Considering the sizes, these fish were likely 1 or 3 years old.  No splake were sampled in this survey however several were caught in the Dry Lake survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch was 16 fish/net which was above average for the lake however sizes were relatively small compared to past surveys.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Dry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 9, which consists of 48 lakes in northeastern Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft and somewhat turbid water.  Little Dry Lake is very typical of lakes in this Lake Class.  The water column in Little Dry Lake stratifies in midsummer and there is less than 5 ppm oxygen below about 13 ft, at which depth the water temperature is about 62 F.  Trout require at least 5 ppm oxygen. Partial oxygen depletion under the ice in some winters has resulted in winterkill of some fish, especially trout because they require more oxygen than other fish species.Little Dry Lake has no inlets.  The outlet is a short channel, 4 ft deep and 10 ft wide, which was blasted through a gravel ridge to adjoining Dry Lake in 1988 to provide an escape route for fish during winters with poor oxygen.  Little Dry Lake has been stocked with trout since 1967, most recently with splake.  Splake are a hybrid of brook trout and lake trout.The single gillnet set in 1996 caught 3.2 lb of trout (both brown trout and splake), which is lower than the long term average of 4.8 lb/gillnet for Little Dry Lake, and is also much lower than the average of 10.6 lb/gillnet for 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.  Also captured in 1996 were 28 white sucker, which is higher than usual for this lake, and 9 cisco, which have been captured only occasionally in Little Dry Lake.  Cisco, like trout, require high oxygen levels.The four brown trout caught in 1996 averaged 12.7 in and ranged from 11.6 in to 13.6 in.  These trout were migrants from adjacent Dry Lake.  They had been stocked as yearlings in the spring of 1994 at the average length of 9 in and had grown to their size at capture in 25 months, which is poor growth.  The five splake caught in 1996 averaged 8.0 in and ranged from 7.4 in to 8.2 in.  These trout had been stocked the previous fall at the average length of 5 in.  None of the splake stocked in adjacent Dry Lake in 1993 were caught in 1996.Both species of trout appeared to be in good condition and had been eating zooplankton, insects, and minnows.</p>",
