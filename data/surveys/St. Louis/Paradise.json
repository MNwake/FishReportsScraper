Paradise is located 10 miles WNW of Two Harbors, MN off County #266 (Fox Farm Road).  Paradise Lake has a gravel, back-in access administered by the township and located on the south shore.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1974 and 2000.     Fish species sampled during the 2000 lake survey included black crappie, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, white sucker, yellow perch and spottail shiner.  The only species not sampled in low numbers were black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed assessment net catch rates were 1.9 and 2.3 per trapnet lift.  Both of these values were typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of simialr type.  Mean length of black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish was 11.3 and 6.6 inches.  Length of black crappie at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 9.9 inches.  This is a fast rate of growth compared to other crappie populations sampled from Duluth area lakes.  From a sample of aged black crappie, five year classes were documented from 1991 to 1997.</p>",
