The failure to collect rainbow trout in trap nets was unsual for this lake, although past trap net catches have usually been low.  All of the rainbow trout collected had been stocked as yearlings in May 2000, and they had doubled their weight since being stocked.The attempt to manage this lake for splake by stocking fingerlings annually has failed.  The failure was probably due to the presence of walleye and smallmouth bass in the lake, which prey directly on the small fingerlings stocked.Walleye were collected in average numbers for the lake class.  Reproduction was sporadic, but sufficient to maintain the population.  Walleye growth rates had been fast, and some large fish were present.  No smallmouth bass were taken in the 2000 assessment, but angler reports indicated they were still present.</p>",

In 2010, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Leo Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were abundant in Leo Lake in the fall of 2010.  Most of the fish collected in the 2010 assessment were  age-1 fish from a spring 2010 stocking of Arlee-strain yearlings.  Despite the presence of walleye and smallmouth bass (both highly undesirable in a stream trout lake), survival of stocked yearlings appeared to have been good, and stocked fish seemed to have grown reasonably well. <br> \n <br> \nThe presence of walleye in a stream trout lake is unusual in this area.  The walleye gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and the mean weight for walleye taken was above the normal range.  Anglers have reported some good walleye fishing from this lake, and harvest of walleye from Leo Lake (within the legal limits) is encouraged.  All walleye collected in 2010 had been produced naturally.  Several year classes were represented in the catch, although none had been exceptionally strong.  Walleye growth had been fast.  <br> \n <br> \nCatches of smallmouth bass in gill nets and trap nets in 2010 were similar to catches observed in this lake in the past.  Smallmouth bass may have produced a strong year class in 2010 - young-of-year fish were abundant. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, backpack electrofishing gear, and quarter-inch-mesh wire minnow traps.  Prior to sampling done in 2010, Leo Lake was known to support natural populations of walleye, smallmouth bass, green sunfish, white sucker, pearl dace, and bluegill.  White sucker had not been sampled since 1990, and no pearl dace had been taken since 1981.  Nearshore sampling  in 2010 added Iowa darter to the list of fish species known to be present in this lake.  <br> \n <br> \n  </p>",

Rainbow trout were larger than usual, ranging from 13 to 19 inches long.  All were 1 or 2 years old, and had been stocked.Three smallmouth bass were caught.  They were estimated to have been seven and eight years old.  Smallmouth bass may be more abundant than these netting results suggest, since they are not caught in nets as readily as some other species.Walleye abundance was normal for this class of lake, but was the highest observed for Leo Lake.  Walleye were larger than usual, ranging from 16 to 31 inches long.Green sunfish up to 5.5 inches long were caught.Walleye, smallmouth bass, and green sunfish are all undesirable species in a lake managed for stream trout.  They compete with trout for forage, and walleye and smallmouth bass prey directly on stocked trout.</p>",

All the fish taken in the 2006 assessment had been stocked as yearlings in May 2006.  Growth of stocked rainbow trout had apparently been good; they doubled their weight between early May and late September.  Walleye, which are considered an undesirable species in a stream trout lake, have been present in Leo Lake since at least 1983.  A few small walleye were collected in the 2006 assessment, although anglers have reported that larger fish are also present.  No smallmouth bass were collected in 2006; however, they have also been present in Leo lake for many years, and it was likely that some were still present in 2006.  Anglers fishing this lake are urged to harvest any smallmouth bass and walleye they catch (and can legally keep).  Both species can prey directly on stocked trout, and both compete with trout for forage.  The presence of these species has limited management options for Leo Lake and caused the failure of some past stocking efforts. <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

Since 2007 it has been stocked exclusively with rainbow trout.  The 2015 survey was the first of two scheduled in the 2011 lake management plan to determine whether a switch to kamloop-strain yearlings, begun in 2013, would result in better attainment of management goals in the lake, particularly better long-term survival of stocked fish.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were abundant in Leo Lake in the fall of 2015, and fish up to 16 inches in length were present.  The 2015 trap net catch was well above the upper end of the normal range (2.20 fish/set) for fall surveys of stream trout lakes in this area.  Although most of the rainbow trout taken were one-year-old fish from the 2015 stocking, several older fish (up to four years old) were included in the catch, indicating good long term survival in this very accessible trout lake.  Results of the 2015 survey suggest the switch to the kamloop strain may have been successful, in that more fish survived past their first year in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLeo Lake supports several fish species that are generally considered incompatible with stream trout management, but none appeared excessively abundant in 2015. Walleye have been caught in fair numbers in past surveys of Leo Lake; however, none were found in 2015.  Smallmouth bass were still present in Leo Lake in 2015, but only two fish were taken.  White sucker, which can compete with trout for invertebrate forage, have been found in low numbers in Leo Lake in the past but were not caught in 2015.  Green sunfish, which may also compete with trout, have been present in Leo Lake since at least 1981.  The green sunfish trap net catch in this survey was within the normal range (0.50 - 3.27 fish/set) for stream trout lakes in this area. <br> \n</p>",
