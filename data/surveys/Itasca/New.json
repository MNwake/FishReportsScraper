                "narrative": "<p>New Lake is a 66-acre lake located 2 miles north of Goodland, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22 ft and a littoral area of 50 acres.  New Lake is in lake class 36 and has a public access and swimming beach on the southeast shore.  Dense beds of watershield, clear water, and steep shoreline breaks characterize the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch was 4.7/net, which was toward the lower end of the expected range for similar lakes.  New Lake has only been surveyed once before in 1980 and the northern pike catch rate in that assessment was 2.8/gill net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 28 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 24 inches by age six.   <br> \n <br> \nLow-density northern pike populations often exhibit good growth and size structure.  Large northern pike often prey on small northern pike, which helps the lake from overpopulating, increases growth for the remaining fish, and leads to improved size structure.  Anglers can help maintain good size structure by releasing larger fish and keeping the small to medium sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch rates were lower than expected due to steep shorelines and dense vegetation.  The bluegill trap-net catch was 1.2/net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in the previous assessment was 2.5/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches sampled.  Growth was slightly slower than the lake class average with fish averaging 6 inches by age 7.       <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net catch was 1.2/net, which was towards the low end of the expected range.  The gill net catch rate was 1.0/net.  Catch rates in the previous assessment were 1.8/gill net and 4.0/trap net. Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8.5 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough traditional gears do not sample largemouth bass effectively, a few fish were sampled.  They ranged in length from 9.5 to 13 inches and had growth similar to the statewide average.  No largemouth bass were sampled in the previous assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch was 13.3/gill net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in the previous assessment was 7.5/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 9 inches sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
