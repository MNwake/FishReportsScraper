                "narrative": "<p>Ruth Lake is a 588 acre lake located just north of the town of Emily in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake.  Development is heavy with 30 homes/cabins per shoreline mile as of 1998.  The maximum depth is 39' and about 34% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates primarily consist of sand and gravel, but areas of rubble and boulders are common as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 26 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattails are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Eurasian watermilfoil is present is this lake and it is imperative that lake users take measures to prevent it from being introduced into other lakes and wetlands.  Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2003 at 13.0/gill net, which is the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight increased slightly from 19.3\" and 1.8 lbs in 1998 to 20.7\" and 2.2 lbs in 2003.  The 2003 walleye catch of 0.9/gill net was the lowest catch to date and below average when compared to similar lakes.  The fish tended to be old with all fish being at least 7 years old.  Average length and weight increased from 20.2\" and 2.8 lbs in 1998 to 22.2\" and 3.8 lbs for all walleye sampled by gill nets.  Largemouth bass were caught in relatively low numbers during the summer survey at 0.1/gill net and 0.4/trap net.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a good largemouth bass catch rate of 100/hr with an average length of 10.8\" and 34% measuring at least 12\". Bluegill and black crappies were both present in good numbers.  Bluegill growth was notably slow.  The 1997-1999 year classes represented 96% of all crappies sampled.  Yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish and were found in average numbers at 18.8/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 7.3 to 34.8/gill net.  The 1999 year class was strongest, representing 59.2% of the total catch.  </p>",

Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample twelve stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey will be considered when the biological health of Ruth Lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Bulrush beds are particularly important to species like bass, crappies, sunfishes and yellow perch because of their value as spawning areas for these species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ruth is a 588 acre lake located near Emily in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the northwest side of the lake.  Development is heavy with about 30 homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  Three resorts are also present on the lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 39 feet and about 34% of the surface area is less than 15 ft. deep.  Ruth has moderately hard water and the phosphorus fertility is in the low range.  Water clarity is excellent for the area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sand and gravel with boulder, rubble and muck also present.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of 20 feet in 1998.  Healthy aquatic plant communities are important.  Emergent species such as bulrush and cattail help regulate nutrient levels and often provide quality spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish species.  Submergent plant species provide food sources and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Ruth Lake was test netted in 1998.  Catches for most species were in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish sampled.  Catch rates were similar to past nettings.  Size averaged 17 inches and 1.8 lbs.  A strong 1995 year class was found and growth was good.  Walleye is another common gamefish in Ruth Lake.  Fingerlings are currently being stocked in alternate years.  Evaluation of this stocking plan is complicated by rather low catches of individual year classes.  Largemouth bass were not sampled in '98 but spring sampling in 1993 showed a diverse bass population was present.  Bluegill numbers have been quite variable over time.  The '98 catch was dominated by a strong 1993 year class.  Bluegill growth was good and about 18% were at least 7.0 inches long.  Black crappie catches were typical for both Ruth and similar type lakes.  A variety of age classes were present and growth was good.</p>",

Average populations of pumpkinseeds, largemouth bass, black crappies, yellow perch and walleyes were indicated. Low populations of white suckers and rock bass were indicated when compared to the area median of lake group 7.  Northern pike between 15 and 21 inches made up 75% of the catch. Growth rates appear to be average when compared with statewide growth rates. Age classes 2 and 3 comprised 81% of the sample.  Bluegills were very abundant with 116.0/lift compared to 21.0/lift for area lakes of similar size and depth.  Growth rates were average.  Length frequencies ranged from 4 to 8 1/2 inches, with 5 to 7 inch fish comprising the bulk of the sample.  Individual year classes represented were 2, 3, 4, and 7. Three, 4 and 5 year olds made up 94% of the sample. Largemouth bass sampled represented year classes 1 to 7.  Growth rates were slow when compared to statewide averages. Length frequencies ranged from 4 1/2 to 15 inches, with half of the sample between 6 and 8 inches. Age groups 2 thru 7 were represented by the black crappies sampled. The 5 year olds were most abundant with 38% of the sample. Growth rates were average. Length frequencies ranged from 5 to 10 1/2 inches. Yellow perch were aged from 3 to 7 years old. Average growth rates were indicated. Lengths ranged from 5 1/2 to 10 inches, with 8 to 10 inch fish most common. Population numbers were average, 19.3/lift compared to 10.0/lift, of similar lakes in the Brainerd Area. The walleye population appears in good shape with length frequencies ranging from 10 1/2 to 29 inches. Thirteen and 14 inch fish represented 43% of the fish sampled. Age classes 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 were sampled, with 4 year olds making up 48% of the sample. The walleye catch rate of 3.8/ lift compares favorably with the area median of 3.2/lift of similar lakes in the Brainerd Area. The yellow bullhead population was high when compared to the area median. Lengths ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with most 8 to 10 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish lengths ranged from 3 to 7 inches. A 5.1/lift catch rate was very near the area median of 5.2/lift.</p>",

The best opportunity for fishing appears to be for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Bluegill.  This lake now contains Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Please clean your boats well and drain all water when leaving the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high for this type of lake at 17.8/gill net.  Average length was 20.5\", with 19% of the fish within the 22-26\" protected slot and 21% above 26\".  Fish up to 34.4\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species showed some good opportunity.  Bluegill were caught at the rate of 65.6/trap net, with an average size of 6.5\" and 43% measuring 7\" or longer.  Black Crappies were caught in average numbers (0.9/trap net) and 75% of the fish were 8\" or larger, with fish up 12.1\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing at the rate of 71.5/hour.  Average length was 14.5\" and 80% measured 12\" or larger.  The largest fish measured 18.7\". <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ruth Lake is a 588 acre lake located just north of the city of Emily in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake.  Development is heavy with 30 homes/cabins per shoreline mile as of 1998.  The maximum depth is 39 feet and about 34% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Shallow water substrates primarily consist of sand and gravel, but areas of rubble and boulders are common as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse, with 26 species present , and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattails are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Eurasian watermilfoil is present in this lake and it is imperative that lake users take measures to prevent it from being introduced into other lakes and wetlands. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch (11.33/GN) remained in the \"high\" category, similar to the 2003 catch (13/0/GN).  Average length and weight, at 19.1 inches and 1.8 pounds, was also nearly identical to 2003 values.  Pike growth was in the \"average\" category. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye catch (1.33/GN was similar to 2003 (0.89/GN).   The catch remained in the \"low \" category compared to similar type lakes.  Average length and weight, at 16.4 inches and 1.67 pounds decreased from 2003 values (22.2 inches and 3.8 pounds).  The lake is currently classified as a \"core lake\" for walleye fingerling stocking and is being stocked at a rate of 2 pounds /littoral acre in odd numbered years in an attempt to increase walleye abundance to respectable levels. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught in respectable numbers in summer netting.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a catch rate of 128 fish per hour run time.  Bass length averaged 11.36 inches.  Thirty three percent were at least 12 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and black crappies were both present in good numbers and had \"average\" growth rates.  All crappies were at least 8.0 inches long and 56% of trap netted bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish and were found in average numbers, at 19.89/GN.  Past catches have ranged from 7.3-34.8/GN  The 2004 year class comprised 44% of the catch in 2009, and 32% of perch were at least 9.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  Of these, yellow bullhead was most abundant in the catch. <br> \n</p>",

The best opportunity for fishing appears to be for largemouth bass, northern pike, black crappie and bluegill.  This lake now contains Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels.  Please clean your boats well and drain all water when leaving the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were excellent at 122.1/hr electrofishing.  Average length was 12.5\" and 56% measured 12\" or larger.  The largest fish measured 20.9\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high for this type of lake (13.2/net), but size wasn't that impressive.  Average length was 20.5\" and 24% were 24\" or larger.  The largest fish was 35.5\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species were present in average numbers and size was decent.  Bluegill were caught at the rate of 28.2/net, with an average size of 6.9\" and 47% measuring 7\" or longer.  Black crappies were primarily from the 2011 year class and had an average size of 9.3\".  The crappie catch of 1.1/net was average for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",
