Several winterkills have been reported over the years, the most recent winterkill reported was a partial winterkill in 2004.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1946.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2009 and have been stocked in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 0.75-inch trap nets was 14.44 fish/set; which was almost twice as high as the previous invesitgation in 2004, but considerably less than the high of 87.90 fish/set recorded in 1994.  The largest captured in 2009 was 9.5 inches and the oldest was eight years old.  Age ranged from 3-8, with ages 3 and 4 representing 82% of the sample.  Growth was above the area mean.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass on May 26, 2009.  A total of 42 bass were captured at a rate of 25.1 fish per hour of on-time, the highest ever recorded for Clear Lake.  Total length ranged from 9.2-19.1 inches and four age-classes were captured.      <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 13.00 fish/set, which exceeds the level observed in 75% of class 13 lakes.  Eight year-classes were captured and age ranged from 1-8 years, but most fish were ages 2 and 3.  Total length ranged from 11.3-27.7 inches.  Average size and growth rate were below average. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was below what is observed in most class 13 lakes.  Total length ranged from 14.6-19.4 inches.  All walleyes captured were from the 2006 year-class, a year during which 1,291 fingerlings were stocked.      <br> \n <br> \nOne yellow perch was captured in 2009, which was the same as 2004.  Abundance has decreased considerably since 1999 when 73 yellow perch were captured.  </p>",

Clear is an 88 acre lake about 1 mile southeast of Gemmell, Minnesota or 11 miles northeast of Northome. Clear can be accessed from a public landing off of County Road 25, which runs between Clear and Dark Lake. Management activities primarily focus on Walleye, but several other species of game fish are also present in Clear Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers are up from the previous survey, and higher than expected for this type of lake. The average size is also good with Bluegill averaging 7.2 inches, and individuals over 9 inches sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers dropped dramatically from the 2009 survey. Standard electrofishing over two nights only captured a single bass, whereas the previous survey sampled 42 bass.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant and their size is within the expected range for this type of lake. They averaged 19 inches, and fish up to 31 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are up, and within the expected range for Clear Lake. The average size of 2 pounds and 18 inches is larger than Walleye in similar lakes. Clear has been stocked with fingerlings on even-numbered years, and it appears as if some natural reproduction is also helping build this Walleye population. The largest Walleye sampled was a 24.5 inch fish.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers are up from the previous survey, and within the expected range for Clear Lake. They averaged 6 inches. <br> \n</p>",

The most recent winterkill reported was a partial winterkill in 2004.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1946.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2004 and have been stocked in the past.    Bluegill abundance in 3/4-inch trap nets was 7.67 fish/set, which was the lowest recorded in over 15 years.  The largest captured was 9.1 inches total length and the oldest was six years old.  Age in trap nets ranged from 3-6, with age-5 composing 70% of the sample.  Growth was equal to the area average.      Night electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass on June 3, 2004.  Several dead largemouth bass were observed at ice-out in 2004 and the number sampled during electrofishing has decreased 35% from 1999.  A total of 11 bass were captured in 2004.  Total length ranged from 12.1-16.4 inches and several age-classes were captured.         Northern pike gill-net abundance was 11.00 fish/set, which exceeds the third quartile for class 13 lakes.  Additionally, age-0 northern pike were the most abundant species captured in the 1/4-inch trap nets.  Six year-classes were captured in gill nets and age ranged from 1-7 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 10.1-23.3 inches and growth was well below the area average.  The average weight was over 50% less than what is observed in over half the class 13 lakes.       Walleyes were not captured in 2004, although several dead walleyes were observed at ice out.  So, walleyes were at least present prior to the partial winterkill that occurred in 2004.  Sixty-thousand walleye fry were stocked on May 18, 2004.    Yellow perch abundance also decreased dramatically and were at an all time low in 2004.  One yellow perch was captured in 2004 compared to over 100 captured in 1999.   </p>",

Northern pike, bluegill and yellow perch are the dominant fish species although walleye and largemouth bass are present in respectable numbers.     The 1999 population assessment sampled high numbers of northern pike, bluegill, and yellow perch.  The average pike measured 19.2 inches with only one individual over 24 inches present in this investigation.  The average bluegill and yellow perch measured 4.8 and 7.5 inches respectively although a few larger individuals of each species were sampled.     Walleye numbers were normal for a lake like Clear.  Average length was 15.1 inches with a range from 13.8 to 18.5 inches.  Largemouth bass numbers were lower than expected.  The average bass measured 13.8 inches with several bass over 16 inches present in the spring electrofish assessment.  In addition, anglers will encounter many black and brown bullheads when fishing on the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was completed on Clear Lake in 2020 as part of a scheduled investigation specified in the Clear Lake Management Plan. Clear Lake can be accessed from a public landing off of County Road 25, which runs between Clear and Dark lakes. Clear Lake is primarily managed for Walleye, with Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike being secondarily managed.  <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has received biennial stocking of fingerlings since 2006, with fry stockings in 1996 and 2004. Walleye numbers were low in this assessment, and the fish that were sampled were large with an average weight of four pounds. Although our sample size was small, we didn't see any clear evidence of natural reproduction, with all aged fish coming from years that were stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nThe secondary management species could provide additional angling opportunities in Clear Lake. Catch rates for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike are up from the previous survey, and higher than expected for this type of lake. The Bluegill particularly were somewhat small, averaging 5.3 inches and 0.1 pounds, with only a small proportion (1.3%) greater than 7 inches, while the Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were within the expected range for this type of lake.  <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has experienced an increase in Black Crappie since they were detected in the 2015 survey. They were sampled at rates expected for this class of lake, but like Bluegill, their size was generally small, with a single fish breaking the 10 inch mark. A majority of the aged fish were from 2017 and may provide quality angling opportunities in the next couple of years.  <br> \n</p>",
