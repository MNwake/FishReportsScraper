                "narrative": "<p>Rockstad Lake is a 128-acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet located near the town of Zerkel in southern Clearwater County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics, water chemistry and fish community.  Rockstad is grouped in Lake Class 39. Lakes in this class are typically round, shallow lakes with lots of aquatic vegetation and good productivity.  Other Bemidji-area Class 39 lakes include Irving, Three Island, Island, Minerva, and Pine.  Rockstad Lake is managed as a periodic winterkill lake, and the fish community present depends on the severity and proximity of the most recent winterkill event.  Winterkill lakes are very resilient and can become re-populated with fish within a few years after a winterkill has occurred.  Fish can grow very rapidly in these situations and provide quality angling in a brief timeframe as well.  Rockstad Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  The 2014 assessment found good numbers and sizes of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate of 4.2/trap net was typcial for Lake Class 39 lakes.  Bluegill had an average size of 8.25 inches in length and 0.53 lbs/fish, which is above average for Lake Class 39 lakes.  Growth rates for Bluegill were well above the average growth seen in similar lakes.  Given an absence of winterkill conditions, this Bluegill population will provide some quality fishing in 2015 and beyond.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured at rates well above the normal range for similar lakes in both trap nets and gill nets, indicating an abundant bass population.  Bass up to 14.76 inches in length were captured with an average size of 13.65 inches and 1.52 lbs/fish.  Most of the Largemouth Bass captured were from the same year class (age-3).  As with Bluegill, growth rates for Largemouth Bass in Rockstad Lake were faster than growth rates for similar lakes.  These fish should continue to grow rapidly and should reproduce in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 4/gill net which is above the median catch rate for this lake class (2.5/gill net).  However, the Black Crappie catch was dominated by young fish that had an average size of 5.68 inches in length.  Growth rates for Black Crappie were well above average, and these fish should provide good angling opportunities within the next few years barring a winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 12.5/gill net was above the normal range for this lake class (4.63/gill net to 11.63/gill net).  Pike had an average size of 21.95 inches in length and 2.29 lbs/fish, with fish up to 31.38 inches in length captured.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the 2014 assessment include Black and Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
