                "narrative": "<p>Big Boy Lake is a 3186-acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet.  The lake is within both the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  Big Boy Lake is the first lake upstream from Leech Lake via the Boy River.  Fish can migrate between the two lakes.  There is a DNR concrete public access in the southwest corner of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43      different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Boy  Lake is in lake class 25.    Lakes in this lake class are typically large in size, moderately deep, moderately clear, and have extensive areas of shallow water (less than 15 feet in depth).  Other area lakes in the same lake      class include Birch, Blackwater, and Inguadona Lakes.  Approximately 63% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Big Boy Lake provides a multitude of angling opportunities.  There is good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  Muskellunge are also sought and caught by anglers.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.Walleye are abundant in Big Boy Lake and are supported entirely by natural reproduction.  No walleye stocking has occurred since 1987. There were nine different age classes sampled so anglers can expect to catch a wide range of lengths.  One important thing that anglers/lakeshore owners can do to protect the walleye population is to protect the spawning habitat around the lake.  Human activities have impacted fish habitat and subsequently      fish populations.Northern pike abundance is comparable to other lakes in lake class 25.  Most pike are small in size but there are a few quality size fish more than 30 inches in length for anglers to catch.  There are many kinds of panfish anglers can fish for in Big Boy Lake.  Panfish of quality size includes bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch.  To maintain such quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger panfish such as bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive that pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boy Lake (DOW#11-0143, Lake Class 25) is a 3,466-acre lake with 2,007 littoral acres, 26.36 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet located north of Longville, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the southwest shore. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco) are secondary management species. The lake was initially surveyed in 1952 and 16 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since. A Black Crappie and Sunfish regulation was implemented on March 1, 2022 (daily bag limit 5 Crappie, 10 Sunfish). The purpose of this survey was to collect population metrics for Bluegill and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black Crappie and Bluegill provide quality angling opportunities. Black Crappie ranged in length from 6 to 14 inches with an average length and weight of 10 inches and 0.6 pounds. Bluegill ranged in length from 4 to 9 inches with and average length and weight of 8 inches and 0.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Boy Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE OF 4.9/GN IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.7 TO 9.6. THE SAMPLE OF NORTHEN PIKE COLLECTED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 9 TO 31 INCHES, HOWEVER MOST WERE 15 TO 18 INCHES IN LENGTH. ALL PAST SURVEYS HAD COLLECTED FISH GREATER THAN 30 INCHES LONG. THE GROWTH RATE EXHIBITED BY NORTHERN PIKE IS GOOD. ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEAD WERE FAIRLY ABUNDANT IN THE SAMPLE OF FISH COLLECTED. MANY OF THE BULL- HEAD COLLECTED WERE GREATER THAN 10 INCHES LONG. PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN SAMPLES OF FISH COLLECTED THAN WERE BLUEGILL. OVER 40% OF THE BLUEGILL COLLECTED WERE GREATER THAN 7 INHCES IN LENGTH. BLUEGILL. GROW AT AN EXCEPTIONAL RATE COMPARED TO MOST LAKES IN THIS AREA. CONSIDERING THE SAMPLING GEAR USED, FAIR NUMBERS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE COLLECTED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT MANY OF WHICH WERE FROM 13 TO 20 INCHES IN LENGTH. THE GROWTH RATE FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS VERY GOOD - A 3 YEAR OLD FISH WAS 11 TO 12 INCHES LONG. FAIR NUMBERS OF BLACK CRAPPIE WERE COLLECTED. THEY RANGED. THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 15 INCHES WITH SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED. THE GROWTH RATE FOR THE BLACK CRAPPIE IS FAST COMPARED WITH OTHER LAKES IN THIS AREA. THE GILL NET CPUE OF YELLOW PERCH IS SIMILAR TO CPUE'S FROM PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. THE 1989 GILL NET CPUE OF 6.0 WALLEYE IS HIGHER THAN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.9 TO 4.0. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CATCH RATE OF WALLEYE. AS IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS ALL SIZE CLASSES OF WALLEYE ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE COLLECTED. THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN YEAR CLASS ABUNDANCE AND WALLEYE STOCKING IN THIS ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. NATUR- AL REPRODUCTION IS MAINTAINING THE WALLEYE POPULA- TION IN BIG BOY LAKE. THE GROWTH RATE FOR WALLEYE IS GOOD.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boy Lake is a 3,466-acre lake located near Boy River, Minnesota that has 26.4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the southwest shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boy Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this Class are generally deep, clear and irregularly shaped. Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Walker Area include Birch, Blackwater, Girl, Hand, and Inguadona. Boy Lake is primarily managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco). The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of fish populations in Boy Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant in Boy Lake and the 2017 catch rate was above average compared to similar local lakes.  The average length was 16 inches and fish up to 27 inches were sampled.  No walleye stocking has occurred since the late 1980's and abundance has been consistently higher since stocking was discontinued.  In addition, Northern Pike are abundant and the 2017 gill net catch rate was the historical high for Boy Lake. The average length for Northern Pike was 18 inches and fish up to 30 inches long were sampled.  Nearly all the Northern Pike were shorter than 22 inches long, and this population will hopefully benefit from new statewide pike zone regulations implemented in 2018. There is a small but natural reproducing population of Muskellunge in Boy Lake with fish up to 51 inches long sampled in 2013. With abundant bulrush and aquatic vegetation, Boy Lake offers quality angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. Bluegill up to 10 inches long, Black Crappie up to 14 inches long, and Largemouth Bass up to 19 inches long were captured throughout the 2017 survey year on Boy Lake. Other fish species that are available for anglers to catch are Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Redhorse (Greater and Shorthead), Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, And Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Boy Lake are the rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boy Lake is a 3,466-acre lake with 26 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet located north of Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the southwest shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Boy Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this Class are generally deep, clear and irregularly shaped. Other Lake Class 25 lakes in the Walker Area include Birch, Blackwater, Girl, Hand, and Inguadona. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco) are secondary management species. A special regulation for Sunfish and Black Crappie (daily bag limit 10 Sunfish and 5 Black Crappie) was implemented March 1, 2022 as part of the state-wide Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI) which aims to protect or increase size of Sunfish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained higher than management goals. Lengths ranged from 13 to 33 inches, with an average length of 18 inches and did not meet population size structure goals. Walleye abundance was within management goals but declined from the 2017 survey. Walleye lengths ranged from 11 to 27 inches, with an average length of 16 inches. The 2019 year-class is strong and will be reaching harvestable sizes in 2022. Yellow Perch numbers declined from previous surveys and were below management goals, but fish up to 10 inches long were sampled. Black Crappie abundance increased from previous surveys but remained below abundance and size structure management goals. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 14 inches. Bluegill abundance increased from previous surveys and exceeded management goals with fish up to 10 inches sampled. Largemouth Bass catch rates were a historical high with fish up to 18 inches long sampled. Targeted electrofishing surveys are required to develop long-range management goals for Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Boy Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Boy Lake is a 3200-acre lake with a maximum depth 45 feet.  It is located eight miles north of Longville. Based on physical, chemical and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types. Big Boy Lake is in Lake Class 25. Other area lakes in this same class include: Birch (located next to Hackensack), Blackwater (located nine miles east and one mile south of Hackensack), Girl (located next to Longville), and Inguadona (located five miles east of Longville) Lakes.  There is a DNR public access off of Co. Rd. 128, between the two major basins of the lake.Walleye were sampled at a rate higher than  in previous surveys and was also higher than what is typically found in other class 25 lakes.  Sampled walleye  ranged in length from 7 - 29 inches which indicates many year classes and good natural reproduction.  More than 74% of the walleye were 15 inches or longer.  Walleye were growing at a rate that was typical of other class 25 lakes.Northern pike were sampled at a rate similar to  past surveys and other class 25 lakes.  Northern pike were generally small with an average length of 17 inches and a weight of 1 1/4 pounds.  There  is, however, some northern pike longer than 28 inches.Sampled bluegill were of  excellent quality.  Ninety-three percent of the bluegill were seven inches or greater in length.  The average length of bluegill was 8 inches and weighed almost a half a pound.  Bluegill growth rates are faster than what is typically found in class 25 lakes.A total of 17 black crappie were sampled. The black crappie that were sampled were of excellent quality with an average length of 11 inches and weighed 0.9 pounds.  Black crappie are difficult to sample with any consistency and their catch rates may not be indicative of abundance. Yellow perch and cisco (tullibee) were the two main food fish for predator species.  Some of these fish were large enough to be acceptable to the angler.Other fish sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, white sucker, bowfin, burbot, greater redhorse, and shorthead redhorse.  Muskellunge are also known to inhabit the lake.To maintain quality fish populations in Big Boy Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife, help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines can help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters and provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.   Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Big Boy Lake is also needed to maintain the lake's water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish helps maintain fish population in a lake and gives anglers more big fish to catch in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Boy Lake is a 3,452-acre lake located near Boy River, Minnesota that has 26.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the southwest shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Boy Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this Class are generally deep, clear and irregularly shaped.  Big Boy Lake is primarily managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco).      <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant in Big Boy Lake and the 2013 catch rate was above average compared to similar local lakes.  The average length was 15 inches and fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  The walleye population is supported by excellent natural reproduction; no walleye stocking has occurred since the late 1980's and abundance has been consistently higher since stocking was discontinued.  In addition, Northern Pike are abundant and the 2013 catch rate was the historical high for Big Boy Lake.  The average length for Northern Pike was 19 inches and fish up to 32 inches long were sampled.  There is a small but natural reproducing population of Muskellunge in Big Boy Lake with fish up to 51 inches sampled during 2013.  Other fish species that are available for anglers to catch are Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Redhorse (Greater and Shorthead), Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, And Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Big Boy Lake are the rusty crayfish and purple loosestrife. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Boy Lake is a 3,186-acre lake located near Boy River, Minnesota that has 20.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the southwest shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Boy Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in the class are generally deep, clear and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco).     Walleye are abundant  in Big Boy Lake and the 2005 catch rate was the historical high for Big Boy Lake.  The mean length was 16 inches and fish up to 27 inches were sampled.  The walleye population is the result of natural reproduction; no walleye stocking has occurred since the late 1980's.  In addition, northern pike are abundant and the 2005 catch rate was the historical high for Big Boy Lake.  The mean length for northern pike was 19 inches and fish up to 36 inches were sampled.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, burbot, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, redhorse (greater and shorthead) rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Big Boy Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local MNDNR Fisheries office.</p>",
