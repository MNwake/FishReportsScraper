A reclamation is planned for Pavelgrit Lake in October 2009 to eliminate fish from this small lake.  Nearby Snowshoe (Little Andrus) Lake, a designated trout lake managed for brook trout will also be reclaimed at the same time.  Pavelgrit is a likely source of the yellow perch that became established in nearby Snowshoe Lake prior to 2002.  The yellow perch have reduced the abundance of brook trout in Snowshoe to about one-half of the pre-perch abundance.  The yellow perch have also reduced the quality of the previously excellent brook trout fishery both through angler interference and competition with the brook trout.  Eliminating fish from Pavelgrit Lake will remove one potential source of introductions of undesireable fish for Snowshoe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two fish species, golden shiner and yellow perch, were captured in the survey.  Some yellow perch were fairly large; around 11 to 12 inches long, but most were around 5 and 6 inches in length.  Small-bodied fish species are not effectively sampled with the standard survey nets used in this assessment, so other small-bodied species may be present.  A visual survey of shallow water was done to look for other small fishes, but none were observed.   <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen >1 ppm was found down to about 13 ft, but below 9 ft dissolved oxygen was < 4 ppm.   <br> \n <br> \nThe initial survey of Pavelgrit Lake was done in 1956.  Northern pike were the only species collected, although no capture of small fish species was attempted.  The next survey was conducted in 1981 as an evaluation of the lakes susceptibility to acid deposition.  Only golden shiners and yellow perch were captured.  Golden shiner, fathead minnow, northern redbelly dace, and yellow perch were caught in the 1984 and 1987 surveys.  Pavelgrit Lake has fairly soft water with reported alkalinities between 2 and 15 ppm.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
