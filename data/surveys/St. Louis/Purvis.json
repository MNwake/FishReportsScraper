                "narrative": "<p>Purvis Lake, also known as Sparrow Lake, is in Ecological Lake Class 10.  Lake Class 10 consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small with very soft (low mineral content) water.  Purvis Lake was thermally stratified on 08/03/2009 with a surface temperature of 65 ?F and a bottom temperature of 41 ?F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 26 feet where the temperature was 45 ?F.   <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, with some gravel, sand, and muck.  There are no inlets.  The outlet leads to the Beaver River and was obstructed by a large beaver dam, blocking most of the flow and acting as a barrier to fish movement at the time of the 2009 survey.  Water levels were high in 2009, which caused flooding of terrestrial grasses and sedges along the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 survey consisted of four gillnet sets to assess the fish population in Purvis Lake.  Five previous fish population investigations, dating back to 1966, consisted of 2-8 gillnet sets.  No trapnets have been set in Purvis Lake due to the difficult portage access.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 total catch of fish (all species combined) in gillnets of 6.5 fish/net (9.82 lbs) was nearly identical to the median catch of 6.4 fish/net (7.1 lbs) for all investigations on Purvis Lake.  Northern pike were the most abundant fish sampled in 2009, followed by walleye.  Low numbers of largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow perch, and rock bass were also caught.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were captured in the 1999 assessment but were not caught in any other investigation.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota in terms of gillnet catches of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in 2009 (3.3 fish/gillnet) was normal for Lake Class 10 and higher than the median catch (2.4 fish/gillnet) for all investigations on this lake.  Average northern pike size in 2009 was 18.1 inches (1.3 lbs), which was smaller than the average length (20.5 inches) for all assessments on Purvis Lake and smaller than normal for this lake class.  The largest pike captured in 2009 was 24.4 inches long.  Four age classes were present in the 2009 assessment with most (10 of 13) coming from the 2007 year class.  Northern pike growth was normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in 2009 (1.8 fish/gillnet) was normal for Lake Class 10 and slightly higher than the median catch (1.4 fish/gillnet) for all investigations on Purvis Lake since walleye fry stocking began in 1975.  Similar to previous assessments, walleye sizes were large averaging 18.6 inches (2.2 lbs) and the largest captured in 2009 was 22.7 inches.  Six of 7 walleye caught in 2009 were from fry stocked year classes (2004 and 2006).  The seventh walleye was from the non-stocked 2003 year class.  Growth of walleye caught in 2009 was faster than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2009 (0.5 fish/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and identical to the median catch for all investigations on Purvis Lake.  Angling reports in previous years, along with the fact that largemouth bass are not sampled effectively in gillnets, suggests largemouth bass numbers in Purvis Lake are likely higher than the gillnet catch indicates. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Purvis Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  It was thermally stratified on 07/28/99 and retained adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) to a depth of 17 ft, where the temperature was 51 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, with some gravel, sand, and muck.  There are no inlets.  The outlet is to the Beaver River.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 9 ft; the most common plant is yellow waterlily.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 6 fish/net (10 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 5 fish/net (4 lb/net) in four previous investigations on this lake dating back to 1966.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Northern pike numbers in 1999 (2.8/net) were normal for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.0/net in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 23\"; the largest was 29\".  Most pike were ages three and four.  Pike growth was normal for area lakes.Walleye numbers in 1999 (1.2/net) were normal for this lake class and were near the median catch of 1.0/net in three previous investigations on this lake after walleye fry stocking began in 1975.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 17\"; the largest was 21.1\".  The five walleye captured in 1999 were all from different year classes, including two years (1995 and 1997) that were not stocked with walleye fry.  Growth of walleye captured in 1999 was faster than normal for area lakes.Largemouth bass numbers in 1999 (0.5/net) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 0.3/net in previous investigations on this lake.  The two largemouth captured in 1999 were 5.9\" and 14.9\".  Judging from local angling reports, largemouth bass may be more abundant than indicated by gillnet catches.Other fish species (pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch) were present in low numbers in 1999.Neascus (black spot) was observed on some of the fish examined in 1999.  Neascus is a parasite found in or just under the skin that is native to the area.  It is usually removed by filleting, is killed by cooking temperatures, and cannot infect humans.</p>",

Low numbers of yellow perch, white sucker, rock bass, and largemouth bass are also present.Walleye sizes are above average for the area.  All walleye are from two stocked years, 1988 and 1986, and are ages 7 and 5.  Walleye growth (18.4\" at Annulus V) is faster than average for the area, which is surprising considering fish populations are dominated by predators.The overall population of 7.8 fish/gill net (16.3 lbs/gill net) is fairly low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Purvis Lake is located approximately 8 miles southwest of Ely within the Superior National Forest. This 53 acre lake is surrounded by a mixed forest. The current water level appears to be high and dead trees are fairly common along the shoreline.\n\nThe most common access is by a 48 rod portage from the Purvis Lake Forest Road. There are no official overnight campsites near the lake. There is a DNR Scientific and Natural Area along portions of the east and southeast shores. The Taconite Snowmobile Trail runs along the north side of the lake. A three-sided shelter can be found along the trail near the lake's northeast shore.\n\nFive species of fish were sampled during the 2019 survey. The gill net catch of 2.8 fish/net is the lowest recorded since 1989. Northern pike were 64% of the catch. The most recent previous survey of Purvis Lake was completed in 2009.\n\nPike numbers in 2019 were slightly below the historic average of 2.1/gill net for this lake and below average when compared to other lakes in the area that are similar. Pike lengths averaged 20.3 inches which is nearly identical to the historic average length. The largest pike sampled measured 23.7 inches.\n\nOne 24.3 inch walleye was sampled in 2019. This 12 year old walleye is the largest sampled to date from Purvis Lake. Walleye fry are currently stocked during even numbered years.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",
