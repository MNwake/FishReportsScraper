Nearly 50% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 7 inches. Overall they had an average length approximatly 8 inches. Black crappies were sampled in averge numbers. Their size was small however. The largest crappie sampled was just over 9 inches in length. A large year class of black crappie averages 8.4 inches and should exceed 9 to 10 inches in a year or two. Yellow perch were sampled at their highest levels, although they are not quite jumbo size at this point. They average 7 inches in length. Black bullheads are not very abundant but their average size is nearly 12 inches long and 1.1 pounds. Northern pike are at their highest level since 1983. Over 28% of the northern pike measured were over 25 inches in length. The walleye population is slightly below average for this type of lake. Growth is considered very good with an average size of 17.7 inches and 2.2 pounds for walleyes sampled in the trapnets. Over 35% of the walleyes sampled were over 20 inches in length.</p>",

A standard population assessment was conducted during the first week in July, 2010 to determine the species composition and abundance of fish in the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance is relatively high compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area.  At 6.0/gill net, numbers were near the median (6.8/net) for similar lakes throughout the state.  Current walleye abundance was similar to the 6.8/net that were observed in the 2004 assessment.   Walleye mean length and weight were 18.3 inches and 2.4 pounds, with the largest reaching 26.5 inches.  Size structure was high, with 69% at 15 inches or longer, 36% at 20 inches or longer, and 6% at 25 inches or longer.  The majority of walleye sampled were from the 2005 (21%), 2006 (14%), and 2007 (31%) year classes.  Walleye averaged 14 inches by age 3 and 20 inches by age 5.  The New Market Sportsman's Club annually stocks approximately 1000 fingerlings in McMahon Lake to maintain the walleye fishery.        <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are very abundant (15.3/gill net).  Typical of high northern pike densities, mean weight (2.1 pounds) was moderately low.  Size structure is characterized by 39% of northern pike at 21 inches or longer and 6% at 28 inches or longer.  Average length was 20.6 inches and the largest sampled was 32.9 inches.  The current population size is the highest on record and is supported by the large 2006 and 2007 year classes that make up 80% of the population.  Northern pike averaged 21 inches by age 4 and 28 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was high in gill nets (34.8/net) and moderately high in trap nets (11.5/net).  Gill net catch has varied over previous assessments (range since 1958, 2.0 \u0013 76.0) however trap net catch is the highest observed since the 1970 assessment (14.8 /net).  For both gear types combined, 54% of black crappie were 8 inches or longer and the longest sampled was 9.1 inches.  Average length and weight were 7.1 inches and 0.21 pounds.  Relatively consistent recruitment was observed with five year classes contributing to the population (2005 through 2009).  The 2005 and 2008 year classes were the most abundant contributing 26% and 38%, respectively.  Black crappie averaged 8 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (80/trap net) is high compared to similar lakes in the state.  Catch of bluegill in trap nets has varied over the years.  Since 1988 (5 assessments), the number per net has ranged from 44 to 538.  In 2010, mean length and weight in trap nets were 6.2 inches and 0.21 pounds.  Sixty-one percent were longer than 6 inches with the largest reaching 7.8 inches.  Bluegill ranged in age from 2 to 8.  The largest year class was in 2005, which represents 37% of the population.  Bluegill grew to 6 inches by age 4.         <br> \n <br> \nSixteen largemouth bass were collected during the assessment; however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  The data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Mean size was 12.3 inches and 1.37 pounds with the largest reaching 20.4 inches and 4.87 lbs.  Fifty-six percent were 12 inches and longer and 19% were 15 inches and longer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are moderately low in abundance (5.17/ gill net) compared with similar lakes in the state.  This has generally been the case over the previous four assessments, with the exception of 1993 when 19.2 per net were observed.  Mean length and weight were 6.6 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Three percent were 8 inches or longer and the longest was 9.3 inches.  Most (90%) yellow perch were age 3 or 4. Yellow perch grew to 8 inches by age 4.      <br> \n <br> \nGolden shiner, an important prey species in the lake that was perhaps established or supplemented by bait dumping, was found in high abundance (24.2/gill net).  In addition to being abundant, golden shiners are reaching large sizes.  Mean weight was 0.20 pounds.  Golden shiners averaged 7.8 inches, the largest measured 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn an assessment of the shallow, nearshore fish community, backpack electrofishing and seining were conducted.  The most abundant species observed was young-of-the-year (YOY) bluegill.  Additionally, adult bluegill, black bullhead, green sunfish, largemouth bass (adult and YOY), and YOY pumpkinseed were observed.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as some minnows and darters contributed to a low IBI score, indicating water quality and habitat may be impaired.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black bullhead, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McMahon (Carl's) Lake is a productive 110-acre, Class 43 lake.  It is located 6 miles south of the city of Prior Lake, in Credit River Township.  The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass, and secondarily managed for Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  The New Market Sportsman's Club stocks Walleye.  A Standard Survey was conducted in 2015 to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was high in 2015; the catch rate of 24.3 fish per trap net exceeded the third quartile for this Lake Class.  The average size of trap-netted Bluegill was 6.1 inches and 0.19 pounds.  Thirty-four percent of the fish exceeded 7 inches, and only 2% of the fish exceeded 8 inches.  The largest Bluegill was 8.5 inches and 0.45 pounds. Bluegill attained an average length of 6.6 inches by age 3, and 7.3 inches by age 4.     <br> \n    <br> \nWalleye abundance is relatively high compared to other lakes in the West Metro Fisheries Area.  The 2015 catch rate of 4.0/gill net fell between the first quartile and median for Class 43 lakes throughout the state.  This is a decline from the 2010 catch rate of 6.0 fish per gill net.  Walleye mean length and weight were 19.7 inches and 2.74 pounds, with the largest reaching 26.0 inches.  Size structure revealed a population of large individuals, with 92% of fish exceeding 15 inches, 54% at 20 inches or longer, and 8% at 25 inches or longer.  Walleye reach an average of 15.7 inches by age 4, and 22.0 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant in 2015.  The gill net catch rate (11.7/net) exceeded the 75th percentile for class 43 lakes.  This decrease in catch from the previous survey (in 2010), when 15.3 fish per net were caught, is also accompanied by an improved size structure since that survey.  In 2015, the average Northern Pike was 22.0 inches and 2.58 pounds, an increase from an average size of 20.6 inches and 1.97 pounds.  Fifty-seven percent of the 2015 catch exceeded 21 inches, compared with 39% of fish exceeding 21 inches previously.  Eleven percent of Northern Pike exceeded 28 inches in 2015, compared with 6% exceeding 28 inches in 2010.  The largest fish measured in 2015 was 33.7 inches and 9.35 pounds.  The fish reached an average of 20.7 inches by age 3, and 27.2 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high in gill nets (17.7, above third quartile) and moderately high in trap nets (5.2, between median and third quartile).  For both gear types combined, 36% of Black Crappie were 8 inches or longer and the largest fish sampled was 10.6 inches and 0.68 pounds.  Average size was 7.3 inches and 0.24 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Yellow Perch were moderately high in abundance (20.0/gill net, between median and third quartile) compared with other Class 43 lakes in the state.  Mean length and weight were 7.2 inches and 0.18 pounds.  Eighteen percent were 8 inches or longer and the largest fish was 10.2 inches and 0.61 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Due to private stocking, walleye numbers and size in Carl's Lake were the highest ever seen in the history of the lake.  Most of these fish are four years old, over 18 inches long, and about 3 lbs.  Northern pike were also fairly abundant, but a majority of fish are only 20 and 23 inches long and about 3 lbs.  Compared to previous surveys, the black crappie and bluegill populations appear to have declined in quality.  During this survey, black crappie were found to be abundant and primarily 3 and 4 year old fish.  Size is lacking, however, with most fish only seven inches long.    No black crappie over nine inches were sampled.  The bluegill appear to be not as abundant, but average size is only six inches.  Only a few fish over seven inches were sampled.  Yellow perch numbers were below previous surveys, with most fish less than 6.5 inches long.  Black bullhead numbers continue to increase, but are still within the lower quartiles for this lake class.  Only seven largemouth bass were sampled, but two were over 19 inches long and growth was above average.</p>",
