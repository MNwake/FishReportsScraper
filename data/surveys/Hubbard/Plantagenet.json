                "narrative": "<p>Lake Plantagenet is a 2,531-acre lake located in northern Hubbard County about 5 miles south of Bemidji, MN.  There is a DNR public water access located on the south end of the lake off of County Road 9 with a concrete log boat ramp and parking for 12 vehicles/trailers.  There is also an unimproved gravel access suitable for smaller boats or canoes located at the outlet of the lake on the north shore off of County Road 35.  Plantagenet is managed for Walleye, Muskellunge, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nLake Plantagenet is a natural lake on the Schoolcraft River which connects a number of high quality fishing lakes including Marquette, Irving and Bemidji.  This connectivity is beneficial to migratory species such as Walleye, and previous studies have documented considerable movement throughout the system as adults seek out preferred spawning habitats in the spring and disperse back through the system in late spring and summer.  Plantagenet is stocked with Walleye fry every other year and has been one of the more popular and consistent Walleye fishing lakes in the Bemidji area.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 catch rate for Walleye was 12.8 fish/gill net, which was above the range found in similar lakes (4.01 to 9.63 fish/gill net).  Walleye averaged 14.10 inches in length and 0.97 lbs/fish.  The largest Walleye captured was 24.53 inches in length.  The Walleye catch was dominated by smaller, younger fish from the abundant 2014 year class.  These fish will make up the bulk of the Walleye harvest for the next few years.  Hopefully another good year class will be produced in the next few years to sustain the population, as Walleye harvest can be high on Lake Plantagenet. <br> \n <br> \nThe Muskellunge population is thriving in Lake Plantagenet and receives a fair amount of pressure from muskie anglers as a result.  Muskies are stocked at fingerling length (10-12\") on odd numbered years. Natural reproduction occurs within the lake as well.  A special trap netting assessment targeting spawning adult muskies was conducted in early spring of 2017.  A total of 65 fish ranging from 39.8 to 54.1 inches were captured, measured, and released.  The male fish appear to reach maximum length just short of 48 inches but an impressive 68% of the females captured exceeded 50 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 1.60 fish/gill net was below the range found in similar lakes (3.0 to 7.89 fish/gill net).  Pike captured in the survey had a good average size at 23.37 inches in length and 3.09 lbs/fish.  The largest pike measured 34.84 inches in length.      <br> \n <br> \n The Yellow Perch catch rate was 17.07 fish/gill net which was comparable to the median catch rate found in similar lakes (17.14 fish/gill net).  Yellow Perch averaged 7.57 inches in length with fish up to 11.50 inches captured in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Bullhead species, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish and Bowfin. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Plantagenet is a 2,531-acre lake located south of of Bemidji in northern Hubbard County. There is a DNR public water access located on the south end of the lake off of County Road 9 with a concrete log boat ramp and parking for 12 vehicles/trailers. There is also an unimproved gravel access suitable for smaller boats or canoes located at the outlet of the lake on the north shore off of County Road 35. Plantagenet is managed for Walleye, Muskellunge, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. Walleye are stocked as fry and Muskellunge are stocked as fingerlings, both on an every-other-year rotation. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 catch rate for Walleye was just over 16 fish/gill net which is well above the average for most area lakes. Lengths averaged just under 14 inches and the largest captured during the 2022 survey was over 26 inches. Multiple strong year classes were present indicating a healthy and balanced population as a result of both stocking and natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were not captured which is not unusual for mid to late summer surveys. For the most recent muskie information, please see the \"Targeted Survey, 2018-05-10\" in the Lakefinder survey drop down menu. The next Muskellunge survey is scheduled for the spring of 2026. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was similar to previous assessments. Pike averaged almost 2 lb/fish  and the largest captured in the 2022 assessment was over 35 inches long. Pike are a great alternative to target when other species refuse to bite or can make for an exciting opportunity for young anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was over 25 fish/gill net which was comparable to most area lakes. Yellow Perch averaged over 7 inches in length and fish up to 12 inches were captured in the survey. Perch are one of the most important forage species for Walleye, muskies, and pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Bullhead species, Black Crappie, and a variety of sunfish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Plantaganette is a 2500 acre, windswept, oval basin located in northern Hubbard County.  Much of the lakeshore is developed, and much of the natural bulrush ring has been removed, but large stands of bulrush do still exist on sand flats and near the outlet.  Development and aquatic plant removal are monitored to prevent the continuing loss of emergent aquatic plant beds.  Primary management on Lake Plantaganette is for walleye, and secondary management is for muskellunge, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Frequent assessments coupled with alternate year walleye fry and muskellunge fingerling stocking are the primary management tools.  Regular walleye fry stocking has been very successful in maintaining above average walleye abundance.The walleye catch rate in the 1999 assessment was the second highest on record and about twice the average for similar lakes.  Walleye from 7.1 to 25.7 inches were sampled, but 83% were less than 15 inches long.  The average length was 13.4 inches.  The dominance of smaller walleyes in the population is likely a direct result of the 1996 fry stocking producing an exceptionally large year class that is just now growing to harvestable size.Northern pike catch rate is low, and has been, throughout the assessment history.  Aging of fish to multiple year classes suggests consistent natural reproduction. Average size is larger than for many lakes, but has declined in recent years.  This assessment captured northern pike with an average size of 20.3 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled was 33.8 inches. Lake Plantaganette has an introduced population of Leech Lake muskellunge.  It is managed as a muskellunge broodstock lake to supply muskellunge eggs, as needed, for statewide production needs.  The minimum size limit is set at 48 inches to provide additional protection for mature females.  Muskie angling has become popular on the lake and on most days in the summer, fishing rigs are parked at the public access long before dawn, and long after sunset.Yellow perch are abundant, and highly sought.  This assessment sampled them with average and maximum lengths of 6.7 and 11.2 inches respectively.  Ten percent of the perch sample was over eight inches and most were free from external parasites.Largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and rock bass are important parts of the fish community and popular seasonally with anglers, but none are overly abundant.  Anglers find average size on all to be acceptable, if they can be located and caught.Tullibee and white suckers, primarily prey fish for larger predatory fish, were sampled at a rate consistent with sampling in the past.  Average weight of the tullibee was about 0.75 pounds and average weight for white suckers was 1.2 pounds.  About half of the tullibee had Triaenophorous, a grub-like parasite buried in the meat along the backbone.  All fish should be well cooked to prevent possible transmission of parasites.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Plantagenet is a 2,529 acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet located in northern Hubbard County about 5 miles south of Bemidji, MN.  There are two public boat landings on the lake, which has a moderate amount of lakeshore development and one active resort.  Lake Plantagenet is a natural lake on the Schoolcraft River system and is well connected to several managed lakes downstream.  The Schoolcraft River eventually joins the Mississippi River near Bemidji, and considerable fish migration between Lake Plantagenet and Lake Bemidji has been documented in previous studies. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population of Lake Plantagenet is maintained by alternate year fry stocking which has been a very successful management tool.  Survival and growth of walleye is excellent and walleye fishing tends to be fairly consistent from year to year.  Fast growth rates combined with high angler harvest rates have resulted in a fish population dominated by abundant \"keeper\" size walleye, although the lake produces its share of large walleye as well.  The 2012 population assessment walleye catch rate was 19.1 fish/gill net, which is well above the statewide upper quartile value of 9.6 fish/gill net for class 22 lakes.  The 2012 assessment marks the third consecutive assessment of Lake Plantagenet that documented particularly high walleye abundance.  The average length of walleye captured in 2012 was 13.9 inches.  Age analysis of the sample indicated two very abundant year classes of young walleye (age-1 and age-2) that will grow to a harvestable size in two to three years.  The recruitment potential of these two year classes should bode well for walleye anglers in the near term.   Walleye angler catch rates on Lake Plantagenet are particularly good from the walleye opener through June and again in October. <br> \n <br> \nLake Plantagenet has gained a reputation as a trophy muskellunge lake, with fish exceeding 50 inches in length reported annually.  Muskellunge are not sampled effectively in standard population assessments, and no muskellunge were captured in the 2012 population assessment.  Fishing pressure directed at muskellunge can be high at times. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch fishing can be good on Lake Plantagenet.  Yellow perch captured in the 2012 assessment ranged up to 12.4 inches in length, with 11% of the sample exceeding 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike up to 32.5 inches in length were also captured in 2012.  The northern pike catch rate of 4.0 fish/gill net is within the normal range for class 22 lakes.  The average size of northern pike in the 2012 sample was 19.7 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Lake Plantagenet appears to have experienced a recent decline in the average size of northern pike.  Historically, Lake Plantagenet was known for quality northern pike fishing.  Pike reproduction has been consistent and the lake contains adequate forage and habitat for producing large pike, so these declines are likely related to overharvest of fish in the larger size classes.  Anglers can help reverse this trend by releasing northern pike larger than 24 inches in length and keeping smaller pike for table fare. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish (sunfish, black crappie) and largemouth bass are present in the fish community in low numbers, which is typical of a lake class 22 fish community.  Trap net catch rates for bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass were below the normal range for lake class in the 2012 assessment.  Other species present in the fish community include redhorse and white sucker, yellow bullhead and rock bass. <br> \n</p>",

This population is also managed as a brood stock source and it frequently contributes eggs toward statewide production needs.  To monitor this population, periodic multi-year assessments are conducted with the goal of estimating the total number of adult fish. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, a special trap netting assessment targeting spawning adult muskies was conducted in early spring.  During the nearly 3 week long assessment, 65 fish were captured and marked with a fin clip in order to be identified the following year and derive a population estimate based on the proportion of recaptures. <br> \n <br> \nIn mid-May of 2018, night electrofishing was conducted over a span of 11 nights to capture adult muskies during the spawning season.  During 28 total hours of electrofishing, 45 fish were captured.  Of those 45 fish, 27 were males and 18 were females.  Lengths ranged from 37.7 to 54.3 inches and averaged 46.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSix of the 45 fish captured in 2018 had a mark from 2017.  Utilizing a simple model to estimate population size, results indicate that approximately 433 adult Muskellunge inhabited the 2,531 acre lake in 2017 at a density of 0.17 adult muskies per surface-acre.  Though seemingly low, this is a typical density of mature adults for a lake of this size. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Plantaganette is a Class 22 lake and is compared with other Bemidji area lakes including Bemidji, Cass andPike Bay.  There are about 70 lakes of this class distributed statewide.  During the 1994 assessment 24species of gamefish and minnows were sampled but others including muskellunge are known to be present.Walleye are the primary management species with secondary management of muskellunge and northern pike. Specialregulations prohibit the harvest of muskies less than 48 inches in length.Walleye were captured at rates exceeding 75% of the lakes in this class but at about half the rate of the 1989survey.  The average length of walleye sampled was about 13.6 inches.  The largest walleye sampled was 26.2inches in length and weighted 6.7 pounds.  Fourteen percent of the fish sampled were greater than 20 inches inlength.  Walleye fry are stocked alternate years (1994, 1992, 1990).  High numbers of walleye from the 1992stock (9\" - 10.5\") and 1990 stock (14\"-16\") were sampled suggesting good fishing to come.Northern pike were sampled at rates well below the normal range for lakes of this class.  The average weightof pike sampled was 2.3 pounds which is also slightly below normal for comparable lakes.  The largest pikesampled was about 31 inches in length and weighted 7.1 pounds.  About half of the pike sampled were greaterthan 21 inches in length.Plantaganette is used as a source for muskie eggs.  The special regulations prohibiting harvest of muskiesless than 48 inches in length is intended to protect potential brood stock.  No attempt to collect eggs wasnecessary during the spring of 1994, but previous seasons have produced eggs and muskies greater than 50\" inlength.  No muskellunge were captured during this assessment but summer netting is not an effective method ofsampling this specie.Yellow perch were sampled in average class numbers but with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Most areprobably not attractive to anglers.  About 3 percent of the perch sampled were greater than 10 inches inlength.  Yellow grub and neascus are found on a few perch.All three bullhead species are present and though numbers appear to be low those anglers seeking them may beable to find good numbers of nice sized fish.Tullibee and white sucker are abundant and are primary forage species for the muskellunge and northern pikepopulations.  Some tullibee and whitefish netting occurs each fall but the extent of this fishery has not beendetermined.Plantaganette is not recognized as a bass panfish lake so the following species, though present, are generallysampled at low rates.  Largemouth bass are often seen as young-of-the-year and yearling but few adult fish arefound.  Black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrids are present but only incidentalcatches are made.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Plantagenet Lake on August 7, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 20.2 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.5?C (67.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) at some depths below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 1994-2017 further indicate marginal oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Lake Plantagenet was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 5-14 July 2022. Twenty-four sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sites with two sites sampled from the boat due to dense wild rice preventing nearer access to shore. A 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites with one being a boat-aided seine, a 15-foot seine was used at twelve sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 32 native species of fish including ten species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, Rock Bass, and Cisco) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate Lake Plantagenet is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These survey results agree with the previous assessment decision for Lake Plantagenet. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Planatagenette is a 2529-acre lake with a maximum depth of 65 feet.  The lake is located 2 1/2 miles south of Bemidji in north central Hubbard County.  There is a DNR concrete public access in the southeast corner of the lake off county road 9.  Another public access (earthen) is located in the northeast corner off of county road 35.  The DNR manages the lake for walleye, muskellunge, northern pike and yellow perch.The walleye catch rate in 2004 was consistent with earlier assessments and higher than what you would typically find in other similar lakes.  Walleye from 7 to 25 inches were sampled with an average length and weight of 14 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Forty-four percent of the walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches.  Stocked walleye are an important component of the fishery and are supporting an excellent population.  Anglers will have good success now and in the future fishing for walleye.Muskellunge are not native to Lake Plantaganette, and the Leech Lake strain of muskies were first introduced in 1982.  There is a minimum size limit of 48 inches on the lake that has been successful with anglers catching muskie over 50 inches in length.Northern pike abundance has historically been low.  In 2004 pike sampled ranged in length from 12.5 to 33 inches with an average length and weight of 21.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Age data indicates that pike natural reproduction is consistent.  There is suitable spawning habitat both within the lake and in the Schoolcraft River drainage.Yellow perch and white sucker provide excellent forage for predator fish such as northern pike, muskie and walleye.  Both species are abundant.  Anglers are also having success catching quality-sized perch.  Shorthead redhorse and tullibee (cisco) are two additional species that can be utilized as forage.Bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass are present but are sampled in very low abundance.  Preferred habitat appears to be limiting recruitment to miminal levels.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  At least 65% of the shoreline on Plantaganette has been developed.  These areas along with their emergent stands of vegetation such as bulrush are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Various species of fish use bulrush as nursery, feeding and spawning areas.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners developing their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.
