Northern pike sampled with gill nets had a catch rate (9.3/set) that exceeded the expected range for this type of lake.  The mean length for sampled northern pike was 15.6 inches, with a length range from 9.9 to 32.4 inches.  The mean weight was 1.1 pounds.     Black crappie were sampled with trap nets, and had a mean catch rate (4.0/set) that was within the expected range.  The mean length was 6.2 inches, with a length range from 3.7 to 11.0 inches.     Other species caught include: bluegill, golden shiner, and tadpole madtom.     McKewen Lake provides anglers with a unique opportunity to fish a lake that receives little fishing pressure and maintains its undeveloped shoreline.</p>",
