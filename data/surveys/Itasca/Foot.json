                "narrative": "<p>Cut Foot Sioux is a 2,771 acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Deer River, Minnesota.  The south side of the lake is directly connected to Lake Winnibigoshish at what is locally called the gap.  There are several public and resort accesses on the lake.  The 2013 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Northern Pike and Walleye as the primary species of management with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch as a secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintain a Northern Pike catch of 5.0/gill net with 45% of the sample longer than 21 inches and 20% longer than 28 inches; and maintain a Walleye catch of 5.5/gill net with 40% of the sample longer than 15 inches and 10% longer than 20 inches.  A standard survey that included 15 gill nets and 15 trap nets was conducted in mid-June to assess the fish community.      <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches were below 8 fish/gill net in all but one survey prior to 2002.  Since 2002, three out of the four surveys documented catches above 8 fish/gill net; a trend that appears to be happening statewide.  The 2017 catch of 9.9 fish/net was the third highest for the lake and was well above the LMP goal.  Higher Northern Pike numbers frequently result in poor size structure.  In 2017, the sampled fish ranged from 14.2 to 39.0 inches and averaged 21.2 inches.  The size structure goals were not met since only 41% of the sample was longer than 21 inches and only 8% were longer than 28 inches.  Seven age-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to age 9 present.  Age-2 and 3 fish represented 69% of the sample.  Despite high catch rates, growth remained good compared to statewide averages.  Fish averaged 24.1 inches after four years.  Anglers are encouraged to release all fish over 30 inches in order to preserve the genetics of the fastest growing fish with the largest maximum size potential. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rates have been relatively stable since the first survey in 1975.  Although the lowest catch was 1.8 fish/net in 1975 and the highest was 10.3 fish/net in 1987, 13 of the 20 catches were between 4.0 and 6.6 fish/net.  In 2017, the gill-net catch of 4.6 fish/net fell short of the 5.5 fish/net management goal.  The Walleye population appeared to be in good condition based on the size and age structures.  Walleye from 7.4 to 25.6 inches were sampled and the average length was 15.9 inches.  The size structure goals were met with 56% of the sample longer than 15 inches and 20% longer than 20 inches.  Twelve age-classes were identified with age-2 through 4 fish representing 55% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages, as age-4 fish averaged 15.6 inches.  Anglers are reminded of the 18 to 23 inch protected slot, with only one Walleye over 23 inches in possession. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been variable, ranging from 0.9 to 10.1 fish/trap net.  The gill-net and trap-net catch rates were 3.5 and 0.9 fish/net in 2017.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.4 to 12.4 inches for the combined gears.  Seven age classes from age 2 to 8 were sampled.  Age-2 and age-3 fish represented 38 and 48% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class averages.  Survey nets often do not sample Black Crappie effectively because the fish frequently suspend offshore where the nets are not set.  Despite lower survey results, Black Crappie angling can be good at times. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have fluctuated from zero in 1952 to 12.7/trap net in 2007.  The 2017 catch of 4.9/trap net was within the normal range for these types of lakes.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches and averaged 4.6 inches.  Six age classes from age 1 to 6 were estimated from scales.  Growth was fast compared to other lakes similar to Cut Foot; fish averaged 8.1 inches after five years.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are an important prey species for large predators like Northern Pike, Muskies and Walleye.  However because they often are found suspended over deep water they are difficult to sample with our standardized summer surveys.  As a result, catch rates are often low but can be highly variable.  The highest catch of 32.3/gill net occurred in 1975 while the lowest catch of 1.7/gill net occurred in 1991.  In 2017, 4.9/gill net were sampled.  The sampled fish ranged from 6.6 to 17.5 inches and averaged 11.4 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected but the diverse size distribution would suggest at least three age classes were represented. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been relatively stable remaining above average for the lake type in all surveys.  In 2017, the catch was 38.1 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.1 to 9.2 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Six age classes from age 2 to 7 were estimated from scales.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages.  Based on the size distribution, Yellow Perch are probably more important within the fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cut Foot Sioux Lake is a 2768 acre lake in NW Itasca County.  It is managed for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, largemouth bass and bluegill.  It is connected to Lake Winnibigoshish, a large reservoir on the Mississippi River.  There are several accesses, campgrounds and resorts on the lake.The walleye gill net catch rate was within the expected range for this type of lake and within the range observed in past assessments.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 7.2 - 24.9 inches long and had an average length of 15.8 inches.  There is currently a regulation that prohibits the harvest of walleye between 17 - 26 inches.The northern pike gill net catch rate exceeded the expected range and was the highest catch rate ever observed on Cut Foot Sioux Lake.  The mean weight of gill net captured northern pike was 2.1 lbs. and the mean length was 19.6 inches.  The largest northern pike sampled was 37.6 inches.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate also exceeded the expected range yet was within the range observed in past assessments.  Yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.9 - 11.3 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for northern pike and walleye.The black crappie gill net catch rate was within the expected range whereas the trap net catch rate exceeded the expected range.  Crappie catch rates can be highly variable between the two types of nets.  Crappie sampled in gill nets had a mean length of 6.2 inches.  Trapnet sampled fish had a mean length of 9.2 inches.The bluegill trap net catch rate is below the expected range.  Low bluegill abundance is generally desirable, as high abundance generally leads to mostly small fish.  Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged from 3.7 to 9.2 inches long and had a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Bluegill in Cut Foot Sioux grow very quickly, reaching 6 inches after only three years.  However, releasing a portion of the larger bluegill caught is the only way to insure that this quality fishery is maintained.Other species sampled in the gill and trap nets included:  bowfin, black, brown and yellow bullheads, burbot, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, redhorse sp. (including shorthead), rock bass, tadpole madtom, tullibee (cisco) and white sucker.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, yet the combined effects of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.

A special assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux in late September of 2009 consisting of 15 standard gill net sets.  The purpose of this special assessment was to provide data on the walleye population for use in a research project evaluating fry stocking related to the spring walleye egg-take operation.  Data collected in this assessment will be used to determine spawning stock biomass and a population estimate.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch was 7.0/gill net which was between the lake class median and third quartile of 6.6 and 9.6/net.  This special assessment was also conducted in 2007 and 2008.  The walleye catch rate in those two assessments was 12.3 and 8.6/net.  Size structure was good with a PSD of 62, an RSD-P of 12, and an RSD-M of 0.  Ages were assigned to otoliths, but scales were not collected for back-calculation.  Eight year classes were sampled and ages 3 and 4 comprised 68% of fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rate in 2009 was 7.1/gill net and was much higher than the third quartile of 1.1/net.  Catch rates in 2007 and 2008 were also higher than the third quartile at 15.7 and 5.9/gill net.   Size structure was very good with a PSD of 99, an RSD-P of 46, and RSD-M of 1.  Six year classes were sampled from ages 1 to 7.  Ages 3 and 4 were especially abundant and comprised 84% of fish sampled.  Growth was slightly faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 10.1 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rate was 2.9/gill net which was similar to the first quartile of 3.0/gill net.  Catch rates in 2007 were higher at 5.9/gill net and slightly lower in 2008 at 2.7/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with a PSD of 58, and RSD-P of 16, and an RSD-M of 2.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 16.5/gill net which was similar to the lake class average of 17.1/gillnet.  Catch rates were similar in 2007 and 2008 at 12.2 and 15.5/gill net.  Size structure was relatively poor with a PSD of 27, an RSD-P of 2, and an RSD-M of 0.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured in relatively high numbers.  The 2009 catch rate was 17.5/gill net and was much higher than the lake class third quartile of 5.2/gill net.  Catch rates in 2007 and 2008 were also higher than the third quartile with rates of 10.1 and 14.6/gill net.    <br> \n</p>",

A special assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux in late September 2011 and has been conducted annually since 2007.  The purpose of this special assessment was to provide data on the walleye population for use in a research project evaluating fry stocking related to the spring walleye egg-take operation.  Data collected in this assessment will be used to determine spawning stock biomass and a population estimate. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch was 7.3/gill net and was between the lake class median and third quartile value of 6.6 and 9.6/net.  The walleye catch rate in the last four assessments has varied from 7.0 to 12.3/net.  Size structure was moderate with a PSD of 69, a RSD-P of 5 and a RSD-M of 0.  Ages were determined from otoliths but backcalculated ages were not determined.  Nine year classes were sampled and ages 4 and 5 comprised 59% of fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill net catch rate was 18.4/net and was higher than the third quartile value of 1.1/net.  Catch rates in the last four special assessments were lower and varied from 5.9 to 15.7/gill net.  Size structure was poor with a PSD of 15, RSD-P of 9 and RSD-M of 2.  Five year-classes were sampled from ages 1 to 6.  Age 1 were especially abundant and comprised 64% of fish sampled.  Growth was slightly faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 10.6 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rate was 4.5/gill net which was near the lake class median of 5.0/net.  Catch rates in 2010 were lower at 3.0/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with a PSD of 37, a RSD-P of 15 and a RSD-M of 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 15.3/gill net which was near the lake class median of 17.1/gill net.  Catch rates were similar in the last four assessments varying from 12.2 to 16.5/gill net.  Size structure was relatively poor with a PSD of 31, a RSD-P of 4, and a RSD-M of 0. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured in relatively high numbers.  The 2011 catch rate was 11.6/gill net and was higher than the lake class third quartile value of 5.2/gill net.  Catch rates in 2010 were also higher than the third quartile value with a rate of 22.5/gill net. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cut foot Sioux is a 2,768-acre, class 22 lake located in northwest Itasca County.  The lake is connected to Lake Winnibigoshish, a large reservoir on the Mississippi River.  There are six public accesses and several resorts on the lake.  The 2008 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch as secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 management plan indicates the goal for walleye is to maintain a gill-net catch of 5.5 fish/net with PSD and RSD-P values greater than 40 and 10, respectively.  The walleye gill-net catch rate was 4.5 fish/net in 2012.  The catch in 2012 was the same as the 2007 catch and similar to the long-term average of 4.6 fish/net for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.0 to 24.8 inches and averaged 15.0 inches.  Size structure values for PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M were 51, 16 and 0, respectively.  Ten year-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to 11 present.  Walleye averaged 15.4 inches after four years of growth.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages.  <br> \n <br> \nThe management plan goal for northern pike was to maintain a gill-net catch of 5.0 fish/net with PSD and RSD-P values greater than 45 and 20, respectively.  Northern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 2.4 to 11.5 fish/net since 1975.  Following the two highest catches on record in the 2002 and 2007 assessments, the catch declined to 6.4 fish/net in 2012.  The 2012 catch was closer to the lake mean of 5.7 fish/net and the management goal.  Northern pike ranged from 12.9 to 33.9 inches and averaged 19.5 inches.  Size structural indices had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 22, 8 and 0.  Nine year-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to age 10 present.  The age structure was dominated by age 2 fish, representing 52% of the fish sampled.   <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie are not sampled effectively in many lakes due to their behavior of suspending off the bottom away from shallow cover during the summer.  The normal range for this lake class is 0.2 to 1.1 fish/gill net and 0.3 to 1.7 fish/trap net.  Gill nets sampled 28 fish for a catch rate of 1.9 fish/net.  The trap nets captured 13 fish for a catch rate of 0.9 fish/net.  The fish that were sampled were smaller, ranging from 3.3 to 12.2 and had a mean length near 6.0 inches.  Five year-classes were identified from scales with fish from age 1 to age 6 present.  Age-2 fish represented 71% of the sample.  Growth was somewhat slower than the class 22 means but this is may be in response to the large 2010 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population can be characterized by lower density with good size structure.  The gill net and trap net catch rates were 0.3 and 0.6/net in 2012.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.5 to 9.5 inches but five of the 12 fish were 8.0 inches or longer.  Five age classes were identified by scales that ranged from age 2 to 7.  Growth was fast compared to other class 22 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population has fluctuated from 20.4 to 58.3 fish/gill net since 1975.  The gill net catch rate was 29.3 fish/net in 2012, near the lake class 3rd quartile.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Six year classes were identified from scales with fish from age 2 to 7 represented.  Age-3 to 5 fish represented 87% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nTullibees are often difficult to sample with our standard summer assessments due to their pelagic nature.  As a result, tullibee catch rates are generally low but they can be highly variable.  The highest gill-net catch rate of 32.3 fish/net occurred in 1975 while the lowest catch of 1.7 fish/net occurred in 1991.  The 2012 gill-net catch of  9.7 fish/net was above the 3rd quartile value of 5.2 fish/net and approached the average of 13.2 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.2 to 18.5 inches and averaged 12.1 inches.  Although no age structures were collected, the diverse length distribution is an indication of multiple age classes in the population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, muskellunge, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

A special assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux in late September of 2008 consisting of 15 standard gill net sets.  The purpose of this special assessment was to provide data on the walleye population for use in a research project evaluating put-back fry stocking.  Data collected in this assessment will be used to determine spawning stock biomass and a population estimate using Qabg modeling. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, yellow perch were the most common fish in the gill nets and were captured at a rate of 15.5/gill net.  This catch rate was near the median value for the ecological lake class (17.1/gill net) and was similar to the catch rate in 2007 (12.2/gill net).  Size structure was relatively poor in both years as proportional stock density (PSD) and relative stock density (RSD) were 27.5 and 5.5 in 2007 and 7.4 and 0.4 in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 12.3/gill net in 2007, exceeding the third quartile value of 9.6/gill net for the lake class.  The catch rate was 8.6/gill net in 2008, near the third quartile value.  Size structure was good in both assessments as PSD and RSD were 78.2 and 16.7 in 2007 and 73.0 and 18.0 in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 5.9/gill net in 2007, near the mean of 5.0/gill net for the lake class.  In 2008, however, the catch of 2.7/gill net was relatively low and was below the first quartile value of 3.0/gill net.  Size structure was similar in both assessments as PSD and RSD were 46.1 and 12.4 in 2008 and 43.6 and 7.7 in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were capture in relatively high numbers in both assessments.  The catches of 15.7/gill net in 2007 and 5.9/gill net in 2008 exceeded the third quartile value of 1.1/gillnet. In 2007, size structure was poor as PSD and RSD were 38.8 and 1.8.  Size structured improved in 2008, however, as PSD and RSD were 43.8 and 11.2. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured in relatively high numbers.  The 2007 catch of 10.1/gill net and 2008 catch of 14.6/gill net exceeded the third quartile value 5.2/gill net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cut Foot Sioux is a 2,768-acre, class 22 lake located in northwest Itasca County.  The lake is connected to Lake Winnibigoshish, a large reservoir on the Mississippi River.  There are six public accesses and several resorts on the lake.  The 2008 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch as secondary species.  The fall special assessment on Cut Foot Sioux has been conducted annually in conjunction with the fall large lake sampling since 2007.  The goal was to collect data on the walleye population for a research project evaluating fry stocking related to the spring walleye egg-take operation.  Data from this assessment will be used to estimate spawning stock biomass and an adult population estimate. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate was 6.2 fish/net in 2012 which approached the lake class median of 6.6 fish/net.  The catch in the prior five assessments ranged from 7.0 to 12.3 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.6 to 24.8 inches and had a mean length of 16.4 inches.  Eleven year-classes were identified from otolith analysis with fish from age 0 to 11 present.  Back-calculated lengths at ages were not determined.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net catch rates ranged from 2.7 to 5.9 fish/net in the six fall assessments.  The 2012 catch of 3.9 fish/net was near the lake class median of 5.0 fish/net.  Northern pike ranged from 16.7 to 35.3 inches and had a mean length of 21.6 inches.  Aging structures have not been collected during the fall special assessments. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are not sampled effectively in many lakes due to their behavior of suspending off the bottom away from shallow cover during the summer.  Fall gill netting appears to be much more effective in sampling black crappie, at least in Cut Foot Sioux.  In the last six fall assessments, the gill net catch for black crappie has ranged from 2.1 to 18.4/net.  However, three of the catch rates were above 15 fish/net.  The fish that were sampled in 2012 ranged from 4.8 to 12.2 and had a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Seven year-classes were identified from scales and otoliths with fish from age 1 to age 8 present.  Age-2 fish represented 76% of the sample.  Growth was somewhat slower than the class 22 means but this is may be in response to the large 2010 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population can be characterized by lower density with good size structure.  The gill net catch was 1.3/net in 2012.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.6 to 9.5 inches but five of the 19 fish were 8.0 inches or longer.  Five age classes were identified by scales and otoliths that ranged from age 1 to 6.  Growth was fast compared to other class 22 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rates have been quite stable since fall sampling began in 2007.  The catches have varied from 12.2 to 17.4 fish/gill net.  The 2012 gill net catch was the highest of the fall assessment catches.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.2 to 11.8 inches and had a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Aging structures were not collected in this assessment. <br> \n  <br> \nTullibees are often difficult to sample with our standard summer assessments due to their pelagic nature.  The fall catches have fluctuated from 10.1 to 22.5 fish/net.  The 2012 gill-net catch of  13.9 fish/net was above the 3rd quartile value of 5.2 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.6 to 17.0 inches and had a mean length of 12.8 inches.  Although no age structures were collected, the diverse length distribution is an indication of multiple age classes in the population.</p>",

A special assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux in late September of 2007 consisting of 15 standard gill net sets.  The purpose of this special assessment was to provide data on the walleye population for use in a research project evaluating put-back fry stocking.  Data collected in this assessment was used to determine spawning stock biomass and a population estimate using Qabg.  This project is being done in conjunction with Lake Winnibigoshish. <br> \n</p>",

A special assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux in late September of 2010 and has been conducted annually since 2007.  The purpose of this special assessment was to provide data on the walleye population for use in a research project evaluating fry stocking related to the spring walleye egg-take operation.  Data collected in this assessment will be used to determine spawning stock biomass and a population estimate.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch was 8.6/gill net and was between the lake class median and third quartile of 6.6 and 9.6/net.  The walleye catch rate in the last three special assessments has varied from 7.0 to 12.3/net.  Size structure was good with a PSD of 86, an RSD-P of 7 and an RSD-M of 0.  Ages were assigned to otoliths and backcalculated ages were not calculated.  Eleven year classes were sampled and age 4 comprised 53% of fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rate in 2009 was 2.1/gill net and was higher than the third quartile of 1.1/net.  Catch rates in the last three special assessments were higher and varied from 5.9 to 15.7/gill net.  Size structure was very good with a PSD of 89, an RSD-P of 79 and RSD-M of 7.  Five year classes were sampled from ages 1 to 6.  Age 4 were especially abundant and comprised 50% of fish sampled.  Growth was slightly faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 10.7 inches by age 5.  Black crappie are difficult to sample and it is unknown if the decline in catch rate is due to angler harvest, year class variability or just a poor sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rate was 3.1/gill net which was similar to the first quartile of 3.0/gill net.  Catch rates in 2009 were similar at 2.9/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with a PSD of 48, and RSD-P of 13, and an RSD-M of 2.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 11.3/gill net which was between the first quartile and median of 7.1 and 17.1/gill net.  Catch rates were similar in the last three assessments varying from 12.2 to 16.5/gill net.  Size structure was relatively poor with a PSD of 41, an RSD-P of 3, and an RSD-M of 0.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured in relatively high numbers.  The 2010 catch rate was 22.5/gill net and was much higher than the lake class third quartile of 5.2/gill net.  Catch rates in 2007 and 2008 were also higher than the third quartile with rates of 10.1 and 14.6/gill net.    <br> \n</p>",

For unknown reasons walleye were not present in substantial numbers during the survey.  It appears a weak 1972 year class lowered angling success this year.  A good 1973 year class should start becoming vulnerable to anglers next year and increase fishing success.  All other fish populations appear to be present in numbers consistent with the character of this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cut Foot Sioux is a 2,768-acre lake in ecological class 22.  The lake is located in western Itasca County and is connected to Lake Winnibigoshish to the southwest.  A population assessment was conducted on Cut Foot Sioux to determine the status of the fish community.  The assessment included night boat electrofishing for largemouth bass in late June and gill and trap netting to assess other species in mid-June.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common fish in both the gill net and trap net samples.  The perch catch exceeded the expected range for the lake type, indicating relatively high abundance of this species.  Size structure was moderate, with approximately 33% of the perch sampled exceeding 8 inches.  Fish exceeding 10 inches were rare, however.  Aside from being a popular target of anglers, perch are an important component of the prey base in Cut Foot Sioux. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch remained typical for the lake.  Size structure was relatively poor, however, with about 40% of the sampled individuals exceeding 15 inches and less than 7% exceeding 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike remained high in the gill nets and the catch exceeded the expected range for the lake type.  Size structure was moderate and few individuals exceeded 28 inches.  Anglers can help improve the size structure of northern pike by voluntarily releasing pike from 22 to 36 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious assessments characterized the bluegill population as having low density with fast growth.   In 2007, bluegill were captured at an average rate for the lake type.  The 2007 catch was the highest bluegill catch observed for the lake.  Size structure remained favorable as 57% of the catch exceeded 6 inches and 23% exceeded 8 inches.  Black crappie were also captured at a relatively high rate when compared to similar lakes and the catch was the highest observed for Cut foot Sioux.  Size structure was relatively poor, however, as most individuals were less than 7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are an important prey species, and are typically associated with the production of large predators.  Tullibee catches declined steadily from 1994 to 2002.  In 2007, tullibee catch continued to decline.  Despite the decline, the catch rate still exceeded range for the lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cut Foot Sioux is a 2,771 acre lake located 15 miles northwest of Deer River, Minnesota. The lake is connected to Little Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish, making it a popular fishing destination. The section of Fisheries has managed the laked primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, but other popular species include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch. Fisheries staff survey the lake approximately every five years, with the most recent survey occurring in 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie are popular panfish species for anglers to target on Cut Foot Sioux. The lake is currently managed for quality sized sunfish, with a five fish bag limit. Bluegill sampled during the 2023 survey ranged from about 6 to 9 inches, and approximately half were from a very strong 2020 year class that averaged 6.6 inches. Black Crappie are not typically caught in large numbers in mid-summer when this survey is completed so the sample size was small, but still within the range expected for similar lakes. Crappies ranged from 5 to 12 inches. Recent creel surveys have shown that more anglers are targeting Black Crappie in Cut Foot Sioux than they have in the past.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are fairly abundant in Cut Foot Sioux when comparing catch rates to similar lakes. High density populations tend to have a poor size structure, and while there are a lot of small pike in Cut Foot Sioux, the lake has shown the ability to grow some large pike as well. The largest sampled in 2023 measured 40.6 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike while releasing large individuals to improve the size structure of the population.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile the strength of any given year class can widely vary, the overall abundance of Walleye in Cut Foot Sioux has remained stable over time. A strong 2019 year class made up 39% of the Walleye caught during the 2023 survey. The 2018 and 2021 year classes were also fairly well represented in the catch. With the current age distribution, the population mostly consisted of 14 to 17 inch Walleye. The 2019 year class averaged just under 15 inches at the time of the survey while the 2018 year class averaged just over 16 inches. There is some natural reproduction in Cut Foot Sioux and Winnibigoshish, and Walleye fry are also stocked here annually. It is common for Walleye populations to be dominated by just a few year classes at any given time, but there is usually some measurable amount of recruitment in Cut Foot Sioux from most year classes. During the 2023 survey there were 9 year classes present. Ages ranged from 1 to 13 years old, with sizes ranging from about 8 to 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are commonly targeted in the connected Lake Winnibigoshish, but the size structure of the population in Cut Foot Sioux tends to run smaller. About 7% of the Yellow Perch caught in gill nets in 2023 were over 8 inches, and the average length was 6.6 inches. While there are some harvestable size fish in the lake, Yellow Perch typically provide more value as a prey item for the predators in Cut Foot Sioux.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) are another important prey item. Tullibee have been decreasing in abundance in Cut Foot Sioux, which matches a trend that has been observed in Winnibigoshish and many other lakes over the past few decades. Other gamefish species in Cut Foot Sioux include Largemouth Bass and Muskellunge. These species are not commonly caught with the sample nets that are used for standard lake surveys.
