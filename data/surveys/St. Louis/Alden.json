                "narrative": "<p>Big Alden is a 180 acre lake with 159 (88%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 29 feet .  Big Alden Lake is located 14 miles northeast of Duluth off St. Louis County Highway #44.  Big Alden does not have a developed public access along the shoreline but can be accessed by canoe through the Cloquet River.  The primary management species is walleye, with secondary management for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.     Walleye abundance of 3.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of walleye was 13.5 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 12.6 inches.  Recruitment was steady with all year classes from 1992 through 2000 represented.     Northern pike abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike mean length of 24.2 inches was large.  Growth was average with length at age four of 20.1 inches.     Yellow perch abundance of 11.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow perch mean length of 6.6 inches was small.  Growth was average with length at age four of 5.7 inches.  All year classes from 1993 through 1998 were represented, with a strong 1998 year class.     White sucker abundance of 9.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of white sucker was 15.4 inches.     Black crappie abundance of 0.7 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length of 11.3 inches was large.  Growth was average with length at age four of 8.2 inches.  Four year classes were represented from 1994 through 1998,  with a strong 1998 year class.     Bluegill abundance of 2.3 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.9 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 6.0 inches.  Eight year classes were represented from 1989 through 1998, with a strong 1997 year class.     A largemouth bass and smallmouth bass electrofishing assessment was conducted in the spring of 2001.  A total of 3 smallmouth bass and 0 largemouth bass were sampled.  Mean length of sampled smallmouth bass was 9.9 inches.     Other fish species sampled in Big Alden Lake include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse and tadpole madtom.  Fifteen largemouth bass were sampled as young-of-the-year in a shoreline seine.     Due to limited public access on Big Alden Lake, fishing pressure is considered light.  Future management will be limited by its low fisheries management priority rating.</p>",
