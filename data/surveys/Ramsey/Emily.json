Black bullhead and black crappie were abundant.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.5 inches, with most fish between 5 and 6 inches.  The largest black crappie sampled was 12 inches, but most were less than 6 inches.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers.  Average length was 5 inches and the largest bluegill sampled was 7 inches.</p>",
