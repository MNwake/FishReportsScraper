It provides picnic shelters, swimming, camping, and fishing.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community, which provides quality habitat for northern pike, bass, and sunfish.  These plants are also important in preventing shoreline erosion and maintaining good water quality.The fish community in Little Chippewa Lake is typical of a small basin with extensive aquatic vegetation.  Northern pike are abundant with average gillnet catches of 13.7 fish/net.  Size structure has improved.  Northern pike averaged 2.7 pounds in weight and 22.0 inches in length.  The largest fish captured in the 2005 survey measured 35.4 inches.An abundant largemouth bass population is comprised primarily of smaller fish.  Electrofishing catches averaged 82.0 fish/hour in 2005.  Average length of sampled fish was 9.7 inches.  Two percent of the sampled fish exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Age-3 and age-4 largemouth bass comprised 55% of the sampled fish.Bluegill are abundant and should provide good fishing.  Over 90% of the fish sampled with trapnets in 2005 were 6.0 inches in length or greater.  However, only 4% of the fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Growth is good with age-5 fish averaging 5.8 inches in length.Walleye are managed as a secondary species.  Fingerlings are stocked in alternate years to provide additional angling opportunities.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.3 fish/net in 2005.  A catch rate of 2.1 fish/net was recorded in 2001.  The normal range of mean catch rates for this type of lake is 1.2 to 6.3 fish/net.  Mean weight of captured fish was 2.6 pounds in 2005.  Stocking rates were increased in 2000 to enhance walleye abundance.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa Lake is a relatively small, lightly developed basin just north of the town of Brandon in Douglas County.  It is part of the Upper Chippewa Chain of Lakes which includes Chippewa, Devils, Stowe, and Whiskey lakes.  Little Chippewa Lake is connected to Devils Lake via a shallow waterway between the two basins.  Chippewa Park, located on the east shore, is a popular destination during summer months.  It support picnics, swimming, camping, and shore fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Chippewa Lake is typical of most small, bass-panfish lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Submergent and emergent vegetation are relatively abundant and provide quality habitat for northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfishes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are very abundant.  Gillnet catches during the 2009 survey exceeded 11.0 pike/net.  Most pike were smaller individuals but larger pike exceeding 30.0 inches were measured.  Spring electrofishing statistics described a very good largemouth bass fishery.   Electrofishing catches averaged 81.0 bass/hour.  Mean length of captures was 11.2 inches.   Approximately 15% of 8.0 inch and larger captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  The largest bass measured 19.3 inches.   Bluegill catch rates have increased over time.  Trapnet catches during the 2009 survey averaged 65.0 fish/net.   Average size is better than might be anticipated in a very abundant population.  Mean sizes of bluegill captured in 2009 was 6.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.   Higher catches and a reasonably good size distribution are largely attributable to high relative contributions of six- and seven-year-old individuals in the total catch. <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates have been low in recent surveys.  Trapnet catches in 2009 averaged only 1.4 crappie/net.    Mean sizes of crappie captured was 8.9 inches and 0.7 pounds.   Walleye are stocked on an alternate year basis to provide additional angling opportunities.   Contributions of stockings have not been great.  Gillnet catches in 2009 averaged 0.8 walleye/net.  Low catch rates are not unexpected due to habitat attributes and overly abundant northern pike and largemouth bass populations.  <br> \n  <br> \nAnglers are strongly encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and directed harvest of more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   Survey statistics verify that very limited walleye abundance in Little Chippewa Lake is directly related to an expanded northern pike population.   Reducing small largemouth bass and northern pike numbers should also improve survival and catches of stocked walleye. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 29, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. The nearshore sampling captured 17 native fish species including three species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) intolerant of habitat disturbance and two species (Common Carp and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard trap net and gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Little Chippewa Lake based on this survey is exceptionally high, and well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides qualityhabitat for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  These aquatic plants are also important inpreventing shoreline erosion and maintaining good water clarity and quality.Northern pike catches averaged 11.5 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catch rates have been lower in previoussurveys, ranging from 0.6 to 5.6 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1978.  Most of the fish werebetween 19 and 24 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.7 pounds.  Walleyecatches decreased from 12.2 fish/gillnet in 1993 to 2.8 fish/gillnet in 1997.  Gillnet catches haveranged from 4.8 to 14.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1978.  Mean weight of fish capturedin 1997 was 1.6 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 21 inches.  The recent decline in walleye abundanceis difficult to explain.  The frequency and rate of walleye fingerling stocking has not changed.  Theconcurrent increase in northern pike abundance may be related to the decline, however forage does notseem to be limited.  Electrofishing yielded 40.5 largemouth bass per hour.  In comparison,electrofishing yielded 86.7 fish per hour in 1993.  Most of the fish captured in 1997 were between 15.0and 16.0 inches in total length.  Over 80% of the fish were age-6 or greater.  This age classdistribution suggests poor reproductive success during the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993. Bluegill catches averaged 32.6 fish/trapnet in 1997.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 20.8 to 37.3fish/net in surveys dating back to 1983.  Only one-fourth of the fish captured were 6.0 inches inlength or greater and few exceeded 8.0 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged71.2 fish/net.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 68.6 to 158.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating backto 1978.  Most of the fish sampled in gillnets were between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in total length.  Blackcrappie are not effectively sampled during summer months to accurately evaluate relative density andsize structure.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.9 fish/net and one fish was captured in the gillnets. Total lengths ranged from 6.9 to 8.9 inches.  All nine of the fish captured were age-2.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa Lake is a small (269 acres), lightly developed basin located just north of Brandon in Douglas County.  Little Chippewa Lake and connected basisns including Big Chippewa, Devils, Stowe, and Whiskey lakes form the headwaters of the West Branch of the Chippewa river.  Chippewa Park, located on the east shore, is a popular destination during summer months.  Administered by the Douglas County Parks Department, the park supports picnics, swimming, camping, and shore fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Chippewa Lake is a typical example of small, bass-panfish lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Water clarity is good.  Submergent and emergent vegetation are abundant and provide necessary habitat for northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfishes. <br> \n <br> \nGillnet catches averaged 14.5 northern pike/net in 2013, well above expected catches for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average weight of pike was 2.3 pounds.  The largest pike caught during the survey measured 30.2 inches.  Most pike caught were young fish (age-5 or younger).  Due to excessive population abundance and intense competition for prey, pike grow slowly.  Anglers are strongly encouraged to harvest small pike. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant.  Average length and weight of bass captured by electrofishing was 12.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Approximately 59% of 8.0-inch and larger captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  The largest bass captured in the 2013 survey was 17.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnet catches during the 2013 survey were lower than that of preceding surveys, but bluegills remain abundant in the system.  Average size of bluegill captured in trapnets was 6.7 inches.  Growth of bluegill was less than desired to maximize quality fishing potential.  Older bluegills did not reach 8.0 inches until age 9.  Total annual mortality of these old, preferred-size fish may be very high.  Only 5% of bluegills caught in trapnets exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Current age structure indicates relatively strong annual recruitment into the population from 2004 through 2009.  Average size and fishing quality should be stable or improve over time as these fish approach 8.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches have been limited among surveys, but due to above-average growth and an extended age structure, crappie can grow to be large in Little Chippewa.  Two of eight fish captured in trapnets exceeded 13.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance appears inversely related to that of northern pike.  Gillnet catches averaged 4.7 walleyes/net.  Average length and weight of captures were 14.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Due to their low relative abundance, walleye in Little Chippewa Lake grow rapidly.  Age-4 walleye averaged 19.9 inches.  Natural reproduction is limited and supplemental walleye stocking (fingerlings, yearlings, adults) will continue to occur on an alternate year basis. <br> \n <br> \nDensities of yellow perch large enough to be recruited to gillnets are very limited due to predation by northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.  None of the captures were large enough to stimulate angler harvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yellow Perch are very abundant. Catch rates have increased steadily from 35.8 fish/gillnet night in 1955 to 158.0 fish/gillnet though relative densities have increased. Growth potential is likely limited by intraspecific competition. Early surveys indicated low Bluegill densities, however, catch rates increased to 37.33 fish/ trapnet night in 1983 and remain moderately high at 33.50 fish/trapnet night in the 1989 survey. Fifty-six percent of the Bluegills captured in the 1989 survey were over 6.0 inches long. Eight percent measured greater than 8.0 inches total length in contrast to Bluegill and Yellow Perch populations, Black Crappie densities appear to have decreased. Trap net catches in 1955 averaged 14.0/ net night and have since declined to 0.17 fish/net night. Electrofishing gear was used to capture Largemouth Bass. This effort yielded 22.5 fish/hour of electrofishing. Mean weight of Largemouth Bass captured was 1.4 lbs. PSD was calculated at 50 percent; however, too few fish were captured to adequately assess population structure. Northern Pike catch rates decreased significantly from previous surveys. This decrease may explain the expansion of the Yellow Perch population. Only three Northern Pike were netted during the survey, two of which measured greater than 26 inches in total length. Walleye gillnet indices have declined from 14.2 fish/gillnet in 1978 to 4.8 fish/gillnet. The 1986 fry stocking would appear to have produced the strongest year class. Almost annual stockings of fingerling or fry, preclude evaluation of natural recruitment. No stocking took place in 1989. Walleye growth rates appear to be below average for the area. Reduced growth rates and limited success of most stockings since 1983 may indicate substantial mortality and competition attributable to the increasingly abundant Yellow Perch population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community which provides qualityhabitat for largemouth bass and sunfish.  These aquatic plants are also important in preventingshoreline erosion and maintaining good water quality and clarity.Walleye gillnet catch rate increased from 4.8 fish/net in 1989 to 12.2 fish/net in 1993.  The normalrange of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 1.0 - 7.4fish/net.  The recent increase in walleye abundance can be attributed to a strong 1991 year class. Age-2 fish comprised 84% of fish captured in 1993.  Most fish sampled were between 13 to 15 inches inlength and averaged about 1.2 pounds.  An evaluation of past walleye stockings is not possible becauseof nearly annual stocking and the stocking of mixed age fish.  A more systematic stocking program wasinitiated in 1991 and should allow for a better evaluation of stocking success in future lake surveys. Northern pike catches averaged 2.2 fish/gillnet in 1993 which is within the normal range of mean catchrates (2.0 - 8.5 fish/net) from similar lakes.  Catch rates have ranged from 0.6 fish/net in 1989 to5.6 fish/net in 1978.  The mean weight of northern pike captured was 3.0 pounds with most of the fishmeasuring between 21 and 25 inches. Largemouth bass are abundant and should provide quality anglingopportunities.  Electrofishing yielded 87.6 fish per hour.  The largemouth bass population has a broadsize structure.  Approximately 50% of the fish are 12 inches or greater and 11% exceed 15 inches inlength.  The average weight of fish captured was 1.1 pounds.  Bluegill should also provide qualityangling opportunities.  Trapnet catches averaged 20.8 fish/net which is within the normal range of meancatch rates for this type of lake.  The average weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.   Seventy-threepercent of the fish were 6 inches or greater, however few exceeded 8 inches in length.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa Lake is a relatively small, lightly developed basin about two miles north of Brandon in Douglas County.  A county park is located on the east shore.  It provides picnic shelters, swimming, camping, and fishing.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community, which provides quality habitat for northern pike, bass, and sunfish.  These plants are also important in preventing shoreline erosion and maintaining good water quality.The fish community in Little Chippewa Lake is typical of a small basin with extensive aquatic vegetation.  Bass, sunfish, and northern pike are all very abundant.  Northern pike average about 2.1 pounds in weight and 21 inches in length.  The size structure of the largemouth bass population is desirable.  Over 50% of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greater and 9% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill should also provide some good fishing.  Three-fourths of the fish sampled with trap nets in 2001 were 6 inches in length or greater.  However, no fish exceeded 8 inches in length.Walleye are managed as secondary species.  Fingerlings are stocked in alternate years to provide additional angling opportunities.  Gill net catches averaged 2.1 fish/net in 2001.  A similar catch rate of 2.8 fish/net was recorded in 1997.  The normal range of mean catch rates for this type of lake is 1.2 to 6.3 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.6 pounds in 2001.  Stocking rates were increased in 2000 to enhance walleye abundance under the DNR Accelerated Walleye Program.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Chippewa is a 269-acre basin located two miles north of Brandon.  Douglas County maintains Chippewa Park, which is located on the eastern shoreline of the lake.  The park offers recreational opportunities including shoreline fishing, swimming, and camping.  A DNR public access exists on the south shoreline off County Road 108.     <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a maximum depth of 24 feet.  Approximately 55% of the lake area is less than 15 feet in depth. Water clarity averages 9.5 feet during summer months.  Due to good water quality, that area less than 15 feet in depth supports a robust aquatic plant community, which provides important habitat for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike.    <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed on Little Chippewa Lake in 2019.  An electrofishing survey was completed on May 31 to assess abundance and size structure of Largemouth Bass.  The netting component of the survey was conducted June 17-20.  Six gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the remainder of the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant.  Length of bass captures during the electrofishing survey ranged from 4.3 to 17.9 inches and averaged 12.5 inches.  Seventeen bass captures were 15.0 inches or larger suggesting fishing quality is good. <br> \n <br> \nNetting results revealed that Bluegill were abundant.  Average size was 6.1 inches, but some individuals exceeded 9.0 inches.  Growth rates of Bluegill were below average due to elevated population density and moderate productivity of Little Chippewa Lake.  Catch rates of Black Crappie were comparatively low.  Length of crappie captures ranged from 4.3 to 12.2 inches.    Yellow Perch are found in Little Chippewa Lake, but they are not abundant and most are too small to stimulate angler interest and harvest. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches were lower than previous survey catch rates, but the survey catch rate of 6.2/gill net continued to exceed the average catch rate from similar lakes in Minnesota.  Pike caught in gill nets averaged 24.1 inches.  The population can offer quality fishing experiences.  Six percent of captures were 28.0 inches and larger.  One memorable-size pike measuring 35.1 inches was captured.   <br> \n <br> \nA modest density of Walleye exist in Little Chippewa Lake due to fish movements among connected basins and stocking.  Gill net catches averaged 5.0/net.  Walleye captures averaged 16.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Elevated numbers of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass likely limit early survival of stocked Walleye.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the liberalized daily bag limit of Northern Pike from lakes within the North-central pike harvest zone.  Anglers are able to keep up to ten pike with no more than two fish longer than 26 inches.  All pike 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels, an aquatic invasive species, have been documented in basins connected to Little Chippewa Lake.  Due to the connection, Little Chippewa Lake has been listed as infested with zebra mussels.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
