This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of August 12, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but four sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 8 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured two sensitive species; blacknose shiner and Iowa darter.  Other non-game fish species sampled include bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, golden shiner, Johnny darter, spottail shiner and tadpole madtom.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the population assessment, was 95. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is located about five miles south of Palisade in central Aitkin County. The lake has a variety of habitats that support a diverse fish community with angling opportunities for several popular game fish species. Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake mixed in with areas of gravel, rubble, muck and silt. Aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present. Curly-leaf pond weed is also present. At 717 acres, the lake is fairly large for Aitkin County. The water color is brown from tannin stain and normal clarity is about 5-7 feet. There is a public access located on the southwest portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGun Lake anglers primarily target Black Crappie and Bluegill. The abundance of Black Crappie has varied widely over time as is typical with Black Crappie populations, the population is currently abundant. While slower growing, fish over 10 inches are sampled regularly. Gill net catch rates for Black Crappie have ranged from 2 to 30 per gill net and the long-term average is 10.5 per gill net. The catch rate for Black Crappie in 2023 was 21.3 per gill net, which was an increase from the last survey in 2019 (13.4 per gill net).  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population is characterized as having low abundance and good growth compared to other area lakes. The sample of Bluegills from trap net catches averaged only 6 inches long, however, size structure is reasonable with 26% measuring greater than 7 inches and fish over 8 inches available for anglers to catch. Selective harvest of Bluegill is encouraged to protect the quality component of the fishery, as it is difficult to restore Bluegill size structure once it is lost. Currently, a special sunfish regulation of 10 fish per day exists to help maintain the quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1960's using a variety of sizes, frequencies, and densities of fish, with only limited success. The gill net catch rate in 2023 was 2 per gill net and is the highest that has been observed in 25 years; a doubling since the 2019 survey.  It appears that the change in management strategy from high density stocking in alternate years (2-3 pounds per littoral acre), to stocking a more modest number of fingerlings (0.5 pounds per littoral acre) annually, may be working as new year classes of Walleye are now evident in the population.  Yellow Perch numbers also appear to have rebounded and are a good source of food for both the Walleye and Northern Pike in Gun Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Largemouth Bass are additional predator species found in the lake. While not sampled effectively in standard survey gear, Largemouth Bass over 15 inches are captured routinely. Largemouth Bass have been consistently present in surveys at low numbers since 2003. Spring night time bass electrofishing was conducted in 2023 to try and gain a better understanding of the abundance and size structure of the population. A total of 14 Largemouth Bass were sampled, equating to a modest catch rate of 8.2 per hour. Sizes ranged from 8.7 to 18.6 inches, with an average size of 12.8 inches. Overall, this was a fairly low catch rate for this area, yet similar to past surveys on Gun Lake.  Additionally, one adult Smallmouth Bass was observed in Gun Lake, which is the first observed in all previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance decreased to 4.8 per gill net from a high of 6.4 per gill net in 2019. Their sizes ranged from 18.9 to 32.3 inches, averaged 25.1 inches long and 3.6 pounds, and had 60% greater than 24 inches.  Those metrics indicate a quality size structure. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers are encouraged to release larger Pike and harvest smaller ones to help protect the vital function larger Pike provide in the aquatic community, and to allow additional opportunities for others to share the experience of catching a quality gamefish. <br> \n</p>",

Panfish are often found in near shore areas during the spring and sampling at that time can sometimes give you a better understanding of the size structure of Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. Black Crappie comprised the majority of the catch and were caught at a rate of 31.8/trap net, which was higher than what was caught during the Standard Survey in mid-August (3.9/trap net).  Black Crappie were also slightly larger during the spring survey with an average length of 8.4 inches compared with 7.2 inches in the summer trap nets.  Spring sampling yielded RSD-P=6 compared with RSD-P=1 in the summer (combined gears). The second most abundant species was Bluegill at 16.3/net which was also higher than the Standard Survey (1.1/net).  Bluegill were larger in the spring averaging 7.3 inches compared with 5.5 inches in the summer. Spring sampling yielded an RSD-P of 35 while summer RSD-P was 2.5. Water temperature was mid 50 degrees Fahrenheit range during the survey.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Gun Lake was conducted on 8/14/2019 by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Mottled Sculpin and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from August 2019 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment of the walleye population was conducted in 2011 to assist in evaluation of the high density fingerling stocking program begun in 2004, and included gill netting (8/22/2011) and fall night electrofishing (10/5/2011).  Walleye abundance, 2.0/gill net, was similar to the most recent survey (2008) and remained below the inter-quartile range for lake class 27.  Catch rates have been below the first quartile value (3.25/gill net) in seven of the nine surveys to date.  Fish ranged from 6.8 to 25.5 inches with averages of 15.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age assessment (22 of 24 fish) revealed fish 1-7 years old from four year classes, each corresponding to the most recent fingerling-stocked years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010).  Growth appeared slower, but was within normal county and statewide ranges.  Although year class strengths of fish stocked at the higher rates (2.5 lbs/littoral acre) were slightly higher than fingerling stocking at standard rate, they were still not sufficient to bring walleye catch rates up to the goal of 4/net.  Only in the 1990 and 1998 surveys did gill net catches exceed this goal, which was due primarily to strong natural reproduction.   As such, annual fry stocking was resumed in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing to monitor the success of walleye fry stocking was conducted on October 5, 2011.  Walleye fry stocking resumed on Gun Lake in 2011 for the first time since 1985.  This was the first survey to look for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye.  The total sample time was 1 hour with two walleyes sampled, but neither fish were YOY.  Although no YOY walleye were sampled, fall electrofishing should continue in the immediate future as staff time permits to develop an index of YOY abundance and determine the effectiveness of the restarted fry stocking strategy. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch (7.5/gill net) remained high for this lake class, having been well above the third quartile value (2.7/gill net) in all eight assessments since 1977.  Size ranged from 4.1 to 10.9 inches and averaged 7.9\".  The management goal (25% of catch > 9\") was met, with 32% measuring at least 9\".  Fish (54 of 90 aged) ranged from 1-11 years old, with strong year class represented from 2005 (19%), 2007 (34%), and 2010 (22%).  As has been observed in other area lakes, the number of larger crappie appear to be correlated with walleye abundance.  If fry stocking results in higher walleye densities, we may see a subsequent increase in larger crappies. Growth was slow compared to statewide averages and historical Gun Lake data, but similar to the most recent assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 2.8/gill net.  Pike catches have been fairly consistent since 1977 ranging from 0.8 to 3.9/gill net with a mean of 2.6 and median of 2.4.  Size ranged from 14.5 to 33.8\" with an average of 22.3\" and 2.7 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is located about five miles south of Palisade in central Aitkin County.  The lake has a variety of habitats that support a diverse fish community with angling opportunities for several popular game fish species. Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake mixed in with areas of gravel, rubble, muck and silt. Aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present.  Curly-leaf pond weed is also present.  At 717 acres the lake is fairly large for Aitkin County. The water color is brown and normal clarity is about 5 feet. There is a public access located in the southwest portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGun Lake anglers primarily target black crappie and bluegill.  The abundance of black crappie has varied widely over time as is typical with black crappie populations, but in general the population is abundant and slower-growing, although fish over 10 inches are sampled regularly.  Gill net catch rates for black crappie have ranged from 2-30/net and the long term average is 9.2/net. The catch rate for black crappie in 2016 was (15.5/gill net), marking an increase from the last survey in 2013. Several year classes of young fish through age 5 were represented in the survey, suggesting adequate recruitment in recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population is characterized as having low abundance and good growth compared to other area lakes.  Size distribution is favorable with the trap net catch averaging 6.5 inches long and with 53% measuring greater than 7 inches.  Selective harvest of bluegill is encouraged to protect the quality component of the fishery, as there are no proven techniques to restore bluegill size structure once it is lost.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1960's using a variety of sizes, frequencies, and densities of fish, with only limited success. Historic walleye catches have been below the expected range for similar lakes in nine of the eleven assessments conducted to date. The current walleye stocking strategy calls for stocking walleye fingerlings annually beginning in 2017.  This change was implemented after stocking fingerlings and fry at high rates had failed to achieve the management goals.  Historically fry and natural reproduction had produced up to 4 fish/gill net.  However, in recent years fry appear to no longer to survive in Gun Lake.  Also, since both standard and high density alternate year fingerling stocking had produced only mediocre results, annual fingerling stocking is now being implemented to increase walleye abundance. The walleye catch rate was low again at 0.6/gill net and below the historic average (2.1/gill net) and the normal range for this lake type. Yellow perch, which is the preferred food source for walleye, have recently become more abundant and may contribute to improved walleye survival in the near future. Gun Lake will continue to be monitored on a regular basis to assess the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and largemouth bass are additional predator species found in the lake.  While not sampled effectively in standard survey gear, largemouth bass over 15 inches are captured routinely.  Northern pike abundance continues to be relatively low compared with similar lakes, but remained within the historic range for Gun Lake. Size from gill nets ranged from 18.5 to 28.5 inches. They averaged 22.9 inches long, and 2.6 pounds, with 45% greater than 24 inches, indicating a quality size structure.  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" and harvesting smaller fish to help protect the vital function larger pike provide in the aquatic community, and to allow additional opportunities for others to share the experience of catching a quality gamefish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on July 11 and 12, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 11 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 sites due to abundant vegetation and soft sediments.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including several species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass were sampled in low numbers).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Gun Lake is near an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Gun Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is a popular destination for many anglers in central Aitkin County.  The lake has diverse structure giving anglers a variety of angling opportunities for such species as northern pike, walleye, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.  The northern pike length frequency distribution indicates that Gun Lake has a healthy population.  Northern pike sampled during the survey ranged in length from 9 to 29 inches with an average length of 23 inches or about 2.7 pounds.  While no northern pike over 30 inches have been sampled during the last two surveys there is potential to grow very large fish.  Black crappie have decreased in abundance since the high catch rate observed in 1998, but the presence of a strong 2001 year class would indicate that anglers should look forward to some good crappie fishing in the next few years. The bluegill abundance in this survey is the highest that we have observed in the six surveys conducted since 1957.  Almost one-half of the fish bluegill sampled came from the strong 2001-year class.  While the presence of this strong year class of young fish has resulted in a decrease in the average length of bluegills the length frequency distribution indicates that there are quality size individuals in this lake in reasonable abundance. The walleye gillnet index has continued fluctuating as evidenced in past surveys.  The age class distribution indicates that the decrease in abundance since 1998 is the result of low recruitment from natural reproduction over the last four years.  The Stocked 1999 year class dominated the sample in 2003 lake survey.</p>",

The lake has a variety of habitats that support a diverse fish community with angling opportunities for several popular game fish species. Sand is the primary substrate around much of the lake mixed in with areas of gravel, rubble, muck and silt. Aquatic vegetation is also diverse with a variety of emergent, floating-leaf, and submerged species present. Curly-leaf pond weed is also present. At 717 acres, the lake is fairly large for Aitkin County. The water color is brown and normal clarity is about 5 feet. There is a public access located on the southwest portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGun Lake anglers primarily target Black Crappie and Bluegill. The abundance of Black Crappie has varied widely over time as is typical with Black Crappie populations, but in general the population is abundant and slower-growing, although fish over 10 inches are sampled regularly. Gill net catch rates for Black Crappie have ranged from 2-30/net and the long term average is 9.6/net. The catch rate for Black Crappie in 2019 was (13.4/gill net), a slight decrease from the last survey in 2016 (15.5/gill net).  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population is characterized as having low abundance and good growth compared to other area lakes. Trap net catches of Bluegill averaged only 5.5 inches, however, size structure is reasonable with 20% measuring greater than 7 inches. Selective harvest of Bluegill is encouraged to protect the quality component of the fishery, as there are no proven techniques to restore Bluegill size structure once it is lost.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1960's using a variety of sizes, frequencies, and densities of fish, with only limited success. Historic Walleye catches have been below the expected range for similar lakes in ten of the twelve surveys conducted to date. The current Walleye stocking strategy calls for stocking Walleye fingerlings annually beginning in 2017. This change was implemented after stocking fingerlings and fry at high rates had failed to achieve the management goals. Historically, fry and natural reproduction had produced up to 4 fish/gill net. However, in recent years fry stocking has been unsuccessful in Gun Lake. Also, both standard and high density alternate year fingerling stocking produced mediocre returns, resulting in implementing annual fingerling stocking in an attempt to increase Walleye abundance. The Walleye catch rate was low again at 1.1/gill net in 2019 and below both the historic average (2.1/gill net) and the normal range for this lake type. Yellow Perch, which is the preferred food source for Walleye, have become more abundant in recent years and may contribute to improved Walleye survival in the near future. Gun Lake will continue to be monitored on a regular basis to assess the Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Largemouth Bass are additional predator species found in the lake. While not sampled effectively in standard survey gear, Largemouth Bass over 15 inches are captured routinely. Largemouth Bass have been consistently present in surveys at low numbers since 2003. Spring night time bass electrofishing was done in 2019 to try and gain a better understanding of the abundance and size structure of the population. A total of 12 Largemouth Bass were caught equating to a catch rate of 7.1/hr. Sizes ranged from 6.8 to 19.9\" with an average size of 13.7\". Overall this was a fairly low catch rate for this area.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased to 6.4/gill net, which marks the highest catch to date, and their size ranged from 19.9 to 33.2 inches. Pike averaged 25.6 inches long, and 3.6 pounds, with 71% greater than 24 inches, indicating a quality size structure. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 26\" and harvesting smaller fish to help protect the vital function larger pike provide in the aquatic community, and to allow additional opportunities for others to share the experience of catching a quality gamefish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is a popular angling location among local anglers. The lake's structure is diverse and so is the fishery, which includes northern pike, black crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass and walleyes. No one species is dominant, with the exception of a larger black crappie population in this assessment. The black crappies were either of sub-catchable size or in the 8.0 to 9.0 inch range. These two strong year classes should provide good crappie fishing for several years, with possibly a short-term downturn in two years.   Sunfish abundance is currently relatively low and, although larger fish may provide sporadic quality fishing, the catch rates for sunfish will probably be low. In the trap nets in this survey the bluegills averaged 6.3 inches in length and ranged up to only 8.7 inches.   Walleye abundance was on the low end of average for this type of lake, indicating that walleye angling may also be relatively slow. The average length of a walleye in the survey gill nets was 15.9 inches and the fish ranged up to 23.2 inches.    Northern pike are as abundant as any previous survey on Gun Lake has indicated and yet compared to other lakes of this type the pike abundance is low. The mean length is a respectable 22 inches and the fish ranged up to 29.6 inches.  Angling for moderate sized northerns should be acceptable, but slower growth may limit the numbers of larger northern pike in the lake.   Largemouth bass are not adequately assessed with standard survey nets. There is plenty of habitat and a moderate prey base for largemouth bass to thrive in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is located about five miles south of Palisade in central Aitkin County.  The lake has a variety of habitats that support a diverse fish community with angling opportunities for several popular game fish species.  There is a public access located in the southwest portion of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGun Lake anglers primarily target black crappie and bluegill.  The black crappie population is abundant and slow-growing, but fish over 10 inches are sampled regularly.  Several year classes were identified from the 2013 survey suggesting adequate recruitment in recent years, including a strong 2011 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population is characterized as having low abundance and good growth compared to other area lakes.  Size distribution is favorable with the trap net catch averaging 5.8 inches and 39% measuring greater than 7 inches.  Selective harvest of bluegill is encouraged to protect the quality component of the fishery, as there are no proven techniques to restore bluegill size structure once it is lost.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1960's using a variety of sizes, frequencies, and densities of fish, with only limited success.  The current strategy of annual fry stocking began in 2011, and will be evaluated with surveys scheduled for 2016 and 2018.  Historic walleye catches have been below the expected range for similar lakes in eight of the ten assessments conducted to date. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and largemouth bass are additional predator species found in the lake.  While not sampled effectively in standard survey gear, largemouth bass over 15 inches are captured routinely.  Northern pike abundance continues to be relatively low compared with similar lakes, but within the historic range for Gun Lake.  Size was fair as fish from gill nets ranged from 16.6 to 32.5 inches, averaged 21.8\" and 2.3 pounds, with 15% greater than 24\".  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" and harvesting smaller fish to help protect the vital function larger pike provide, and allow additional opportunities for others.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gun Lake is a popular destination (summer and winter) for many anglers in Aitkin County.  The lake's diverse structure gives anglers a variety of angling opportunities for northern pike, walleye, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.  There is a public access located on the SW corner of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population has a wide length frequency distribution, which indicates a healthy population.  Sizes ranges from 13 to 37 inches in length, with an average size of 23.5 inches.  Growth rates are good, and the limiting factor appears to be angling mortality. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population has remained stable since the 2003 survey, and is above average for this lake type.  The average size was about 8 inches, and growth rates are good.  The presence of a strong (half of the fish sampled were 3 years old) 2005 year class indicates that anglers should have good fishing in the next few years. Increased restraint of anglers harvesting smaller crappie should result in good recruitment of crappies into preferred sizes. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill abundance in this survey is the highest that we have observed in the seven surveys conducted since 1957.  The presence of 4 strong year-classes from the last 6 years, and good growth rates for Aitkin County, indicate anglers will have plenty of keeper size bluegill for the years to come.  Thirty percent of the fish sampled were over 7 inches in length, but there were only 11 fish over 8 inches.  This suggests that fishing pressure is high and is limiting bluegills from growing to the sizes we have previously seen in Gun Lake.  Gun Lake is one of few lakes in the area that has the potential to produce memorable bluegill, but they need to survive long enough to do so. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net index has continued to fluctuate, and the catch rates were still below the average for this lake type.  The age class distribution indicates that the decrease in abundance since 1998 is the result of low recruitment from natural reproduction in recent years, for reasons unknown.  The stocked 2004 year class was the strongest in the 2008 survey. It is unclear yet whether the increase in stocking rate to 2 lbs/ littoral acre, begun in 2004, will result in higher densities of walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nKey forage species such as yellow perch and white sucker are low relative to previous surveys and for this lake type.  Maintaining a healthy perch population is important for the future of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

The trap net indices for bowfin and black crappie were above the lake class 31 third quartiles. The trap net indices for burbot and bluegill are below the lake class 31 first quartiles. Northern pike sampled ranged from one to seven years of age with stronger year classes indicated for 1985 and 1988. Growth rates were normal. Bluegill sampled ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988. Growth rates were normal. Black crappie sampled ranged from one to six years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1989. The growth rates for the third and fourth increments were faster than normal. Length at formation of the sixth annulus was normal. Yellow perch sampled ranged from two to six years of age with strong year classes in 1987 and 1988. The growth rate for the first increment was slower than normal. Other growth increments were normal walleye sampled ranged from one to eight plus years of age with stronger year classes indicated for 1986, 1987 and 1988. Growth rates were normal. From these data an increase in walleye abundance from stocking could not be determined. Northern pike showed a significant decrease in abundance since the 1985 survey based on eight gill net sets. Walleye showed a significant increase in abundance since the 1985 survey based on eight gill net sets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Gun Lake was conducted on July 6, 2023 by Aitkin Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample ten stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including 4 species that were intolerant of disturbance (ie., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass) and none that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Bigmouth Buffalo).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Gun Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life used determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
