                "narrative": "<p>Little Cavanaugh Lake is a 19 acre lake located near Cohasset, MN.  The lake was created when a mining road split a larger basin into two separate basins; Big Cavanaugh and Little Cavanaugh Lakes.  Little Cavanaugh Lake has a maximum depth of 22 ft and has had a history of winter kills.  A developer has asked the DNR to look into removing a plugged culvert and reopening a channel in the mining road which splits the two basins.  The purpose of this survey was to determine the present status of the fish community and what impacts any culvert modification may have on the fishery.Black bullhead numbers were very abundant with a gill net catch of 70/gill net.  Largemouth bass gill-net catch was 10.5/gill net which is much higher than the lake class third quartile of 1.5/gill net.  The largemouth bass population was comprised of one year class with an average length of 9.5 inches.  Largemouth bass growth was faster than statewide averages.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 6.0/set with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Two bluegill were sampled in the trap nets.The fish community is characteristic of a lake which experiences winter kills.  Species such as bullheads are tolerant of low oxygen and are often the most abundant species.  Game fish which survive winter kills are often comprised of one or two year classes and experience good growth after a winter kill.  Water level data taken at the time of the survey indicates that Big Cavanaugh Lake is 1 foot higher than Little Cavanaugh.  Opening the culvert would lower Big Cavanaugh Lake by 1 foot affecting lakeshore owners and possibly increasing the potential for winter kill in Big Cavanaugh.  For these reasons, culvert modification is not recommended.</p>",
