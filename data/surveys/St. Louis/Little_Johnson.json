The lake is connected to Johnson and Spring lakes by the Johnson River.  Northern pike were very abundant for this lake type.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-8 years.  The 2000 year-class represented 46% of the sample.  Average length was 19.2 inches with a range from 13.2 to 36.6.  Growth was less than the statewide and area averages.  The average weight of northern pike captured in gill nets was lower than what is found in similar lakes.  Smallmouth bass abundance was the highest level ever recorded in gill nets for Little Johnson Lake and well above what is found in similar lakes throughout Minnesota.  Nine year-classes were present and the age ranged from 2-10 years.  Length ranged from 6.5-19.2 inches and the average was 13.7.  Growth was greater than the area average.  The average weight was greater than what is found in similar lakes.   Walleye gill-net abundance was 6.00 fish/set, which was below what is found in the majority of similar lakes and the second lowest level ever recorded in Little Johnson.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  The 2001 year-class represented 33% of the sample.  Length ranged from 7.3-24.4 inches and the average was 15.6.  Eighty-eight percent of the walleyes captured in all gear types were greater than 13 inches.  Mean weight of walleyes captured in gill nets was 1.40 pounds, which exceeded the average found in similar lakes.  Growth was greater than the area and statewide averages.Yellow perch abundance and average weight were low, but growth was well above average.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-9 years.  Length of yellow perch captured in gill nets ranged from 5.5-12.3 inches and the average was 6.7.   </p>",

This remote lake is accessed by boat from Johnson Lake, which is connected to Little Johnson by a 2.5-mile boat ride on the Johnson River. The total surface area is 566 acres and maximum depth is 28 feet. Little Johnson Lake is relatively shallow; 83 percent of the surface area (471 acres) is less than 15 feet deep. A water chemistry analysis done in 2003 suggests a lake with low fertility and low productivity.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Little Johnson Lake for Walleye follow the statewide regulation, which is a 6-combination total possession limit with not more than one Walleye over 20\". Northern Pike follows the Northeast Zone regulation, which is a possession limit of 2 with not more than 1 over 40\" in possession and all Northern Pike from 30-40\" must be immediately released. Bass fishing regulations follow the Northeast Zone regulation, which is six combined Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rate was 11.1 fish per net which is well above average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 8.0 fish per net for Little Johnson Lake. Total length ranged from 4.7 to 25.0 inches and mean length was 16.0 inches. Average weight was 1.6 pounds which is above average for similar class lakes. A total of 16 year classes were present, and ages ranged from 1-19 years. Little Johnson Lake offers a good Walleye fishing opportunity, there are good numbers of Walleyes in Little Johnson Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rate was 15.4 fish per net, which is well above the average for similar class lakes. Catch rate was higher than the management goal of an abundance less than 6.0 fish per gill net for Little Johnson Lake. Total length ranged from 13.4 to 31.6 inches and the mean length was 19.9 inches. Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 1.6 pounds which is below average for similar lakes. A total of seven year classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 - 7 years. Little Johnson Lake offers a decent fishing opportunity for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gill net catch rate was 3.6 fish per net, which is above average for similar class lakes. Total Length ranged from 9.2 to 20.1 inches and the mean was 14.7 inches. Average weight was 1.9 pounds, which is above average for similar class lakes. Ten year classes were present, and ages ranged from 3-20 years. Little Johnson Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Smallmouth Bass in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 5.2 fish per net, which is below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 5.8 to 11.3 inches and the mean length was 7.3 inches. Mean weight was 0.2 pounds, which is below average for similar lakes. Five year classes were present, and ages ranged from 3-7 years. Yellow Perch can offer an additional fishing opportunity but also offers great forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Johnson is located approximately 37 miles east-southeast of International Falls, Minnesota, or approximately 10 miles northwest of the community of Crane Lake, Minnesota. This remote lake is accessed by boat from Johnson Lake, which is connected to Little Johnson by a 2.5 mile boat ride on the Johnson River. Little Johnson and the nearby connected lakes (Johnson and Spring) provide an extremely diverse community of fish populations ranging from coldwater Lake Trout to a thriving warmwater bass fishery. Little Johnson is the warmest and shallowest of these lakes, with over 80% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep. Little Johnson was surveyed in 2017 as part of a regular rotation of investigational surveys in the International Falls management area.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were at a record high in 2017. The average size was 20 inches, but fish up to 30 inches were caught. The majority of the Northern Pike sampled in 2017 were young, with 78% of the fish being 2 to 3 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth were also at record high numbers in 2017. Not only are Smallmouth Bass caught at rates greatly exceeding what would be expected for Little Johnson, growth rates are still similar to other International Falls area lakes and the average size is over 14 inches. Smallmouth up to an estimated age of 14 years old were caught in this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in 2017 were within the expected range for lakes similar to Little Johnson. The average size is bigger than what would be expected, with an average length of about 17 inches. Little Johnson produces very consistent year classes of Walleye through natural reproduction. Of the Walleye that were aged, there were representatives of nearly every year class since 2003 in the sample. Little Johnson Walleyes also grow faster than average when compared to other International Falls area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught during the 2017 survey included Lake Whitefish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

The two most recent investigations (1989 and 1993) have seen abundance indices for these two species decline to lower levels, although they are still within the range considered normal for similar lakes.  Walleye abundance as measured by DNR test nets in 1993 is significantly less than that observed in past assessments, however, natural reproduction is still producing year classes almost every year.  The size structure of the walleye population has shifted downward since the initial survey in 1971, with fewer numbers of walleye over 15\" present in DNR test nets.  The majority of walleye sampled were 2 years old.  The average size of northern pike in DNR test nets is 1.6 pounds, and the number of northern pike over 21\" has steadily increased since 1971.  The number of smallmouth bass, and yellow perch sampled in test nets were within the range considered normal for lakes similar to Little Johnson.  White suckers have historically been sampled in low numbers, and the 1993 assessment netting was no exception. Although lake whitefish are present in neighboring Johnson Lake, this is the first time they have been sampled in test nets in Little Johnson Lake.</p>",

The lake is connected to Johnson Lake by the Johnson River.  The fish community is fairly diverse and is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance and average weight were within the typical ranges for this lake type.  The average weight was 1.31 pounds and the average length was 18.8 inches; fish up to 23.0 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are abundant and sizes should provide great fishing.  Fish up to 18.0 inches were captured in the 2010 investigation and the average was 13.9 inches.  The average weight was 1.56 pounds.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the typical range for this lake type, but lower than levels historically seen in Little Johnson Lake.  Size was above average and should satisfy anglers that are seeking walleye.  Average weight was 1.76 pounds, which is heavier than the typical range for this lake type.  Fish up 25.6 inches were sampled and the average was 16.5.  Growth rate was much greater than the area and statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled but sizes were small and are likely more important as forage for predators than as a recreational fish for anglers.  Very few fish above 9 inches were sampled.  </p>",

Walleye numbers increased from the 1993 sampling and was near levels normally seen in lakes like Little Johnson.  Sampled walleye ranged in ages from 1 through 8 with an average length of 15.6 inches and several fish over 20 inches present.  Northern pike abundance increased and was higher than what was typically found in this type of lake.  Most of the northerns were 2 to 4 years old so the average length was only 18.5 inches.  Smallmouth bass numbers also increased with the average bass measuring 12.4 inches.  White sucker and lake whitefish were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",
