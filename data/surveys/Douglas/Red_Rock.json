                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is located in the southwest corner of Douglas County, just northwest of Kensington.  This 708-acre lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse throughout the main basin, but it can be dense in the southern bays.  The seechi disk transparency of 13.0 feet recorded in June of 2002 is somewhat misleading.  Water clarity is usually quite good in May and June, however algae blooms are common throughout July and August.  Lake residents feel that recreational uses, especially swimming, are impaired during summer months.  A Lake Assessment Program completed in 1990 found that excessive nutrients from internal and external sources greatly influenced water quality.Anglers have been targeting yellow perch and walleye in recent years.  Yellow perch are abundant and the size structure of the population is desirable.  Most of the fish captured with survey gear during 2002 were between 8 and 12 inches in length.  Walleye numbers have increased since the last survey in 1998.  Gill net catches averaged 5.8 fish/net, which is above the normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Walleye averaged about 18.5 inches in length and 2.5 pounds in 2002.  Walleye fry stockings in 1997 and 1999 appear to have been successful in increasing walleye abundance.Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie populations are characterized by highly variable year class strength and rapid growth rates.  In general, these species are present in low to moderate numbers, however the average size tends to be large because of the fast growth.             </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is a shallow, fertile basin located in southwest Douglas County, near Kensington.  Maximum depth is 22.0 ft.  Mean depth is only 9.0 ft.  Water quality and clarity are seasonally impaired due to excessive total phosphorus concentrations.  Strong wind and waves can re-suspend nutrients tied up in bottom sediments and trigger frequent and severe algal blooms.  Average water transparency during open water is 5.9 ft.  Red Rock\u0019s fish community has have been greatly impacted by habitat change.  Lake level increased approximately 7.0 ft. in the mid-80s, flooding homes and drowning extensive stands of hardstem bulrush surrounding the shoreline.  High water also connected Red Rock Lake to wetland basins in the southern watershed area.  Aquatic vegetation became sparse throughout the main basin, yet dense in the inundated southern basins. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to habitat degradation, Red Rock was recognized as a \"destination\" lake for high quality largemouth bass fishing.  This high quality fishery and that of bluegill were lost with habitat changes and partial winterkill in southern basins.  Habitat conditions changed to favor gamefishes less reliant upon aquatic vegetation and more tolerant of seasonal water clarity impairment, specifically walleye and black crappie.  Construction of an outlet and lower, stable water levels in the last 10 years have been conductive to re-growth of rooted aquatic vegetation and modest improvement in water clarity.  Recent lake survey information describes a gradual restructuring of the fish community to reflect pre-flood conditions. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance has increased dramatically with habitat restoration.  Electrofishing catch rates increased from 3.6 bass/hr in1989 to 56.0 in 2006.  Bluegill were slower to recover, but abundance has increased greatly.  Trapnet catches averaged only 0.2 bluegill/net in 1998, but increased to 25.7 fish/net during the 2006 survey.  Growth rates remain well above average in this productive basin even though densities have increased.   Due to fast growth, size distributions of largemouth bass and bluegill populations are skewed towards a higher relative percentage of large individuals.  Ninety-five percent of largemouth bass captured in 2006 exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  Thirteen percent of bluegill measured in 2006 exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  Some exceeded 10.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nA modest increase in black crappie numbers is also evident.   Despite greater numbers, growth remains excellent.  Older crappie in the 2006 capture sample had grown to exceed 10.0 inches in total length by age-4.   The population supports an exceptional fishery.  The largest crappie captured measured 14.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nContrary to expectations, northern pike abundance has yet to increase in response to more suitable habitat conditions.  Gillnet catch rate in 2006 was at the lower rate of expected catches for similar lake types.  Reproductive success or survival of young fish appears limited.  Few young and large pike were observed.  Eighty percent of those pike measured exceeded 21.0 inches in length, but few exceeded 28.0 inches.  Growth rate was very good through age-4, but slowed significantly with increasing age.  Limiting factors could include prey limitations or high water temperatures during summer months.  Red Rock Lake is too shallow and exposed to stratify for long.   There is no thermal refuge for this coolwater fish species. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population can best be described as a low-density population comprised of larger than average fish.  Average gillnet catch rate in 2006 was relatively low, but well within the range of normal for the lake.   Size distribution of the 2006 catch describes a very high quality fishery in terms of average size.  Thirty-seven percent of walleye caught exceeded 20.0 inches.  Seven percent of captures exceeded 25.0 inches in length.  Average length of walleye measured during the 2006 survey was 17.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake is one of few basins within the Glenwood Management Area supporting a yellow perch fishery.  In absence of heavy predatory pressure, perch channel more energy into growth rather than early reproduction.  Perch are currently abundant and grow fast.  The popularity of the fishery is beginning to show.  Ten-inch perch were fairly common in the 2006 survey.  Twelve-inch perch were common in 2002 catch. <br> \n <br> \nFish community structure and fishing experiences have been very dynamic over the past 20 years.  Habitat improvements and associated fish community shifts are likely to continue for some time.  Fishing pressure is heavy and certain to increase.  Anglers are encouraged to practice catch and release or exercise constraint in size and number harvested to sustain good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of the population assessment indicate the fish community in Red Rock Lake has not improvedsince 1990.  Catch rates for most gamefish species are well below the normal ranges of mean catch ratesfor lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics.  Fluctuating water levels, loss ofemergent vegetation, and poor water quality are some of the factors that may be limiting gamefishpopulations.Walleye are the predominate gamefish in Red Rock Lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 5.2 fish/net in 1993. The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 1.1 - 5.0 fish/gillnet.  Age 1 fish comprised40% of fish captured in 1993.  The relatively strong 1992 year class (age 1 fish) is likely the resultof a fry stocking.  The largemouth bass population is characterized by a limited number of large fish. Electrofishing yielded 7.1 fish per hour.  Twelve of the thirteen fish captured were 15 inches inlength or greater.  Northern pike catches averaged 0.6 fish/gillnet.  The normal range of mean catchrates for similar lakes is 2.8 - 12.9 fish/gillnet.  Catch rates have gradually declined from 12.8fish/gillnet in 1977 to the present catch of 0.6 fish/net.  Bluegill catch rate remained less than 1.0fish/trapnet despite the stocking of adult bluegill in 1991.  Apparently the stocking of adultbroodfish resulted in enhanced reproduction, but because of poor habitat suitability, few recruited toage-1.   Yellow perch catch averaged 1.9 fish/gillnet.  Catches averaged 2.5 fish/net in 1990 and 3.0fish/net in 1989.  Previous catches averaged 46.7, 72.6, and 105.3 fish/net in 1985, 1982, 1977,respectively.  Black bullhead abundance has decreased significantly since 1990.  Gillnet catch ratefell from 18.4 fish/net in 1990 to 0.2 fish/net in 1993.  Trapnet catches averaged 40.4 fish/net in1990 and 0.3 fish/net in 1993.  </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Red Rock Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nEleven species were collected during this survey.  One species (Banded Killifish) was considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Red Rock Lake.</p>",

Only 3 Black Crappie and one Pumpkinseed were captured in 1990.  Length frequencies would suggest these fish were age 1+ fish.  Electrofishing efforts yielded only 14.9 Largemouth Bass per hours. Largemouth Bass captured during electrofishing ran from 14.0 to 20.0 inches in total length.  PSD was calculated at 100.0% and RSD P-M was 92.0%. Three age 1+ bass were captured in trap nets.  No age 2, 3, or 5 year old Largemouth Bass were captured during the assessment.  This corresponds to the 1989 during which no age 1, 2, or 4 year old fish were netted.  Natural reproduction of Largemouth Bass appears to be very inconsistent or limited.  Growth rates of bass are excellent with Largemouth Bass averaging 15.3 inches at age 4.  Loss of critical habitat in response to a very significant increase in water levels followed by steadily declines in water level have negatively impacted recruitment and abundance of Centrarchid species and likely Yellow Perch.  Hardstem Bulrush growth was previously very extensive around most of the shoreline.  Northern Pike gill net catches have shown a steady decline since 1977. Catch rates have decreased from 12.75 Northern Pike/gill net in 1977 to 1.88 Northern Pike/gill net in 1990. No age 1 and only one age 2 fish was captured. Age 3 Northern Pike averaged 21.5 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance has also declined since the 1977 survey.  A gill net catch rate of 105.0 fish/net was recorded in the 1977 survey.  Only 2.5 Yellow Perch captured in each gill net set in 1990.  Walleye abundance remained quite low as demonstrated by a catch rate of 3.25 Walleye/gill net.  Mean weight of the Walleye increased to 5.3 lbs.  No age 1 or 2 Walleye were captured in gill nets; however, four age 1 and one age 2 Walleye were represented in trap net catches.  Age class distribution indicates cohorts of the 1989, 1984, 1983, 1980 year classes comprised most of the population.  The 1989, 1983, 1980 year classes appear to have been established by fry stockings or natural reproduction.  Growth of Walleye is outstanding with age 4 Walleyes averaging 19.1 inches.  Size structure reflects exceptional growth.  RSD-P was calculated at 89.0%.  Black Bullhead catch rates declined from 107.5 fish/gill net and 100.8 fish/trap net in the 1989 survey to 18.4 fish/gill net and 40.4 fish/trap net.  Bullhead populations have been subject to intense commercial exploitation.  Approximately 26,700 pounds of bullhead were commercially harvested from Red Rock Lake between the time of the 1989 and June 1990 surveys.  This removal likely explains the significant decrease in relative abundance and size structure.  In response to size-selective harvest, size structure has shifted to a greater proportion of small individuals.  PSD declined form 45.0% to 14.0% .</p>",

All Northern Pike and Walleye showed good growth when compared with the state averages. Walleye had good natural spawing success in 1971.  There appears to be a poor bass population though spawing areas are present.  Good population of crappies in terms of number and size and a fair population of Blugeill and bullheads.

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is a shallow, fertile basin located in southwest Douglas County, near Kensington.  Maximum depth is 22.0 feet.  Mean depth is only 9.0 feet.  Water quality and clarity are seasonally impaired due to excessive total phosphorus concentrations.  Strong wind and wave action can re-suspend nutrients tied up in bottom sediments and trigger frequent and severe algal blooms.  Red Rock's fish community is beginning to stabilize following extensive habitat changes from higher lake levels beginning in the mid-80's.  Stable water levels have been conducive to growth of submergent vegetation in the main basin and connected wetland basins in the southern watershed area.  Launching a boat during late summer can be challenging due to the shallow access. <br> \n <br> \nA quality largemouth bass fishery currently exists.  Largemouth bass remain abundant and over two-thirds of sampled fish exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance has declined since the previous survey.  Average size is good at 7.1 inches in length.  Walleye and northern pike populations were not very abundant at time of the 2010 survey.   The walleye population was comprised mostly of two-year-old fish thus, average size was small.  Mean length of walleye captures was 12.8 inches.  Northern pike abundance has yet to increase in response to more suitable habitat conditions.  Gillnet catches in 2010 were lower than expected catches for similar lakes.  Three-fourths of captured pike exceeded 21.0 inches.  Only six percent exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  Red Rock Lake is one of few basins within the Glenwood Management Area supporting a yellow perch fishery.  Perch are currently abundant and grow fast.  Popularity of the fishery may be showing.  Four percent of 2010 gillnet catches were 10.0 inches and larger.  Forty percent of the 2002 population sample was greater than 10.0 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is located in the southwest portion of Douglas County, just northwest of Kensington.  This 708-acre lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Vegetation is sparse throughout the main basin, but can get dense in the southern bays.  Water quality on Red Rock Lake is impaired.  A Lake Assessment Program was completed in 1990 by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.  The findings indicated that excessive nutrients from internal and external sources greatly influenced water quality.  Agricultural  runoff, especially from feedlots on the west shore,  are likely significant contributors of sediment and nutrients.  Douglas County and the Soil and Water Conservation District are working with farmers to minimize pollutants entering the lake and restricting cattle access to the lake.  High water conditions resulted from above average precipitation in the mid-80's.  The majority of the bulrushes that encircled the lake were lost.  The Red Rock Lake Association opened an outlet in 1994 to lower the lake by two feet.Anglers target walleye, northern pike and yellow perch.  Walleye catch of 1.7 fish per net is within the normal range for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Catch rates from previous surveys have been higher, averaging 5.2 and 3.3 fish per net in the 1993 and 1990 surveys, respectively.  The size of fish sampled with gill nets may not accurately reflect the size structure of the existing walleye population.  The largest fish sampled was 20.5 inches and mean length was 12.5 inches.  Trap nets set near shore caught larger fish, mostly between 17 and 24 inches.  Experienced Red Rock walleye anglers related that the larger walleye were caught in very shallow water during the survey time frame.Northern pike catches reflect a quality fishery.  Catch of 3.2 fish per net is within the expected normal range, however it is the highest survey catch during the past 10 years.  The size distribution is good with a mean length of 24.5 inches and the largest fish sampled was 34.3 inches.  Northern pike have access to additional spawning habitat during high water.Yellow perch offer excellent fishing opportunities.  Catch of 58.4 fish per net is well above the expected normal range.  The size distribution is desirable.   Fish up to 13.6 inches were captured and one-half of the fish were 8 inches or greater.  Both open water and ice anglers target the perch.  Ice anglers do especially well.Largemouth bass have never been abundant on Red Rock Lake, however, it has supported a trophy fishery in the past.  Spring electrofishing resulted in the capture of 34 fish per hour.  All the fish were less than 10.5 inches.  A strong 1997 year class is present and may improve fishing in the near future.  The Viking Sportsmen stocked a total of 4,416 bass fingerlings during the falls of 1996 and 1997.  Natural reproduction is also known to occur.  However, survival to catchable sizes has been poor since the early 1990's.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is a 902-acre, shallow lake located approximately seven miles northeast of Hoffman.  Maximum depth is 22 feet.  The lake was added to the listing of Minnesota's impaired waters in 2008 due to excess nutrient enrichment.  Water transparency during summer months has averaged 5.4 feet since 1997, but clarity has been improving.  High productivity affords a greater carrying capacity for fish.  Gamefish diversity has improved with increasing water transparency and expansion of aquatic vegetation.   <br> \n <br> \nA most recent standard fisheries survey was completed in 2019.  An electrofishing survey was completed on June 6 to assess abundance and size structure of Largemouth Bass.  The netting component of the survey was initiated on June 10 and completed on June 14.  Twelve gill nets and 12 trap nets were used to sample the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake supports good panfishing opportunities.  Black Crappie are abundant and grow rapidly in Red Rock Lake.  Multiple age classes of crappie were captured.  Length of captures ranged from 3.6 to 13.2 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Ten percent of crappie captures were 10.0 inches and larger.  Based on the elevated number of two- and four-year-old fish making up the crappie population sample and good growth rates, good quality crappie fishing opportunities will be sustained for a few more years.   Bluegill catches have increased with habitat improvements.  Age distribution of Bluegill catches ranged from age 2 to age 6.  A strong year class recruited to the population in 2016.  Bluegill captures in gill nets averaged 7.3 inches.  The largest Bluegill measured was 9.9 inches.  Fair numbers of Yellow Perch were captured.  Most were young fish so average length was 6.8 inches.  Perch do have the growth potential to reach a harvestable size.  One seven-year-old capture exceeded 10.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake was well known for an exceptional Largemouth Bass fishery prior to an extended high-water period and loss of emergent and submergent vegetation.  The bass population is rebounding.  Electrofishing catches were good and length of captures ranged from 4.5 to 18.4 inches.  Average length was 11.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefish captures included Northern Pike and Walleye.  A total of 44 Northern Pike were captures in gill nets.  Size distribution of that catch was very good with an average size of 26.9 inches.   Nearly half of captures were 28.0 inches or larger.  Four memorable-size pike exceeding 34.0 inches were measured.  The largest measured 38.7 inches.  Walleye catches averaged 4.5/gill net, which was the highest catch rate reported since 1993.  Average size was 17.4 inches and 2.2 lbs.  Alternate-year Walleye fingerling stockings have supplemented natural reproduction in Red Rock Lake.   <br> \n   <br> \nRed Rock Lake is not currently known to be infested with aquatic invasive species.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nA DNR, public access with concrete ramp is located on the eastern shoreline, just off Shorewood Drive.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2022 on Red Rock Lake to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were low, but some quality Bluegill were observed. Forty-two percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length. Growth rates of Bluegill in Red Rock Lake are fast, and age 4 Bluegill averaged 8 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was almost 10 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were high and a variety of sizes were observed in the survey. Approximately 35% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are fast; average length of age 4 fish was over 10 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 14 inches and the oldest crappie was 11 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Red Rock Lake. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2022. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleyes have increased slightly from the last survey, with good length frequency distribution. Year class strength corresponds to stocking. The four year old class probably came from a 1982 stocking of 1+ year old fish. The Walleyes of Red Rock average over 2.5 lbs. Northern Pike numbers have decreased over the last two surveys but they are still abundant. The Northern Pike population exhibits the three year old burn out. However, the Northern Pike are able to reach a quality size before burning out. Yellow Perch have declined over the last two surveys but they are still very numerous and should be adequate forage for Walleye and Northern Pike. Bluegills have also declined from previous surveys from 8.0/net (1977) and 18.2/net (1982) to 2.13/net in the present survey. However, the Bluegills are large (mean=.65 lb) and should provide a quality fishery. Although, the lake survey fails to sample Largemouth Bass populations, Red Rock Lake is known for its quality bass. The biggest change in fish indices is the Black Bullheads. Black Bullheads have dramatically increased from 4.75/gill net in 1977 and 0.57/gill net in 1982 to 76.29/gill net in the current survey. This increase may be due to the rising water levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>No Bluegills, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, or Black Crappies were captured during the assessment. High winds may have had an input on net catches. Black Bullheads were the dominant species netted during the survey. Of the 1906 total fish taken during the survey, 1,855 were Black Bullheads. No Black Bullheads were measured from the trap nets, but gill net lengths suggest only marginal angling or commercial value. Walleye gill net catch declined to 1.33 fish/gill net. Previous surveys in 1958, 1977, 1982, and 1985 yielded gill net catches of 3.0 to 11.0 fish/gill net. Mean weight of the Walleye sampled was 3.70 lbs. Stocking efforts were hard to evaluate due to the small sample size and the stocking of carry-over fingerlings in 1987, 1985 and 1982. Northern Pike gill net catch rates decreased to 2.50 fish/net. Mean weight increased correspondingly to low densities to 3.07 lbs. Northern Pike PSD was calculated at 93.0 percent, but none were larger than 27 inches. Ten of the fifteen Northern Pike captured were age 3. Growth is excellent with the age 3 Northern Pike averaging 22.4 inches. Yellow Perch abundance dropped from 46.7 fish/gill net in 1985 to 3.0 fish/gill net in 1989. The Largemouth Bass population was sampled using electrofishing gear. The Largemouth Bass population appears to be composed of a few large, older fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is a shallow and fertile basin located in southwest Douglas County, near Kensington.  The lake has a surface area of 903 acres.  Maximum depth is 22.0 feet.  Average depth is only 9.0 feet.  Water quality and clarity are seasonally impaired due to excessive nutrient loading.  Water transparency is near 5.0 feet during summer months.  Strong wind and wave action can re-suspend nutrients tied up in bottom sediments and trigger frequent and severe algal blooms.  Red Rock Lake is a polymictic lake.  It can become thermally stratified during the summer, but strong winds can break down the thermocline and allow the top warm water layer and cool deeper water to mix.  During those periods during which the lake is thermally stratified, dissolved oxygen concentrations may be too low in deeper water to support fish.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations were too low below 17.0 feet to support gamefishes in early June of 2014. <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock's fish community has been strongly impacted and shaped by water level instability.  Much of the hardstem bulrush ringing the shoreline and most submergent vegetation was lost to inundation and extended high water following heavy precipitation in the mid-1980s and again in the mid-1990s.  Outlet modifications have occurred to lower and stabilize the water level, but with weather extremes, lake elevation among years has varied by as much as 5.5 feet.  Such habitat instability, limited water clarity, and variability in diversity and coverage of aquatic plants can have profound influences on natural recruitment of nesting gamefishes, survival of young fish in absence of nursery and escape cover, and feeding efficiency of predators.  Those fishes most at risk include sight feeding predators such as Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and sunfishes.  Relatively stable water levels in recent years has been conducive to growth of submergent vegetation in the main basin and connected wetland basins in the southern watershed area.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite harsh water quality and habitat conditions, Red Rock Lake supports quality fishing opportunities.  Northern Pike density has increased.  Gillnet catches in 2014 averaged 8.8 fish/net which was the highest catch rate recorded among all surveys.  Pike catches averaged 25.5 inches in length and 3.7 pounds.  Thirty percent of sampled fish exceeded 28.0 inches.  Two captures exceeded 36.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nA quality Largemouth Bass fishery has re-established after a population collapse that corresponded to loss of aquatic vegetation.  Bass are now moderately abundant.  Ninety-two percent of electrofishing captures in 2014 exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass caught was 20.7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches increased with better and relatively consistent annual recruitment since 2008. Most captures were relatively young, but due to fast growth, the population can support good fishing.  Bluegills grow to 6.0 inches by age 3 and exceed 8.0 inches by age 5.  In response to fast growth, average size of Bluegill caught was 7.0 inches.  Eleven percent of captures exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  One capture measured 10.2 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have also increased, particularly with establishment of a very strong year class of young fish in 2012.  Five age classes were detected in the population sample.  Two-year-old captures made up 83% of the total catch.  Average length was only 6.5 inches because of the high proportion of young fish in the population.  If rate of growth is near average, the two-year-olds should approach 10.0 inches in length in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked during odd-numbered years to sustain a modest fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2014 survey averaged 4.4 fish/net.  This catch rate is reasonably good for lakes assigned to Lake Class 38.  Based on age distribution of the 2014 gillnet catch, natural recruitment may account for much of the standing stock.  The population sample was comprised of cohorts of five age classes. Well over half of all captures were age-4 fish.  No stocking was programmed in 2010.  Rate of growth is dependent upon density so cohorts of the strong 2010 year class did not grow as fast as fish in other age classes.  Those four-year-olds did approach 15.0 inches in length at time of the June 2014 survey.  Average size of Walleyes caught was 15.5 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nRed Rock Lake is one of few basins within the Glenwood Management Area that supports a Yellow Perch fishery, but this fishery may be near collapse.  Yellow Perch abundance remains stable, however, numbers of large perch continue to decline with harvest and predation.  Forty percent of perch captures in 2010 exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  One percent of captures exceeded 10.0 inches in 2014.  At increasing Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass densities, perch will likely mature earlier and channel more energy into reproductive processes rather than body growth.    <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake does not have any known infestations of aquatic invasive species.  If you suspect a new infestation of an invasive plant or animal, take a photo, note the location, or save a specimen and report it to a local DNR invasive species contact at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/contacts.html. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should note that launching a boat during late summer can be challenging due to the shallow access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed on Red Rock Lake in spring 2023 to assess Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 to 10 was implemented in 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey was a repeat from 2022 in an attempt to increase sample size for Bluegill and will be used to help evaluate the reduced sunfish limit regulation.  The current Bluegill population can be described as having moderate abundance, quality size structure, and fast growth rates.  Average size of Bluegill sampled in 2023 was 7.1 inches and 0.3 pounds.  The largest Bluegill observed in the survey measured 9.5 inches.  Twenty-two percent of the Bluegill sample was over 8 inches in length.  The Black Crappie population can also be described as having a quality size structure and fast growth rates.  Average size of Black Crappie sampled in 2023 was 10.5 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The largest Black Crappie observed in the survey measured 14.0 inches.  Approximately 65% of the crappie sampled were over 10 inches in length and 38% exceeded 12 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Red Rock Lake. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nRed Rock Lake was designated as an infested water due to the discovery of zebra mussels in 2022. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",
