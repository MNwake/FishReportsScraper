                "narrative": "<p>Sunset Lake, a 253 acre lake of moderate fertility, is located on the Aitkin/Crow Wing County line just southwest of the city of Aitkin.  A public boat access is not available, but access can be gained via private property off of Crow Wing County Road 33 near the bridge along the north end of the lake.  Eight-three percent of the lake's surface area is made up of water depths at 15 feet of less.  Since shallow water depths are characteristic of this basin along with good fertility, the potential for some degree of fish winterkill does exist when conditions are favorable.  According to historical records, Sunset Lake has experienced low oxygen levels in the past resulting in partial fish winterkill.  The northern most end of the lake is the most susceptible to oxygen deficient conditions.  The lake's immediate shoreline is primarily surrounded by mixed hardwood forest covering gently rolling hills interspersed with residential homes or seasonal cabins.  The majority of the residential development resides along the east, southeast, and northwest shores.  In addition, pasture land and crop land exist along the west shore while marshland is limited to the north and south ends of the lake and small scattered areas along the west shore.  Currently, the lake is managed for bluegill sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike.Evaluation goals of the current management plan called for a population assessment in 2001 to assess the current status of the fish population and the water quality.  During the open water season of 2001, the following gear types were utilized: spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass; spring trap nets to assess adult largemouth bass, black crappie, and northern pike; summer gill nets; and summer trap nets.  Northern pike numbers were within a normal range while the average weight, at 1.0 pound, was below normal.  Measured northern from all gear types ranged from 9.4 to 37.7 inches with most pike between 13.0 and 17.0 inches; however, 24% of 63 northern sampled were at 22.0 inches or greater.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike ranging from 24.0 to 36.0 inches to improve or maintain the proportion of larger fish in the population while still providing opportunities to harvest fish.  Largemouth bass abundance was above normal for this type of lake and their lengths extended from 5.6 to 21.1 inches.  The largemouth size structure appears to be well balanced, as indicated by the broad range of sizes represented, and of excellent quality with 41% of the overall sample at 14.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappie numbers were above normal with their lengths ranging from 4.7 to 12.0 inches.  Crappie lengths sampled during spring and summer were dominated by fish ranging from 6.5 to 8.0 inches.  The abundance of bluegill sunfish tripled since 1991 and was above normal in number when compared to similar lakes, but the average size remained small.  Measured bluegill extended from 3.3 to 7.2 inches with the majority of the sample less than six inches in length.  The sampled fish community also consisted of brown bullhead, dog fish, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, and walleye.  For lakes of this type, numbers of brown bullhead, walleye, and yellow perch were below normal while yellow bullhead was above normal in number.  Based on previous survey data, yellow perch numbers have always been low and yellow bullhead numbers have historically been high.  During the 2001 assessment, a single 20.9 inch walleye was captured.  This was the first time a walleye was sampled by DNR test nets in Sunset Lake.  The exact origin of this fish is unknown.An angler fishing Sunset Lake is likely to encounter an abundance of smaller northern pike, an abundance of largemouth bass with good numbers of quality sized fish, an occasional memorable sized northern pike, an abundance of smaller sized crappie and sunfish with some larger fish available.  Selective harvest of smaller fish for eating is recommended.  Release of larger fish will help maintain or improve the quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake can influence a lake's water quality and ultimatly its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near shorelines.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sunset Lake is a 253 acre lake located on the Aitkin/Crow Wing County line 8 miles southwest of the city of Aitkin.   Although there is no designated public access on Sunset Lake, some anglers have accessed the water via the Crow Wing County Road 133 crossing.  Eighty-three percent of the lake's surface area is made up of water 15 feet deep or less.  Given the shallow depths and good fertility, Sunset Lake can experience partial winterkills, although no significant fish kills have been documented in recent decades.  The lake's immediate shoreline is primarily surrounded by mixed hardwood forest covering gently rolling hills, interspersed with residential homes or seasonal cabins.  The majority of the residential development is along the east, southeast, and northwest shores.  In addition, pasture land and crop land exist along the west shore while marshland is limited to the north and south ends of the lake and small scattered areas along the west shore.  <br> \n <br> \nA full lake survey was conducted in 2011 to assess the current status of the fish population.  The northern pike catch, 5.6/gill net, was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Average weight was below normal at less than 1 pound.  Combining all sampling gear, sizes ranged from 9.8 to 27.9 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  Only 5% of all pike sampled were larger than 24 inches indicating a poor size structure.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24 inches and larger to improve the size structure of the population.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance has been increasing tremendously and was well above normal for this type of lake.  The bulk of the population is comprised of individuals 12 inches and smaller.  A once well balanced largemouth size structure appears to be declining as indicated by data collected in 2011.  Growth was slow, with fish needing 6 years to reach 10\" in 2010 compared to 4 years in 2001.  Largemouth bass lengths extended from 5.7 to 19.0 inches with a mean length of 11.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance was within normal ranges.  Black crappie sizes ranged from 6.2 to 12.7 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  The abundance of bluegill sunfish has fluctuated considerably in surveys dating back to 1970, and has decreased significantly since 2001, while remaining within normal ranges for this lake type.  No bluegill longer than 8 inches were measured in 2011, and the average length was 6.2 inches.  Other fish sampled in Sunset Lake included brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, golden shiner and Johnny darter. Based on previous survey data, yellow perch numbers have always been low and yellow bullhead numbers have historically been high, however, bullhead numbers decreased significantly in the 2011test nets.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the standard summer field work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2011.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the nearshore fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health. <br> \n <br> \nCatch and release of the larger game fish and panfish will help maintain or improve the quality of the fishery and provide quality angling opportunities into the future.  Land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake can influence a lake's water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizers on surrounding lawns, gardens or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near shorelines.  <br> \n</p>",
