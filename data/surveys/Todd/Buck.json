                "narrative": "<p>    A special assessment was conducted on Buck Lake in early June to evaluate the panfish population in conjunction with a gillnet survey in early August.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the Burtrum area and Buck Lake has a history of supporting a quality bluegill population.  Six trapnets were set over a three-day period and lifted twice.  A similar assessment was conducted in the same time period in 2003. <br> \n   The 2008 assessment sampled 305 bluegill between 3.4 and 9.4 inches in length.  Mean length for the catch was 6.8 inches and modal length 6.5 - 7 inches with 48% of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.   A total of 733 bluegill were caught in the 2003 panfish assessment.  The length distribution was from 2.3 to 9.7 inches in length with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Modal length for the catch was the same as in the 2008 assessment, 6.5 - 7 inches, however, with the larger sample size only 28% of the fish were over 7 inches in length.  Both of the panfish assessments produced samples that exceeded the lake management goal of at least having 20% of the bluegill in panfish assessments exceed 7 inches in length.   Ages 2 thru 10 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment with all of the age groups exhibiting fast growth.  The 2002 year class accounted for 31% of the catch.   <br> \n      The 2008 panfish assessment was more effective at sampling black crappie with a catch of 105 fish compared to only 35 in the 2003 assessment. Crappie in the 2008 assessment ranged from 3.7 to 12.3 inches in length while those in 2003 were between 4.4 to 10.2 inches in length.  Mean length in 2008 was better at 6.6 inches but the modal length was smaller 4 - 4.5 inches, due to a strong representation of 1+ age fish, compared to a mean length of  6.1 inches in 2003 and modal length of  5 - 5.5 inches.  More of the crappie in the 2008 sample exceeded 9 inches, 28% (n=29), compared to 17% (n=6) in 2003.  Ages 2 thru 5 and 7 were represented in the 2008 panfish assessment with all of the age groups displaying normal growth.  The 2006 year class accounted for 61% of the catch and was responsible for the modal length. <br> \n     The forty-nine pumpkinseed sunfish sampled in the 2008 panfish assessment were also measured and ranged from 3.4 to 9.1 inches in length.  The mean length for the catch was 7.1 inches, with a modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches, and 45% (n=22) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  The previous assessment in 2003 caught 106 pumpkinseed sunfish, but none of them were measured. <br> \n      Some gamefish species measured in the 2008 panfish assessment included seven largemouth bass between 9 and 19 inches in length, two northern pike, between 15 and 20 inches in length, and a 28-inch walleye.  The 2008 summer gillnets captured only two bass and eight northern pike.  The pike gillnet catch of 2.7/set was at the first quartile level for lake class 33 which was the lowest catch to date for the lake.  The fish measured from 16 to 24 inches in length. <br> \n      Species counted but not measured included bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Golden shiner were also found to be quite abundant in the lake with 53 counted in the assessment.  This is one species that has not been mentioned in previous surveys, but may be an important prey base for the gamefish as only three yellow perch were sampled in the spring netting and  none were caught in the 2008 summer gillnets. <br> \n      The spring panfish assessments have shown to be very effective at sampling the adult black crappie and bluegill in Buck Lake.  An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth.</p>",

Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake four previous times since 2003. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2023 captured 469 Bluegill of which 429 were measured. Spring sample sizes in the past ranged from 185-757 fish. Bluegill in 2023 ranged from 2.8- 10.71 inches and mean length was 6.08 inches. Fish over 7 inches comprised 51% of the catch, fish greater than 8 inches made up 15% of the sample, and 5.6% exceeded 9 inches.  The 2023 results indicate attainment of the goals for fish exceeding 7 and 10 inches while falling short of the goals for proportion over 8 and 9 inches.  In 2023, the mean length of the top 10% was 9.03 inches suggesting improvement since the regulations were enacted.  In general, the size structure has shown some definite improvements under the current regulations with good representation of fish exceeding 9 and even 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and the lake's catches have demonstrated this variability. Spring trap net catches in the lake have ranged from 30 to 105 fish. A total of 35 crappies were captured in 2023 ranging in size from 7.1 to 13 inches, mean length was 8.6 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake is a small, clear-water lake known for its bluegill fishing.  Averagesize is four inches, however, bluegills over seven inches are still available. Northern pike are plentiful and average about 20 inches in length.  Largemouth bassabundance and population characteristics are unknown as bass typically aredifficult to assess with survey gear.  Buck Lakes' walleye population is a resultof stocking and any fish caught are likely to be over 20 inches in length. Stocking was discontinued after 1989 when it was determined the lake was bettersuited for largemouth bass and panfish.  Black crappies and low numbers of yellowperch are also present.  Perch are an important prey species for larger walleye andnorthern pike.  Non-game species in the lake include bowfin, white sucker, blackbullheads, and yellow bullheads.  A wildlife management area is located on the west side of the lake around thepublic access and outlet.  Because of Buck Lake's small size, its water quality,habitat and fish community can be easily influenced by actions on and around thelake.  Best land use practices need to be implemented in the watershed to maintainwater quality and healthy fish habitat.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleyeand voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish may  help to improve the fishcommunity structure.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Buck Lake is a small, clear-water lake west of Burtrum known for its bluegill fishing.  Three types of surveys were conducted on the lake in 2008.  A special assessment was conducted in mid-June of 2008 targeting the panfish, electrofishing for bass was done in early June, and a lake survey completed in early August.  Few fish were caught in the lake survey but the panfish assessment did fairly well as did the electrofishing effort.  The lake has no development along its shoreline, however, cattle are allowed down to the water on the east side of the lake.  Despite the pasture on the east side of the lake, water clarity was good in August.  Buck Lake has a cattail fringe around most of the lake and there is a State owned wildlife management area on the south and west sides of the lake.  Fast drop-offs and weed lines are about the only fishing structures in the lake. <br> \n     Some nice bluegill up to 9 inches were observed in the panfish assessment and a fair number were over 7 inches in length.  Anglers will have to work a little harder to find \"keeper\" size black crappie.  The average size observed in the panfish assessment was around 7 inches, however, there were some crappie up to 12 inches measured.  Because of Buck Lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of the larger bluegill and crappie to sustain the quality fishery.   The electrofishing effort netted bass up to 18 inches in length but most of the bass were less than 12 inches long.  The northern pike population appears to be dominated by smaller fish as none of the fish caught in 2008 were over 25 inches in length.  The panfish assessment showed that there are still some walleye swimming around in the lake.   Stocking was discontinued in 1989 and anglers lucky enough to hook into a walleye are likely to catch a trophy. <br> \n     Other species of the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  It appears that golden shiner are abundant in Buck Lake and may be the forage base for the pike as few yellow perch were found in the 2008 surveys.  Yellow bullhead were the more abundant of the two species of bullhead. <br> \n       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A special assessment was conducted on Buck Lake in mid-June to evaluate the panfish population.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the Burtum area and Buck Lake has a history of supporting a quality Bluegill population.  Six lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 sets.   Similar assessments were conducted in both 2008 and 2003.   <br> \n       A total of 338 Bluegill (28.2/TN) were caught in the 2013 panfish assessment which was comparable to the 305 (25.4/TN) caught in 2008 but less than half of the 2003 catch of 733 Bluegill (61.1/TN).  Both the 2013 and 2008 results were below the lake management goal of 30+/TN in a spring assessment. <br> \n       Bluegill in the 2013 assessment measured from 2.2 to 9.4 inches in length with a mean length of 6.1 inches and modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches for the sample.   Fish exceeding seven inches in length comprised 35% (n=118) of the sample with 12% (n=40) more than eight inches and 0.3% (n=1) over nine inches.  Mean length and modal length was more desirable in the 2008 Bluegill catch at 6.8 inches and 6.5 - 7 inches, respectively.  The largest Bluegill caught in 2008 was also 9.4 inches.  Fish more than seven inches accounted for 48% (n=145) of the sample with 12% (n=36) exceeding eight inches and 1.6% (n=5) over nine inches in length.   <br> \n       Although a greater number of larger Bluegill were caught in 2003, because of the sample size, the proportion of the catch exceeding seven inches was lower, 28% (n=204).  There were a lower percent of Bluegill over eight inches, n=37 (5%), caught than in 2013 but more nine inches or greater, n=11 (1.5%).   The largest Bluegill documented in 2003 was 9.6 inches in length.   The 2008 panfish assessment was the only one to meet the lake management goal of having at least 40% of the Bluegill in a spring assessment exceeding seven inches.  All of the panfish assessments met the goal of recording the presence of nine-inch Bluegill. <br> \n       Ages 1 through 8 were represented in the 2013 spring Bluegill catch.  The 2010 year class dominated the sample, comprising 41% (n=139) of the catch and the 5 - 5.5 inch modal length.  Growth for all the age groups was fast when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       The 2013 Black Crappie catch of 30 fish (2.5/TN) was the lowest of the three spring panfish assessments.   One hundred five (105) crappie were caught in 2008 (8.8/TN) while 35 (2.9/TN) were netted in 2003.  The 2008 panfish assessment was the only one to meet the lake management goal of 5+ Black Crappie per trap net. <br> \n       Crappie in the 2013 panfish assessment were between 4.9 and 12 inches in length with a mean length of 7.2 inches and modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches for the sample.   Fish exceeding nine inches comprised 20% (n=6) of the catch with 10% (n=3) more than eleven inches in length.  There was one crappie over  twelve inches.  Crappie in the 2008 panfish assessment measured from 3.7 to 12.3 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches and modal length of 4 - 4.5 inches for the sample.  Thirty percent (n=32) of the fish were more than nine inches in length with 13% (n=14) exceeding eleven inches.  Two of the crappie caught were more than twelve inches.   <br> \n        None of the Black Crappie caught in 2003 exceeded eleven inches as the largest fish was 10.2 inches.  Mean length for the sample was 6.1 inches with a modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches and 17% (n=6) exceeding nine inches.  The 2008 panfish assessment was the only spring assessment to meet the management goal of at least 30% of the crappie caught exceeding nine inches.  Both the 2013 and 2008 spring assessments met the goal of documenting the presence of twelve-inch crappie.    <br> \n       A lake survey was conducted on Buck Lake in 2008.  Although the gill nets used failed to sample any Black Crappies, the electrofishing effort in early June netted eight of the species.  Those fish were between 8.1 and 12.2 inches in length with a mean length of 10.4 inches.   <br> \n       Ages 2, 3, and 5 through 7 were represented in the 2013 spring crappie sample.  Fish from the 2011 year class dominated the catch, comprising 60% (n=18) of the catch, resulting in the 5 - 5.5 inch modal length.  Growth appeared to be fast for ages 2, 3, and 5 while the older fish showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  <br> \n        Other panfish caught and measured in the 2013 panfish assessment included nine Pumpkinseed between 3.9 and 9.2 inches in length and two hybrid sunfish from 5.7 to 7 inches in length.   Mean length for the Pumpkinseed sample was 6.8 inches with 67% (n=6) of the fish exceeding seven inches.  <br> \n        The second most abundant fish species in the 2013 panfish assessment was Yellow Bullhead.  Forty three Yellow Bullhead ranging from eight to 13.7 inches were netted with a mean length of 10.5 inches for the catch.   There were also three Brown Bullhead between 8.1 and 13.9 inches caught.  Other fish species caught in the spring assessment included Bowfin, Golden Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n     Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were the only two gamefish species sampled in the 2013 spring assessment.  The largest of the four pike caught was 20.5 inches and the largest of the four bass was 17 inches. <br> \n        Spring panfish assessments appear to be the most effective method of sampling adult Bluegill and Black Crappie in Buck Lake.  </p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the west Shore. Buck Lake has 1.35 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 39 feet. Buck Lake is in Lake Class 33; lakes in this class are generally small, have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, have very hard water, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance was down compared to previous years, but the size structure of the population was good with fish up to 18.5 inches captured. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Buck Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Daytime electrofishing and angling was undertaken in the spring of 2020 in order to calculate an estimate of the Bluegill population.  Electrofishing was conducted on five separate days from June 1 to June 17.  Angling took place on June 19 and provided an additional gear type for calculating the population estimation.  Fish were marked with a partial left pelvic fin clip.  Only Bluegill 175 mm (7 inches) or greater were included in the estimate and smaller fish were not collected during most visits.  Catch rates and size structures are not directly comparable to past assessments due to this size selectivity.   Spring trap netting is the preferred method for sampling Bluegill, however social distance restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic required the use of other gear types.  Spring trap net assessments were completed in 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2019 and most future Bluegill sampling on Buck Lake is likely to be done with spring trap nets to facilitate more representative comparisons.   <br> \n <br> \n A total of 467 Bluegill ranging from 1.9 to 10.7 inches were measured during the daytime electrofishing efforts.  Fish in the 7-7.99 inch range accounted for 79% of the marked fish and average size was 7.43 inches.  Ten (10) Bluegill exceeded 9 inches.  Angling captured 41 fish which ranged from 6.5 to 8.4 inches long (average= 7.57 inches).  A population estimate of 2,898 Bluegill 175 mm or longer was calculated.  As this was the first Bluegill population estimate ever completed in the work area no comparisons can be made to past surveys.  <br> \n <br> \n Previous spring trap net assessments have produced good numbers of fish with sample sizes of 185 to 757 fish recorded.  The most recent spring trap net survey performed in 2019 indicated an exceptionally high quality size structure with 56% of the catch exceeding 8 inches, 23% over 9 inches and several fish measuring greater than 10 inches.  Otoliths were extracted from Bluegill in 2019 and aging indicated excellent growth with fish averaging 6.7 inches by Age 4 and 9.1 inches by Age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nA five fish bag limit for sunfish is scheduled for implementation on Buck Lake on March 1, 2021 as part of the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.   The lower bag limit is intended to reduce the harvest of sunfish while improving the sizes of sunfish available to anglers.  The goal is to have the lake produce more 7 to 10 inch sunfish which are most desired by anglers.  Evaluations of lakes that have had similar reduced bag limits for several years have shown that most respond favorably and produce larger sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n <br> \nLarge Black Crappie were documented during the 2020 electrofishing as three fish from 11.9 to 13.2 inches were measured to verify their presence. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buck Lake is a small (56 acres) and undeveloped bass/panfish lake west of Burtrum, MN in southeastern Todd County.  Panfish netting was conducted on 5/29/2019 to evaluate Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and lifted on two days for a total of twelve lifts.\n\nBuck Lake has a Bluegill population characterized by moderate abundance and good size structure.  This and prior spring panfish assessments documented Bluegill populations with fairly high percentages of keeper size fish.  A total of 185 Bluegill were caught in the 2019 assessment ranging from 4.8 to 10.4 inches and averaging 7.9 inches in total length.  The total catch was down compared to past assessments where catches ranged from 305 in 2008 to 733 in 2003.  The 2019 survey captured larger Bluegill than previous assessments.  Individuals exceeding 7, 8 and 9 inches comprised 73.0%, 55.7% and 23.2% of the catch respectively.  These percentages are the highest observed for these length groups in spring panfish assessments in the Little Falls Area.  Bluegill exceeding 7 inches comprised from 28% to 48% of prior survey catches on Buck Lake.  Three Bluegill exceeding 10 inches were also sampled in 2019.  Bluegill growth rates were fairly fast with some fish reaching 7 inches at age 4, 8 inches at age 5, and 9 inches at age 7.  Angler harvest can have a major impact on Bluegill size structure, especially on small lakes such as Buck Lake.  Fisheries managers suggest harvesting more abundant fish in the 6 and 7 inch range, limiting harvest of 8 inch fish, and releasing the largest fish over 9 inches.  This will help maintain quality Bluegill populations.\n\nThe 2019 panfish assessment captured 54 Black Crappies which was within the range observed in previous assessments (N=30 to 105).  Crappies ranging from 7.2 to 12.7 inches and averaging 9.0 inches were sampled.  Fish exceeding 9 and 10 inches comprised 40.7% and 22.2% of the catch respectively, suggesting good numbers of keeper size fish are present in the lake.  Fish exceeding 9 inches in length comprised between 20% and 30% of prior survey catches.  Again, fisheries managers suggest limiting your harvest rather than keeping a limit to help maintain quality Black Crappie in the lake.\n\nOther species captured during the survey included:  Bowfin (Dogfish), Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Walleye and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",
