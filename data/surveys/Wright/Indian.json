Age classes 4 thru 8 are represented. Growth is average for young fish, but becomes slow for older fish. A small sample of Largemouth Bass suggests that growth is slow for this species. The Bluegill population is dominated by age classes 4 and 5, and is ten times above average abundance for this area. This compares to 18.6/trap net in 1971 and 117/trap net in 1960. Growth is slow. Black Crappie are ten times above average in abundance for this area with age class 3 dominant. Growth is average. In 1971 and 1960, the catch was 18.2/trap net and 10.7/trap net, respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is located two and a half miles west of Silver Creek in northwest Wright County. The lake is 146 acres and has a maximum depth of 31 feet.  It has a small watershed that is primarily agricultural and this is reflected in the lower water clarity (3.6 foot average in summer).    The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and sunfish.  Curled pondweed grows to nuisance levels in the spring in most of the nearshore areas.  Eurasian watemilfoil was discovered on the lake in 2003 during the vegetation survey.Largemouth bass in Indian Lake are abundant.  Eighty-one largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in May.  The catch rate was 72 bass per hour of sampling, above the Montrose average of 56 bass per hour.  Most bass caught were between 8 and 12 inches, though some fish greater than 15 inches were sampled.Bluegills are also very abundant in Indian Lake.  Historically, the catch rate of bluegill in trap net has remained well above the average for lakes similar to Indian.  The average size of bluegills is small (5.8 inches), with only 4% of fish sampled being larger than 7 inches.  Both black and white crappie are present in Indian Lake.  Historically, black crappies have been sampled in higher numbers but white crappies have been larger in size.  In 2003, the catch rates of both black and white crappies were within expected levels for lakes similar to Indian.  Most black crappies sampled were between 7 and 9 inches and white crappies were between 9.5 and 11 inches.The northern pike catch in 2003 increased from the 1994 survey, as did the average size of fish sampled (from 2.0 to 4.8 pounds).  Northern pike in the lake grow relatively slowly and most of the large fish were over 10 years of age.  Large northern pike play a critical role in controlling the population of smaller pike, which can become over-abundant in lakes.  Harvesting these large, older fish could shift the fishery back to being dominated by smaller \"hammer-handle\" sized pike, so it is important to practice catch and release on these larger fish.Walleye were last stocked in Indian Lake in 1992 by the DNR and in 1999 by the lake association.   Indian Lake has few yellow perch present and this makes it difficult to establish a walleye population.  Gill net catches of walleye in Indian Lake have remained low, even when more frequent stocking occurred.  The gill net catch in 2003 was low, but average size of fish was large (2.8 pounds).  Most fish sampled came from the 1999 stocking, though one fish was from the 1992 year class (24.8 inches).Other fish sampled in the survey included white sucker, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and golden shiner.</p>",

Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 358 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 3 - 9 inches with an average length of seven inches. For Indian Lake, 76% of Bluegill caught were longer than six inches and 15% were longer than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species caught included: Twenty-eight Pumpkinseed ranging in length from 5.2 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of seven inches and 20 Hybrid Sunfish ranging in length from 4.1 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches. Sixty-three Black Crappie were also sampled with lengths ranging from 4.4 to 11.0 inches and a mean length of 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill size structure in Indian Lake is excellent compared to many lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area. It is hoped that the reduced daily bag limit for sunfish will help redistribute harvest across a larger portion or the season as well as to preserve the size structure that exists in the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a 146 acre recreational development lake located north of Maple Lake in north central Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 31 feet and an average summer water clarity of about four feet. A public access is located on the southeast side of the lake with room for 6 - 8 truck/trailer rigs.  Indian lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and sunfish. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2003.  In addition to the summer survey a targeted Bluegill assessment and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey were conducted in June. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation covered 2% of the lake and 22% of the shoreline in June, primarily cattail and bulrush. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but coontail, sago pondweed and northern watermilfoil were the dominant species in 2003. Eurasian water milfoil was also discovered in the lake in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was similar from that of 2003 and within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Pike ranged in length from 15 to 34 inches with an average length and weight of 24 inches and 3.2 pounds. Forty eight percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and 10 percent were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 22, 2017. A total of 332 Largemouth Bass were captured in 2.65 hours of sampling for a catch rate of 125.5/hour. This is three times greater than the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43.3/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 21 inches with an average length of 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was the lowest surveyed, but still within the range of expected values for the lake class. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of Black Crappie was the lowest surveyed, while the gill net catch was within the range of expected values for the lake class.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches with an average length of 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the surveys include: Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike ranged in size from 16.3-27.1 inches and averaged 20.1 inches in length.  The average weight of pike caught (2.0 pounds) appeared to decline from the 1989 assessment but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Three, four and seven year old fish were caught and Northern Pike growth was average.The gill net catch rate of Walleye appeared to increase from the 1989 fish assessment and rose to within expected levels for this lake class.  The average weight of Walleye (1.3 pounds) also appeared to increase from the 1989 assessment (0.3 pounds) and rose to within expected levels for this lake type.  Walleye ranged in size from 12.1-23.3 inches and averaged 14.8 inches in length.  The growth rate of Walleye was average when compared with other populations in the state.The catch rate of White Crappie in trap nets did not appear to change from the 1989 assessment and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  White Crappie ranged in size from 4.4-11.0 inches and averaged 9.3 inches in length.  The average weight of White Crappie (0.5 pounds) was large for this lake type.     The Bluegill catch rate appeared to decline from the 1989 fish assessment but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average weight of Bluegill (0.2 pounds) appeared to increase from the 1989 assessment but also remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 3.4-7.5 inches and averaged 6.2 inches in length.  Five year old fish dominated the catch and the overall growth rate of Bluegill was average.     The trap net catch of Black Crappie also appeared to decline from the 1989 assessment, but still remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Indian.  Black Crappie ranged in size from 5.1-9.7 inches and averaged 8.6 inches in length.  Four year old fish dominated the catch and the overall growth rate was average.     Largemouth Bass populations were assessed by spring electrofishing.  A total of 34 bass were caught at a rate of 31.4 per hour.  Largemouth Bass ranged in size from 8.7-20.4 inches and averaged 12.3 inches in length.  The growth rate of Largemouth Bass was average.     Other species of note caught during the 1994 survey included average numbers of large Black (1.4 pound average size) and Brown Bullhead (1.6 pound average size).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Indian Lake from June 2 6, 2016. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 474 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 2.0 to 10.0 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described using terms such as Proportional Stock density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD 8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. Indian Lake Bluegill PSD was 59 and RSD 8 was 32. So 59% of Bluegill were longer than six inches and 32% were longer than eight inches. These results seem average for PSD and above average for RSD 8; recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range of 26 to 91 and an RSD 8 range from 0 to 54. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and other sunfish species were also caught. A total of 33 Pumpkinseed were captured with lengths ranging from 3.6 to 8.3 inches and an average length of 7.4 inches. A total of 27 Hybrid Sunfish were captured with lengths ranging from 5.2 to 8.9 inches and an average length of 7.0 inches. Two Green Sunfish was also caught. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except two sites where deep water prevented seining. Abnormally high water level conditions during the survey may have influenced sampling methods and results. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling captured six game fish species, but no non game fish species were captured. The near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Indian Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Northern Pike catch was low relative to the local average and the catch in 1983. Northern Pike from age 4 to age 9 were caught. The data support the 1983 consensus of poor Northern Pike spawning conditions. Two age 1 Walleye were captured and presumed to be from the 1988 fingerling stocking. \n\nShoreline seining captured over 70 Largemouth Bass. Young of the year Largemouth Bass averaged 2.6 inches in length and comprised 82% of the sample. A sample of 224 angler caught bass from 1988 ranged in length from 5 to 19 inches. Age classes from 2-11 were well represented in the angler caught sample. Growth of Largemouth Bass was good. \n\nBluegill abundance remained very high. Five and six year old fish dominated the sample in which seven age classes were represented. Growth of Bluegill remained slow. Shoreline seining produced in excess of 1,200 Bluegill. Young of year Bluegill made up 65% of the seine sample and averaged 1 inch in length. The average length of the remaining Bluegill was approximately 3 inches. Black Crappie abundance decreased from 1983 levels. Ages 2-4 were sampled with ages 2 and 3 being predominant. A strong age 1 sample was taken in gill nets. \n\nWhite Crappie were sampled for the first time in 1989 at levels similar to the local average. All trap net caught White Crappie were age 2, though smaller fish from gillnets were presumed to be age 1. Golden Shiner abundance was above the local average. Catches of Yellow Perch and White Sucker were below statewide averages. Black Bullhead were taken in gill nets at a rate similar to that of 1983 and the local average. Bullheads ranged in length from 11 to 14 inches with an average of 13 inches.</p>",
