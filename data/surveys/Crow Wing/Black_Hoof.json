Black Hoof is in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on July 21, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 3 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Eighteen species were sampled, including 5 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter and Rock Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 21-24, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Hoof Lake is a 183 acre lake located a mile west of Ironton.  There is a public access located on the south shore.  The maximum depth is 29 feet and 44% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Walleye, the primary management species of the lake, have been stocked as fingerlings once every three years since 1986.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 1.3 per gill net, similar to the last assessment and at the low end of the expected range for this type of lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are the most abundant game fish in the lake and were captured at a rate of 7.2 per gill net.  While the 2010 catch was a decrease from previous surveys, it was near the average for similar lakes.  Pike size ranged from 11 to 36 inches and averaged 20.9\" and 2.4 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in numbers similar to the previous survey at 1.8 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net.  Growth was average, fish from 7.7 to 17.7 inches were collected and average size was 12\".  The catch of black crappie was typical for this type of lake and remained similar to previous surveys.  Size of fish was decent.   The bluegill catch was also normal for this type of lake, but was an increase from previous catches on this lake.  Size of bluegills was small. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured at a rate of 21.0 per gill net which is within the expected range of value for this type of lake.  Perch are an important prey species for the lake, although with only 5% measuring at least 8\", few reach a size large enough to be of interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  Various species of darters, shiners, and other minnows common to the area were collected.  A total of 23 species of fish were collected in all sampling methods combined during the 2010 survey.     <br> \n</p>",

The 2016 catch rate of 2.2/gill net was average for this type of lake and fish were a decent size.  Average length was 19.3\" and all of the fish were over 12\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike looked just as healthy as the walleye at 5.2/gill net.  Size was good with an average length of 24.5\" and 42% of the fish measured 24\" or larger.  Anglers are encouraged to only keep fish under 22\" in order to maintain this healthy population. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were mixed.  Black crappie were caught in high numbers (7.0/gill net), with an average length of 8.3\" and 70% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were average for this type of lake (19.9/trap net).  Size was small, with an average length of 5.5\" and only 12% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Gill nets, which are typically not used to evaluate bluegill, also had a fair amount of fish (5.7/gill net).  These fish were larger, with an average length of 7.0\" and 50% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is classified as a hard-water lake with moderate fertility.  Water clarity is good for the area.  The water is somewhat \"bog stained.\"  About 44% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are mostly sand.  The aquatic plant community is not highly diverse.  Emergent plants, especially bulrush, often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species, but abundance is rather limited in the lake.  Submergent species grow to a depth of at least 12 feet in the lake.  They provide critical cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Northern pike and walleyes were the most abundant gamefish species in the '94 netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, both were present in \"high\" numbers.  The northern pike catch was \"high\" for the fifth time in seven nettings.  Size ranged from 15-27 inches (in gillnets) and averaged 21 inches, similar to 1989 results.  Average weight was 2.2 lbs..  Recent walleye stocking has occurred every third year, beginning in 1986.  The walleye catch was \"high\" in each of the last two nettings.  Walleyes aged were from years with stocking.  In 1994, walleyes ranged from 10.7-26.2 inches long (average=18\") and average weight was 2.3 lbs..Few largemouth bass were sampled in '94, but numbers were still \"average.\"  Young bass were common in shoreline seine samples.  Bluegills were present in \"low\" numbers for the second straight netting. However, young bluegills were very common in seine samples.  Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Past netting catches have quite variable.Yellow perch and white suckers provide important forage sources for the lake's gamefish.  Both were present in \"average\" numbers, similar to 1989 catches.  Young perch were also very common in shoreline seine hauls.Other species caught in the 1994 netting included rock bass, bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullheads, all in \"average\" numbers.  Pumpkinseeds were caught in \"low\" numbers, compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackhoof lake is a 183 acre lake located one mile west if Ironton.  Maximum depth is 29 feet and 44% is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity is limited due to heavy algae blooms during certain times of the year and bog stain.  The lake has moderate fertility.  A public access is located on the south side.  The  northern pike catch rate of 18.7 fish/gill net in 1999 is extremely high when compared to similar lake class types.  Catch rates were similar to past surveys dating back to net catches from 1984.  Size range from 17.5 to 23.2 inches with an average size of 20.8 inches.  The lake does not get heavy fishing pressure and larger fish may be getting cropped down.  Walleye wre sampled at 9.3 fish/gill net which is above the normal catch range for this lake class type.  Catch rates were very similar to the previous two surveys of 1989 and 1994.  Sizes ranged from 9.3 to 24.1 inches with an average size of 19.1 inches and a weight of 2.3 lbs.  Walleye are being stocked every third year.  Largemouth bass are present in low numbers with respectable size.Black crappie were represented with a catch rate of 1.0/trap net which is considered within the normal range for this lake type.  Size ranged from 5.6 to 12.7 inches and had an average size of 6.4 inches.  Bluegill were observed in moderate numbers with 99.5% under 7.0 inches and all fish less than age 5.  Growth rate was above normal.  Past surveys indicated larger and older black crappie and bluegill in the surveys.  Yellow perch as in past surveys were very abundant, thus furnishing a good forage food base for various predators.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Hoof Lake is 183 acres in size and is located just west of Ironton.  A public access is present on the south shore.  The lake is classified as a hard-water lake with moderate fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  The water is somewhat \"bog stained.\"  About 44% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are mostly sand.  The aquatic plant community has fair diversity.  Emergent plants, especially bulrush, often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species, but abundance is rather linited in the lake.  Submergent species grow to a depth of at least 12 feet in the lake.  They provide critical cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the 2004 netting.  Abundance remained \"high\" for the seventh time in the nine nettings to date.  Size ranged from 12-26 inches and averaged 18 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye numbers were down from previous nettings, but remained \"average\" compared to similar lakes.Size averaged 19 inches and 2.26 pounds, similar to that from previous nettings.  Walleye stocking has continued once every third year since 1986.The largmouth bass catch remained in the \"average\" category, however, spring electrofishing produced a catch of 149 bass per hour, a high catch rate for this area.  The bass size structure was satisfactory.  Bass ranged from 3.7-19.8 inches long and averaged 11.1 inches.Bluegill numbers remained in the \"average\" category.  Young bluegills were abundant, but of small size in shoreline seine hauls in late August.  The black crappie catch was \"low\" in 2004, but has been quite variable in the past.Yellow perch, an important forage species was down in numbers compared to previous nettings, but remained in the \"average\" category.  Young perch continued to be sampled in good numbers in shoreline seining samples.</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 29'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on 29 July 2016, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at five stations, with the 50' 1/8th inch used at one additional site.  Four stations had heavy vegetation which would not allow for seining.  In total 22 species were sampled including Iowa Darter, blacknose shiner, and blackchin shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 21-24 June 2016 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Blackhoof Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

Average length was 20.8\", with 15% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length made up 9% of the catch.  Northern Pike up to 34.1\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in high number in gill nets (3.8/net), and average numbers in trap nets (0.7/net).  Average length was 9.0\" for gill net sampled fish and 7.8\" for trap net sampled fish.  For both gears combined 55% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills had a trap net catch of 25.8/net, which was average when compared to similar lakes.

These species net catches showed the fish were in the average size range for fish in lake class 34. The net catches for largemouth bass and black crappie indicated larger than average size fish in these samples with fish greater than the third quartile for fish in lake class 34. Bluegill net catches indicate below average population levels with larger than average size fish. The black bullhead net catches indicate below average population levels with catch rates below the first quartile of lakes in this lake class. Black bullhead and brown bullhead net catches indicate average population levels with larger than average size fish.</p>",
