This lake is a popular entry point and receives alot of use from visitors travelling through to other destinations. There is one designated USFS campsite located on the north shore. A short portage from the parking area can be eliminated during periods of high water in the inlet from Picket Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSix species of fish were sampled during the 2014 population assessment. Four shallow gill nets and four deep gill nets were used. Northern pike (43%), bluegill (17%), white sucker (35%) and one rock bass were sampled in the shallow nets. Cisco (84%), burbot (7%) and white sucker (9%) were sampled in the deep nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2014 (2.5/gill net) was similar to past assessments. Pike sizes averaged 24.8 inches and the largest pike was 31.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCisco abundance in 2014 (9.5/gill net) was higher (3.0/gill net) compared to past assessments on this lake. Cisco sizes averaged 6.6 inches and the largest cisco sampled was 7.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake is located entirely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and is accessed via portage from the Picket Lake parking area. The lake has a maximum depth of 76 feet and relatively clear water. <br> \n <br> \nOn August 14, 2023, Mudro Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F. Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to approximately 70 feet. Lake substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and ledge rock, and shoreline drop-offs are steep around the majority of the lake. Four shallow gill nets and four deep gill nets were used in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nCisco were the most abundant species sampled in this survey with a catch rate of 1.8 fish/net. This catch rate was slightly lower than average for Mudro lake. Cisco averaged 6.8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBurbot were sampled in both shallow and deep gill nets resulting in an overall catch rate of 0.8 fish/net. This was the highest catch rate ever recorded for Mudro Lake. Burbot lengths ranged from 16.1 inches to 23.0 inches, which was also the longest burbot ever sampled from the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 1.0 fish/shallow net, which was slightly lower than average for the lake. Lengths ranged from 13.0 inches to 24.8 inches with an average of 19.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch was just 0.8 fish/shallow net, which was lower than average for the lake. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.0 inches to 23.8 inches and averaged 18.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2023 included white sucker, smallmouth bass, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",
