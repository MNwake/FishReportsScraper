                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike was the most abundant species sampled in gill nets.  Pike were sampled at a rate exceeding the expected rate for lakes similar to Dewey Lake.  The average weight was near the upper end of the expected range, while the average length was 24.3 inches.  The longest fish sampled was 33.6 inches.  A quality fishery exists with almost a quarter of captured pike exceeding the preferred length of 28 inches.  Anglers can help the northern pike size structure and population by releasing fish larger than 24 inches and making use of the smaller sized fish.  Comparing between previous assessments indicates an increasing trend in gill net catch rates.  Growth was shown to be near the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears tend to inadequately sample bass populations.  An active capture technique, electrofishing, was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  Largemouth were sampled at a rate of 33.6 fish per hour.  Captured largemouth averaged 13 inches long, and the longest was 19.7 inches.  A quality fishery exists with a good portion of the largemouth population above 15 inches.  Seining in the shallows sampled young-of-the-year largemouth, indicating natural reproduction.  Growth was shown to be near the statewide average for most ages.  This was the first assessment that electrofishing was used to sample the bass population.  There was no bass sampled in the passive gears.  The first and only time largemouth bass had been sampled previous to the 2007 lake survey was 1982. <br> \n <br> \nTwo walleye were sampled at a rate well below the expected range.  Previous assessments had catch rates similar to the 2007 assessment despite previous stockings.  Because there was limited to no returns, walleye stocking was discontinued in 1986.  It is doubtful that walleye are naturally occurring due to the lack of quality spawning habitat.  It is possible that a few walleye have immigrated from the Shannon River system. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled at a rate within the expected range.  This was a slight increase above the previous assessment, but below the historical average.  Lengths averaged 16 inches, and the longest fish sampled was 19 inches.  Historically, relatively larger sized fish have been sampled. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate within the expected range.  Historically, perch have been sampled in relatively low abundance.  Angling opportunities are limited with an average length of six inches, and almost 100% of perch sampled were less than seven inches.  Growth was shown to be near the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at rates within the expected ranges for both gill nets and trap nets. Lengths averaged about eight inches between the two gears.  The longest was 10.2 inches, which was sampled in a gill net.  A moderate angling opportunity exists for smaller sized fish with a few individuals exceeding the preferred length of 10 inches.  Growth was shown to be similar to the statewide average for most ages.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets within the expected range.  No real correlation can be made between historic catch rates due to the inconsistent number of nets set in previous assessments.  A limited fishery exists for quality size fish, with 64% of the population less than six inches.  The longest fish sampled was 8.4 inches.  Growth was shown to be the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the assessment include Iowa and Johnny darters, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, common shiner, golden shiner, mottled sculpin, pumpkinseed, rock bass, spottail shiner, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",
