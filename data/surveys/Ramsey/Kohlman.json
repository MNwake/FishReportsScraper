The lake is connected to Gervais Lake by a navigable channel with no barriers to fish movement. Although the sample size was small, Walleye were captured above the median level for abundance. Three of the Walleyes captured were yearlings that had been stocked in Gervais Lake during Fall 2004. The other Walleyes captured were 7 and 9 year-old adults that were over 25.0\" in length, with the largest individual measuring 27.56 inches. One Hybrid Muskie was captured that measured 28.15\" and weighed 4.4 pounds. The condition and growth rate of this fish was below average. No Northern Pike were captured during this survey. Bluegill were captured in the highest abundance of all species in this survey. The average size of sampled Bluegill was 5.75\" long and 0.13 pounds, with 1.2% of all fish captured being 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie were sampled within the normal range for abundance, but the average size was only 6.67\" long and 0.18 pounds. Growth rates for Bluegill and Black Crappie are average. Largemouth Bass were sampled near median levels of abundance with the largest individual measuring 19.57 inches in length.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>There are 73.5 surface acres in Kohlman Lake.  The maximum depth is 9 feet and the median depth is 5 feet.  Shoal water soils are judged to be 80% mucky sand, 15% detritus, and 5% marl.  Submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants are quite scarce.  A moderate growth of cattail occurs as a fringe adjacent to the outlet, as scattered patches on the north shore, and as a sizeable lowland area on the east shore.  The moderately hard waters of the lake have poor clarity, as indicated by a 1.5' secchi disc reading.  Marshy areas were seen in the southwest lake corner and on the east shore.  County Ditch 18 serves as the inlet from the east and the outlet on the southwest lake shore leads into Lake Gervais.Due to the shallow character of Kohlman Lake and the presence of speed boats and water skiers, no gillnetting was attempted.  Only trapnets were used.  The test nets revealed that black bullhead, bluegill, black crappie, and white crappie numbers were above the respective statewide medians.  Black bullhead, black crappie, and white crappie were especially plentiful.  Numbers of yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed were below statewide medians.  The quantity of carp netted was near the state median.  Common sucker, golden shiner, northern pike, and perch were also taken with the trapnets, but only gillnet medians are considered to show population comparisons.A total of 22 homes or cottages and four boats was recorded.  There is no designated public access.  A local resident stated that most of the fishing occurs from shore and that few boat anglers utilize the lake.  Fishing pressure is indicated to range from very light to light.</p>",

Black crappie numbers were low, with fish small in size (9.0 inches maximum).  Largemouth bass numbers appear good, although no electrofishing was done to assess the population.  Small fish were sampled in moderate numbers, with one larger fish taken.  Four walleye and one tiger muskie were captured, having entered the lake from Gervais Lake, just downstream.  White sucker and carp were present in moderate numbers.  Yellow and black bullhead were present in low numbers, with all fish sampled measuring over 10 inches.  Yellow perch and golden shiner were taken in low numbers.</p>",
