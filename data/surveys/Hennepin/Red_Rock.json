                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake is a 92 acre lake with a maximum depth of 16 feet, located in Eden Prairie.  The lake provides some recreational opportunities.  A city park and a boat launch are present.  Parking is plentiful.  A city ordinance restricts the size of motors in use on the lake to 10 horsepower.  Water quality in Red Rock Lake is fair, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By early summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 14 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing northern pike and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 12 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Red Rock Lake reflects a natural state.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are present.  Northern pike numbers were low compared to historic averages for Red Rock Lake.  Average length was 24.5 inches.  In the 2011 population assessment no largemouth bass were sampled.  This is due in part to a severe winterkill that occurred during the summer of 2010-2011.  The two aeration systems failed.  Numerous deceased largemouth bass were observed after ice-out.  A winterkill assessment showed sufficient numbers remained to repopulate the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSix species of panfish are present in Red Rock Lake.  Black crappie abundance is very low.  Only two fish were sampled.  Adult black crappie were restocked in the spring of 2011.  Bluegill abundance decreased compared to the 2005 survey, but stayed within the historic average range.  Abundance and mean weight are below average compared to similar lakes.  Nearly 50% of sampled bluegill measured at least 6 inches.  Yellow perch abundance in Red Rock Lake increased.  The 2011 measure of abundance is high compared to other lakes.  Mean weight of yellow perch was below average.  Average length was 6.9 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at a below average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.     <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in very low numbers.   No common carp were sampled in the 2011 survey.  Black bullhead abundance fell to an all-time low for Red Rock Lake.  White sucker were also sampled in low numbers.    <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help the fishery recover from the winterkill by practicing selective harvest.  Harvesting large fish reduces the biological incentive to grow large.  Larger fish compete for spawning habitat and food more effectively.  Thus, fish have more incentive to grow large if large fish are present in a lake.  Harvesting smaller fish preserves spawning stock and increases the biological incentive to grow large which promotes big fish genetics.  Harvesting smaller black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass would aid the repopulation of Red Rock Lake.     <br> \n</p>",

The black crappie population is average for this type of lake, but has improved since the last survey. Individuals up to 11.2 inches were sampled. Northern pike were captured in the nets for the first time during this survey. These fish were most likely stocked illegally in the early 1990's. Northern pike over 30 inches in length were sampled. The largemouth bass population is also increasing, as shown by their presence in the trapnets for the first time. Their average length was approximately 11 inches, with individuals over 15 inches also present. The yellow perch population has decreased dramatically since the 1991 survey. This may be a result of the introduction of northern pike and the increased largemouth bass population. Although less abundant, the yellow perch present provide a fairly good quality fishery for the Metro area with individuals up to 11 inches present. Black bullheads are abundant enough to frustrate bluegill fishermen, but some are large enough to provide a good meal for someone so inclined. Green sunfish and hybrid sunfish are present in low abundance.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Rock Lake, a 92-acre, class 42 lake, is a quality panfish lake nestled in the city of Eden Prairie.  A well-maintained public access operated by the city of Eden Prairie is located at the southeast corner of the lake.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye and yellow perch.  Red Rock Lake Sportsman's Association stocked 1500 yearling walleyes in 2002.    Northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass inhabit Red Rock Lake in varying numbers.  Originating from the 2002 private stocking, two age-4 walleyes, averaging 18.3 inches and 2.1 pounds, were sampled in trap nets.  Fifteen northern pike averaging 4.1 pounds and 25.7 inches were captured in both gill and trap nets.  Although pike numbers are slightly down from last survey, they still are good-sized (50% of fish sampled are greater than 25.0 inches) and moderately abundant (7.0 pike/gill net).   Red Rock Lake has a reputation as a quality bass fishery.   Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, two bass measuring 10.5 (age-3) and 15.5 (age-5) inches were sampled.Red Rock Lake offers a diverse panfish community consisting of bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Of the 609 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 65% were above 7.0 inches while 31 fish exceeded 8.0 inches.  Average length of bluegills sampled in trap nets (7.1 inches) increased by one inch since 1999 population assessment.  The largest bluegill sampled measured slightly less than 10.0 inches.    Approximately, 64% of the crappies sampled were above 8.0 inches, with no fish exceeding 9.5 inches.  The sampled crappie population solely consisted of 3 and 4 year old fish.  If allowed to mature, these fish could provide quality future crappie fishing.  The lone yellow perch measured nearly 6.0 inches and weighed 0.1 lb.  Twenty hybrid sunfish and five pumpkinseeds averaged 7.2 and 7.0 inches respectively.  The largest hybrid sunfish measured nearly 9.0 inches.  Although low in numbers, black and brown bullheads averaged 12.1 inches.     </p>",

A public boat access is located at a city park on the southeast side of the lake.  A city ordinance restricts the size of motors in use on the lake to 10 horsepower.  Red Rock Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass, and also supports a healthy population of Northern Pike.  A Standard Survey was conducted in 2021 to monitor the fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nBoat electrofishing in the springtime revealed an abundant Largemouth Bass population, with large fish present in the sample.  Fish lengths were between 4 and 21 inches, with a 12 inch average.  A good number of fish were between 9.5 and 11.5 inches, however, a sizeable portion of the catch also exceeded 16 inches.  With abundant vegetation, Red Rock Lake offers high quality largemouth habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant in 2021, and of good size.  Fish lengths were between 22 and 36 inches, with a 29 inch average.

SAMPLED FISH WERE SMALL, WITH 90.2% IN THE 4.0-5.4 INCH RANGE FOR TOTAL LENGTH AND EXHIBITING AN AVERAGE RATE OF 20.3 FISH PER POUND.  BLG WERE SAMPLED AT SEVEN TIMES THE GILL NET LOCAL MEDIAN AND FIVE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAP NETS.  BLG MEDIAN SIZE WAS IN THE 5.0-5.4 INCH RANGE AND THE POPULATION IS REPRESENTED BY A PSD=0.6%.  GSF WERE PRESENT IN NUMBERS SEVEN TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL NETS AND 42 TIMES THE LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIAN.  THESE FISH WERE EXTREMELY SMALL WITH A LENGTH RANGE OF 3.0-5.4 INCHES AND AN AVERAGE RATE OF 17.3 FISH PER POUND.  PMK WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE GILL NETS, BUT EXCEEDED THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAP NETS BY A FACTOR OF SIX.  FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 4.0 TO 6.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH AND REFLECT A CALCULATED RSD=21.2%.  HSF WERE CAPTURED AT LEVELS NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIANS AND RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 4.0-6.4 INCHES WITH AN AVERAGE RATE OF 8.0 FISH PER POUND.  YEP WERE SAMPLED AT 34 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL NETS AND 75 TIMES THE LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIAN.  LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 12.9 INCHES, WITH A MEDIAN RANGE OF 9.0-9.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  THE AVERAGE RATE FOR SAMPLED YEP WAS 3.4 FISH PER POUND.  BLC WERE SAMPLED NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS, AND AVERAGED 2.0 FISH PER POUND.  LENGTH RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 13.9 INCHES, WITH 20.0% OF THE FISH MEASURING OVER 10.0 INCHES. ONE WAE WAS CAPTURED, WEIGHING 3.4 POUNDS.  TWO SEINE HAULS MADE DURING THIS ASSESSMENT CAPTURED FOUR YOY LMB.  BESIDES FHM, VARIOUS NUMBERS OF YOY BLB, GSF, PMK, BLG, BLC, AND YEP WERE ALSO SEINE SAMPLED.</p>",
