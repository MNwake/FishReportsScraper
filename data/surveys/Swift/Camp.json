                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Camp Lake was conducted during September 18, 2017. Camp is a small (230 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum) and productive lake with abundant submergent vegetation located in Swift County.  <br> \n <br> \nCamp Lake was part of a DNR Research study on Walleye stocking from 2001-2005. Walleye fingerlings were stocked during this time period. Spicer strain fry (about 100,000 fish per year) had been stocked in 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2015-2017. Pike River strain frylings (21,978 fish) were stocked in 2011. Occasional Walleye natural reproduction had been documented in Camp by previous surveys and historical data review. Potential Walleye spawning sites with suitable substrates (gravel, rubble and boulder) were limited to the south shore adjacent to a high clay bank or the public access gravel road/parking lot only when periodic flooding occurred during high water springs. Abundant Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike populations may negatively affect Walleye fry, fryling or fingerling survival during some years in Camp. Abundant numbers of YOY Northern Pike (16.00 YOY/hour, 10.00 inches average) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 and low numbers in 2016(2.00 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average). Moderate yearling Walleye numbers (8.00 fish/hour, 8.64 inches average) were captured in 2017. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 6.69 inches average) were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Spicer strain Walleye fingerlings (2,608 fish, 207 pounds), yearlings (460 fish, 238 pounds) and adults (4 fish) were stocked into Camp during October of 2017 due to the poor fry stocking results from 2015-2017.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success was generally poor in most area lakes during 2015-2017 corresponding to early ice out conditions. Moderate Walleye numbers (49.66 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches average length) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (124.00 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches) in 2011. Approximately 39.3% of the YOY Walleye fingerlings captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey were from oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry stocked as frylings (21,978 fish). The Camp Lake YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 66.11 YOY/hour from fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nCamp Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in 2019. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years (next stocking in 2019). <br> \n</p>",

THE MEAN WEIGHT OF NOP CAUGHT WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED VALUE (3.51 LBS.) IN THE 1992 SURVEY.  THE HISTORICAL MEAN WEIGHT OF NOP CAUGHT IS 3.17 LBS.  THE NOP PSD IN 1992 WAS THE SAME AS THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (79) AND ABOVE THE RANGE OF BALANCED POPULATION (30-60).  THE RSD-P WAS 26 IN 1992 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 8. NOP GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-4 AND AVERAGE FOR AGES 5-8.  THE 1992 BLG GILLNET CATCH INDEX (19.25 PER GN, 3.29 LBS PER GN) WAS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (5.9 PER GN, 1.07 LBS PER GN).  THE 1992 BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (23.44 PER TN, 1.71 LBS PER TN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX, BUT BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (27.5 PER TN, 4.32 LBS PER TN).  THE 1992 BLG PSD (19) WAS BELOW THE RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (40-60).  THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE PSD IS 38, HOWEVER IT IS VARIES FROM HIGH (75) TO LOW (19) WITH NO INTERMEDIATE VALUES.  THE 1992 BLG RSD-P WAS 1 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 1. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF BLG CAUGHT WAS 0.17 LBS IN THE GILLNETS AND 0.07 LBS IN THE TRAPNETS.  ALTHOUGH THE BLG POPULATION IS COMPOSED OF SMALLER FISH, GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 4-5.  IT APPEARS THAT THE 1989 YEAR CLASS IS STRONG.  LOCAL REPORTS FROM ANGLERS SUGGEST THAT THE SIZE OF BLGS HAVE DECREASED THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THE INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF SUB- MERGENT VEGETATION WILL PROVIDE COVER AND PROTECTION FOR SMALL BLGS.  THUS SURVIVAL AND INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION MAY INCREASE RESULTING IN SLOWER GROWTH RATES, AND FEW BLGS GREATER THAN 6 121.84 LBS PER HOUR) WAS HIGH FOR NUMBERS AND POUNDS.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF LMB CAUGHT WAS 0.45 LBS.  THE MAJORITY OF LMB CAPTURED WERE BETWEEN 7-10 1992 SPRING ELECTROFISHING PSD (7) WAS BELOW THE RECOMMENDED RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (40- 60).  THE RSD-P WAS 4.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-7 EXCEPT FOR AGES 3-4 WHICH WERE BELOW AVERAGE. LOCAL REPORTS FROM ANGLERS INDICATE CATCHES OF 1-2 LB LMB WERE COMMON THIS SUMMER.  THE 1992 YEP GILLNET CATCH INDEX (71.25 PER GN, 9.14 LBS PER GN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (58.4 PER GN, 7.33 LBS PER GN). THE 1992 MEAN WEIGHT OF YELLOW FISH CAUGHT FROM GILLNETS WAS 0.13 LBS WHICH WAS THE SAME AS THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE.  THE 1992 PSD (15) WAS BELOW THE RANGE FOR A BALANCE POPULATION (30-50) BUT SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (8).  GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-5.  THE 1989 YEAR CLASS APPEARS TO BE STRONG.  THE 1992 WAE GILLNET CATCH INDEX (8.75 PER GN, 22.20 LBS PER GN) WAS ABOVE THE LAKE CLASS 34 INDEX, AND ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (4.40 PER GN, 8.09 LBS PER GN). THE 1992 WAE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.52 LBS COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 1.54 LBS.  THE 1992 PSD (60) WAS WITHIN THE RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION (30-60) AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (52). THE RSD-P WAS 49 COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 39.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-6 AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 7-9. THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WAE OCCURRING, BUT NO STRONG YEAR CLASSES ARE EVIDENT.  LOCAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT ANGLING SUCCESS IS POOR FOR WAE IN CAMP LAKE. BLH POPULATIONS HAVE DECREASED IN RECENT YEARS WHILE THE SUBMERGENT VEGETATION DENSITY APPEARS TO HAVE INCREASED.  A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN REMOVED BLHS FROM CAMP LAKE DURING THE LATE 1970'S AND EARLY 1980'S.  THE 1992 BLH SPP.  CATCH INDEX FOR NUMBERS (9.0 PER GN, 0.3 PER TN) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE (21.9 PER GN, 42.2 PER TN). THE MEAN WEIGHT OF BLB CAUGHT WAS 1.36 LBS COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 0.84 LBS. THE 1992 BLB PSD WAS 70 COMPARED TO THE LBS.)

                "narrative": "<p>Camp is a small (203 acre), eutrophic lake about 3 miles east of Swift Falls, MN in Swift County. Maximum depth fluctuates between 28 to 33 feet deep. Camp is a landlocked lake with no discernable connections to other permanent bodies of water. The surrounding watershed is characterized by rolling hardwoods, agricultural, pasture, and grasslands. Submergent vegetation densities (coontail, northern watermilfoil) fluctuate with lake water levels. Algae blooms can become quite common during late July. Camp has been managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill. Winter rescue northern pike were stocked at various rates (64 - 2,973 lbs per year) into Camp from 1981-85. Walleye fingerlings were stocked at relatively low rates (< 1/2 lbs/littoral acre) in 1985, 1986, 1990, and 1992. However, about 200,000 - 300,000 walleye fry were stocked per year in 1980, 1983, and 1986. Walleye stocking has been temporarily discontinued to evaluate any changes in population size structure of other species (black crappie, bluegill) which may be directly or indirectly influenced by walleye populations. In 1978, flathead catfish fingerlings were stocked (6,300 fish) into Camp to control abundant bullhead and stunted bluegill populations. However, flathead catfish were not sampled in any subsequent surveys. There have been reports of winterkills occurring, but specific dates were not recorded. Commercial fishing for bullhead occurred during the late 1970's and early 1980's. There have been no reported catches of common carp in the six lake surveys/population assessments conducted on Camp since 1962. There have been reports in the past of good angling success for largemouth bass, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill.     Black crappie abundance (0.1 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (2.1 - 31.4 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (0.9 fish/trapnet). Low densities of black crappie have occurred for the last several years in many local lakes.        Largemouth bass are abundant in Camp (113.9 fish/hour) as indicated by spring electrofishing surveys. We estimated the population of largemouth bass greater than 8 inches to be 2,721 fish. The 1993 catch rate had declined compared to 1992 catch rate (272.0 fish/hour), however the average size increased from 0.45 lbs in 1992 to 1.00 lb in 1993. About 75% of the largemouth bass captured were between 8 and 12 inches. The largest fish captured was 20.1 inches. Camp is a popular fishing lake by local anglers for quality/preferred size largemouth bass.      Bluegill abundance (30.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (5.8 - 48.9 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but above the historical average (15.7 fish/trapnet). The average size in 1993 was only 4.6 inches. Only 9% of the bluegill caught were above 6 inches. Growth rates appear poor compared to local lakes.      Northern pike abundance (3.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.0 - 8.5 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (5.0 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1993 (3.3 lbs) was similar to the historical average (3.2 lbs). Growth rates appear good compared to local lakes. There are two marsh originated intermittent inlets where spawning can occur. Higher densities of northern pike can be supported by Camp due to the abundance of forage (yellow perch) present.      Yellow perch abundance (98.3 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (2.0 - 29.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (65.0 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1993 (0.2 lbs) was similar to the historical average (0.2 lbs). About 19% of the yellow perch were greater than 8 inches.     Walleye abundance (6.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 7.4 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (4.6 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1993 (3.2 lbs) was above the historical average (2.0 lbs). Growth rates appear good compared to other local lakes. It appears that some natural reproduction occurs in Camp Lake as determined by scale reading. Walleye stocking has been relatively minimal in recent years. The best available spawning habitat (gravel/rubble) occurs near the south shore. A further check with fall electrofishing will provide concrete documentation of walleye reproduction in Camp.     Black bullhead abundance (0.4 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (2.0 - 53.0 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes. Black and brown bullhead abundance combined (1.1 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (35.4 fish/trapnet). Bullhead densities have been sparse (< 4.0 fish/trapnet) throughout the 1980's and 1990's. The highest densities occurred in 1975 (69.5 fish/trapnet, average size=0.1 lbs) and 1962 (137.4 fish/trapnet, average size=0.3 lbs). During the late 1970's intensive commercial bullhead removal occurred. The 1993 average bullhead size (0.9 lbs) was above the historical average (0.6 lbs).     Management priorities on Camp Lake include working with area landowners to the reduce nutrients inputs, protecting existing emergent vegetation, improving the bluegill size structure, increasing northern pike densities, and maintaining a quality largemouth bass fishery. Maintaining high densities of predator populations (largemouth bass, northern pike) is the most feasible management option for attempting to improve bluegill size structure due to the fluctuations of habitat conditions (submergent vegetation density) in Camp. Although, yellow perch densities have been historically high with occasionally good size structures present, they do not appear to affect bluegill densities through predation of young of year in Camp. If northern pike numbers do not improve and yellow perch numbers continue to increase, then stocking winter rescue northern pike if available would be an option to bolster densities. Additional spring electrofishing data is needed to effectively manage the largemouth bass population. Experimental regulations is a viable option if over harvest of largemouth bass occurs in Camp.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Camp is a small sized and moderately deep lake located in Swift County. The waterquality is moderately productive in Camp. The majority of the nutrient inputs into Camp comesfrom agricultural and livestock runoff. The water clarity (secchi=8.5 feet) was good on June8, 1998, but had decreased by July 27, 1998 (5.5 feet) due to algae blooms. Blue-green algaeblooms can become intense during the late summer months. Submergent vegetation (northernwater milfoil, water moss, filamentous algae) densities were abundant in 1998. Emergentvegetation species (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, green fruited burreed) were generallysparse with the exception of the duckweeds, jewel weed and reed canary grass. Flooded anddownfall trees are common surrounding the shoreline of Camp. Shoal water substrates aremostly sand, detritus, and gravel. High water conditions currently exist on Camp. There isno natural outlet. Presently, the public access parking lot and a portion of the townshiproad is flooded. The shoreline coverage is mostly undeveloped hardwoods, a turkey farm on thesouthwest shore, marshlands, 14 residential cabins/homes/farmsteads. The surroundingwatershed is a mixture of agricultural row crops, livestock operations, undevelopedwoodlands, prairie grasslands, and marshlands. Camp has a variety of habitat available forfish spawning. Largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish species have many good areas tospawn in Camp. Walleye have fair spawning grounds located along the rubble/boulder pointareas especially along the south shore. Additional walleye spawning habitat has beenavailable since the high water conditions flooded the gravel township road. It is common toobserve numerous gulls on the lake which are attracted to the nearby turkey farms and pastureareas. Many of the gamefish species (yellow perch, walleye, northern pike) present in Campwere infected with a parasitic fluke called neascus that appears as a black spot on theoutside of the skin. This fluke is harmless to humans if the fish is properly cooked. Fishact as an intermediate host for the immature parasite neascus and a fish eating bird is thefinal host. Camp is a popular lake for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northernpike fishing. In recent years walleye fishing has also been good on Camp.     Bluegill numbers were low in 1998 (11.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the historicalaverage (15.17 fish/trapnet). The 1998 bluegill average length (4.4 inches, gillnets andtrapnets combined) was small compared to the historical average (5.5 inches). The largestbluegill captured during the 1998 survey was 6.8 inches. The 1996 year class comprised themajority of the 1998 bluegill survey catch. Bluegill natural reproduction appeared good in1998 (96.8 young of year \"YOY\"/seine haul).     Black crappie were abundant in 1998 (6.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (2.26 fish/gillnet). The 1998 black crappie average length (6.4 inches, gillnets andtrapnets combined) was small compared to the historical average (7.2 inches). The largestblack crappie captured in the 1998 survey was 8.1 inches. There were two abundant blackcrappie year classes (58% for 1997, 42% for 1996) present in Camp during 1998.     Northern pike were abundant in 1998 (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (5.69 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average length (21.6 inches, gillnets andtrapnets combined) was moderate, but below the historical average (23.1 inches). The 1998average weight was 3.00 lbs. The largest northern pike captured in the 1998 survey was 30.8inches.     Walleye were abundant in 1998 (15.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average(6.15 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average length (17.3 inches, gillnets and trapnetscombined) was large. The largest walleye captured in the 1998 survey was 25.5 inches. Therewere three strong to moderate walleye year classes (1997, 1996, 1994) present in Camp due tonatural reproduction. Walleye natural reproduction was documented for several years by the1993 survey. Walleye fingerlings were last stocked (1,584 fish) into Camp during 1992.     Yellow perch were abundant in 1998 (96.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (69.48 fish/gillnet). The 1998 yellow perch average length (6.2 inches) was small.     Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass was not conducted in 1998 due to timeconstraints. Largemouth bass have been abundant in Camp during previous spring electrofishingsurveys (272.00 fish/hour in 1992, 113.97 fish/hour in 1993). Large bass (15-20 inches) werecommon in Camp Lake during 1992 (9.33 fish/hour) and 1993 (13.97 fish/hour).     The Camp Lake fishery appears to be in good shape for a variety of fish species.Although black crappie and bluegill average sizes are presently small, these fish are youngand the average size should improve during the next few years. Camp offers excellentlargemouth bass angling opportunities for large fish. In addition, bluegill and black crappiefishing are often good during the spring and winter seasons. Other popular fish that anglersseek in Camp include northern pike and walleye in recent years. It appears that walleye arepresently able to self sustain themselves in Camp through natural reproduction. However,stocking may be necessary if natural reproduction success decreases in frequency. The DNRSpicer Fisheries personnel will monitor adult fish population numbers every four years bysummer test netting and spring bass electrofishing in order to evaluate management practiceson Camp Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Camp Lake was conducted during September 20, 2016. The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Camp is a small (230 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum) and productive lake with abundant submergent vegetation located in Swift County.  <br> \n <br> \nCamp Lake was part of a DNR Research study on Walleye stocking from 2001-2005. Walleye fingerlings were stocked during this time period. Spicer strain fry (about 100,000 fish per year) had been stocked in 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2015-2016. Pike River strain frylings (21,978 fish) were stocked in 2011. Limited Walleye natural reproduction had been documented in Camp by previous summer surveys and assessments. Potential Walleye spawning sites with suitable substrates (gravel, rubble and boulder) include the south shore adjacent to a high clay bank and the access gravel road/parking lot when periodic flooding occurs during the spring. Abundant Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike populations may negatively affect Walleye fry, fryling or fingerling survival during some years in Camp. <br> \n <br> \nThere were low YOY Walleye numbers (2.0 YOY/hour, 4.9 inches) captured in 2016. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2016. Low YOY Walleye numbers (6.0 YOY/hour) were also captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. The 2015 YOY Walleye average length was large (6.7 inches). No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success was generally poor in most area lakes during 2015 and 2016 corresponding to early ice out conditions. Moderate Walleye numbers (49.7 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches average length) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (124.0 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) in 2011. Approximately 39% of the YOY Walleye fingerlings captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey were from oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry stocked as frylings (21,978 fish). The YOY Walleye catch rate due to natural reproduction was significant (75.3 YOY/hour) in 2011 for Camp. The Camp Lake YOY Walleye historical average catch rate is 77.1 YOY/hour from fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nCamp Lake will be surveyed for all fish species in 2019. A fall night electrofishing survey will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Camp Lake in July of 2008. Camp is a small (203 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity are variable in Camp. Water clarity was good (secchi=7.0 feet) during mid July of 2008. Total phosphorus levels were low to moderate (0.029 ppm) in June of 2008. Mid summer dissolved oxygen levels were low (< 1.00 ppm) at depths greater than 18 feet. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Water levels were normal in 2008 with no flooding of the public access road or parking lot. Aquatic vegetation (various pondweed species, duckweed species, water moss, bulrush, coontail, northern milfoil, filamentous algae) was common to abundant within the lake during 2008. The north bay had high densities of submergent vegetation and filamentous algae in 2008. Shoalwater substrates were composed of mostly sand, silt, and rubble. There are numerous small inlets that drain water primarily from agricultural row crop fields into Camp Lake. These intermittently flowing inlets were dry or not flowing during the July 2008 resurvey of Camp Lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number (16) of residential homes. A large turkey barn along the southwest shore attracts large numbers of gulls that use Camp Lake. Birds act as an intermediate host for various fish parasites like neascus (black spot) that are prevalent on several fish species (northern pike, yellow perch, walleye) in Camp Lake. Fish eating birds such as white pelicans and double crested cormorants can also be numerous on Camp. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp primarily for largemouth bass and walleye. Camp Lake is currently a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2008 (0.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp (25th=0.00, 50th=0.25, 75th=7.67 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 3.58 fish/gillnet. Low numbers (0.33 fish/trapnet) of black crappie were captured in the 2008 trapnets. The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.77 pounds and 9.17 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2008 (108.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp (25th=11.00, 50th=19.33, 75th=30.22 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 29.09 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was small (0.05 pounds and 3.86 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (3.89 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2 and within the normal ranges for ages 3-6. The 2006 year class comprised 57% of the 2008 total bluegill catch. The 2005 year class comprised 38% of the 2008 total bluegill catch. Low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" bluegill (6.00 YOY/haul, 1.46 inches average length) were captured from the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNo spring electrofishing surveys for largemouth bass were conducted during 2006 or 2008. The 2004 spring electrofishing survey largemouth bass catch rate (66.86 fish/hour) was moderate to good, but below the Camp Lake historical average (150.92 fish/hour). Previous spring electrofishing surveys of largemouth bass documented high numbers (113.89 fish/hour and 0.99 pounds average weight in 1993, 272.00 fish/hour and 0.45 pounds average weight in 1992) in Camp. The largemouth bass average weight and length were 2.11 pounds and 15.00 inches from the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average size was 1.18 pounds and 11.79 inches from spring electrofishing in Camp. Low numbers of YOY largemouth bass (5.50 YOY/haul, 1.77 inches average length) were captured from the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (11.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp (25th=3.88, 50th=10.00, 75th=11.00 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 8.03 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate (2.97 pounds and 23.06 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.00 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (0.75 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but below the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2005 year class comprised 39% of the 2008 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp (25th=1.38, 50th =3.25, 75th=9.71 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 5.57 fish/gillnet. The 2008 walleye average size was moderate (1.81 pounds and 15.81 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.06 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low to moderate (2.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The two dominant walleye year classes were 2005 (35%) and 2007 (30%) observed in the 2008 walleye net catch. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 2001 (480 fingerlings, 24 pounds; 135 yearlings, 27 pounds), 2003 (165 yearlings, 50 pounds), 2005 (3,002 fingerlings/yearlings, 194 pounds), and 2007 (98,181 unmarked fry). The 2001, 2003, and 2005 stockings (OTC marked) were part of the DNR walleye stocking research study. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (83.08 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches average size) were captured in a 2007 fall electrofishing survey. The YOY walleye may have been from a 2007 spring fry stocking, natural reproduction, or a combination of the two. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were low to moderate in 2008 (17.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp (25th=16.25, 50th=29.50, 75th=85.67 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 50.09 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.11 pounds and 6.32 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 year class comprised 59% of the 2008 yellow perch gillnet catch. There were moderate to low numbers of YOY yellow perch (14.50 YOY/haul, 3.06 inches average length) captured from the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured in the 2008 survey nets included moderate numbers of white sucker (3.25 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of black bullhead (0.22 fish/trapnet). Historical average catch rates were 2.25 white sucker/gillnet and 18.01 black bullhead/trapnet for Camp Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. All fish species in Camp Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2010. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Camp Lake during late June of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A targeted survey was conducted by Fall Electrofishing for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye in 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nCamp is a small (230 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Development is limited to a few farm sites (south and northwest) and 35 homes (2015 survey) along the northeast shoreline area. Undeveloped hardwood stands compose the majority of the immediate shoreline. Water quality and clarity are variable in Camp. Water clarity was fair during on June 24, 2019 (secchi=8.0 feet). Submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil, various pondweeds, etc.) is abundant in the littoral areas (< 15 feet deep), but emergent vegetation (i.e. bulrush, cattails, etc.) is limited in Camp. Total phosphorus levels were low to moderate (0.025 ppm) in June of 2015. Dissolved oxygen levels were low (< 2.4 ppm) at depths greater than 25 feet during the 2019 survey. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Water levels were above normal in 2019. The public access road and parking lot almost flooded in the 2019 spring. Camp Lake can flow out over an outlet rock structure during high water into a wetland adjacent to the west side of the access. Water from this wetland can flow through a private road culvert, continuing thru an above ground channel and eventually into a tile system to the East Branch of the Chippewa River. There are numerous small inlets that drain water primarily from agricultural row crop fields into Camp Lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number of residential homes. Neascus \"black spot\" is common parasite on the outside skin of some gamefish species in Camp, although not harmful if eaten when properly cooked. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Walleye. Although invasive species such as Eurasian watermilfoil (Scandinavian and Gilchrist) Zebra Mussels (Gilchrist) are present in nearby lakes, none have been reported in Camp.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2019 (0.50 fish/gillnet and 0.22 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 2.90 fish/gillnet and 1.41 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Black Crappie average size was large (0.86 pounds and 11.46 inches) from gillnets. Black Crappie population numbers were higher in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Anglers usually target Black Crappie during the spring and winter months. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high in 2019 (86.78 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average catch rate (48.44 fish/trapnet), but the average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.59 inches) from trapnets. A few Bluegill over 9.00 inches were captured in the 2019 trapnets. Stunting or slow growth of Bluegill occasionally occurs in Camp. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2019. The previous 2015 Largemouth Bass catch rate (45.23 fish/hour) was moderate, but the lowest recorded spring electrofishing value for Camp Lake. The Largemouth Bass average size was large (2.45 pounds and 15.80 inches) from the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. Camp has excellent Largemouth Bass angling opportunities for both numbers and large sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2019 (12.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 8.40 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.31 pounds and 24.85 inches) from gillnets, but there were no fish captured greater than 30.00 inches. Northern Pike grow rates were slow. The 2014 year class comprised 33% of the 2019 Northern Pike gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Camp Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2019 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 5.71 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Walleye average size was large (3.70 pounds and 20.83 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were excellent. The majority (67%) of Walleye captured were 10 years or older in the 2019 survey. Occasional Walleye natural reproduction has been documented in Camp during high water periods, especially when the access gravel parking lot and road have flooded. Recent Walleye stockings occurred in 2011 (21,978 marked frylings), 2013 (119,755 fry), 2015 (103,802 fry), 2016 (99,788 fry), 2017 (98,358 fry; 2,608 fingerlings, 207 pounds; 460 yearlings, 238 pounds; 4 adults, 7 pounds), 2019 (2,700 fingerlings, 300 pounds). Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in 2011 (124.00 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches) and 2013 (49.66 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Low YOY Walleye numbers (<7.00 YOY/hour) were captured in the 2015-17 fall electrofishing surveys. The 2019 YOY Walleye catch rate was also low (2.86 YOY/hour, 7.09 inches). Walleye angling can be good for larger sized fish during some years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2019 (18.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes, but below historical average catch rate (42.99 fish/gillnet) for Camp. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.54 inches) from gillnets. Neascus parasite is commonly found on Yellow Perch in Camp.  <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured or not captured in the 2019 survey nets included moderate numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish (5.00 fish/trapnet) and White Sucker (3.00 fish/gillnet); low numbers of Black Bullhead (0.11 fish/trapnet); and no Common Carp. Historical average catch rates were 1.38 Pumpkinseed Sunfish/trapnet, 2.05 White Sucker/gillnet, 14.17 Black Bullhead/trapnet and 0.00 Common Carp/gillnet for Camp Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking Walleye as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2024. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer population assessment of the fish population was conducted on Camp Lake in July of 2004. Camp is a small (203 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity is variable in Camp. Water clarity was poor (secchi=3.75 feet) during the 2004 assessment. High water conditions had resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Local officials constructed an outlet about five years ago to alleviate high water conditions in Camp, but subsequent flooding downstream delayed the initial use of the outlet. Additional tile installation and rerouting of the water resulted in a functional outlet system about a year after the original outlet construction. Presently, the public access is not flooded. Aquatic vegetation (pondweeds, duckweeds, water moss, bulrush, coontail, northern milfoil, filamentous algae) is abundant within the lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number of residential homes. A large turkey barn along the southwest shore attracts large numbers of gulls that use Camp Lake. Birds act as an intermediate host for various fish parasites like neascus (black spot) that are prevalent on several fish species (northern pike, yellow perch, walleye) in Camp Lake. Fish eating birds such as white pelicans and double crested cormorants can also be numerous on Camp. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. Camp Lake is currently a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking.Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2004 (11.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 3.41 fish/gillnet in Camp. The 2004 black crappie average size was small (0.10 pounds and 5.59 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.16 pounds from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in Camp were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2002 black crappie year class comprised 87% of the 2004 assessment black crappie catch.Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2004 (67.44 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 21.44 fish/trapnet in Camp. The 2004 bluegill average size was small (0.05 pounds and 3.91 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured in the 2004 assessment was 7.64 inches. The catch rate of 6.00 inch and larger bluegill was low (2.77 fish/trapnet) in 2004.Largemouth bass numbers were abundant in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey (66.86 fish/hour) and above the Spicer area historical average (47.22 fish/hour). However, the 2004 spring electrofishing catch rate was below the Camp Lake historical average (150.92 fish/hour). The largemouth bass average size was large (2.11 pounds and 15.00 inches) from the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average size is 1.18 pounds and 11.79 inches from spring electrofishing in Camp. The largest bass captured during the 2004 spring electrofishing survey was 19.65 inches. The catch rate of 15.00 inch and larger largemouth bass was high (41.88 fish/hour) in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates in Camp were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 1998 largemouth bass year class comprised 30% of the 2004 spring electrofishing catch. Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2004 (10.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.40 fish/gillnet in Camp. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (2.98 pounds and 23.46 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.02 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 assessment was 38.50 inches. The catch rate 28.00 inch and larger northern pike was low to moderate (1.25 fish/gillnet) in 2004. Northern pike growth rates in Camp were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2000 northern pike year class comprised 28% of the 2004 northern pike summer assessment catch. Neascus (black spot parasite) was prevalent on northern pike captured in the 2004 summer assessment.Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (6.25 fish/gillnet) for Camp, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2004 walleye average size was large (2.87 pounds and 19.71 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.07 pounds from gillnets. The largest walleye captured in the 2004 assessment was 25.00 inches. There were no yearling walleye observed during the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. Walleye growth rates in Camp were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 1999 walleye year class comprised 27% of the 2004 walleye assessment catch. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 1990 (4,235 yearlings, 55 pounds), 1992 (1,584 fingerlings, 49 pounds), 2001 (480 fingerlings, 24 pounds; 135 yearlings, 27 pounds), and 2003 (165 yearlings, 50 pounds). The 2001 and 2003 stockings were part of the DNR walleye stocking research study. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2004 (15.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (56.06 fish/gillnet) in Camp, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2004 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 5.81 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. Neascus was prevalent on yellow perch captured in the 2004 summer assessment.Other notable fish species captured or not captured in the 2004 summer assessment included abundant numbers of white sucker (4.50 fish/gillnet) and no black bullhead (0.00 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 2.19 fish/gillnet for white sucker and 11.98 fish/gillnet for black bullhead.Current fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. All fish species in Camp Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2006.</p>",

Camp is a small (203 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity are variable in Camp. Water clarity was fair (secchi=5.0 feet) during early July of 2010. Total phosphorus levels were low to moderate (0.029 ppm) in June of 2008. Mid summer dissolved oxygen levels were low (< 1.00 ppm) at depths greater than 18 feet. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Water levels were normal in 2010 with no flooding of the public access road or parking lot. There are numerous small inlets that drain water primarily from agricultural row crop fields into Camp Lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number (16) of residential homes. A large turkey barn along the southwest shore attracts large numbers of gulls that use Camp Lake. Birds act as an intermediate host for various fish parasites like neascus (black spot) that are prevalent on several fish species (northern pike, yellow perch, walleye) in Camp Lake. Fish eating birds such as white pelicans and double crested cormorants can also be numerous on Camp. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp primarily for largemouth bass and walleye. Camp Lake was a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2010 (4.33 fish/trapnet) were moderately abundant compared to the historical average (1.62 fish/trapnet). The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate to small (0.23 pounds and 7.32 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2010 (146.44 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 38.87 fish/trapnet. The 2010 bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.42 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (3.33 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 spring electrofishing survey largemouth bass catch rate (55.20 fish/hour) was moderate, but below the Camp Lake historical average (126.99 fish/hour). Previous spring electrofishing surveys of largemouth bass documented high numbers in 1993 (113.89 fish/hour, 0.99 pounds average weight) and 1992 (272.00 fish/hour and 0.45 pounds average weight), but similar numbers in 2004 (66.86 fish/hour, 2.11 pounds average weight). The largemouth bass average size was large (2.43 pounds, 15.73 inches) from the 2010 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average size was 1.49 pounds and 12.78 inches from spring electrofishing in Camp.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (7.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.97 fish/gillnet. The 2010 northern pike average size was moderate to small (2.78 pounds and 22.83 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.98 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2005 year class comprised 29% of the 2010 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2010 (11.33 fish/gillnet) compared to normal ranges for Camp and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 6.05 fish/gillnet. The 2010 walleye average size was moderate (1.27 pounds and 13.94 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.98 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (5.67 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-7. The 2009 (44%) and 2007 (36%) year classes comprised the majority of walleye year classes observed in the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 2001 (480 fingerlings, 24 pounds; 135 yearlings, 27 pounds), 2003 (165 yearlings, 50 pounds), 2005 (3,002 fingerlings/yearlings, 194 pounds), 2007 (98,181 unmarked fry) and 2009 (98,942 unmarked fry). The 2001, 2003, and 2005 stockings (OTC marked) were part of the DNR walleye stocking research study. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye were captured in 2007 (83.08 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches average size) and 2009 (198.00 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches average size) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2010 (4.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Camp and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 46.28 fish/gillnet. The 2010 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 6.05 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured or not captured in the 2010 survey nets included low numbers of white sucker (0.33 fish/gillnet) and no black bullhead or carp. Historical average catch rates were 2.09 white sucker/gillnet, 16.51 black bullhead/trapnet and 0.00 carp/gillnet for Camp Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. YOY walleye will be surveyed in the fall of 2010. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Camp Lake during late June and early July of 2015. Camp is a small (230 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity are variable in Camp. Water clarity was fair during early July (secchi reading=7.5 feet) and August (secchi reading=5.0) of 2015. Total phosphorus levels were low to moderate (0.025 ppm) in June of 2008. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Water levels were below normal in 2015 with no flooding of the public access road or parking lot. There are numerous small inlets that drain water primarily from agricultural row crop fields into Camp Lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number (35) of residential homes. A large turkey barn along the southwest shore attracts large numbers of gulls that use Camp Lake. Birds act as an intermediate host for various fish parasites like neascus (black spot) that are prevalent on several fish species (Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Walleye) in Camp Lake. Fish eating birds such as white pelicans and double crested cormorants can also be numerous on Camp. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Walleye. Camp Lake was one of several study lakes for a DNR Research project on Walleye stocking during 2001-2005. Camp Lake is a popular panfish and Largemouth Bass fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers in 2015 (0.11 fish/trapnet and 0.33 fish/gillnet) were very low compared to the Camp historical averages (1.51 fish/trapnet and 3.08 fish/gillnet). Only two Black Crappies were caught during the 2015 survey. The 2015 Black Crappie average size was small (5.4 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2015 (125.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and Camp historical average (45.50 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.6 inches) from trapnets. There were few large (6.0 inches or greater) Bluegill captured (6.55 fish/trapnet) in the survey. Bluegill growth rates were slow in Camp. The 2012 year class comprised 65% of the 2015 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were moderate (45.23 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. However, the Largemouth Bass average size was large (2.45 pounds, 15.8 inches) from the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth Bass growth rates were excellent. Camp has excellent numbers of large (> 15.0 inches) size bass as documented by the spring electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2015 (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the Camp historical average (8.13 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Northern Pike average size was small (2.63 pounds and 23.0 inches from gillnets) compared to the historical average (2.95 pounds). Northern Pike growth rates were moderate for younger fish (< age 5), but slow for older fish. Only 1 Northern Pike over 30.0 inches was captured in the 2015 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2015 (5.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and similar to the historical average (5.99 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was large (3.47 pounds and 21.3 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.11 pounds. Walleye growth rates were good. Fish from the 2009 year class (47%) comprised the majority of the Walleye captured in the 2015 survey nets. Recent Walleye stockings occurred in 2007 (98,181 fry), 2009 (98,942 fry), 2011 (21,978 marked frylings), 2013 (119,755 fry) and 2015 (103,802 fry). Abundant fingerling size \"YOY\" Walleye numbers were captured in 2007 (83.08 YOY/hour, 6.55 inches), 2009 (198.00 YOY/hour, 6.02 inches), 2011 (124.00 YOY/hour, 6.03 inches) and 2013 (49.66 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. YOY Walleye numbers were low (6.00 YOY/hour, 6.69 inches average size) in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye natural reproduction occurs periodically in Camp. Potential Walleye spawning sites with suitable gravel/rubble substrates include a south shore area adjacent to a high clay bank and the gravel road/parking lot when periodic flooding occurs during the spring.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2015 (28.00 fish/gillnet), but below the Camp historical average (44.87 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.14 pounds and 6.7 inches) from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow. No Yellow Perch over 8.5 inches were captured in the 2015 survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured or absent in the 2015 survey nets included low numbers of White Sucker (0.67 fish/gillnet), Black Bullhead (0.33 fish/gillnet) and no Common Carp. Historical average catch rates were 1.98 White Sucker/gillnet, 8.34 Black Bullhead/trapnet and 0.00 Common Carp/gillnet for Camp Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking Walleye as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2019. YOY Walleye will be surveyed by fall night electrofishing in 2017. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer assessment of the fish population was conducted on Camp Lake in June of 2001. Camp is a small lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity is variable in Camp. Water clarity was poor during the 2001 assessment. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during recent years. Local officials constructed an outlet several years ago to alleviate high water conditions in Camp, but subsequent flooding downstream precluded any further use of the outlet. Aquatic vegetation is abundant within the lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number of residential homes. A large turkey barn along the southwest shore attracts large numbers of gulls that use Camp Lake. Birds act as an intermediate host for a fish parasite called neascus (black spot) that is prevalent in several fish species (northern pike, yellow perch, walleye) in Camp Lake. Fish eating birds such as white pelicans and double crested cormorants were also numerous on Camp. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2001 (3.3 fish/gillnet), but slightly above the historical average (2.4 fish/gillnet). Black crappie numbers were abundant in the previous survey (6.7 fish/gillnet in 1998). The 2001 black crappie average size was small (0.07 lbs. and 5.2 inches from gillnets). The largest black crappie in the 2001 assessment was 9.3 inches.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2001 (19.3 fish/trapnet), but slightly above the historical average (15.7 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.09 lbs. and 4.5 inches from trapnets). Quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill in the 2001 assessment (6.6 fish/trapnet) were moderately abundant in Camp. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 assessment was 8.9 inches.Largemouth bass numbers were high in previous spring electrofishing surveys (114.0 fish/hour and 0.99 lbs. average weight in 1993, 272.0 fish/hour and 0.45 lbs. average weight in 1992) in Camp. We were unable to attempt spring electrofishing surveys of largemouth bass during 2001 and 1998 in Camp because the access was partially flooded or blocked by a rock dike. Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2001 (16.0 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (7.0 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was small (2.18 lbs. and 21.4 inches from gillnets). Growth rates for northern pike were below average in Camp compared to Spicer Area lakes. Approximately 62% of the northern pike captured in 2001 were young fish hatched from 1998. Approximately 79% of the northern pike captured in the 2001 summer assessment were infected with a black spot parasite called neascus, which is harmless to humans if the fish is cooked properly before eaten. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 assessment was 34.3 inches.Walleye numbers were abundant in 2001 (10.7 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (6.7 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.69 lbs. and 16.0 inches from gillnets). Growth rates were generally above average for walleye in Camp compared to Spicer Area lakes. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 1990 (4,235 yearlings), 1992 (1,584 fingerlings, 49 lbs.), and 2001 (480 fingerlings and 135 yearlings, as part of a DNR walleye stocking research study). It appears that sufficient walleye numbers have been produced naturally combined with supplemental stocking to provide a viable walleye population in Camp. Approximately 59% of the walleye captured in the 2001 summer assessment were infected with the black spot parasite, neascus. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 assessment was 27.6 inches.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2001 (2.7 fish/gillnet) and the lowest recorded value. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 61.1 fish/gillnet. The 2001 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 lbs. and 6.1 inches from gillnets). Approximately 30% of the yellow perch captured in the 2001 summer assessment were infected with the black spot parasite, neascus.Other notable fish species captured in the 2001 summer assessment included abundant numbers of white sucker (6.3 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of black bullhead (0.3 fish/gillnet. Historical average catch rates were 1.9 fish/gillnet for white sucker and 13.5 fish/gillnet for black bullhead. Current fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. Largemouth bass will be surveyed by electrofishing in the 2002 spring. Also, walleye yearlings will be sampled by spring electrofishing in 2002 for a DNR walleye stocking research study. The entire Camp Lake fishery will be surveyed again in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer population assessment of the fish population was conducted on Camp Lake in July of 2006. Camp is a small (203 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Swift County. Camp is a popular fishing lake for local residents. Water quality and clarity is variable in Camp. Water clarity was fair (secchi=4.5 feet) during the 2006 assessment. High water conditions have resulted in flooding of the public access, excess erosion of the shorelines, and poor water quality due to runoff in Camp during previous years. Aquatic vegetation (pondweeds, duckweeds, water moss, bulrush, coontail, northern milfoil, filamentous algae) is abundant within the lake. The immediate watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, turkey barns, feedlots, grasslands, and minimal number of residential homes. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Camp for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. Camp Lake is currently a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2006 (8.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 3.94 fish/gillnet. The 2006 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 5.88 inches from gillnets). The black crappie historical average weight is 0.16 pounds from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in Camp were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised the majority of the 2006 assessment black crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2006 (19.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 21.20 fish/trapnet. The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.46 inches from trapnets). The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2006. The 2004 spring electrofishing survey largemouth bass catch rate (66.86 fish/hour) was high compared to the Spicer area historical average (47.22 fish/hour. Previous spring electrofishing surveys of largemouth bass documented high numbers (113.89 fish/hour and 0.99 pounds average weight in 1993, 272.00 fish/hour and 0.45 pounds average weight in 1992) in Camp. The largemouth bass average weight and length were 2.11 pounds and 15.00 inches from the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average size is 1.18 pounds and 11.79 inches from spring electrofishing in Camp.  <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2006 (10.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.71 fish/gillnet. The 2006 northern pike average size was moderate (2.87 pounds and 23.37 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 3.00 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2006 (1.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 5.80 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (2.20 pounds and 16.38 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight is 2.09 pounds from gillnets. Recent walleye stockings occurred in 1990 (4,235 yearlings, 55 pounds), 1992 (1,584 fingerlings, 49 pounds), 2001 (480 fingerlings, 24 pounds and 135 yearlings, 27 pounds), 2003 (165 yearlings, 50 pounds), and 2005 (3,002 fingerlings, 194 pounds). The 2001, 2003, and 2005 stockings were part of the DNR walleye stocking research study.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2006 (29.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 53.40 fish/gillnet. The 2006 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.13 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured in the 2006 summer assessment included moderate numbers of white sucker (1.75 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of black bullhead (0.25 fish/gillnet). Historical average catch rates were 2.15 fish/gillnet for white sucker and 10.81 fish/gillnet for black bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Camp include protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fingerlings as warranted. All fish species in Camp Lake will be surveyed again in the summer of 2008. <br> \n</p>",
