                "narrative": "<p>Jackpine Lake, a 141-acre lake with a maximum depth of 6 feet, is located in northern Cass County about 4 miles west of Hackensack.  The lake has been known to experience periodic winterkills, but an outlet on the southeast corner allows fish to repopulate the lake following a winterkill.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Jackpine Lake is in Lake Class 37.  Lakes in this classification can be summarized as small circular lakes with turbid, shallow waters.     There is a county-owned earthen boat ramp at the north end of Jackpine Lake off of County Road 40.  Bluegill and northern pike are popular with anglers on Jackpine Lake, and lakes that receive periodic winterkill have a tendency to have a higher percentage of larger fish.  Other fish species present that provide angling opportunities are black crappie, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch.         Bluegill and northern pike abundances in 2000 were higher than other Lake Class 37 lakes.  The majority of the bluegill sampled in 2000 were between 6 to 8 inches.  About half of the northern pike sampled were greater than 21 inches.      There has been limited development on Jackpine Lake.  In 1990, there were six lake homes, and about half of the shoreline is administered by Cass County.  Shoreline areas (on the land and into the shallow water) provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.       Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Only if lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.     </p>",
