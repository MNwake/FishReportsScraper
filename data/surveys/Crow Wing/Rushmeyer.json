                "narrative": "<p>Rushmeyer (Blue) is a small (37 acres), relatively shallow (26 ft. max. depth) lake near the eastern border of Crow Wing County.  It is a moderately hardwater lake with good phosphorus fertility.  Lake water is somewhat below average in clarity (5-6 ft. secchi disc readings) for the area and is somewhat bog stained as well.  Shallow water (4 ft. and less) soils are predominantly muck and detritus (undecomposed plant/animal material).  Some areas of sand, gravel and silt are also present.  These sand-gravel areas provide important spawning habitat for bass and sunfish species (including crappies), especially when bulrushes are also present.  The variety of submerged plants provide important feeding areas for some fish, while providing protective cover for other fish species.Black bullheads were found to be very abundant in the 1993 initial lake survey.  Northern pike and black crappies were also found in high numbers.  Bluegills, largemouth bass and pumpkinseeds were all present in low numbers in 1993.  This distribution of fish species suggests that low winter oxygen conditions have occurred in the past.  Such conditions favor species like black bullheads and northern pike which can tolerate fairly low oxygen levels, over species like bluegills and pumpkinseeds which need higher levels of oxygen to thrive.</p>",
