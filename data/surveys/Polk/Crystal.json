There are just two homes near the lake's shoreline.  Both located along the northwest shore. <br> \n <br> \nEcologically, the lake is best suited for northern pike, bass, and panfish.  These are all present in Crystal Lake, but excluding bluegills, the most abundant species in experimental nets was walleye.  Walleyes averaged a very nice 18.7 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Most were attributed to a single year class, the 2004. <br> \n <br> \nOther species (including black crappie and bluegill) tended to be small and young.  Populations of these species showed signs of overfishing, even though access is limited.  It is possible, however, that larger and older fish were located in deeper water at the time where they would not be vulnerable to capture in trap nets.</p>",
