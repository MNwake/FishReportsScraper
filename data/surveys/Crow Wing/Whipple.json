                "narrative": "<p>Whipple Lake is a 410 acre lake located in the city of Baxter in Crow Wing County.  Whipple consists of three basins Upper, Middle and Lower.    Upper and Lower are shallow and heavily vegetated, while Middle Whipple reaches depths of 25'.  This survey took place on Middle Whipple.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 14'.  Development is moderate around the shoreline.  One camp is located on the southwest shoreline.  A large public beach is located on the west side, along with a public watercraft access.  A 2003 aquatic vegetation survey found a diverse plant community, with 33 species present.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nBass are the lake's premier species.  A spring electrofishing survey sampled largemouth bass at a rate of 72.2/ hr.  Some nice bass are present with an average length of 13.2 inches.  Largemouth bass over 12\" made up 60% of the catch, and bass over 15\" made up 32%. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was above average compared to similar lakes at 11.0/net.  This was the highest catch to date.  Average size was a little small at 18.4\" and 1.5 lbs.  Northern pike at least 24\" made up only 9% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were average in gillnets (3.0/net), and in trapnets (2.3/net).  For both gears 19% of crappies were at least 8\" in length.  The 2011 year class made up 69% of the catch and were roughly 7-8\" at the time of the survey.  Bluegills were caught is average numbers at 14.7/ trapnet.  Average length was 5.5\", with 15% at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Whipple Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Some nice fish are present, with an average length of 13.9 inches and fish up to 19.9 inches sampled.  Largemouth Bass over 12\" made up 80% of the catch, and those over 15\" made up 36%. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were caught in average numbers (7.0/gill net) for this type of lake.  With only 14% of the fish within the 22-26\" protected slot, there are plenty of fish that can be harvested.  Most of those will have to be under the slot as only 14% were over 26\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were the lowest to date at 6.5/trap net, and size wasn't that impressive either.  Average length was 5.3\" and only 13% measured 7\" or longer.  Black Crappie numbers were considered high for this type of lake at 15.3/gill net.  Mean length was 6.9\" and 34% of the fish measured 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Whipple Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Middle Whipple Lake was conducted on July 8, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey will be considered when the biological health of Middle Whipple Lake is assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whipple is a 410 acre lake located in the City of Baxter.  It is divided into three separate basins:  Upper, Middle, and Lower Whipple.  The survey was completed on Middle Whipple, which is approximately 150 acres.  The other two basins are shallow and choked with weeds.  The maximum depth is 25 feet.  A public access is on the east shore, south of the public beach.  The lake is moderately developed with 36 homes/cabins, a camp with 6 cabins, and a public swimming beach.  Shallow water substrate is predominately sand.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 33 species present: the most common being the submerged species coontail.  These plants are extremely important to maintaining a healthy aquatic environment.  Emergent plants, such as waterlilies and bulrush, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and they provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The exotic plant purple loosestrife is also present on Whipple.  Lake owners should take measures to prevent this species from being spread to other lakes.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers when compared to similar lakes (10.8/gill net).  The 1999 and 2000 year classes represented 77% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 17.4\" to 22.5\".  Average length and weight were 20.2\" and 1.8 lbs. with 12% of the fish being 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass were sampled in both trap nets and gill nets at average rates (0.7/trap net and 1.0/gill net).  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 74.0/hr.  The average length of these fish was 13.4\" and 68% were 12\" or larger.  Growth was relatively slow, with the 1995 and 1999 year classes each contributing 24% of the catch.Bluegill were caught in average numbers at the rate of 22.8/trap net.  Average length of these fish was 5.9\" and 23% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Over half of these fish (57%) were from the 1999 year class.  Black crappie numbers declined from 4.5/trap net in 1988, to 0.2/trap net.  Yellow perch, which were captured at the rate of 57.0/gill net, were not sampled in the 2003 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey including nearshore, trap net, and gill net sampling was completed during the week of  June 27th, 2022 in Whipple Lake by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. <br> \nNearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 10 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) and zero species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nSix trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill (55%) and Yellow Bullhead (22%) comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, and Yellow Bullhead (33%), Bluegill (22%), and Northern Pike (19%) comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Black Bullheads sampled per net was more than double the 75th quartile for similar lake class 32 lakes. The number of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullheads sampled per net were all above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 32 lakes. Conversely, the number of Yellow Perch sampled per net were at the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 32 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nFour gill nets were set in open water locations. Black Bullhead (26%), Yellow Bullhead (22%), and Northern Pike (24%) comprised a majority of the gill net catch by number, and Northern Pike (52%), Yellow Bullhead (16%), and Black Bullhead (16%) comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Black Bullheads sampled per net was more than five times the 75th quartile for similar lake class 32 lakes. The number of Black Crappies and Northern Pike sampled per net were more than double the 75th quartile for similar lake class 32 lakes. The number of Largemouth Bass sampled per net was above the 75% quartile, and number of Yellow Bullheads sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 32 lakes. Conversely, the number of Yellow Perch sampled per net were at the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 32 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish data collected during the June 27th, 2022 nearshore, trap net, and gill net surveys were combined to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Whipple Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
