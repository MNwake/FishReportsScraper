Yellow Perch catch in gill nets was only 1/3 the area average, but quarter inch mesh trap nets indicate high reproduction. Walleye catch in gill nets was 75% of the area average, and fish were in good condition. These fish are likely migrants from Crooked Lake, which receives fry stocking and some fingerling stocking on a regular basis. It is unknown whether Walleye reproduce in Artlip or its inlet, but it is unlikely. Smallmouth Bass present most likely  are also migrants from Crooked Lake.</p>",
