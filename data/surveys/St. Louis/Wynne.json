                "narrative": "<p>Wynne Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have a low amount of biologically productive shallow shoreline area, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Wynne Lake has even less shallow shoreline area and has less clear water (due to bog-stain) than most of the lakes in this lake class.   <br> \n <br> \nWynne Lake was thermally stratified on 08/07/2006 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more that 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 21 feet, where the temperature was 50 F.  The Embarrass River flows through Wynne Lake with average flows of 100-500 cubic feet per second in midsummer, and the amount of flow in a given summer probably affects the thermal stratification.  Fish may move between Wynne and Sabin Lake (upstream) through a narrows that is navigable by boat except in very low flow periods.  There are no lakes on the Embarrass River upstream of Sabin Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Wynne Lake consist mostly of gravel, rubble, sand, and boulder.  Due to the riverine nature of Wynne Lake, the shoreline drops off quite quickly to deep water in much of the lake.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 feet; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies and largeleaf pondweed.   <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2006 fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnets and nine trapnets.  Seven previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1973, used 3-9 gillnets and 2-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining for small and young-of-year fish was done in 1955, 1959, 1971-72, and 1996.   <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2006 of 10.5 fish/net (8.4 lb/net) was lower than normal (in the first quartile) for Lake Class 5, but was similar to the median total catch of fish in all investigations on Wynne Lake of 9.3 fish/net (7.5 lb/net).  Lake Class 5 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  The reasons for the historically low fish catches in Wynne Lake are not known, except that other \"flowage\" type lakes in the area, such as Pike River Flowage and Garden Lake have had similarly poor fish catches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2006 of 11.6 fish/net (7.8 lb/net) was low, but was similar to the median trapnet catch in all investigations on Wynne Lake of 11.2 fish/net (7.6 lb/net). <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in Wynne Lake in 2006 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie.  Perch catches in gillnets and trapnets on Wynne Lake have historically been low, but good numbers of young-of-year were collected in shoreline seines in previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2006 (2.7/gillnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class, but were similar to the median walleye catch of 2.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2006 averaged 14.4 inches (1.4 lb), which was larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was larger than the average walleye size of 12.3 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 23.6 inches.  Walleye from nine year-classes were captured in 2006, and natural reproduction was fairly even from year-to-year.  Walleye growth was very slow (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (1.5/gillnet) were lower than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class, and were similar to the median pike catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2006 averaged 18.1 inches (1.4 lb), which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class and was smaller than the average pike size of 19.7 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike was 22.6 inches.  Pike growth was normal (in the second or third quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2006 (2.6/trapnet) were lower than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class, and were similar to the median bluegill catch of 2.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2006 averaged 7.5 inches (0.4 lb), which was larger than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and was larger than the average bluegill size of 7.0 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill was 8.9 inches.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2006 (1.6/trapnet) were somewhat lower than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class and were lower than the median crappie catch of 2.5/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2006 averaged 10.6 inches (0.7 lb), which was larger than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and was larger than the average crappie size of 7.5 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie was 12.5 inches.  Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2006 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Some of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wynne Lake is a 278 acre lake located just northwest of the city of Biwabik.  It is accessed by a ramp on the north end of the lake.  It has a maximum depth of 52 feet and dark brown water.  in August 2016, oxygen levels were adequate for fish to a depth of 27 feet.  \n\nWynne Lake is relatively developed with year round and seasonal homes although many are set back from the lake shore with good natural riparian buffers.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are boulder/rubble, sand and gravel.  Due to the riverine nature of Wynne Lake, the shoreline drops off quite quickly to deep water in much of the lake.  Vegetation is fairly sparse and only grows in some of the shallowest areas of a few bays.  The Embarrass River enters the lake on the north end and empties out the southwest corner.  Fish may move between Wynne and Sabin Lake (upstream) through a narrows that is navigable by boat except in low flow periods.  \n \nThis standard survey consisted of gillnet and trapnet sets.  This is the ninth fisheries investigation on Wynne Lake, the first dates back to 1973.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were walleye, cisco, white sucker, northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, and black crappie. Additional fish species sampled in trap nets were bluegill, yellow bullhead, and shorthead redhorse.  \n\nDuring the 2016 survey, 19 walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.1 fish/net, which was low compared to other similar lakes but average for Wynne Lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 27 inches with an average just shy of 12 inches.  The average weight per fish was 1 pound.  Walleye growth was extremely slow compared to other lakes in the area.  The average four year old walleye was just under 12 inches long.  Ages ranged from 1 to 14 but nearly 90% of the fish were four years old or younger. \nWalleye have not been stocked in Wynne Lake since 1989.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 0.7 fish/net which was tied for the lowest on record for the lake.  Lengths ranged from 18 to 22 inches with an average of 20 inches.  The average weight was just under two pounds.\n\nFour black crappie were sampled, two in gill nets and two in trap nets.  Lengths from all four fish ranged from to 5 to 12 inches.  Three of the fish were larger than 9.5 inches.  \n\nSeven bluegill were sampled for a trapnet catch rate of 0.8 fish/net which was low compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes were good however, with a range from just under 7 to just over 8 inches.  The average weight was nearly a half a pound.    \n\nCisco numbers in 2016 (1.1 fish/gill net) were on par with most of the previous surveys.  Fish were small with an average weight of 1/10 of a pound and lengths ranging from 6 to 11 inches.  \n\nOther species sampled but in low numbers were yellow perch, white sucker, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and yellow bullhead.\n\nSome yellow perch were infested with yellow grub, but all the rest of the fish species appeared relatively clean.  \n\nThirteen Rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), an invasive species, were sampled for the first time in Wynne Lake.  \n</p>",

Sizes of cisco, northern pike, and walleye are below average for the area, while black crappie sizes are above average. Black crappie recruitment is good, while recruitment of bluegill sunfish and walleye is low. Growth of bluegill sunfish and black crappie is good by area standards, while walleye growth is slow.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wynne Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average sized, have a low amount of biologically productive shallow shoreline area, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.   Wynne Lake is typical of lakes in this class, except that it has even less shallow shoreline area than normal for this lake class, has water that is less clear, and has a more irregular shoreline shape.Wynne Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) below about 28 ft in some years and below about 45 ft in other years.  The water temperature at the depth where oxygen declines to below 2 ppm is usually in the 40's F.  The Embarrass River flows through Wynne Lake with large flows in most summers; the amount of flow probably affects the depth of thermal stratification.  Fish may move between Wynne Lake and Sabin Lake (upstream) through a narrows that is navigable by boat except for very low water periods.  There are no lakes upstream of Sabin Lake.Shallow water bottom substrates in Wynne Lake consist mostly of gravel, rubble, sand, and boulder.  Aquatic plant growth is sparse, the most common plants are shoreline grasses, yellow waterlilies, and pondweeds.  Aquatic plants grow to a maximum depth of 5 ft.Fish sampling in the 1996 survey consisted of trapnets, gillnets, and shoreline seines.  Six previous gillnet and trapnet assessments have been done in Wynne Lake, dating back to 1973.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1996 (all species combined) of 7 fish/net (8 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class, but was similar to most previous gillnet catches in this lake.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of fish numbers and weight.  The reason for the low catches in Wynne Lake is not known, except that some other \"flowage\" type lakes in the area that have large rivers flowing through them have had similarly poor catches.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1996 of 21 fish/net (22 lb/net) was higher than in most previous trapnettings, due to an increase in the numbers of bluegill and white sucker.Fish populations in Wynne Lake in 1996 were dominated by white sucker, followed by northern pike, bluegill, and walleye.  Also present in 1996 were low numbers of black crappie, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, yellow perch, and various native minnows including shiners, darters, and dace.  Cisco were captured in most previous nettings, but were not observed in 1996.  Bullheads, caught in a few previous nettings, were also not caught in 1996.  Fair numbers of young-of-year perch and black crappie were caught in the shoreline seine in 1996, but few adults of these species were caught in the gillnets or trapnets.White sucker numbers numbers in the gillnets in 1996 were low, but similar to previous gillnet catches.  Sucker numbers in the trapnets, however, were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than in previous trapnet catches.  The reason for the increase in trapnet catch of suckers in 1996 is not known.Northern pike numbers in the gillnets in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to the long term average catch of 1.9/gillnet in this lake.  Pike sizes in 1996 (as in previous net catches) were smaller than normal, averaging 18\" in the gillnets and 16\" in the trapnets.  The largest pike captured in 1996 was 23\".  Pike growth (16\" at age three, 19\" at age four) was slower than normal for the area.Bluegill numbers in the trapnets in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class, but were higher than the long term average catch of 2.0/trapnet in this lake.  Fair numbers of young-of-year bluegill were caught in shoreline seining.  Bluegill sizes in the trapnets were good, averaging 8\"; the largest was 9.3\".  Bluegill growth (7.2\" at age five; 7.9\" at age six) was faster than normal for the area.Walleye numbers in the gillnets in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to the long term average catch of 2.2/gillnet in this lake.  Walleye sizes were small, averaging only 11\".  Walleye sizes were also small in most previous gillnet catches, although a few nettings produced average sizes of 12-15\".  The largest walleye caught in 1996 was 19.4\".  Most walleye were ages one and two; few walleye were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Walleye growth was normal for young fish, but was slower than normal for older fish.</p>",
