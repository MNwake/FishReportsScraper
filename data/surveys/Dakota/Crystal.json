                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a class 34 lake located in Dakota County with a surface area of 288 acres and 208 acres of littoral zone (72.1%). The lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and mean depth of 10 feet. The total watershed area for Crystal Lake is 3,667 acres. The secchi depth trend over the past 10 years is increasing and is meeting the MPCA water quality standard of 1.4 meters. Likewise, the 10 year trend for total phosphorus concentration is declining (improving) in Crystal Lake, exceeding the MPCA standard for deep lakes of 40ug/L. Chlorophyll-a concentrations also have been improving and were at the MPCA standard for deep lakes in 2016 (14ug/L). Fisheries management dates back to as early as 1908 when fish stocking was taking place. The first lake survey on record occurred in 1957.\n\nThe 2017 survey included electrofishing and trap netting. The Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch rate of 232 fish per hour is extremely high and signifcantly greater than the 2016 catch rate of 87 fish per hour. These catch rates are indicitive of a very high density bass population. Nearly one-third of the bass sampled measured over 12 inches long and several fish were over 18 inches in length. The Largemouth Bass population is very robust and meeting management goals.\n\nBluegill and Black Crappie were sampled in the trap nets in the normal range from class 34 lakes. Black Crappie measured up to 11.3 inches long while the largest Bluegill measured 7.4 inches. The 2017 survey did find that Bluegill density was lower than previous surveys and there was a shift in the size structure toward larger fish. The high numbers of Largemouth Bass may be contributing to fewer, but larger, Bluegill Sunfish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a class 34 lake located in Dakota County with a surface area of 288 acres. The lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and mean depth of 10 feet. The fishery is primarily managed for Tiger (Hybrid) Muskellunge and Largemouth Bass with Walleye as a secondary management species. Tiger Muskellunge are stocked at a rate of 1.5 fingerlings per acre every other year. Walleye are stocked, when surplus fingerlings are available, at a rate of 0.65 pounds per littoral acre. They were first stocked in 2018 and this survey as well as the previous survey conducted in 2021 were conducted with gill nets primarily to assess the success of recent stocking. Trap nets were also set to sample near-shore fish in order to inform an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) survey. <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 1.75 fish per gill net. This is below average for the lake class and slightly lower than the previous catch rate of 2.2 fish per gill net. Of the seven fish sampled, six were 4 years old and one was 1 year old. Those 4 year old fish ranged from 16 to 20 inches long indicating good growth but perhaps low recruitment to the fishery from stocking. <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 2.5 fish per gill net. This is lower than average for the lake class but similar to the last couple of surveys. Size appears to be improving over the last couple of decades with fish sampled during this survey averaging 26 inches in length and ranging up to 36.7 inches long. Mean size substantially exceeds the 75th percentile for the lake class. <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 4.75 fish per net. This is low relative to the lake class but typical considering the history of the lake. Size was unimpressive with a mean length of six inches and no fish exceeding 10 inches.  <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 1.5 fish per net. This much lower than average for the lake class but similar to historical catch rates. Fish ranged from 4.2 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches in length. Slightly larger fish were sampled by gill net with the largest individual measuring 12.2 inches.  <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 30.25 fish per trap net. This is higher than average for the lake class but typical relative to the fairly high variability of catch rates in previous surveys. Fish size was unremarkable with a range of 3.2 to 7.5 inches and a mean length of 6 inches.  <br> \nWhile not a target of this study due to unreliable sampling of them by these methods, four Tiger Musky were captured. Three were fairly small at about 15 inches in length and one measured 33.7 inches. Other species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake presently is receiving very little management other than regular monitoring of the fish population through scheduled surveys and assessments. The only fish species currently being stocked is Hybrid Muskie (TME). Hybrid Muskie management began in 1984 and stocking is conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 1.0 fingerlings/surface-acre (288 fish). No TME were captured in trap nets during this assessment. Only 3 Northern Pike (NOP) were captured in the trap net sample and they averaged 24.96 inches and 3.22 pounds. Yellow Perch (YEP) are present but only one individual was captured by trap nets. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled above the median level for abundance , but below the median level for mean weight, in trap nets. The average BLC captured was 7.63 inches in length and 0.27 pounds. Approximately 13.0 percent of all BLC sampled measured 8.0 inches or longer with the largest individual captured measuring 12.64 inches. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled above the third quartile level for abundance in trap nets and below the first quartile level for mean weight. The average size of BLG in the trap net sample was 5.32 inches in length and 0.11 pounds. Only 2.6 percent of all BLG sampled measured 7.0 inches or longer, with the largest individual captured measuring 9.41 inches in length. Growth rates for BLG and BLC were found to be near average. Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish are also very common in the lake with some respectable sized individuals present. Largemouth Bass (LMB) also appear to have a significant presence in this lake as they were sampled near the median level for abundance in trap nets. The average size LMB sampled was 17.34 inches long and 3.23 pounds. While no electrofishing was conducted during this assessment, local anglers report some quality LMB fishing in this lake.</p>",

Less than one-fifth of these fish were of acceptable size to anglers.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed were also abundant with less than a third of acceptable size to anglers.  Black crappie numbers were average for this type of lake with less than a tenth of good size.  Northern pike were the most abundant predator species with a fifth of the fish of good size.  Six tiger muskellunge were sampled, all below the minimum legal size of 40 inches.  Largemouth bass appear to be low in number although no electrofishing was done to assess their status.  Yellow, black, and brown bullhead were captured in low numbers and were of good average size.  Yellow perch, golden shiner and white sucker were present in low numbers.</p>",

The average length sampled was only 4.79 inches. Less than 3% were larger than 6 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish were also abundant when compared to similar lakes. Their average size was 5.37 inches in length. Black crappies were found in the lowest numbers in 30 years. The average length sampled was approximately 7.5 inches. Northern pike were found in average to low abundance. The average size was about 25.5 inches, which is above the average for the Twin Cities metro area. Largemouth bass were found in good abundance and size. Individuals exceeding 18 inches in length were sampled along with one over 20 inches. Black bullhead and yellow bullhead were each sampled in average abundance during this survey. The average size sampled was smaller than what many anglers prefer. One sauger was captured in the gill nets. This species is not endemic to Crystal lake and was most likely a result of an illegal stocking by a private individual.      </p>",

Fisheries management has been limited to lake surveys, population assessments, and stocking of tiger muskellunge since 1984.Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish made up over half the fish sampled in this assessment.  Most sunfish were small, with less than 10% over 7 inches long.Black crappie were present in average numbers.  All fish captured were under 10 inches long.Northern pike were abundant, captured at the second highest level ever.  While most were small, a few were over 30 inches long.  One tiger muskie was captured, measuring 33.74 inches long.  It was from the 1996 stocking.Largemouth bass were abundant, with fish from age 1-8 present.  Less than half were over 12 inches long, and less than one-fifth were over 16 inches long.Black and yellow bullhead were present in average numbers with over half at least 10 inches long.  Yellow perch were average in abundance with few over 8 inches long.A few white sucker, one walleye, one golden shiner, and one shortnose gar were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Crystal Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 7-9 August 2023.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with two sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 7-9 August 2023 by IBI Program Staff.  Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill and Tiger Muskellunge comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was about the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 34 lakes and the average length was 5.5 inches, with 5% over 7 inches.  The number of Black Crappie sampled per net was also about the 50% quartile for Lake Class 34 lakes and the average length was 8.0 inches with 8% (2 out of 24) over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Crystal Lake in in summer 2023 resulting in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Crystal Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located 2 miles west of Apple Valley, MN, Crystal Lake is a 289-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet. A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by IBI Program Staff on Crystal Lake on 4 August 2015 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, three sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and 4 were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented seining at three stations. Backpack electrofishing was done on foot along the shoreline at eight sites and site conditions at 2 other stations required electrofishing from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 9 species of fish. None of the species captured are intolerant of disturbance. The species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black bullhead, Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Spotfin Shiner, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. Nearshore catches are used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 11 - 14 July 2005, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Crystal Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA review of potential stressors found watershed (87% disturbed land cover), riparian (Score the Shore survey score: 62/100; approximately 9 residential docks per kilometer), and in-lake habitat characteristics at levels near those thought to impact the fish community.  Based on this information we also recommend that Crystal Lake be recognized as \"Vulnerable\" to future impairment with additional watershed and/or shoreline disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Crystal Lake is located in the Lower Minnesota River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a class 34 lake located in Dakota County with a surface area of 288 acres (208 acres of littoral zone; 72.1%). The lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and mean depth of 10 feet. The secchi depth trend over the past 10 years is increasing and is meeting the MPCA water quality standard of 4.6 feet. The fishery is primarily managed for Tiger (Hybrid) Muskellunge and Largemouth Bass. Tiger Muskellunge are stocked at a rate of 1.5 fingerlings per acre every other year. Walleye are managed as a secondary species with surplus fingerling stocked at a rate of 0.65 pounds per littoral acre when available. They were first stocked in 2018 and this survey was conducted with gill nets in June 2021 primarily to assess the success of that stocking. The previous survey conducted with gill nets occurred in 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 2.2 fish per net. This is below average for similar lakes but the population is currently establishing itself and at the highest rate sampled in the history of the lake. Fish size was also slightly below average with a mean length of 15.6 inches. Fish ranged in from 11 to 20.6 inches in length. Aged fish were evenly split into a group of 2 year olds which averaged approximately 12 inches and 5 year olds which averaged approximately 19 inches. More time and additional stockings will be needed in order for a more mature population structure to develop. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 3 fish per net which is below average but the same as the previous survey. Fish size was slightly smaller than the previous survey with a mean length of 23.8 inches. The largest individual was 33.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not reliably sampled by gill nets but the data gathered may support more qualitative observations. Their catch rate in this survey was 2.4 fish per net which is higher than average for similar lakes and the highest rate for gill nets in the history of the lake. Size was with a mean length of 11.6 inches. The largest fish measured was 16 inches long. Ages from 2 to 9 were represented with one individual being 14 years old. This indicates that recruitment is consistent but growth is likely slow.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 11.6 fish per net which is higher than average. Only the 1990 survey had a higher catch rate. Size was typical with a mean length of 7.7 inches. Sizes were well distributed up to 9 inches with one larger individual captured at 11.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a relatively low rate of 4.8 fish per net. This was approximately one third of the catch in the previous two surveys. Size was typical with a mean length of 7 inches and a maximum of 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFour Tiger (Hybrid) Muskellunge were sampled during the survey. They are not reliably sampled by these methods but it does offer a qualitative note. Fish ranged from 20 to 26 inches. Other species sampled in the survey were: Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
