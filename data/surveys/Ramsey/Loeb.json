                "narrative": "<p>Status of the fishery\n\nLoeb Lake is a small Lake in Marydale Park in St. Paul. There is on-street parking, a walking path around the lake, a playground, and picnic tables/grills. The lake is rather deep for its size, with a maximum depth of 28 feet. The water is clear and supports abundant vegetation. Shore-fishing access is good along the east shore where there is a fishing pier and a quick drop-off. The rest of the lake is difficult for angling due to brushy shoreline and shallow water near shore. An aeration system operates after ice formation to prevent winterkill of fish and ice anglers need to be cautious. The 2014 summer dissolved oxygen profile indicated fish may be limited to areas of the lake that are 7' deep and less due to lake stratification and anoxia below the thermocline. \n\nThis netting assessment found low to moderate abundance of most species. Bluegill Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were the most common species, but they were only moderately abundant for lakes such as Loeb. Lengths ranged from 3 to 6 inches for all \"sunfish\", with average length being 4.35 inches. Black Crappie abundance was low, and the largest fish sampled was just over 8 inches. Black Crappie size was better than average for Loeb lake. Black Bullhead were sampled in low numbers, with just one large 11 inch fish sampled. Largemouth Bass are present in numbers above average for Loeb Lake but growth was poor and the size was small, less than 10 inches. Walleye fingerlings are stocked regularly and abundance has been high in the past, however the current abundance is moderate.  The average size of Walleye sampled was small but these fish were only one year old at the time of this survey. Channel Catfish have previously been stocked and may be present in low numbers, but none were sampled in 2014. \n</p>",

The bulk of the fish population, with the exception of bullheads, is temporary, consisting primarily of stocked panfish.  The high fishing pressure and winterkill nature prevent formation of permanent populations.  The only species found to exhibit a permanent population in this netting was the brown bullhead.  It is anticipated that low winter oxygen levels will eliminate all but the bullheads during the next severe winter.</p>",

Most fish were small in size and three years old or less.  Black crappie were also present in moderate numbers, with most fish small in size.  Walleye were the most abundant predator species present, with all fish from the 1997 fry stocking, measuring 16-20 inches long.  A few largemouth bass, northern pike, black bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, and channel catfish were also present.</p>",

None of the catchable size stocked crappies were sampled.The largemouth bass sampled was an age III+ which showed above average growth rate.  Some limited northern pike and centrarchid reproduction apparently takes place, although 1/4\" trapnetting sampled no young of the year fish of any species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loeb Lake is a small Lake in Marydale Park in St. Paul.  There is on-street parking, a walking path around the lake, a playground, and picnic tables/grills.  The lake is rather deep for its size, with a maximum depth of 28 feet.  The water is clear and supports abundant vegetation.  Shore-fishing access is good along the east shore where there is a fishing pier and a quick drop-off.  The rest of the lake is difficult for angling due to brushy shoreline and shallow, weedy water near shore.  An aeration system prevents winterkill of fish.  Ice anglers need to be cautious.  The lake is known to have poor ice conditions. <br> \n <br> \nThis netting assessment found low abundance of most species.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were the most common species, but they were only moderately abundant.  Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 7 inches, with average length just under 6 inches.  Black crappie abundance was low, and the largest fish sampled was just under 7 inches.  Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers, but were large, with lengths ranging from 9 to 11 inches.  Largemouth bass and northern pike are present in low numbers.  Only juvenile bass from 3.5 to 6.5 inches were sampled.  The one northern pike sampled was large - 31 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked regularly and abundance has been high in the past, but current abundance is low.  No walleye were sampled in this assessment.  Channel catfish have previously been stocked and may be present in low numbers, but none were sampled. <br> \n</p>",
