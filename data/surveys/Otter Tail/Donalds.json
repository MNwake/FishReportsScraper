                "narrative": "<p>     Donalds Lake is a 168-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County and within the city limits of Ottertail City, Minnesota.  The maximum depth is 43 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 14.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk reading have ranged from 6.0 to 15.0 feet. <br> \n     Moderate development exists around Donalds Lake.  The public access, which is located on the west shoreline, is owned by the city.  Parking is limited and access is gained by navigating off of a city street.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\t <br> \n     Recent lake survey data indicate that Donalds Lake has viable populations of Walleye, Northern Pike,  and Bluegill.  <br> \n     Walleye ranged in length from 9.2 to 21.0 inches with an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 2.2 pounds.   <br> \n      A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.2 to 34.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 22.5 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     The long-term trend has been an increase in Bluegill abundance.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-four percent  of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age. <br> \n    Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Donalds Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Fergus Falls Area Fisheries staff conducted a targeted nearshore survey of Donalds Lake on July 19th and 20th, 2021.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter), as well as one tolerant species (Fathead Minnow).  The nearshore survey data was combined with standard gill net and trap net survey data from the week of June 29, 2015 to calculate a Fish IBI (FIBI) score for assessing the aquatic life use of Donalds Lake.  FIBI Tool 4 was used for scoring, resulting in a FIBI score of 46, which exceeds the impairment threshold value (38) for this tool.  <br> \n     The high proportion of small benthic species sampled in the nearshore gears and the proportion of biomass in trap nets from insectivores most positively influenced the FIBI score.  The primary negative influences on the FIBI score are the presence of a species tolerant of stressors and the high number of species sampled that are vegetation dwellers.  <br> \n     Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redeye River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Despite the increase in abundance, growth of bluegill appears good. No bluegills greater than 8.0 inches were sampled. <br> \nLargemouth bass reproduction appears to be good as age classes 1+ through 3+ were sampled and age data from the 1988 spring electrofishing survey indicated consistent reproduction with age classes 2+ through 7+ sampled.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 0.3 per gill net lift in 1984 to 5.3 per net.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1983.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 2.3 per gill net lift, with an average weight of 2.1 lbs. Walleye abundance has declined steadily over time.

                "narrative": "<p>Donalds Lake is a 168-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County within the city limits of Ottertail City, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 43 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates are dominated by sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 15.0 feet in 2005 and has ranged from 6.0 to 14.9 in past surveys.  A public access is located along the west shoreline.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Twenty-eight homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Donalds Lake contains a good, well balanced population of largemouth bass.  A spring electrofishing assessment sampled many year classes of bass.  Bass ranged in length from 7.2 to 19.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.5 inches at four years of age.     The lake also contains a good population of northern pike. Northern pike numbers remained fairly stable since the last survey with some larger fish present.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18.0 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.6 pounds. Pike reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Pike attain an average length of 21.0 inches at four years of age.     Walleye abundance was down in this survey.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.9 to 26.9 inches in length with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Seven different year classes were represented.  The most dominant year class (1997) corresponds to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Walleye stocking appears to be maintaining a healthy walleye population in Donalds Lake.  Walleye management includes doubling the stocking rate on a biennial basis beginning in 2006.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.4 inches at four years of age.     Bluegill are very abundant; however, the average size is small.  Only 5% of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 5.6 inches at six years of age.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 34 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 64.0 (+/- 4.0), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was low (50-65). Approximately 94 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 62.0 (+/- 3.9), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 96.7 (+/- 3.3).

                "narrative": "<p>     Donalds Lake is a 168-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County and within the city limits of Ottertail City, Minnesota.  The surrounding watershed is primarily municipal.  The maximum depth of Donalds Lake is 43 feet; however, 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 15.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk reading have ranged from 6.0 to 15.0 feet. <br> \n     Moderate development exists around Donalds Lake.  A city owned concrete public access is located on the west shoreline.  Parking space is limited and access is gained by navigating off of a city street.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\t <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists; however, the size structure is poor.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.8 to 33.1 inches with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 0.9 pounds.   <br> \n     The Bluegill population is extremely abundant and has a high quality size structure.  Eighty-five percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 44% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.1 inches at eight years of age.  <br> \n     The Black Crappie population is moderately abundant with a quality size structure.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 8.5 to 12.2 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches.  Fifty percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Donalds Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Donalds Lake is a 168-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County within the city limits of Ottertail City, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 43 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates are dominated by sand and gravel.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, has ranged from 6.0 to 14.9 in past surveys.  A public access is located along the west shoreline.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Twenty-eight homes/cabins were located along the shoreline during the 2000 lake survey.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattail, and wild rice) are located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Donalds Lake contains populations of largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Although not many largemouth bass were sampled, they are likely present in good numbers.  A spring electrofishing assessment would provide better information on the bass population.  Bluegill and black crappie numbers are down from previous surveys, however, some larger fish are present.  Six percent of the bluegills were at least seven inches in length.       The lake also contains good populations of northern pike and walleye. Northern pike numbers remained stable since the last survey with some larger fish present.  Pike reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18.3 to 27.7 inches with an average length and weight of 21.3 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleye numbers increased in this survey.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.7 to 26.6 inches in length, representing nine different year classes.  The most dominant year class (1997) corresponds to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  These fish were between 12 and 14 inches in length and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye fingerling stocking appears to be maintaining a healthy walleye population in Donalds Lake.  Future walleye management calls for biennial fingerling stocking to continue.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Donalds Lake is a 168-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County and within the city limits of Ottertail City, Minnesota.  The maximum depth is 43 feet and 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 10.0 feet and has ranged from 6.0 to 15.0 feet in the past. <br> \n     Moderate development exists around Donalds Lake.  The public access, which is located on the west shoreline, is owned by the city.  Parking is limited and access is gained by navigating off of a city street.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is located in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\t <br> \n     Recent lake survey data indicate that Donalds Lake has good populations of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Size distribution for most of these species appears to be good.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Donalds Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.6 to 23.9 inches with an average  length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A moderate density northern pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 16.3 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that a well balanced largemouth bass population exists in Donalds Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 10.6 to 15.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.   Age and length data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass reach an average length of 11.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessment indicates that bluegills are very abundant, but the average size is small.  Only three percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 5.4 inches at six years of age. <br> \n    Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Donalds Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
