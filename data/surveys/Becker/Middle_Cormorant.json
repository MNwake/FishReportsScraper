The northern pike growth rate is slightly above average.  A good northern pike length frequency distribution in 1989 (mean length 17.9 inches) has shifted towards smaller fish (mean length 16.9 inches).  The trapnet catch of bluegills has declined from far above the third quartile in the previous survey to just under the third quartile in the current survey.  Similar to the previous survey, an extremely high number of bluegills (81.83/set) were taken in gillnets.  Bluegills tend to be small, median length group 5.5-5.3 inches, and exhibit slow growth.  Largemouth bass and black crappie trapnet catches are both less than the previous survey's, black crappies are below the first quartile and largemouth bass just above for this lake class.  Both species exhibit good growth rates.  This lake class typically supports a substantial yellow perch population, however, since the earliest survey, Middle Cormorant has shown very low numbers of perch.  Only four perch were collected in the current survey, all in the trapnets.  Biennial walleye fingerling stocking since 1976 has failed to produce any significant results, and the population continues to gradually decline.  At 1.00/gillnet it is now below the first quartile for this lake class.  The few walleyes taken in test nets do, however, exhibit good growth.  An abundant yellow bullhead population is present but length frequency data indicates most fish are too small to be of interest to commercial fishermen.  Net catches indicate that carp are continuing to increase in abundance, as they have since first detected in the 1977 survey.  In general, gamefish populations in the lake appear to have been suffering slow but steady declines in quantity or quality since carp were introduced.  Whether or not an actual cause and effect relationship exists is not clear.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cormorant is a 366-acre lake located in western Becker County.  It currently has a navigable connection to upstream Nelson and Upper Cormorant Lakes and a non-navigable connection to downstream Big Cormorant Lake.  This lake is ecologically well-suited to Largemouth Bass, panfish, and Northern Pike.  Good Walleye spawning habitat is scarce in Middle Cormorant, but immigration is possible from the other connected lakes.  The modest Walleye fishery is sustained primarily by a combination of immigration and regular stocking. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled in 2014 averaged a healthy 2.6 pounds each.  Northern Pike were more abundant with an identical average weight of 2.6 pounds but some pike over 30 inches were also found. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were lower than those in past studies but gill net catches were relatively high indicating that fish were occupying deep water during the August survey.  The numbers of large Bluegill (over 8.0 inches) in Middle Cormorant were up in 2014 compared to the recent past, but not as abundant as in assessments conducted during the 1960's and 1970's.  Approximately one of every five Bluegills sampled by gill nets in 2014 was over eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe diverse fish community in Middle Cormorant currently reflects relatively good water quality.  There are very few Black Bullheads.  There is an average population of larger than normal Walleyes in the lake compared to ecologically similar lakes.  There are good numbers of small Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Anglers can help increase the average size of these species by releasing Bluegills over seven inches and Northern Pike over 24 inches.  Other fish species found in this lake include Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Common Carp, and Rock Bass.  Smallmouth Bass were also found during past studies but none have been sampled since 1977.  This species is known to inhabit Big Cormorant which is the next lake downstream in the chain. <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Cormorant is a relatively small lake with heavy shoreline development.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers are encouraged to use wise land management practices that will help protect the water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cormorant Lake is a 373-acre lake located in southwestern Becker County 13 miles south of the city of Lake Park. The lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and receives high recreational use and fishing pressure from the surrounding area. The lake maintains a navigable channel to Nelson and Upper Cormorant Lake and a non-navigable connection to downstream Big Cormorant Lake. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2019. Middle Cormorant Lake provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Middle Cormorant Lake in August 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye have remained low in Middle Cormorant Lake since the 1977 survey.  Spawning habitat suited for Walleye is limited in the lake, therefore the fishery is sustained through periodic fingerling stocking. Gill nets captured an average of three Walleye per net in 2021.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 9.4 to 25.6 inches, averaging 17.6 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were below average in 2021. On average, roughly six pike per gill net were captured. Sampled pike ranged in length from 12.7 to 31.5 inches and averaged 21.3 inches long. Of the sampled pike, 34.5% were greater than or equal to 24 inches in length, revealing a fair number of quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 was below average with trap nets catching 32 fish per net.  Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 8.4 inches, averaging 5.8 inches long. Approximately 1% of Bluegill sampled in trap nets were eight inches or longer. Bluegill exhibited slow growth, with fish not reaching eight inches until over a decade of growth.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, a total of 25 crappie were caught in combined gears ranging in length from 4.5 to 11.0 inches. Nine Largemouth Bass were caught in trap nets, ranging in length from 5.8 to 17.8 inches and averaging 9.4 inches long. Catch rates of Yellow Perch in Middle Cormorant Lake have always been historically low and no perch were caught during the 2021 survey. <br> \n  <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the 2021 survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and White Sucker. One Smallmouth Bass was captured, the first time this species has been found in the lake since a survey in 1966. Yellow Bullhead were extremely abundant in catch and were the most common among the three bullhead species. Common Carp have been documented in the lake but were not sampled during the 2021 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain and improve Middle Cormorant Lake's fishery by harvesting small-moderately sized Northern Pike and Bluegill and releasing larger fish, as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habit in the lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones, leaving native aquatic vegetation stands intact, and using wise land management practices. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cormorant Lake, with its physical and chemical makeup, is best suited for bass, panfish and northern pike.  Preferred spawning habitat is readily available for them.  Consequently, these species are abundant.  However, other fish like walleye and bullhead are also present in significant number.  Although walleye fingerlings are currently sotcked on a regular basis, net catches were actually higher in 1966, when walleye fry were being stocked in Middle Cormorant.  Fisheries personnel are not able to say for certain that walleye fry stocking was more successful than fingerling stocking in Middle Cormorant because a large spring migration of walleye from Big Cormorant was also observed in 1966.  It is quite possible that walleyes migrating into the lake from Big Cormorant stayed long enough to be sampled in test nets during the summer.  It is clear that walleye spawning habitat is lacking in Middle Cormorant and that natural reproduction was probably not a factor.At any rate, fish spawning habitat and water quality can both be affected by unrestricted shoreline and watershed development.  It is clear that Middle Cormorant and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Individuals from Middle Cormorant Lake help monitor water quality by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations and asking advice about how to achieve water use goals without sacrificing water quality, fish communities and, eventually, property values.  Guides are available for riparian owners who desire to alter shoreline areas while doing the least harm to the lake.The diverse fish community in Middle Cormorant Lake currently reflects relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads.  There is an average population of larger than normal walleyes in the lake compared to ecologically similar lakes.  There are large numbers of small northern pike and bluegill.  Anglers can help increase the average size of these species by releasing \"medium size\" fish and keeping smaller ones instead.  Currently, northern pike and bluegills are being \"cropped off\" by anglers as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.  There are largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, carp, and rock bass present in Middle Cormorant.  Still, the lake is small enough to be vulnerable to additional nutrient input and sedimentation.  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  Consequently, best management practices are urged for all shoreline and watershed alterations and development.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cormorant is a 360-acre lake located in western Becker County.  It currently has a navigable connection to Nelson and Upper Cormorant Lakes and a non-navigable connection to Big Cormorant Lake.  This lake is ecologically well suited to largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike.  Good walleye spawning habitat is scarce in Middle Cormorant, but immigration is possible from the other connected lakes.  The modest walleye fishery is sustained by a combination of immigration and regular stocking. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled in 2010 averaged a healthy 1.8 pounds each.  Northern pike were small and more abundant with an average weight of 2.1 pounds but some pike over 30 inches were also found. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill test net catches were up from the 2004 study but still within the normal range for similar lakes.  The numbers of large bluegill (over 8.0 inches) in Middle Cormorant were much fewer in assessments since 1983 than in those conducted during the 1960's and 1970's.  A few have shown up in the two most recent surveys, but big bluegills are still rare.  It is believed that angler exploitation is the primary factor.  What appears to be happening is common in many bluegill lakes.  As soon as bluegills reach sizes acceptable to anglers, they are being harvested.  Thus, only smaller fish remain.  If there is public support, special regulations may hold potential in this lake for increasing the number of larger bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nThe diverse fish community in Middle Cormorant currently reflects relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads.  There is an average population of larger than normal walleyes in the lake compared to ecologically similar lakes.  There are good numbers of small northern pike and bluegill.  Anglers can help increase the average size of these species by releasing bluegills over seven inches and northern pike over 24 inches.  Other fish species found in this lake include black crappie, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, carp, and rock bass.  Smallmouth bass have also been found during past studies but none were caught in 2010.  This species is known to inhabit Big Cormorant which is the next lake downstream in the chain. <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Cormorant is a relatively small lake with heavy shoreline development.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers are encouraged to use wise land management practices that will help protect the water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Cormorant is a 360 acre lake located in western Becker County.  It has a currently navigable connection to Nelson and Upper Cormorant Lakes and a non-navigable connection to Big Cormorant Lake.  This lake is ecologically well suited to largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike.  Good walleye spawning habitat is scarce in Middle Cormorant, but immigration is possible for the other connected lakes.  The modest walleye fishery is sustained by a combination of immigration and regular walleye fingerling stocking.Walleyes sampled in 2004 averaged a healthy 1.7 pounds each.  Northern pike were more abundant and the average weight was 1.6 pounds but some over 30 inches were found.  Largemouth bass up to 19 inches in length were sampled.Bluegill test net catches were down from previous surveys but still within the normal range for similar lakes.  The numbers of large bluegill (over 8.0 inches) in Middle Cormorant were much fewer during recent surveys than during the 1960's and 1970's.  It is believed that angler exploitation is the primary factor.  What appears to be happening is common in many bluegill lakes.  As soon as bluegills reach sizes acceptable to anglers, they are being harvested.  Thus, only smaller fish remain.  If there is public support, special regulations may hold potential in this lake for increasing the number of larger bluegills.The diverse fish community in Middle Cormorant currently reflects relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads.  There is an average population of larger than normal walleyes in the lake compared to ecologically similar lakes.  There are good numbers of small northern pike and bluegill.  Anglers can help increase the average size of these species by releasing bluegills over seven inches and northern pike over 24 inches.  Other fish species found in this lake include black crappie, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, carp, and rock bass.  Smallmouth bass have also been found during past studies but none were caught in 2004.Middle Cormorant is a relatively small lake with heavy shoreline development.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers are encouraged to use wise land management practices that will help protect the water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",
