                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a 124 acre lake located on the border of Beltrami and Clearwater counties about 3.5 miles south of US Highway 2.  A county-owned, primitive public access is located on the west end of the lake off of 320th Street with space for about five vehicles with trailers.  The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped and forested but a few houses are scattered around the 2.9 miles of shoreline.  The Little Mississippi River flows through the lake and exits on the southeast side, flowing through Lake Manomin before joining the Mississippi River.  <br> \n <br> \nWith a maximum depth of 13 feet, vegetation covers the majority the lake bottom which provides habitat for the Northern Pike and panfish populations which comprise the majority of the fish community.  Walleye fry stocking occurs on even numbered years.  Bluegill and Black Crappie would also be re-introduced in the event of a winterkill but this has not occurred since 1977.  Currently, no experimental or special regulations exist on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are present in moderate numbers with sizes up to 10 inches.  The average size in 2014 was 8.4 inches making Moose Lake an excellent destination for quality-sized panfish quietly off the beaten path.  Black Crappies are also present with sizes ranging up to 12.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are few and far between; however, catching a large fish is possible.  Of note, a 28 inch fish was captured and released during the 2014 survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike is the most abundant predator fish inhabiting Moose Lake.  This species averaged 18.9 inches in length in the 2014 fish population assessment.  The opportunity to harvest some of these fish in small to medium sizes ranging up to 26 inches can serve as an excellent alternative for the consumptive angler. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present in good numbers and are the primary food source for both Northern Pike and Walleye.  A few fish were found at harvestable sizes in 2014 but most were below the 8 inch mark. <br> \n</p>",

THE GILLNETS SHOW THE NORTHERN PIKE AND WHITE SUCKER TO BE ABOVE LOCAL MEANS. BLACK CRAP- PIE, BLUEGILL, PUMPKINSEED, AND BLACK BULLHEAD WERE ALL ABOVE LOCAL MEANS IN THE TRAP NETS WHILE BROWN BULLHEAD AND LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NEAR THE MEAN AND ROCK BASS, BELOW. AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTIONS SHOWED WALLEYE FROM YEARS WHEN STOCKING DID NOT TAKE PLACE INDICATING SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION.</p>",
