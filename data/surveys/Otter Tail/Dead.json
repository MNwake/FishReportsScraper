                "narrative": "<p>     Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 5.4 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms. \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  Three DNR owned public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  \n     Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.\n     The test-net catch rate of walleye has increased in recent surveys .  Walleye ranged in length from 8.1 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  To supplement the walleye population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR initiated a walleye fry stocking program in 2001.  Since 2001, 3.3 million walleye fry have been stocked on a biennial basis.  Age and catch data indicate that this stocking regime and natural reproduction may be able to maintain walleye abundance at or above management goals.  \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate indicates that pike are abundant.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good but that mortality is high and growth is slow.  Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 26.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.\n     Bluegill test-net catch rates have remained stable over the recent series of surveys; however, the long-term trend is a decline in catch rates.  The decline in bluegill abundance has led to a corresponding increase in bluegill size distribution.  Thirty-three percent of the bluegills in this assessment were at least 7.0 inches or greater in length.   \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n     The western basin of Dead Lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill.  A partial winterkill was most recently documented during the winter of 1996-97.  Data from population assessments indicate that this basin has been repopulated with fish from the main lake basin.\n     Dead Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue diving ducks at various locations  on the lake.  Large stands of emergent vegetation are abundant and offer convenient hiding places for duck hunters as they pursue their quarry.  A State Wildlife Management Area is located along the northeast shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 17, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 19 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) as well as three tolerant species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) website for \"Lake Index of Biological Integrity.\"  The FIBI score for Dead Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of northern pike sampled has remained stable at about 0.8 lbs.  The special regulation allowing an increased limit of northern pike on Dead Lake has only been in effect since 1987 and it probably hasn't been long enough to identify any changes in the northern pike population.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 83.4 per trap net lift in 1985 to 54.6 per trap net.  The index of bluegill abundance is still nearly twice the area median.  <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate has continued to decline, from 16.3 per net in 1973 to 1.6 per net.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 8.5 per gill net lift in 1985 to 13.9 per gill net lift.  The average weight of walleye sampled decreased from 1.4 lbs. in 1985 to 1.1 lbs.  Age information from a sample of the walleye captured indicates very good natural reproduction, as five out of the eight year classes represented were skip years in the stocking sequence.  Back calculated length analysis for walleye indicates that age I+ and II+ walleyes appear to be growing slower and ages III+ to V+ are growing faster.   <br> \n     Additional age information for other gamefish species indicates adequate natural reproduction as evidenced by the distribution of age classes represented in the sample. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh lands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 lake survey was 5.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  State owned public water accesses are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     There is a 90-acre Aquatic Management Area (AMA) located on Dead Lake.  It adjoins a State Owned Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The Dead Lake WMA/ AMA is approximately 895 acres.  The AMA portion contains two islands and the eastern shoreline of the unit.  The WMA/AMA is located on the central part of Dead Lake.  The entire unit is primarily managed and overseen by the Division of Wildlife. <br> \n      Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the diversity of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.7 to 24.0 inches with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2013, 2015, and 2016 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys; however, size structure has remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 19.0 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 16.3 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has also remained stable.  The general trend has been for an increase in Bluegill size structure.  Fifty percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappie reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Twenty-four percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Dead Lake is a popular lake with Largemouth Bass anglers.  Several permitted bass tournaments are held annually on Dead Lake   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Dead Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 4.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms. \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  Three DNR owned public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  \n     Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.\n     The test-net catch rate of walleye has remained stable in recent surveys.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 27.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleye reach an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.  \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate indicates that pike are abundant.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good but that mortality is high and growth is slow.  Pike ranged in length from 9.7 to 32.0 inches with an average length and weight of 17.1 inches and 1.2 pounds.\n     Bluegill test-net catch rates have remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  The short term trend has been for an increase in bluegill size distribution.  Thirty-six percent of the bluegills in this assessment were at least 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill reach an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age.   \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n     The western basin of Dead Lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill.  A partial winterkill was most recently documented during the winter of 1996-97.  Data from population assessments indicate that this basin has been repopulated with fish from the main lake basin.\n     Dead Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue diving ducks at various locations  on the lake.  Large stands of emergent vegetation are abundant and offer convenient hiding places for duck hunters as they pursue their quarry.  A State Wildlife Management Area is located along the northeast shoreline.</p>",

The following summary is a combination of all four basins.  Testnetting data indicate that northern pike, walleye, and bluegill numbers exceed their respective statewide and area net catch medians.  <br> \n     Yellow perch numbers are below both the statewide and area net catch medians.  <br> \n     Northern pike numbers and average weight have remained stable in recent surveys.  An increased bag limit regulation may help increase the average size.  <br> \n     Walleye age structure is balanced with age-III+ being an extremely strong year class.  The walleye age-class distribution indicates that three out of the eight year classes sampled are the result of natural reproduction.  Naturally produced year classes are strong and are maintaining a stable walleye population.  <br> \n     Bluegill numbers have increased dramatically the past 12 years, and bluegill fishing has increased accordingly.   <br> \n     Adult yellow perch numbers have steadily declined the past 12 years, possibly due to the large predator population; however, shoreline seining indicates above average numbers of young-of-the-year yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

The catch rate declined from 8.6 per gill net lift in the 1988 survey to 3.3 per net and marked the first time since the 1973 survey that abundance was within the normal range for this lake class.  Average weight of pike increased from 0.9 pounds in 1988 to 1.8 pounds, and is related to an improvement in size structure.  In 1988, 25% of the pike sampled were greater than 18.0 inches in length compared to 46% in in this survey.  <br> \n     Black bullhead abundance declined from 28.9 per gill net lift in 1988 to 2.4 per net, which is below the normal range.  The same trend was observed in brown bullhead abundance, which declined from 11.8 per gill net lift in 1988 to 1.5 per net. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance remained stable at 53.7 per trap net lift, and is 3.5 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Sixteen percent of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length compared to eight percent in 1988.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance increased from 1.0 per trap net lift on 1988 to 2.3 per net, which is four times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance remained below normal at 1.8 per trap net lift and the absence of age-I fish and fish under seven inches in length may be indicative of poor reproduction in 1990.   <br> \n     Yep abundance increased from 1.6 per gill net lift in 1988 to 4.4 per net, which slightly exceeds the lower limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 13.9 per gill net lift in 1988 to 4.7 per net, which is within the normal range.  This coincided with an increase in average individual weight of 0.7 pounds in 1988 to 1.1 pounds.  The high abundance of walleye in 1988 was related to a strong 1986 year class, a year in which no stocking was conducted.  Consistent walleye reproduction is evident as year classes were present for all years in which fry were not stocked. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  Dead Lake is connected to Otter Tail and Walker Lakes via the Dead River.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by an unnavigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2003 lake survey was 4.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.  Dead Lake is included in lake class 41 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.       The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  The 1994 lake survey referenced 239 homes and 10 resorts.  Three DNR owned public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Dead Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Dead Lake.  Data from recent population assessments indicate that all of these species are abundant.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye is within the normal range for class 41 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.5 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The 2000, 2002, and 2003 year classes appear to be at least moderately strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.          To supplement the walleye population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR initiated a walleye fry stocking program for Dead Lake in 2001.  The DNR stocks 3.3 million walleye fry on a biennial basis.  This stocking regime and the extent of natural reproduction will be evaluated in future lake surveys to determine if walleye abundance can be sustained at or above long-range management goals.       Northern pike abundance is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 41.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good but that mortality is high and growth is slow.  Pike ranged in length from 14.0 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 17.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.4 inches at five years of age.     Bluegill test-net catch rates have remained stable over the recent series of surveys; however, the long-term trend is a decline in catch rates.  The decline in bluegill abundance has led to a corresponding increase in bluegill size distribution.  Thirty-one percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at six years of age.      Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     The western basin of Dead Lake is susceptible to periodic partial winterkill.  A partial winterkill was most recently documented during the winter of 1996-97.  Data from recent population assessments indicate that this basin has been repopulated with fish from the main lake basin.       Dead Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue diving ducks at various locations on the lake.  Large stands of emergent vegetation are abundant and offer convenient hiding places for duck hunters as they pursue their quarry.  A State Wildlife Management Area is located along the northeast shoreline.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  It is the second largest lake in Otter Tail County.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh lands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2021 lake survey was 4.4 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  State owned public water accesses are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     There is a 90-acre Aquatic Management Area (AMA) located on Dead Lake.  It adjoins a State Owned Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The Dead Lake WMA/AMA is approximately 895 acres.  The AMA portion contains two islands and the eastern shoreline of the unit.  The WMA/AMA is located on the central part of Dead Lake.  The entire unit is primarily managed and overseen by the Division of Wildlife. <br> \n      Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The abundance of these species can be attributed to the diversity of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     The recent trend has been an increase in Walleye abundance.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 14.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2018 year class is very strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys; however, size structure has remained poor.  Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 20.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 16.1 inches at five years of age.    <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has also remained stable.  The general trend has been for an increase in Bluegill size structure.  Fifty-six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 16% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappie reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Forty-two percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Dead Lake is a popular lake with Largemouth Bass anglers.  Several permitted Largemouth Bass tournaments are held annually on Dead Lake   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Dead Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2019.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.  <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  Three public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 7.6 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2009 and 2011 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good but that mortality is high and growth is slow.  Pike ranged in length from 11.5 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has also remained stable.  The general trend has been for an increase in bluegill size distribution.  Thirty-two percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Black crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by a non-navigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.  <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  Three public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 23.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2011, 2012, and 2013 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good but that mortality is high and growth is slow.  Pike ranged in length from 11.9 to 26.1 inches with an average length and weight of 17.4 inches and 1.0 pound.  Pike attain an average length of 19.8 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has also remained stable.  The general trend has been for an increase in Bluegill size distribution.  Twenty-eight percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Lake is a 7,901-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately three miles south of Dent, MN.  Dead Lake is connected to Otter Tail and Walker Lakes via the Dead River.  The Dead River outlet is located along the southeast shoreline and flows south into Walker and Otter Tail Lakes.  The Walker Lake State Fish Hatchery is located on the Dead River.  Dead Lake is also connected to Star Lake by an unnavigable channel under County Road 35.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural and marsh land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Dead Lake is 65 feet; however, 83% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2000 lake survey was 6.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Water clarity in Dead Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.      The majority of the shoreline of Dead Lake remains undeveloped.  Approximately 70% of the shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods or marshlands.  Homes, cabins, and resorts occupy the shoreline that is developed.  The 1994 lake survey referenced 239 homes and 10 resorts.  Three DNR owned public water accesses are available.  They are located along the north, west, and east shorelines of the lake.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Dead Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Dead Lake.  Data from recent population assessments indicate that all of these species are abundant and exhibit good size structures.  These species also exhibit consistently good reproduction and moderate to fast growth.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.      To supplement the walleye population produced by natural reproduction, the DNR is initiating a walleye fry stocking program for Dead Lake.  Beginning in 2001, the DNR will stock 3.3 million walleye fry on a biennial basis.  This stocking regime and the extent of natural reproduction will be evaluated in future lake surveys to determine if walleye abundance can be sustained at or above long-range management goals.       Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     The western basin of Dead Lake is susceptible to periodic partial winterkill.  A partial winterkill was most recently documented during the winter of 1996-97.  Data from recent population assessments indicate that this basin has been repopulated with fish from the main lake basin.       Dead Lake is also a popular waterfowl hunting lake.  Many hunters pursue diving ducks at various locations on the lake.  Large stands of emergent vegetation are abundant and offer convenient hiding places for duck hunters as they pursue their quarry.  A State Wildlife Management Area is located along the northeast shoreline.   </p>",
