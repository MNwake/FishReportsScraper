The average weight of individual pike was 2.2 pounds.  Analysis of the length frequency distribution indicates that the northern pike population size structure is good, with over 90% of the sample greater than 18.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     Green sunfish abundance, as indexed with trap net catches, was exceedingly high at 36.0 per net lift.  This catch rate was thirteen times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate of 8.0 per gill net lift was within the normal range. <br> \n</p>",
