THE CATCHES OF PUMPKINSEEDS, BLUEGILLS, AND BLACK CRAPPIES WERE LESS THAN LOCAL MEDIAN RATES. MOST ARE SMALL BUT THREE OF THE BLUEGILLS SAMPLED WERE GREATER THAN 8 INCHES IN LENGTH. BOTH BLACK AND YELLOW BULL- HEADS ARE PRESENT. YELLOW APPEAR TO BE MOST ABUN- DANT THOUGH BLACK TEND TO BE LARGER. FORTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE BLACK BULLHEADS SAMPLED WERE GREATER THAN 12 IN LOW NUMBERS ARE BOWFIN, PUMPKINSEED, LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND YELLOW PERCH. CARP ARE KNOWN TO PRESENT FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS, BUT NUMBERS ARE LOW.</p>",
