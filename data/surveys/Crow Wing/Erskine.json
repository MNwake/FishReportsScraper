                "narrative": "<p>Test netting on Erskine Lake indicated high populations of pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch. Average populations of bowfin, northern pike, carp, golden shiner, yellow bullhead and largemouth bass were indicated. Black and brown bullheads were present in low numbers. Northern pike sampled and aged indicated a fast growing and above average individual size of fish. Age classes two thru five and seven were represented with three year olds comprising 50% of the aged sample. A high population of 10/lb yellow perch is probably responsible for the fast growth rates of the northern pike since it should provide an excellent food source. Bluegills show high numbers and average sizes, but appear to be slow growing. Age classes two thru eight were represented with five, six and seven comprising 65% of the fish aged. Ninety-three percent of the fish measured were between six and eight inches long. Largemouth bass sampled indicated average growth rates. There were only five bass sampled so a population estimate probably wouldn't be accurate. Black crappies were very abundant, but very small. Although this might suggest a stunted population, the fish that were aged were also young. Growth rates appear to be average. Yellow perch appear to be about average. Ages two thru six were represented with three and four year olds comprising 80% of the sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Erskine Lake sits at the far SE corner of Crow Wing County and offers some quality fishing opportunities.  With so many other options closer to Brainerd, combined with the fact that it isn't stocked with walleye, it is probably overlooked by many non-local anglers.  Only the southern half of the lake is developed, including a spacious public access for this size of lake.  Shore fishing was occurring almost every day of the survey.  Heavy aquatic plant growth probably limits fishing later in the summer, especially from shore.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were high in 2016, but size was less impressive.  The bluegill catch rate was 60.2/trap net, with an average length of 6.0\" and only 7% measuring 7\" or larger.  The black crappie catch was also high at 10.5/gill net, however, only 33% were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in average numbers (8.8/gill net) with the average size (24.0\") being a little larger than we typical see in this area (38% measured 24\" or larger).  This might have to do with the healthy yellow perch population (28.3/gill net) which is also not as common in this area.  They are an important forage fish.  Anglers are encouraged protect the unique balance in this lake and only keep smaller northern pike, releasing the larger ones to sustain a healthy population.  The new north central zone regulations set for implementation in 2018 are designed to do this.  They would allow anglers in this area to keep 10 pike under 22\"; 2 pike of the 10 daily bag limit may be over 26\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers and size were impressive, with a spring electrofishing catch rate of 87.7/hr.  Size was good, with an average length of 14.4\" and 84% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 14'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on 03 August 2016, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at six stations.  Four stations had heavy vegetation which would not allow for seining.  Fifteen species were sampled including Iowa Darter, blacknose shiner, and blackchin shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 06-09 June 2016 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Erskine Lake.  <br> \n</p>",
