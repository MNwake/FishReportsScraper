                "narrative": "<p>This 2021 electrofishing survey was the first survey targeting Walleye during the spring spawning period in Pool 2.  Sampling occurred on a weekly basis as weather conditions allowed.  Sampling occurred on March 29, April 5, April 14, April 21, and April 29, 2021.  No Saugers were observed during electrofishing.  A total of 110 Walleyes were sampled ranging in size from 7.6 to 28.1 inches.  Average length of all Walleyes sampled was 18.8 inches.  Average length of mature male Walleyes (N=67) was 19.1 inches (13.1 to 24.0 inches).  The largest male Walleye sampled was 24 inches and 5.5 pounds.  Average length of mature female Walleyes (N=19) was 23.7 inches (17.7 to 28.1 inches).  The largest female Walleye sampled was 28.1 inches and 9.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 72% of Walleyes sampled were males, over 26% were females, and less than 2% were unknown and immature.  Almost 67% of female Walleyes and almost 84% of males were mature.  It was expected that more males would be sampled than females as males typically arrive on spawning grounds before females and reside in the area longer than females.  Sampling on April 21 and April 29 were presumed to be post-spawn as no females were sampled on April 21, and the male/female ratio was closer to 50% on April 29, with all female walleye sampled either immature, or mature and spent.  Additionally, daily catch/hour for all Walleye was lowest on April 21 when no female Walleyes were sampled.  The highest daily catch/hour (95) was pre-spawn on March 29 when almost 96% of the Walleyes sampled were males and the one female sampled was gravid, but the eggs were not yet ripe.  Additionally, every Walleye sampled on March 29 was mature.  Peak spawning was likely missed due to sampling only once per week.  No female Walleyes were observed with flowing, ripe eggs. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye ages ranged from 1 to 15 years old.  Over 50% of age-3 and older male Walleyes were mature and the oldest immature male was 7 years old.  Over 50% of age-5 and older female Walleyes were mature and the oldest immature female was 5 years old.  The oldest male Walleye sampled was 15 years old that was the largest male sampled (24.0 inches).  Additionally, nine male Walleyes were sampled that were aged as 12 years old.  The largest female Walleye sampled (28.1 inches) was 11 years old and the oldest female sampled was 12 years old but only 23.9 inches and 4.2 pounds.  Over 71% of aged female Walleyes and almost 64% of males were at least 5 years old.  Almost 13% of all Walleyes sampled were at least 10 years old.  Average length-at-age was higher for age-2 and 3 male Walleyes but females were generally larger after age-5.  When comparing Walleye combined sex average length-at-age to Lake St. Croix and Lake Pepin data, the average length-at-age is smaller because those waterbodies are surveyed in the fall.  Changing the age by one year so that age-3 Pool 2 Walleyes sampled in the spring are compared to age-4 Lake St. Croix and Lake Pepin Walleyes sampled in the fall, the lengths-at-age are generally comparable outside of instances where there are low samples sizes at a given age. <br> \n <br> \nThis spring spawning survey was very helpful in assessing length, age, sex, and maturity composition of Walleyes spawning in upper Pool 2.  It is recommended to repeat this survey as time and staffing allows, while taking advantage of the existing passive acoustic telemetry network in the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers and implant Walleye with acoustic transmitters.  The large number of acoustic receivers deployed in these rivers would greatly enhance our understanding of seasonal Walleye movements and has many advantages over the radio telemetry study conducted in 1998-1999.  Timing of transmitter implantation is better in the spring, when water temperatures are cooler, and fish are less stressed.  However, implanting transmitters in the summer has a greater chance of avoiding transient fish that may be traveling from greater distances downstream of Pool 2.  The goal should be to track the \"resident\" Pool 2 population of Walleyes.  Implanting transmitters into Walleyes that spawn in upper Pool 2 would also be valuable, but one would have to assume it returns to its general home range it previously occupied, which may still be limited to Pool 2. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill nets and trap nets can be used effectively in too few places in Pool 2 of the Mississippi River.  Standardized electrofishing stations were established to be used in future electrofishing surveys and represent the many different habitat types present and are spread throughout the entire 32 river miles.  In addition, fall electrofishing was employed in targeted areas to gather walleye, sauger, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass to evaluate the catch-and-release regulation on those four species.  Channel catfish were later collected at the same time to supplement information for aging as few catfish were caught in the standard summer electrofishing assessment. <br> \nTwenty-eight different fish species, one hybrid (hybrid sunfish), and one variant (mirror carp) were sampled in Pool 2 during the standard electrofishing survey.  Emerald shiners were also observed, but no effort was made to enumerate them as they, and many other minnow species, are typically small enough to pass through the mesh of the dip nets used for electrofishing.  The top three species collected during summer sampling were common carp, freshwater drum, and shorthead redhorse, and was almost 43 percent of the entire sample. <br> \nThe walleye population appeared to be an older population, likely due to the catch-and-release regulation.  Few small walleye were sampled, although walleye grow very fast in Pool 2.  The average length for a 3-year-old walleye was 19.6 inches long.  Sixty-one percent of the walleye sampled were at least 15-inches long, and just over 21 percent were at least 25-inches long. <br> \nVery few sauger were sampled as they were likely in deeper water than what the electrofishing boat was able to sample.  Most of the sauger sampled were 1-year-old and less than 10-inches long. <br> \nA typical size structure was evident for both largemouth and smallmouth bass in that smaller fish were the most abundant, and as size increased, numbers decreased.  Pool 2 is not ideal habitat for largemouth and smallmouth bass as the water clarity dramatically decreases after the Minnesota River confluence.  Decent bass are present, but the numbers present are relatively low as bass are largely sight predators and are at a disadvantage. <br> \nChannel and flathead catfish were sampled in low numbers, though other methods may better assess the catfish population present.  A broad range of sizes were sampled for both, though no trophy catfish were sampled. <br> \nA fair number of white bass were sampled by electrofishing.  Individuals ranged from just under eight-inches long to almost 17-inches long.  White bass ages were from 2 to 6-years-old however, recent work on Lake Pepin has shown that white bass may be living much longer than previously thought and aging with scales may be inaccurate, so further work is needed to assess the white bass age structure.  Based on size structure, white bass could contribute a fair amount to an anglers catch on Pool 2 and be a quality recreational resource that would also be harvestable. <br> \nOther game fish sampled in low abundance were bluegill, black crappie, white crappie, and northern pike.  Again, conditions are not optimal in Pool 2 for these other game fish as water clarity in most of Pool 2 is poor, which puts these sight feeding game fish at a disadvantage. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were sampled in fair numbers and in a variety of sizes and ranged in age from Age II to Age IX.  Growth of walleye was good.  Sauger sampled were small and limited to fish Age III or Age IV.  Older fish are thought to reside in the pool, but in water too deep to be sampled with the gear employed.  Growth of sauger was comperable to fish from Pool 4 and the St. Croix River.  Smallmouth sampled were generally small and young, with Age III and IV fish making up the bulk of the catch.  Growth of smallmouth was similar to populations in the St. Croix and Rum Rivers.  Largemouth bass and northern pike were sampled in expectedly low numbers, as most of these fish inhabit the backwater areas of the pool not sampled in this investigation.    Trot lines were used in this survey in an attempt to better sample the catfish populations present.  Good numbers of both flathead and channel catfish were sampled.  Catfish populations appear healthy, with good numbers of fish in a variety of sizes sampled.  However, trotlines set between the abandoned toll bridge and downtown St. Paul caught few fish.  The poor catch was attributed to the high level of commercial barge taffic in that area.     Species diversity in this investigation was similar to earlier investigation of this area, with no new species sampled.  Gizzard shad, carp, and freshwater drum were the most common species sampled, with members of the sucker family (nine species sampled) making up much of the remaining catch.     Panfish were sampled in low numbers, which was anticipated, as they prefer the backwater areas not sampled in this investigation.</p>",

This survey was repeated in 2017 and 2023.  Two stations were abandoned in 2023 due to decreasing depth and replaced with new stations.  A third station was altered due to a massive sediment deposit during the 2019 flood.  Attempts were made to collect all Flathead Catfish observed.  Fish frequently elude capture as low frequency electrofishing can raise Flathead Catfish to the surface a considerable distance from the boat (200 feet or more).  A pectoral spine was removed from all but one Flathead Catfish for aging.  In addition, all Flathead Catfish over 9.8 inches were tagged with a Carlin Dangler disc tag. <br> \n <br> \nTotal electrofishing on-time was 9.2 hours.  One hundred sixteen Flathead Catfish were sampled in the 23 electrofishing stations.  Catch per hour of electrofishing was 12.7 in 2023, slightly below the 2008 catch per hour of 13.6, but higher than the 2017 catch per hour of 9.6.  Lengths of the sampled Flathead Catfish ranged from 6.0 to 42.3 inches.  Almost 84% of the fish sampled were less than 20-inches.  All but one Flathead Catfish sampled were able to be aged.  Ages ranged from 2 to 24 years old.  Over 90% of the Flathead Catfish were 5 years old or younger.  The largest age class sampled was age-3 (61.7%). <br> \n <br> \nIt is recommended to repeat this Flathead Catfish survey at least once every five years.  More frequent surveys could help determine year-class strength and potentially result in the recapture of previously tagged fish allowing us to confirm age estimates obtained from pectoral spines as well as informing growth rates.  Angler reports of tagged fish will also inform angler success, exploitation, and fish movements.</p>",
