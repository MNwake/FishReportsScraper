Largemouth bass population average. Yellow perch, no numbers. The northern pike, yellow bullhead, and bluegill net catches indicate above average populations, these species catch rates exceed the third quartile of the area median. The northern pike age groups from 2 to 8 years were represented with 50.8% being 4 and 5 years old. The northerns show an average weight of around 2.75 lbs. Length groups 11.0-35.9 inches were represented. Growth rates were slow for all age groups. Bluegills were small in size, with a few larger ones present. Length groups from 3.5 to 7.9 inches were represented. Age groups from 3 to 9 years were represented. Growth rates were slow for all age groups. The yellow bullheads average around 0.3 lbs. The bowfin, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and walleye net catches indicate average population status for the area median. The bowfin average 3 lbs per fish. Pumpkinseed length groups 5.0-8.4 in were represented. Largemouth bass age groups 4, 5 and 6 years old were represented, with 60% being 5 years old. The average weight for largemouth bass was close to 1.6 lbs per fish. The growth rates were slow for all age groups. Walleye age groups 5 and 6 years were represented, with the average weight per walleye being 3.6 lbs. Only two walleye were netted. Length groups 20.0-20.9 inches and 23.0-23.9 inches were represented. Growth rates were below average for all age groups. The black crappie net catches indicate a low population status for the area median. Age groups 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 years old were represented. Average weight was around 0.3 lbs per fish. Growth rates were below average for all age groups.</p>",

The other large predator fish (northern pike and largemouth bass) were caught in good numbers in Shirt Lake.  Northern Pike were caught at the rate of 11.0/gill net and averaged 23.4\", with 43% above the 22-26\" protected slot.  Fish up to 33.3\" were caught.  Largemouth Bas were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 60.0/hour.  Average size was 12.7\", with fish ranging from 6.5\" to 18.7\".  Largemouth bass over 15\" accounted for 20% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average, with both Bluegill and Black Crappie offering some decent fishing opportunities.  Bluegill were caught at the rate of 36.9/trap net, with an average length of 6.3\" and 18% measuring 7\" or longer.  Black Crappie numbers while lower (1.0/trap net) were still average for this type of lake and 78% were 8\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shirt is a 224 acre lake located about six miles southeast of Deerwood.  It is a soft-water lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  About 73% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are predominately sand and gravel.  Marshy areas on the east side have silt and muck soils.  Aquatic plants are abundant.  Emergent species are most abundant on the marshy east end.  Species like bulrush often provide preferred spawning sites for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species grow to a depth of about 15 feet in the lake.  These species provide areas of cover and feeding sites for a wide variety of fish species.Compared with similar type lakes, northern pike were present in \"high\" numbers in the 1994 netting (as they were in the 1983 and '88 nettings).  Growth rate was slow through age 3, and was good for older fish.  About one-half of the northerns aged were from the 1990 year class.  Average size was 2.1 lbs. in '94, compared to 2.8 lbs. in 1988.The walleye catch was \"low\" when compared to similar type lakes but was very similar to results of previous nettings of this lake.  Every second year stocking of walleye fingerlings began in 1992.  No fish from the 1992 year class were sampled in the '94 netting.Largemouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers in the '94 netting and appeared to have good growth.  The bluegill catch was also \"average,\" but growth was slow.  The black crappie catch was \"low,\" similar to catch rates in previous nettings.Yellow perch are an important food source for the lake's gamefish species.  Perch abundance bordered on \"low\" in the '94 netting but was generally similar to previous netting results.  Young perch continued to be present in shoreline seine samples.  Other species found in 1994 included \"average\" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and \"high\" numbers of yellow bullheads, compared to similar type lakes.  Previous nettings showed similar numbers of these species to be present in the lake at those times, as well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nShirt lake is a 224-acre lake located six miles southeast of Deerwood. Maximum depth is 38 feet with 73% less than 15 feet deep. Water clarity is excellent with a secchi disc reading of 14 feet. Shoal water (less than 4 feet) soil is mainly sand or gravel in the main basin and sand and muck in the bay areas. Aquatic plants were very diverse with over 35 species found. A few of these native species have never been identified in the Brainerd lakes area or have been found in very few locations. Many of these plants you would find in lakes characteristic of northeastern Minnesota.  The shoreline is fairly well developed with 69 homes or cabins present. The northern pike population remains high at 11.7/gill net. In past surveys it has ranged from 4.5(1973) to 15.7/gill net (1994).  The size distribution is also very good and fish from 10.2 to 34.1 inches were observed, and 31% were 24.0 inches or larger. The average size was 20.2 inches.   A total of five walleye were observed.  Size ranged from 19.1 to 26.8 inches. Walleye stocking was done prior to 1999, but survival rate was low from these stockings.  This is probably due to predation by the high population of northern pike, and a very low population of yellow perch for a forage food base.  Black crappies were present in modest numbers and fish up to 12.2 inches were captured.  The average size was 8.8 inches. Bluegill abundance was moderate with the majority small and only 16 % were 7.0 inches or greater.  The largemouth population as in past surveys is very good, and size ranged from 7.7 to 18.0 inches.  A township public access does exist, but parking is not allowed close to the access due to no parking signs along the township road, individuals have to park at least 0.1 miles away along the side of the road.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shirt lake is 224 acre lake located six miles southeast of Deerwood.  Maximum depth is 38 feet with 73% less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is excellent.  Shoal (less than 4 feet depth) soil is mainly sand or gravel with submerged aquatic vegetation being very abundant.  Scattered areas of emergents are found around the lake.  Access is via a township road on the south side.  The lake is primarily managed for nothern pike, largemouth bass and panfish with walleye managed as a secondary species. Walleye are stocked every third year.  Evaluation of the success of the stockings will determine future stockings.  Walleye catch rate of 0.3 fish/gill net in 1999 is low for this lake type.  Walleye were stocked over various time periods dating back to 1968 and every third year since 1992.  None of these stockings have been successful.  The low survival rate of the stocked walleye is probably due to low perch populations, and high northern pike numbers that feed on the perch and small walleye.  At present there is no biological reason to continue stocking in the future.  As in the previous two surveys (1988 and 1994) northern pike were observed in high numbers at 10.0 fish/gill net with sizes ranging from 10.6 to 37.1 inches and the average size of 17.1 inches. Largemouth bass were present in moderate numbers and various sizes.  Black crappie were observed in small numbers and majority were under 7.5 inches.  Bluegill were present in good numbers as in past surveys with size ranging from 3.3 to 7.6 inches and a average size of about 4.8 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Shirt Lake was conducted on July 28, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Shirt Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
