Low populations of rock bass and largemouth bass were indicated. A very high population of northern pike was present, when compared to the median of lake class 29. Individual sizes were average when compared to fish in the same lake group. A stunted bluegill population was apparent. A very high population and the average individual size was below average. Growth rates of the fish sampled and aged were below average for all ages. Black crappies also were abundant. The individual size of the crappies were below average and the growth rates were slow as one might expect. Yellow perch were present in average numbers and average individual sizes. Growth rates of the perch appeared to be slow also.</p>",

There is no official public access to launch a boat, but carry-in or walk-in access could be obtained through permission from the camp or through the attached State Aquatic Management Area (AMA) which has a trail from the south.   <br> \n <br> \nThere are a few species that could give a person some fishing action on Pickerel.  Northern pike were present in average numbers (8.0/gill net).  Average size was 21.0\", with 31% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Largemouth bass would be another option.  They were present in high numbers for this type of lake (2.5/net).  Average length was 12.3\" and 60% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish results looked decent with both bluegill and black crappie being present in average numbers.  Average bluegill length was 5.7\" and 34% were 7\" or larger.  A variety of black crappie sizes were caught, with fish ranging from 4.9\" to 11.8\" and 42% measuring 8\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",
