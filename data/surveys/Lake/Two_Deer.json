                "narrative": "<p>Two Deer Lake is located in the Superior National Forest approximately 15 miles northwest of Isabella. The lake has a maximum depth of 7.5 feet and is relatively clear, with a Secchi disc visible at that depth. The lake is surrounded by federal land and the lakeshore is undeveloped and in a wild state. A 200-foot walking trail down a steep hill from Forest Service Rd. #1491 leads to the north end of the lake. The fish population is comprised of northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch, white suckers, and various minnow species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers in 2006 compared to other lakes in this class. The average size was 2.5 pounds, with fish up to 28.9 inches (5.3 pounds) captured.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were collected in average numbers.  However, this species is difficult to capture in netting gear and therefore actual density is uncertain. Largemouth bass collected in the 2006 assessment ranged from 5.2 to 17.1 inches, and averaged about 2.0 pounds.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were collected in above average numbers but most of the fish in the sample were smaller than 8.0 and too small to interest anglers.  <br> \n</p>",

The largest northern pike collected was 13.5 pounds; however, fish of this size are uncommon in Two Deer Lake.  Most of the fish caught by anglers will be less than 5 pounds.The status of the largemouth bass population was uncertain.  This species does not capture well in the type of sampling gear used in Two Deer Lake.  A total of six largemouth bass were collected in the survey, with lengths of 6.8 inches to 14.9 inches (2.1 pounds).  Most of the fish in the sample were between 1.3 and 2.0 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers, however, most were too small to interest anglers.  The largest perch sampled was 9.0 inches and only 3 fish in the sample were larger than 8.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two Deer Lake is a 45 acre, 100% littoral lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  From State Hwy 1 travel 4.25 miles north on the Deep Lake Rd. (#1491).  The public access is a carry-in, 200 feet, down a steep slope to the north end of the lake.  There is very little parking at this location and little room to maneuver a boat trailer.  Canoes and light boats are recommended for this type of access. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population in Two Deer Lake was slightly above average for the lake class in 2011.  The average weight was 3.4 pounds (23.4 inches), also above average.  Forty-two percent of the catch larger than 25 inches, the largest northern pike was 37.5 inches (12.4 pounds).  Two Deer Lake is locally known as a good northern fishing lake with nice average size fish and a decent chance at larger fish. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass typically do not sample well with standard netting gear, the difficult access to Two Deer Lake does not allow for an assessment of the largemouth bass population with a standard electro-fishing boat.  Four largemouth bass were sampled in 2011 with two over 18 inches (3.75 and 4.0 pounds).  Ageing results on largemouth bass samples in the Finland Area often show years of little or no successful spawning (probably associated with cool summers) on lakes like Two Deer.  Angling success for largemouth bass will vary greatly with the strong and weak year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was above average for the lake class although the average size was small.  One 10.9 inch yellow perch was sampled in 2011, but few yellow perch over eight inches were captured.   About half of the perch had black spot (Neascus) and nearly all had yellow grub parasites. <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers are also present in above average numbers with a small average size. Suckers along with six minnow species provide an ample forage base for this lake as evidenced by the healthy and chunky northern pike sampled. <br> \n</p>",
