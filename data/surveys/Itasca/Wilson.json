The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie with goals of maintaining at least a rate of 2.0 crappie/net and a Bluegill catch of 10/net with 20% of the population at least eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie trap net catch was average for lakes of similar habitat, though lakes of this type do not produce an abundance of fish. The catch was comparable to past surveys. Size distribution was reasonable with fish up to 11 inches sampled and an average length of almost 9 inches. Age analysis indicated consistent recruitment and average growth. Crappie averaged over 10 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most numerous species sampled in trap nets despite a catch lower than what is expected for lakes like Wilson. Past catches have generally been low. Size structure was modest. Fish ranged from 3.5 to 8.8 inches and averaged 5.7 inches. Ages 3-9 were present with a fairly even distribution of ages, except age 3 which comprised nearly half the sample. The 2020 year class (age 3) was well represented in other area lakes as well. Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish reaching almost eight inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nNot many Northern Pike were sampled in gill nets or trap nets. This is comparable to past surveys as well as what would be expected from lakes with similar characteristics. As in previous surveys, size structure was poor with few fish over 24 inches sampled. Fish ranged from 11.0 to 28.4 inches and averaged 19 inches. Only two fish exceeded 24 inches in a combined sample. Recruitment was consistent with ages 1-6 present and somewhat equally distributed. Growth was average by statewide comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilson Lake is an 86 acre lake located 12 miles southwest of Togo, MN.  The lake has 46 acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  The lake has a state administered access and low shoreline development.  The 1995 lake management plan indicated black crappie, bluegill and northern pike were the primary species and largemouth bass and walleye were secondary species for management.Black crappie catch rates for gill nets and trap nets have been low in all four assessments.    In 2003, the trap-net catch was 0.6 fish/net which fell within the 1st quartile of 0.3 fish/net and the lake class median of 0.9 fish/net.  Fish sampled in the trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 7.5 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  Only one age-1 and four age-2 fish were sampled.  Although sample size was low, growth appeared to be similar to statewide averages.  In all four assessments, trap-net catch rates for bluegill have been below average yet within the normal range.  In 2003, the trap-net catch rate was 8.6 fish/net.  The fish ranged from 3.4 to 9.1 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Eleven year classes from age 3 to age 13 were determined from scales.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to other class 29 lakes.Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with our standard summer netting gears and methods.  During the survey no largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets or trap nets.  However, adult fish were observed in the shallows.  Nine were captured during the late August ?-inch trap net assessment to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) fish.The northern pike gill-net catch rate of 7.0/net was the highest on record and approached the lake class median of 8.4 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 17.4 and 28.5 inches and averaged 21.1 inches.  Six year-classes from age 2 to 8 were sampled with no dominant year class.  Northern pike growth was similar to statewide averages in 2003.Yellow perch were first sampled in Wilson Lake during the 1994 assessment.  In 2003, yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 1.0 fish/net, which was lower than normal for these types of lake.  The fish were small, ranging from 5.9 to 6.6 inches.  Sample size was too small to warrant aging these fish.  Despite low catches in the standard gears, 160 YOY yellow perch, averaging 1.9 inches, were captured during the late August ?-inch trap net assessment.Other species sampled during the lake survey included pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and one 20.2 inch walleye.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike appears to be the predominant predator species within the lake and the average size in the captured sample was 2 lbs.  Largemouth bass appear to be present in average abundance for lakes of this type according to shoreline seining results and local angling reports.  Black crappie and bluegill abundance is below state and local medians but the species appear to have a good size range where larger individuals are readliy sought after by anglers.  Walleye abundance is low and consists mainly of a few, large, adult fish.  Yellow perch were abundant in shoreline seining but only 1 caught in trap nets or gill nets.  Blacknose and golden shiners were most abundant minnow species within the lake.  No fish species have ever been stocked in this lake by the fisheries section.</p>",

This compares to a lake class inter-quartile range of 0.5 to 3.0 per set.  Of the three walleye sampled in this assessment, two were from year classes that were stocked with fry, one fish was 30 inches in length.     Northern pike were the most abundant species sampled in 1994.  The gill net CPUE was 4.3 per set.  The lake class inter-quartile range is 4.8 to 12.5 per set.  The CPUE in 1987 was 5.8 per set.  Growth of northern pike is average to age three and then slow, probably a result of lack of forage.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets for the first time in 1994.  Trap net CPUE was 0.3 per set in both 1994 and 1987, the lake class first quartile is 0.3 per set.     One black crappie was sampled in four gill nets, the same as in 1987.  This is below the lake class first quartile of 1.0 per set.       Bluegill trap net CPUE has increased considerably in 1994 from that observed in 1987, 20.8 per set and 2.0 per set, respectively.  The bluegill CPUE was above the lake class first quartile of 8.3 per set but below the median of 29.2 per set.  Twenty percent of the bluegill sampled were greater than seven inches in length.     Only one largemouth bass was samped in the trap nets, this fish was 8.6 inches in length.       Other species sampled include rock bass, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
