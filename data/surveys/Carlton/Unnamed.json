White Suckers are very abundant and appear to be increasing, while Northern Pike are poorly represented and may be declining.  Bullheads and especially Channel Catfish have increased since 1988.  Smallmouth Bass have increased and while not typical of this lake type, can be considered abundant.  </p>",
