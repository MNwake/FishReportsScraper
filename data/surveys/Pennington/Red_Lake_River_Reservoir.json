                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill trap net catch rates are below the first quartile range for lake class 33.  Anglers contacted while conducting the natural reproduction assessment were having success catching 6-8 inch Bluegills, and reported that many people have been fishing for these Bluegills in the reservoir during the past summer.  In May of 1991, 650 pounds of adult Bluegills were stocked in the reservoir, and this stocking may have contributed to the angler's success.  Evidence of Bluegill natural reproduction was found during the trap netting. Walleye have been stocked regularly during the past ten years.  The gill net catch rate of 2.0/lift is within the first and third quartile ranges for lake class 33.  Skilled anglers report catching Walleye consistently in the tail-water of the dam below the reservoir, but Walleye angling success in the reservoir is considered to be poor.  Northern Pike gill net catch rates, at 7.5/lift, are at the upper end of the interquartile range.  Mean weight of gill net caught Northern Pike was only 1.1 pounds, but this is probably due to the large proportion of one year old fish in the sample (61%).  The abundance of one year old Northern Pike points toward good natural reproduction while water levels were low during 1990.  Largemouth Bass were not sampled well during the netting assessment, but four young-of-year were sampled by 1/4 inch trap nets in August, attesting for some natural reproduction.  The young-of-year Largemouth Bass sampled were all less than four inches long.  Two Smallmouth Bass, including one young-of-year were sampled in August.  Smallmouth Bass have been stocked by fisheries personnel below the dam at Thief River Falls, but not in the reservoir proper.  It is probable that private citizens caught fish in the river below the dam and then released them into the reservoir.  Although Black Crappie trap net catch rates are low (0.2/lift), they are within the interquartile range for lake class 33. Evidence of natural reproduction was found during the 1/4 inch trap net assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Red Lake River Reservoir fish community provides a modest fishery for anglers of all skill levels.  Put and take stocking of bluegill provide a willing biter for less skilled  and experienced anglers alike, while  fishing from shore, the DNR angling pier, or a boat.  Northern pike, although unlikely to ever grow to trophy size due to the biological limitations of the reservoir itself, will always be an important component of this fishery.  Adequate natural reproduction allows this species to maintain a healthy population without stocking.  Walleye pike, while not ever a large proportion of this fish community, will continue to be a very valuable component of this urban fishery.  Although maintained primarily by fall fingerling stocking, the recreational value of these highly sought-after fish is very high.  Skilled or lucky anglers may catch an occasional very large individual of this species.  Hopefully, an increase of catch and release angling will allow this scarce resource to be shared with more anglers.  Many other species swim these waters, albeit at varying abundances and social acceptance.  Anglers who choose to pursue crappie will some years be richly rewarded, and other years, mystified.  Discharge from a water control structure at the outlet of the Thief Lake Wildlife Management Area ( the headwaters of the Thief River ) are occasionally anoxic.   Within the reservoir itself decaying vegetation may also create anoxic conditions.  The future of the fishery of this reservoir will be greatly influenced by agricultural practices within the watershed, the volume, timing and quality of water entering the reservoir, and the impacts of those who use or live near this waterbody.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Red Lake River Reservoir is located within the city of Thief River Falls in Pennington County, northwestern Minnesota.  The reservoir is formed by a hydroelectric dam just downstream of the confluence of the Thief and Red Lake rivers.  The reservoir has a maximum depth of 18 feet, and has been drawn down and dredged in the past to remove heavy sedimentation.  Rooted and emergent aquatic plants are abundant including the invasive curly-leaf pondweed.  Overall, aquatic plants provide good habitat for species such as northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nA full fisheries survey conducted during the summer of 2009 shows a stable walleye population exists within the reservoir.  The catch rate of walleye in the reservoir is similar to the catch rates of similar lakes.  The average size of walleye in the reservoir is about 17 inches with walleye up 28 inches in length present in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were less abundant during this survey compared to past years.  The average size of northern pike in the reservoir is slightly larger than 18 inches, with pike up to 32 inches present.  Anglers typically catch pike from 20 to 30 inches in length and fishing reports indicate that 40 inch pike have been caught.  The northern pike population appears to be in good condition. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral panfish species within the reservoir, including bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and yellow perch, were sampled in low numbers.  Poor habitat quality and lack of reproduction has led to a decline in these species.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and yellow perch can still be caught, and larger fish are present, but anglers need to realize that a good day of fishing on the reservoir will most likely include only 2 to 3 of these fish per day.  On the other hand, one panfish species is doing particularly well in the reservoir.  Rock bass are at the highest abundance ever observed in the reservoir with an average size of 6.5 inches.  A rock bass caught during the 2009 survey was 11 inches indicating that very large rock bass can be caught in the reservoir.  Rock bass are an excellent fighting fish and will provide plenty of action while fishing on the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nAnother interesting find during the 2009 survey was the abundance of freshwater drum in the reservoir.  Freshwater drum abundance was at the highest level ever documented.  The average size fish is about 15 inches with fish up to 20 inches observed in the sample.  The freshwater drum is the only freshwater member of a saltwater family of fish that includes the black drum and red drum, both of which are considered excellent game fish and are highly sought after for the frying pan.  Similarly, the freshwater drum is an excellent tasting fish and is considered by some to be superior to walleye based on taste and texture. <br> \n <br> \nThere are two public water accesses located on the reservoir in the city of Thief River Falls, and the reservoir is navigable to fishing boats and smaller pleasure boats.  A significant connection exists between Red Lake and the Red Lake River Reservoir through the Red Lake River.  Over the years, the reservoir has mirrored the same fishing successes and declines as Red Lake.  Therefore, Red Lake fishing reports may also reflect what is happening in the reservoir.  In addition, Red Lake is surveyed each year as a part of the large lake survey program in Minnesota and data is available on the MN DNR website in the Lake Finder application.  Also, a quality fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish exists downstream of the hydroelectric dam of the reservoir in the Red Lake River, with public access in the city of Thief River Falls.  Overall, the Red Lake River Reservoir and the Red Lake River provide a very unique and productive fishery in northwestern Minnesota. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Red Lake River Reservoir is a unique fishing opportunity in northwestern Minnesota that lies entirely with the city of Thief River Falls. The reservoir is created by a hydroelectric dam located just downstream of the confluence of the Thief River and Red Lake River. Red Lake River Reservoir has a surface area of 139-acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet. The reservoir has abundant in aquatic vegetation in portions of the reservoir. <br> \n\tA fisheries population assessment was conducted during the summer of 2019. Assessment results indicate variety of species inhabit the reservoir. A Walleye catch rate of nearly three fish per net was the highest observed since 1994. Walleye averaged nearly 14 inches in length and the largest fish observed was nearly 27 inches long. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike catch rate of two fish per net was slightly below average for Red Lake River Reservoir. The average size of Northern Pike in the reservoir was slightly under 19 inches, with the largest pike sampled being nearly 33 inches. Average length of Northern Pike was approximately the average when compared to previous surveys. Anglers have reported catching pike that are 20-30 inches and that 40 inch pike have been caught in the past.  <br> \n\tSeveral panfish including Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch inhabit the reservoir. Poor habitat quality and lack of natural reproduction keeps these species in low abundance. Anglers should expect low catches of these fishes. Yellow Perch catch rate remains low though it is slightly higher than the previous survey. Average Yellow Perch length for the 2019 survey of eight inches was near the normal average for Red Lake River Reservoir. The largest Yellow Perch sampled in 2014 was slightly under 10 inches.  <br> \n\tAn interesting discovery made during 2014 was the presence of Channel Catfish above the dam. One Channel Catfish was sampled during an educational event and was approximately 14 inches. Another Channel Catfish was sampled during the 2019 survey confirming the presence of multiple Channel Catfish in Red Lake River Reservoir.  Abundance of Channel Catfish above the dam is likely low. <br> \n\tTwo public water access points are located on the reservoir in the city of Thief River Falls.  In addition to fishing opportunities on the reservoir, opportunities for Channel Catfish, Walleye, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass exist downstream of the dam. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Red Lake River Reservoir presents fishing opportunities in the center of the city of Thief River Falls. The reservoir is created by a dam on the Red Lake River and has two main arms which includes part of the Thief River. This silty bottom reservoir is mostly less than 15 feet deep with sufficient submerged aquatic vegetation to provide good habitat for fish such as northern pike. Fall fingerling stocking of walleye every two out of three years and annual stocking of bluegill sunfish make these species available. Other fish species found here include black crappie, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, fresh water drum (sheepshead), rock bass, bullheads, and white suckers. Two public boat ramps and a fishing pier in town enable both boaters and shore anglers fishing opportunities. Good fishing can also be found below the dam. Northern pike are the most abundant gamefish in this reservoir due to the suitability of the habitat for natural reproduction. Cattails, hardstem bullrush, and other aquatic vegetation provide good pike spawning and nursery areas. Northern pike sampled in 1998 were a wide range of sizes showing many successful year classes. Most pike were between 15-20\" although this year=s sampling caught a 40\" specimen. Patient walleye anglers have the opportunity to occasionally catch a larger fish. Walleye caught in test nets were mostly between 17-22\". Stocking maintains this fishery which is limited by lack of good spawning habitat and possibly a low abundance of suitable food for juvenile fish. Local stories suggest early ice fishing provides the best walleye fishing.Panfish are available in the reservoir as well. Stocked adult bluegills offer opportunity for anglers of various skill. Bluegills stocked in 1998 averaged 8\". Naturally reproducing black crappie populations are known to produce year classes (fish of the same age) that are quite variable in number from year to year. Crappie populations are most likely linked to strong year classes in Red Lake that move down the river. A strong year class of 8-9\" fish is now present in the reservoir and should provide even larger specimens in 1999.Red Lake River Reservoir water quality is influenced by the upper watershed and the area around the reservoir. Sediment and agricultural runoff coming from the Thief River and urban run-off of lawn chemicals and from storm sewer outlets have a negative impact on water clarity and quality. Nutrient enrichment (as from fertilizer) from farmland and residences contributes to dense growths of algae at times. When these algal mats die and decay, oxygen content in the reservoir is reduced. Storm sewer outlets contribute trash and urban pollution (such as oil run-off), as well. Water contributed from Thief Lake and Agassiz wildlife refuge can also be lacking in oxygen (anoxic) which has a negative impact on fish populations, especially when water levels are low. Because of these factors, maintenance of the fishery in Red Lake River Reservoir is a challenge. The Red Lake River fishery is dependent on decisions made in the surrounding watershed as well as stocking and other efforts made within the reservoir. The Red Lake River Reservoir is a fishing venue primarily due to its location rather than its quality. The reservoir=s location in the center of Thief River Falls and the lack of nearby fishing venues creates the need to maintain fishing opportunities in this degraded system. The Thief River enters this reservoir at its head and the sediment load it carries, combined with its agri-chemical load, is most likely the contributor to its rating by MPCA (1996, 305b Report to Congress of the United States) of >not supportive= of swimming and =partially supportive= of aquatic life. The Thief River also rated only partially supportive in terms of oxygen, turbidity, and habitat alteration. The Red Lake River was given similar ratings (except for being supportive of swimming) from its source to the Thief River. However personal observation of the river at its confluence with the Thief indicate it carries less sediment. The heavy sediment loading is most likely due to poor agricultural practices in this area and an unstable stream channel due to channelization. The downstream movement of sediment results in the reservoir acting as a settling pond. This reservoir also has heavy nutrient influx which creates dense beds of aquatic macrophytes. These algal blooms contribute to urban residents desire to remove aquatic vegetation as it collects the algal mats and trash. Multiple use interests for recreation also create pressure for dredging and removing aquatic vegetation in this reservoir. Additionally, The reservoir is vulnerable to anoxic events due to outflow from wildlife management areas (such as Thief Lake SWMA and Aggassiz NWR) which can be confounded by low flows during dry periods. Anoxic events have been recorded under the ice in the reservoir. All these factors make the improvement of fishing resources a challenge.The most numerous naturally producing game fish species found in the reservoir are northern pike. Pike were present across a broad range of age classes, and occasional specimens greater than 30' have been sampled. The greatest strength in this system is the success of the northern pike population. Sampling in 1998 showed the presence of a strong year class of 8-9\" black crappies. Red Lake may be the source for these fish, as this coincides with a known strong year class in this lake. Few walleye were sampled, but the most common year class was of 1994. It is unclear whether these are naturally produced fish or survivors from stocking. No stocking was done in 1994. Yearlings and fingerlings were stocked in 1995 at a low rate (698 and 422 fish, respectively). We also found evidence of many snapping turtles due to the quantity of northerns and other fish eaten and knawed in our gillnets. Very little evidence of natural reproduction was found in the reservoir during this survey despite the use of 1/4\" trap nets. The recapture of stocked blue gills was low and no young-of-the-year were found. The catch rate of yellow perch was also markedly low. Maintenance stocking of bluegills will continue to be necessary to sustain this fishery. It is unclear how much walleye stocking is contributing to the fishery or whether there are naturally reproduced fish present, possibly as emigrants from Red Lake. Historically, Red Lake was likely an important source of walleye production. However, the current depleted state of Red Lake=s fishery effectively discounts it as a source in the near future. The need for stocking walleye continues in order to maintain a fishery. Increased numbers of fish will be stocked (above the total poundage goals) in years where the number per pound rate is low. Most anecdotal fishing reports heard were of walleye ice fishing and some reports of large northern pike. The reservoir was used for fishing during the survey period, primarily by kids. We saw northern pike being caught. The fishing pier was utilized at times.It may be useful to do some water quality analysis to assess the limitations contributing to the lack of juvenile fish. An agricultural chemical analysis and invertebrate presence/absence assessment could be useful for assessing this system.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\t Red Lake River Reservoir is a unique fishing opportunity in northwestern Minnesota that lies entirely with the city of Thief River Falls. The reservoir is maintained by a hydroelectric dam located just downstream of the confluence of the Thief River and Red Lake River. Red Lake River Reservoir has a surface area of 139-acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet. The reservoir is abundant in aquatic vegetation in portions of the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \n\tA fisheries population assessment was conducted during the summer of 2014. Assessment results indicate variety of species inhabit the reservoir. Walleye were present in the 2014 sample, but at low abundance. <br> \n <br> \n\tNorthern Pike abundance was lower than past surveys. The average size of Northern Pike in the reservoir is 19 inches with largest pike sampled being close to 26 inches. Average length of Northern Pike has increased since the past survey. Anglers have reported catching pike that are 20-30 inches and that 40 inch pike have been caught in the past.  <br> \n <br> \n\tSeveral panfish including Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch inhabit the reservoir. Poor habitat quality and lack of natural reproduction keeps these species in low abundance. Anglers should expect low catches of these fishes, but of larger size. Average length of Black Crappie and Bluegill is the highest it's been since 1994. Rock Bass abundance remains high in the reservoir and anglers can expect to catch fish averaging 6 inches. Yellow Perch abundance remains low. Yellow Perch length is the highest recorded since 1994 with fish averaging 9 inches. The largest Yellow Perch sampled in 2014 was just over 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \n\tCommon Carp abundance was the highest reported since being first observed in 1994. Average Common Carp length in the reservoir was approximately 19 inches. High abundance of Common Carp may provide plenty of bowfishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \n\tAnother interesting discovery made during 2014 was the presence of Channel Catfish above the dam. One Channel Catfish was sampled during an educational event and was approximately 14 inches. Overall abundance of Channel Cats above the dam is expected to be low, but a lucky angler might happen to run into one. <br> \n <br> \n\tTwo public water access points are located on the reservoir in the city of Thief River Falls.  In addition to fishing opportunities on the reservoir a quality Channel Catfish, Walleye, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass fishery exists downstream of the dam.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Red Lake River Reservoir presents fishing opportunities in the center of the city of Thief River Falls.  The reservoir is created by a dam on the Red Lake River and has two main arms which includes part of the Thief River.  This silty bottom reservoir is mostly less than 15 feet deep with sufficient submerged aquatic vegetation to provide good habitat for fish such as northern pike.  Fall fingerling stocking of walleye every two out of three years and annual stocking of bluegill sunfish make these species available.  Other fish species found here include black crappie, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, fresh water drum (sheepshead), rock bass, bullheads, and white suckers.  Two public boat ramps and a fishing pier in town enable both boaters and shore anglers fishing opportunities.  Good fishing can also be found below the dam.      Northern pike are the most abundant gamefish in this reservoir due to the suitability of the habitat for natural reproduction.  Cattails, hardstem bullrush, and other aquatic vegetation provide good pike spawning and nursery areas.  Northern pike sampled in 1998 were a wide range of sizes showing many successful year classes.  Most pike were between 15-20\" although this year's sampling caught a 40\" specimen.         Patient walleye anglers have the opportunity to occasionally catch a larger fish.  Walleye caught in test nets were mostly between 17-22\".  Stocking maintains this fishery which is limited by lack of good spawning habitat and possibly a low abundance of suitable food for juvenile fish.  Local stories suggest early ice fishing provides the best walleye fishing.     Panfish are available in the reservoir as well.  Stocked adult bluegills offer opportunity for anglers of various skill.  Bluegills stocked in 1998 averaged 8\".  Naturally reproducing black crappie populations are known to produce year classes (fish of the same age) that are quite variable in number from year to year.  Crappie populations are most likely linked to strong year classes in Red Lake that move down the river.  A strong year class of 8-9\" fish is now present in the reservoir and should provide even larger specimens in 1999.     Red Lake River Reservoir water quality is influenced by the upper watershed and the area around the reservoir.  Sediment and agricultural runoff coming from the Thief River and urban run-off of lawn chemicals and from storm sewer outlets have a negative impact on water clarity and quality.  Nutrient enrichment (as from fertilizer) from farmland and residences contributes to dense growths of algae at times.  When these algal mats die and decay, oxygen content in the reservoir is reduced.  Storm sewer outlets contribute trash and urban pollution (such as oil run-off), as well.  Water contributed from Thief Lake and Agassiz wildlife refuge can also be lacking in oxygen (anoxic) which has a negative impact on fish populations, especially when water levels are low.  Because of these factors, maintenance of the fishery in Red Lake River Reservoir is a challenge.  The Red Lake River fishery is dependent on decisions made in the surrounding watershed as well as stocking and other efforts made within the reservoir.         </p>",
