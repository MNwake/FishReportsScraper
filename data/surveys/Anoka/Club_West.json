                "narrative": "<p>Club West Lake is a 39-acre, man-made lake located in Blaine near the intersection of Highway 65 and 109th Avenue.  Although depths up to 25 feet are present, the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet.  It has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2003 with the goal of providing quality shorefishing opportunities in the city of Blaine.  Black crappies and bluegills were stocked from 2003 to 2005 while northern pike adults and walleye fry were stocked in 2006 and 2004, respectively.  A city park on the north side of lake provides a playground and plenty of shoreline to fish.  Club West's fish community consists of black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and white sucker.     <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye were sampled in low numbers. A single largemouth bass measuring 7.7 inches and one northern pike, measuring 22.4 inches and weighing 2.4 pounds, were sampled by gill net.   Additionally, a gill net sampled two, fast-growing age-3 walleyes averaging nearly 16.8 inches.  The two walleyes are likely individuals from the 200,000 walleye fry stocked in 2004.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies, bluegills, and pumpkinseeds were also sampled in relatively low numbers.  Of the 26 bluegills captured in both gill and trap nets, approximately 46% of the fish sampled were above 6.0 inches, with three fish exceeding 6.5 inches.  Twenty-seven black crappies averaged 7.7 inches and five pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 5.5 inches.   Steep drop-offs and deep frame depths may have affected trap net catches.       <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads, golden shiners, and white suckers were sampled in low numbers during assessment.  Black bullheads averaged nearly 7.0 inches while white suckers averaged approximately 17.0 inches.  Two golden shiners were also encountered in the gill net.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Club West Lake is a 39-acre, man-made lake located in Blaine near the intersection of Highway 65 and 109th Avenue. Although depths up to 25 feet are present, the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet. It has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2003 with the goal of providing quality shorefishing opportunities in the city of Blaine. Black crappies and bluegills were stocked from 2003 to 2005 while northern pike adults and walleye fry were stocked in 2004, 2006 and 2008 respectively.  A city park on the north side of lake provides a playground and plenty of shoreline to fish.  Club West's fish community consists of black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and white sucker.     <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in low numbers. Two largemouth bass measuring 7.24 and 15.91 inches were sampled by trapnet net. Northern pike have an average size in Club West Lake registering in at 25.4 inches. The largest northern pike surveyed measured 29.6 inches and weighed 6.4 pounds which is near the state wide average for northern pike. No walleyes were sampled during this survey. Several fast growing walleyes were sampled in the 2006 survey which were most likely individuals from the 200,000 walleye fry stocked in 2004.  Walleye fry (160,000) have been stocked biennially in Club West Lake since 2008 but none of these fish were detected during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies, bluegills, and pumpkinseeds were also sampled in relatively low numbers.  Of the 41 bluegills captured in both gill and trap nets, only 17% of the fish sampled were above 6.0 inches, with three fish exceeding 6.5 inches.  Fourteen black crappies averaged 6.1 inches which is less than the average size found in the 2006 survey.  One pumpkinseed sunfish was sampled and it measured 3.5 inches.  The physical layout of Club West Lake with its steep shoreline makes for less than ideal panfish trap netting conditions. These steep areas result in deep frame depths for the trapnets and may reduce trap net catches.       <br> \n <br> \nTwo golden shiners were encountered in the gill net and white suckers were sampled in low numbers during this assessment. White suckers averaged approximately 16.1 inches. Black bullheads were found in moderate to abundant numbers and averaged 6.41 inches.   <br> \n</p>",
