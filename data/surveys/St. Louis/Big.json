Low numbers of burbot are also present.  Overall fish populations of 29.8 fish/gill net (32.7 lbs/gill net) are good.Some large northern pike and walleye are present.  Recruitment of yellow perch and walleye is good.  Perch growth is fast by area standards.  Walleye growth was very fast for fish captured in the 1988 assessment, but is very slow for fish captured in the 1993 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Lake (69-0050) also known as Devilfish, is located 13 miles east of Hoyt Lakes.  The public access is via a 2.5 mile long hiking trail administered by the US Forest Service that starts at the Stone Lake access parking lot and goes northeast, crossing the railroad tracks as it approaches the southwest corner of Big Lake.  At the time of this assessment the trail was not being maintained. Contact the US Forest Service Laurentian Ranger District (218-229-8800) for more information.\n\nThis 805 acre lake is the headwater for the South Branch of the Partridge River.  It has a maximum depth of 30.0 feet and the water color is brown.  On July 16, 2013 the lake had a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 55 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for fish to a depth of 21.0 feet.  Shoreline substrates consist of mostly boulder with some sand, gravel, and muck.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined in this survey was 27 fish/gill net which is average for this lake.  Fish species sampled were rock bass (55%), walleye (16%), northern pike (16%), yellow perch (12%), and white sucker (1%).  \n\nThirty-five walleye were caught in gill nets for a rate of 4.4 fish/net, just below the average compared to other similar lakes in the state.  This is a lower catch rate than the two previous surveys that sampled walleye at 26.5 fish/net in 1988 and 8.8 fish/net in 1993.  Fish ranged in size from 7.0 to 22.0 inches with an average of 12.5 inches.  Growth rates for walleye in Big Lake were extremely slow when compared to other walleye lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 1 to 11 with 40% of the fish aged coming from the 2011 year class.  Thirty-one percent of the walleye were infested with neascus (black spot).\n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 4.3 fish/net which is above the average for similar lakes throughout the state.  Lengths ranged from 12.0 to 36.0 inches with an average of 22.0 inches.  Growth is slightly slower than other lakes with northern pike in them in the area.  Ages ranged from 1 to 10.  Twenty-six percent of the pike were infested with neascus (black spot).\n\nThe yellow perch catch rate was 3.4 fish/net and is lower than other similar lakes throughout the state.  Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 10.0 inches with an average of 7.0 inches.  \n\nRock bass numbers have increased over time with the 2013 catch setting the new high mark at 15.0 fish/gill net.  This is much higher than other similar lakes in the state.  The rock bass are also quite large with an average weight of 0.4 pound/fish.  Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 10.0 inches with an average of 8.0 inches.  \n\nThe white sucker catch was the lowest recorded (0.4 fish/gill net) and are showing a declining trend through time.  Lengths ranged from 14.0 to 19.0 inches with an average of 17.0 inches.  \n</p>",
