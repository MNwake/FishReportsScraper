                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Lake Wakanda was conducted during mid-July of 2022. The targeted survey was conducted with 1 gillnet and 4 trapnets to determine fish assemblage and abundance after opening the lake to unlimited fishing, a drawdown/drought and previous low (< 1 ppm) winter oxygen levels. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Wakanda during September 27, 2022. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A standard survey was last conducted during July of 2021. <br> \n <br> \nWakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development is limited to the south shore. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and eventually outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Submergent vegetation densities are variable in Wakanda. Sago pondweed is usually the most frequently occurring submergent species. Submergent vegetation was abundant especially in the shallow bay areas due in part to extremely low water conditions during 2021. Abundant submergent vegetation species included coontail, sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss in 2021. Abundant densities of submergent vegetation were observed in the bay areas but lacking in the main basin during 2022. Filamentous algae is usually abundant in Wakanda. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and common during mid to late summer months but were less intense during 2021 and 2022. Wakanda receives high flows of agricultural and storm sewer runoff via tiles and ditches. Water clarity is often good from ice out to mid-June, but poor during the remainder of the summer. The secchi disc reading was 2.5 feet on July 6, 2022. Water clarity was good in the bay areas, but poor (gray stained) in the mid basin area. Water levels were below normal during 2020 and 2021. A drawn down was also initiated during 2020-2021 to facilitate a winterkill of less desirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullheads) in accordance with management plan objectives formalized by the DNR Wildlife & Fisheries, Ducks Unlimited and local conservation and governmental groups. The Wakanda maximum depth was only 11 feet in 2021 summer compared to the historical depth of 15 feet. Water levels rebounded in 2022 to allow use of the public accesses but was still low compared to normal levels. Boat access was severely limited due to low/shallow water in 2021. Dissolved oxygen levels were supersaturated (14-19 ppm) from the surface down to 8 feet of water during the July 2021 survey, but in the normal range (5-7 ppm) during the July 2022 survey. Total phosphorus levels (0.177 ppm) were high on June 13, 2016. A large upstream wetland restoration (Grass Lake Project) is currently underway to potentially reduce or buffer storm water runoff from the city of Willmar and improve incoming water quality flowing into Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. Wakanda was opened to unlimited fishing during the 2021-22 winter because of the continued drawdown and non-operation of the aeration system. Some local anglers who participated in unlimited fishing season on Wakanda claimed the caught Walleye tasted poorly. <br> \n <br> \nPartial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period. A significant winterkill of gamefish and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013. The helixor aeration system was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due in part to high snowfall accumulations. The helixor aeration system was not operated during the 2013-14 winter in part to facilitate a winterkill of undesirable fish (Common Carp) and also because the 2013 Walleye fry stocking was a failure. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured from 1 to 1.9 ppm during early February of 2014. Common Carp and Black Bullhead were present in 2014 ice out trapnets in Wakanda. It appears that even with a severe and prolonged winter with low oxygen conditions that a complete winterkill of undesirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullhead) did not occur in 2014. The helixor aeration was moved into shallower water with more rock substrates and away from silt and muck substrates in the fall of 2014. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation resulting in good oxygen levels in many susceptible winterkill lakes. The Wakanda helixor aeration system appeared to maintain good dissolved oxygen levels at 5.0 ppm throughout the 2014-15 and 2015-16 winters, however nearby shallow lakes without aeration had higher oxygen levels (>7 ppm). Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and large Northern Pike during the 2016 summer. A partial winterkill occurred during February of 2019, mostly Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo and White Sucker in addition to some gamefish. We did catch low numbers of gamefish (Walleye, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie and Northern Pike) in 2019 ice out trapnets. The aeration system was not operated during 2020-21 and 2021-22 winters. There were no reports or evidence of winterkill for the 2020-2021 winter. Oxygen level were extremely low (0.3-0.9 ppm) during late February of 2021. Dissolved oxygen levels were variable during the 2021-22 winter due in part to low water levels, colder temperatures, variability in snow cover, and overabundance of submergent vegetation in some basins (i.e., Elizabeth). In 2021-22 winter, high snowfall cover coupled with low water and decaying of high submergent vegetation densities in some area lakes resulted in rapid declines of winter oxygen levels. Oxygen levels ranged from 6.8 ppm in early January of 2022 to 1.5 ppm at the end of February 2022 for Wakanda. There were no reports of winterkill for the 2021-22 winter. The aeration system was operated in the 2022-23 winter (extreme snowfall conditions). Winter dissolved oxygen readings near the aeration system was around 5 ppm on February 7, 2023 which was better than other nearby lakes like Elizabeth and Ella (1-2 ppm). Gamefish often become susceptible to winterkill when oxygen levels are less than 1 ppm for an extended period. There were no reports of winterkill in Wakanda in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was high (75.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022, but comparable to 2021 (65.67 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 29.62 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Yellow Perch average weight and length were 0.19 pounds and 7.2 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from gillnets. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) was high (25.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Yellow Perch catch rate of preferred size (10.0 inches plus) was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The largest Yellow Perch captured was 11.14 inches in the 2022 survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch were noted in August of 2022 seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The 2021 Northern Pike survey abundance was 6.00 fish/gillnet. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 6.75 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Northern Pike average weight and length were 4.26 pounds and 27.2 inches from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.94 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike growth rates were excellent for ages 1-3. The 2019 year class comprised 100% of the 2022 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Wakanda in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (1.25 fish/trapnet) in 2022. Bluegill were absent in 2021 survey nets. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.12 fish/trapnet. The 2022 Bluegill average weight and length were 0.09 pounds and 4.7 inches respectively from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.10 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie were absent in 2022 survey nets. Black Crappie abundance was moderate in 2021 (3.14 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 0.82 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Crappie average weight and length were 0.10 pounds and 5.8 inches from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.36 pounds and 0.12 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was moderate (8.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Walleye abundance was higher (44.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 21.93 fish/gillnet. The 2022 Walleye average weight and length were 2.01 pounds and 17.8 inches from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.44 pounds from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) was moderate (7.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The Walleye catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches plus) was 0.00 fish/gillnet in 2022. Walleye growth rates excellent for ages 1-4, but slow for ages 5-6. The 2019 and 2016 year classes (fry stocked) comprised 78% and 11% respectively of the 2022 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The largest Walleye captured was 18.7 inches in the 2022 survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is probably insignificant during most years, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Walleye fry (493,587 Spicer Strain fish) were recently stocked in 2022. Spicer strain Walleye fry (404,928 fish) were stocked in 2019. Pike River strain Walleye fry (1.2 million Pike River strain) were stocked in 2018. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked in 2016 (Pike River strain), 2014 (Private and Spicer strains) and 2013 (Pike River strain).  <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (118.00 YOY/hour, 7.4 inches) in 2022 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (276.00 YOY/hour, 7.3 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were also abundant in 2018 (285.00 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches), 2016 (90.00 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) and 2014 (464.00 YOY/hour, 7.9 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches) were captured in the (fry stocked year) 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) were also observed in the (fry stocked year) 2009 fall electrofishing survey. However, most of the 2011 and 2009 year class walleyes died during the January/February 2013 winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were absent in the 2021 survey nets. Only one Channel Catfish (0.25 fish/trapnet, 6.0 inches) was captured in the 2022 survey. Channel Catfish abundance was moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2016 Channel Catfish average size was large from gillnets (8.22 pounds, 27.7 inches). Channel Catfish were first documented in Wakanda during a 2006 survey. Channel Catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. Channel Catfish may have moved into the Wakanda from the outlet via the connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo abundance in 2022 (2.00 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (0.52 fish/gillnet). The 2021 Bigmouth Buffalo gillnet catch rate was 2.67 fish/gillnet. Bigmouth Buffalo trapnet catch rate was 0.50 fish/trapnet in 2022. The 2022 Bigmouth Buffalo average size was 1.79 pounds and 7.66 pounds respectively from gillnets and trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was high (141.00 fish/gillnet, 81.25 fish/trapnet) in 2022. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rates are 87.72 fish/gillnet and 177.90 fish/trapnet. Black Bullhead abundance was high in 2021 (74.00 fish/gillnet). The 2022 Black Bullhead average weight and length were 0.21 pounds and 7.0 inches from gillnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from gillnets. The largest Black Bullhead captured was 12.0 inches in the 2022 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance was high (9.25 fish/trapnet) in 2022. Common Carp abundance was 6.00 fish/trapnet in 2021. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 17.17 fish/trapnet. Common Carp abundance was 11.00 fish/gillnet (0.21 pounds average) in 2022 gillnets. The 2022 Common Carp average weight and length were 4.73 pounds and 20.2 inches from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 3.71 pounds from trapnets. The largest Common Carp captured was 32.1 inches in the 2022 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker abundance was high (14.00 fish/gillnet) in 2022. The 2022 average weight and length were 1.14 pounds and 13.6 inches respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2026. Fall electrofishing surveys may be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wagonga is a shallow (15 feet maximum depth) and productive lake. Water clarity was fairto poor water clarity in past summers (secchi=4.0 ft on 6/13/94). However, water clarity wasexcellent in June of 1996 (14.5 ft on 6/12/96, 9.8 ft on 6/26/96). Water quality results froma sample taken on 6/12/96 are as follows: pH=8.21, Total Alkalinity=169 ppm, Total DissolvedSolids=496 ppm, Conductivity=660 uMHO/cm, Total Phosphorus=0.163 ppm, and Chlorophyll a=2.9ppb. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus) in 1996. A bubbler (helixor) aerationsystem (12 units) was installed in November of 1995 and first operated during January of1996. However, a partial winterkill occurred in 1996 due to prior heavy snowfall events anda late start up (January) of the bubbler system resulting in low dissolved oxygen water beingmixed within the lake instead of oxygenated water. Submergent vegetation (sago pondweed,water moss) was moderate to abundant in the bay areas. Filamentous algae was abundantthroughout the lake. Nuisance blue-green algae blooms were often intense and frequent duringthe summer in Wagonga. Common cattail was found along the northeast and southwest bayshorelines. Reed canary grass was also a common emergent species. Sand, silt, and gravel werethe primary shoalwater substrates. Walleye potential spawning sites are limited to severalgravel shoal points, however siltation of these substrates due to wind/wave action or carpactivity probably precludes any significant hatching success in these areas. Northern pikespawning sites include an inlet marsh area (NE side of lake), County Ditch#23A, Lake Eleanor,and several unnamed ditches/inlets (NW & SW side of lake). In 1990, water control structureswere installed at the overland ditch outlet and downstream at the Little Kandiyohi Lake (34-0096 ) outlet. Fish barriers (swinging metal fingers) were installed in March of 1996 on theoverland ditch, between Wagonga and Little Kandiyohi adjacent to County Road #8, and betweenthe upstream lakes of Kasota (34-0105) and Minnetaga (34-0076). The purpose of these barrierswere to prevent immigration of carp and bullheads into Lake Wagonga while promotingwinterkill of these fish in shallow game\\waterfowl lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota). Wagongais relatively undeveloped with 8 homes. Agricultural cropland dominates the surroundingwatershed. The immediate shoreline is composed of a hardwood shoreline fringe adjacent toagricultural row cropland and marshlands areas. Nutrient runoff into Wagonga is significantvia various inlets/ditches from both agricultural and municipal (Willmar storm sewer,Kandiyohi sanitary & storm sewer system) sources. Several government agencies (state, county,city) are proposing to restore an upstream drained wetland/lake (Grass Lake Project) in orderto filter the Willmar storm sewer water that eventually enters into Wagonga. However, publicand private funding is presently insufficient for completing the project. It is projectedthat at least 6 million dollars is needed to install lift stations and obtain easements.Grant money (private and public) has been obtained to acquire most of the easements, howeverit will probably take several years before additional funding is available to purchase thelift stations (4 million dollars) and remaining easements. Wagonga is a designated state fallwaterfowl resting area from September 1 to the close of waterfowl season each year. Thefollowing restrictions during the waterfowl resting period includes: no outboard motorallowed; no electric trolling motor greater than 30 lbs of thrust allowed. Wagonga ispresently managed for walleye and northern pike as the primary species with yellow perch asthe secondary species. Presently, Wagonga is scheduled to be stocked with walleye fry (about1.7 million fry) every other year.     A cursory spring electrofishing survey was conducted May 13, 1996 to assess the relativeabundance of various fish species after a winterkill occurred during the 1995-96 winter.There were no game fish observed, however several alive adult white sucker and small carpwere seen by fisheries personnel. Many dead and decaying carp were observed along theshoreline.     A resurvey was conducted on Wagonga in summer of 1996 to better assess the various fishpopulations in Wagonga. Standard fish population sampling was done with gillnets, trapnets,and shoreline seining. Other data collected included water quality, inlet/outlet flows,submergent/emergent vegetation abundance, water levels, watershed characteristics, and theidentification of pollution/erosion areas.     Walleye abundance (0.8 fish/gillnet) in the summer of 1996 was below the 1st and 3rdmedian interquartile range (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41, but similar toprevious years (0.3 fish/gillnet in 1992, 0.0 fish/gillnet in 1988). Adult (1,367 fish, 1.0lbs. average size) and yearling (2,487 fish, 0.6 lbs average size) walleye were stocked intoWagonga from carry over walleye rearing ponds in the fall of 1995. Unfortunately, theaeration system did not operate as expected during the first winter (1996) resulting in asignificant loss of these fish due to winterkill conditions in Wagonga.      Walleye (1,666,347 fry) were stocked into Wagonga in May of 1996 (Table 1.) after apartial winterkill was confirmed for 1995-96. A fall night electrofishing survey wasconducted in 1996 to determine relative walleye young of year (YOY) abundance and whether thefry stocking was successful. The YOY walleye abundance (284.0 YOY/hour) was excellent in thefall of 1996 (Table 2.). The 1996 YOY walleye abundance in Wagonga was above the overallmedian 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (36.0 - 265.5 YOY/hour) for area fry stockedlakes. The walleye YOY average size (7.2 inches) was excellent in Wagonga (Table 3.). The YOYwalleye overall average size is 6.2 inches for all area fry stocked lakes. There were noyearling walleye captured in the 1996 fall electrofishing survey (Table 4.).     The northern pike abundance (8.8 fish/gillnet) in the summer of 1996 was above the 1stand 3rd median interquartile range (1.2 - 7.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and aboveprevious surveys (1.5 fish/gillnet in 1992, 3.0 fish/gillnet in 1988). The 1996 average sizewas 3.0 lbs (22.2 inches) from gillnets. The largest northern pike caught was 32.3 inches.The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 62.7% and 15.7% respectively. There were no obvious differencesof northern pike abundance by age I-III classes. The growth rates were above average for ageI-III fish compared to other area lakes. There were no YOY northern pike observed in the 1996fall electrofishing survey (Table 5.).     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (42.3 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.0 - 22.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 41 and above previous surveys(3.5 fish/gillnet in 1992, 29.7 fish/gillnet in 1988). The 1996 average size was 7.4 inches(0.25 lbs) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch caught was 10.6 inches. The 1996 PSD andRSD-P was 42.5% and 1.7% respectively. About 54% of yellow perch belonged to the 1994 yearclass and 36% belonged to 1995 year class. Grow rates appear above average for ages I-IVcompared to other area lakes. YOY yellow perch abundance was low (1.4 fish/seine haul) duringthe 1996 August seining survey.     Carp abundance in the 1996 summer (5.6 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.7 - 5.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but below the 1992 survey(12.5 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size was 5.4 lbs from trapnets compared to 4.7 lbs in1992 and 2.3 lbs in 1988. The 1996 YOY carp abundance (19.5 YOY/seine haul) was aboveprevious August seine haul surveys (8.5 fish/seine haul in 1992, 0.5 fish/seine haul in1988).     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (72.9 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.3 - 78.1 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 41, but below previous surveys(82.1 fish/trapnet in 1992, 269.0 fish/trapnet in 1988). The 1996 average size was 5.7 inches(0.13 lbs). There were no YOY black bullhead caught in the 1996 August seining survey.      Although a partial winterkill occurred during the first year of aeration operation inWagonga, abundant numbers of northern pike and yellow perch survived. In addition, non-gamefish such as carp and black bullhead appear abundant even though the numbers wereslightly lower than previous years. These four species are the least prone to winterkillduring low dissolved oxygen conditions unlike other species such as bluegill, walleye,largemouth bass, and black crappie. Presently, the aeration system on Wagonga appears to beworking well with dissolved oxygen readings at 7.4 ppm during late February of 1997 near theopen water area. Several shallow non-aerated fish lakes have experience winterkill conditionswith dissolved oxygen readings less than 1.0 ppm. The aeration system worked better in 1996-97 because it was started earlier in the winter. In addition, the operation of the aeratorin 1995-96 probably dispersed a sufficient amount of silt, sediment, and muck away from thebottom of the substrate where the bubbler was located, thus resulting in less mixing ofanoxia water/substrates the following year. Hopefully the excellent walleye year class froma 1996 fry stocking will be recruited to acceptable size for anglers in the next two-threeyears. There appears to be an abundance of forage (yellow perch, black bullhead) for bothwalleye and northern pike. Management priorities will include the oversight of aerationoperation every year, stocking of walleye fry every even year, maintaining the present fishbarriers, encouraging best management practices (planting buffer strips, conservationtillage, manure management, wetland restoration) within the watershed. In addition, Area DNRoffices (Wildlife, Fisheries, etc.) will continue to seek funding and support for completingthe Grass Lake restoration project. Fall electrofishing will occur after each precedingspring walleye fry stocking and a lake survey will be scheduled in 1999 to provide valuableinformation about the fishery and to reevaluate the management of Wagonga.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Wakanda was conducted during mid-July of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nWakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development is limited to the south shore. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and eventually outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Submergent vegetation densities are variable in Wakanda. Sago pondweed is usually the most frequently occurring submergent species. Submergent vegetation was abundant especially in the shallow bay areas due in part to low water conditions during 2021. Abundant submergent vegetation species included coontail, sago pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and watermoss. Filamentous algae was also frequently occurring in Wakanda. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and common during mid to late summer months but were less intense during 2021. Wakanda receives high flows of agricultural and storm sewer runoff via tiles and ditches. Water clarity is often good from ice out to mid-June, but poor during the remainder of the summer. The secchi disc reading was 3.0 feet on July 12, 2021. Water levels were below normal during 2020 and 2021. A drawn down was also initiated during 2020-2021 to facilitate a winterkill of less desirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullheads) in accordance with management plan objectives formalized by the DNR Wildlife & Fisheries, Ducks Unlimited and local conservation and governmental groups. The Wakanda maximum depth was only 11 feet in 2021 summer compared to this historical depth of 15 feet. Boat access was severely limited due to low/shallow water in 2021. Dissolved oxygen levels were supersaturated (14-19 ppm) from the surface down to 8 feet of water during the July 2021 survey. Total phosphorus levels (0.177 ppm) were high on June 13, 2016. A large upstream wetland restoration (Grass Lake Project) is currently underway to potentially reduce or buffer storm water runoff from the city of Willmar and improve incoming water quality flowing into Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. Wakanda was opened to unlimited fishing during the 2021-22 winter because of the continued drawdown and non-operation of the aeration system. <br> \n <br> \nPartial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. A significant winterkill of gamefish and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013. The helixor aeration system was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due in part to high snowfall accumulations. The helixor aeration system was not operated during the 2013-14 winter in part to facilitate a winterkill of undesirable fish (Common Carp) and also because the 2013 Walleye fry stocking was a failure. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured from 1 to 1.9 ppm during early February of 2014. Common Carp and Black Bullhead were present in 2014 ice out trapnets in Wakanda. It appears that even with a severe and prolonged winter with low oxygen conditions that a complete winterkill of undesirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullhead) did not occur in 2014. The helixor aeration was moved into shallower water with more rock substrates and away from silt and muck substrates in the fall of 2014. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation resulting in good oxygen levels in many susceptible winterkill lakes. The Wakanda helixor aeration system appeared to maintain dissolved oxygen levels at 5.0 ppm throughout the 2014-15 and 2015-16 winters, however nearby shallow lakes without aeration had higher oxygen levels (>7 ppm). Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and large Northern Pike during the 2016 summer. A partial winterkill occurred during February of 2019, mostly Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo and White Sucker in addition to some gamefish. We did catch low numbers of gamefish (Walleye, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie and Northern Pike) in 2019 ice out trapnets. The aeration system was not operated during 2020-21 and 2021-22 winters. There were no reports or evidence of winterkill for 2020-2021 winter. Oxygen level were extremely low (0.3-0.9 ppm) during late February of 2021. Dissolved oxygen levels were variable during the 2021-22 winter due in part to low water levels, colder temperatures, variability in snow cover, and overabundance of submergent vegetation in some basins (i.e., Elizabeth). In 2021-22 winter, high snowfall cover coupled with low water and decaying of high submergent vegetation densities in some area lakes resulted in rapid declines of winter oxygen levels. These conditions may result in possible winterkill of fish in some area lakes in 2022. Oxygen levels ranged from 6.8 ppm in early January of 2022 to 1.5 ppm at the end of February 2022 for Wakanda. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2021 was high (65.67 fish/gillnet) for Wakanda. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 23.95 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.23 pounds and 7.48 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from gillnets. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.00 plus inches) was high (27.67 fish/gillnet) in 2021. The Yellow Perch catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) was 6.00 fish/gillnet in 2021. Yellow Perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2015 and 2018 year classes each comprised 27% of the 2021 Yellow Perch survey catch. The largest Yellow Perch captured was 11.38 inches in the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2021 was high (6.00 fish/gillnet) for Wakanda. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 7.47 fish/gillnet. The Northern Pike average size was small (1.82 pounds and 20.31 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.78 pounds from gillnets. The Northern Pike catch rate of quality size (21.00 plus inches) was 1.00 fish/gillnet in 2021. Northern Pike growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2018 year class comprised 78% of the 2021 Northern Pike survey catch. The largest Northern Pike captured was 26.34 inches in the 2021 survey. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Wakanda in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were absent in 2021 survey nets. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.10 fish/trapnet. The Bluegill historical average weight was small (0.10 pounds) from trapnets.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2021 was moderate (3.14 fish/trapnet) for Wakanda. The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 0.93 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Crappie average size was small (0.10 pounds and 5.83 inches from trapnets). The Black Crappie historical average weights are 0.36 pounds and 0.12 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively. Small sized Black Crappie (2.67 fish/gillnet, 0.11 pounds average weight) were also captured in the 2021 gillnets. The largest Black Crappie captured was 7.09 inches in the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was high (44.33 fish/gillnet) for Wakanda. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 23.67 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Walleye average size was moderate (1.68 pounds and 16.85 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.35 pounds from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) was high (40.67 fish/gillnet) in 2021. The Walleye catch rate of preferred size (20.00 plus inches) was high (6.33 fish/gillnet) in 2021. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2019 and 2016 year classes (fry stocked) comprised 73.5% and 19.1% respectively of the 2021 Walleye survey catch. The largest Walleye captured was 23.66 inches in the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is probably insignificant during most years, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Spicer strain Walleye fry (404,928 fish) were stocked in 2019. Pike River strain Walleye fry (1.2 million Pike River strain) were stocked in 2018. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked in 2016 (Pike River strain), 2014 (Private and Spicer strains) and 2013 (Pike River strain). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (276.00 YOY/hour, 7.31 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were also abundant in 2018 (285.00 YOY/hour, 6.20 inches), 2016 (90.00 YOY/hour, 6.84 inches) and 2014 (464.00 YOY/hour, 7.91 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 5.93 inches) were captured in the (fry stocked year) 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 YOY/hour, 5.78 inches) were also observed in the (fry stocked year) 2009 fall electrofishing survey. However, most of the 2011 and 2009 year class walleyes died during the January/February 2013 winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were absent in the 2021 survey nets. Channel Catfish abundance was moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2016 Channel Catfish average size was large from gillnets (8.22 pounds, 27.69 inches). Channel Catfish were first documented in Wakanda during a 2006 survey. Channel Catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. Channel Catfish may have moved into the Wakanda from the outlet via the connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo abundance in 2021 (2.67 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (0.33 fish/gillnet). The 2021 Bigmouth Buffalo average size was small (0.42 pounds) from gillnets. Bigmouth Buffalo were absent from the trapnets in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2021 gillnets was high (74.00 fish/gillnet), but near the historical average catch rate (81.06 fish/gillnet). Black Bullhead trapnet abundance in 2021 was 12.43 fish/trapnet for Wakanda. The Black Bullhead historical average trapnet catch rate is 189.99 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Bullhead average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.56 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from trapnets. The 2021 Black Bullhead average size was small (0.29 pounds and 7.65 inches) from gillnets. The largest Black Bullhead captured was 14.17 inches in the 2021 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2021 was moderate (6.00 fish/trapnet) for Wakanda. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 18.16 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Common Carp average size was moderate (3.39 pounds and 15.71 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 3.58 pounds from trapnets. The largest Common Carp captured was 32.28 inches in the 2021 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included abundant numbers of White Sucker (7.67 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of White Crappie (0.67 fish/gillnet). The 2021 average sizes were 1.88 and 0.08 pounds respectively for White Sucker and White Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2026. Fall electrofishing surveys may be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Wakanda during September 11, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Wakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and eventually outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Partial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. A significant winterkill of gamefish (Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie) and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013 and a partial winterkill in 2014. Black Bullhead and Northern Pike appeared to be two species that survived in adequate numbers during both winterkill events. The helixor aeration system was moved from deeper water with softer substrates to shallower water with rock substrates in the 2014 fall. Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and large Northern Pike during the 2016 summer. Oxygen levels were good through January of 2019, but heavy snowfall during February lowered oxygen levels in many shallow area lakes. A partial winterkill occurred in February of 2019 even though the aeration system was operational all winter long. We observed abundant numbers of dead Common Carp, White Sucker and Bigmouth Buffalo. We also saw low numbers of dead adult Walleye, Black Bullhead and Yellow Perch. However, we caught numerous gamefish in our 2019 spring test nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is insignificant during most years based on previous surveys and standard analysis, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Walleye fry (1.2 million Pike River strain) were last stocked in 2018. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked each year during the 2016 (Pike River strain), 2014 (Private and Spicer strains) and 2013 (Pike River strain).  <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2018 (285.00 YOY/hour, 6.20 inches) and 2016 (90.00 YOY/hour, 6.84 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant YOY walleye numbers were captured (464.00 YOY/hour, 7.91 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 5.93 inches) were captured in the (fry stocked year) 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 YOY/hour, 5.78 inches) were also observed in the (fry stocked year) 2009 fall electrofishing survey. However, most of the 2011 and 2009 year class walleyes died during the January/February 2013 winterkill. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2018. We observed abundant YOY Yellow Perch and adult Walleye, in addition to moderate numbers of adult White Sucker in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (39.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Wakanda and similar lakes in the most recent 2016 summer gillnet survey. The 2016 Walleye average weight and length were 1.05 pounds and 14.66 inches from gillnets. The 2014 year class comprised 96% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Lake Wagonga was conducted in early June of 2002. Wagonga is a large, shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A twelve subsurface helixor aeration system is operated during the winter months to prevent winterkill of gamefish. In the past, operational problems with the aeration system in conjunction with adverse winter conditions resulted in partial winterkills (1995-96, 1996-97, 1999-2000) of both gamefish (walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie) and non-gamefish (carp, black bullhead). However, the winterkills were not complete, thus adequate brood stock numbers of most fish species were present to reproduce in the lake. Also, gamefish were restocked into the lake after each partial winterkill. Wagonga was recently stocked with 1.68 million walleye fry and 303 walleye yearlings in the spring of 2000, 1.67 million walleye fry in the spring of 2002, 370 northern pike adults in January of 2001, and 98 black crappie adults in May of 2002.Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2002 (2.8 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes, but the highest historical recorded value for Wagonga. The black crappie average size was small (0.15 lbs. and 5.8 inches) from the trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in Wagonga were generally within the normal range compared to area lakes. The largest black crappie captured was 11.8 inches. Approximately 84% of the black crappie captured in the 2002 assessment were hatched in 2001.Northern pike numbers were abundant in 2002 (32.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the Wagonga historical average catch rate (9.4 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike average size was small (1.41 lbs. and 17.9 inches) from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Wagonga were below the normal range for ages 1-3 compared to area lakes. Northern pike hatched in 2000 accounted for 80% of the northern pike captured in the 2002 assessment. The largest northern pike captured was 32.7 inches. It appears that the low numbers of northern pike brood stock, which survived the 1999-2000 partial winterkill, produced an excellent year class in the spring of 2000.Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2002 (17.0 fish/gillnet), and above the previous 2000 Wagonga summer survey (3.5 fish/gillnet). The yellow perch historical average is 19.2 fish/gillnet. The 2002 yellow perch average size was large (0.40 lbs. and 8.9 inches) from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 10.6 inches. Walleye numbers were abundant in 2002 (43.0 fish/gillnet) assessment and the highest recorded value for Wagonga. The walleye historical catch rate is 8.8 fish/gillnet. The 2002 walleye average size was small (0.83 lbs. and 12.4 inches) from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 22.4 inches in the 2002 assessment. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (6.0 fish/gillnet). Walleye hatched in 2000 (walleye fry stocking) accounted for 78% of the walleye catch in the 2002 summer assessment nets. Walleye natural reproduction in Wagonga is generally absent or rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. However, moderate walleye natural reproduction was documented in 2001 based on scale aging of walleye yearlings caught in the 2002 summer assessment. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye abundance was moderate (48.5 YOY/hour) in the 2002 fall electrofishing survey. These fish were probably from a 2002 spring walleye fry stocking. Local anglers reported excellent success catching walleye (1-2 lbs.) during the early ice-fishing season in December of 2002. Both black bullhead (223.0 fish/gillnet) and carp (41.0 fish/trapnet) numbers were abundant in 2002 compared to the historical averages (94.8 black bullhead/gillnet, 24.0 carp/trapnet). Also, black bullhead and carp average sizes were small (0.11 lbs. for black bullhead, 0.85 lbs. for carp). Although, significant numbers of black bullhead and carp died during recent partial winterkills, unfortunately low numbers of surviving brood fish rapidly replenished bullhead and carp numbers in the lake through natural reproduction.Current fish management activities on Wagonga include assisting Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Lake Wagonga fishery will be surveyed in the 2006 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Lake Wakanda was conducted in mid July of 2006. Wakanda is a large (1,664 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Partial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990\u0019s due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. Water levels were below normal during the 2006 summer due to drought like conditions. Submergent vegetation densities are variable in Wakanda. Sago pondweed is usually the most frequently occurring submergent species. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and common during mid to late summer months. Wakanda receives moderate to high levels of agricultural and storm sewer runoff via tiles and ditches. Water clarity is often good from ice out to mid June, but poor during the remainder of the summer. Residential development is limited to the south shore of Wakanda. Walleye fry are generally stocked every other year or after years of poor fry survival. Local residents and various government officials are developing a new comprehensive management plan for Wakanda. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2006 (0.87 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.77 pounds and 10.22 inches from trapnets). The black crappie historical average length is 8.93 inches from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (8.27 fish/trapnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill catch rate in 2006 was the highest recorded value for Wakanda. The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.48 inches from trapnets).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2006 (3.00 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The Wakanda northern pike historical average catch rate is 8.29 fish/gillnet. The 2006 northern pike average size was moderate (2.74 pounds and 22.67 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average length is 21.56 inches from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Wakanda were above or within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005, 2002, and 2000 year classes comprised the majority of the northern pike captured in the 2006 summer assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2006 (14.50 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes, but slightly below the Wakanda historical average catch rate (18.40 fish/gillnet). The 2006 yellow perch average size was moderate to large (0.39 pounds and 8.91 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average length is 7.89 inches from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2006 (62.00 fish/gillnet) and above the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 walleye catch rate was the highest recorded value for Wakanda. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.53 pounds and 16.10 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average length is 14.77 inches from gillnets. Walleye were also abundant in the 2006 trapnet sets (6.80 fish/trapnet, average length=16.43 inches). The 2006 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (48.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates for age 1-8 were near the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges. The majority of walleye captured in the 2006 assessment were from the 2004 and 2002 year classes. Local anglers reported excellent success catching walleye (1-2 pounds) during the early ice-fishing seasons of 2004-2006. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Wakanda is generally rare based on previous fall and summer surveys. Young of year \u001cYOY\u001d walleye numbers were abundant (88.57 YOY/hour, 5.18 inches average length) in the 2006 fall electrofishing survey (fry stocked year). The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 70.35 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction combined. Walleye fry have been stocked recently into Wakanda during 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 1996 (284.00 YOY/hour, 7.23 inches average length) for a fry stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were numbers moderate to abundant in 2006 (58.00 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The Wakanda black bullhead historical average catch rate is 88.67 fish/gillnet. The 2006 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.30 pounds and 7.88 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average length is 7.39 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2006 (55.50 fish/gillnet) and above the normal range for similar lakes. The carp abundance in the 2006 trapnets was also high (10.73 fish/trapnet, 3.26 pounds average weight). The 2006 carp average size was small (2.10 pounds and 16.10 inches from gillnets). The carp historical average length is 11.70 inches from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (1.73 fish/trapnet), and the highest recorded value for Wakanda. The 2006 channel catfish average size was small (0.36 pounds and 6.78 inches from trapnets). Channel catfish have never been stocked in Wakanda by the DNR. However, downstream lakes like Big Kandiyohi have moderate channel catfish numbers and periodic stockings. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include assisting Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The Lake Wakanda fishery is scheduled for survey in the 2011 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" walleye on Lake Wakanda on September 15, 2015. Walleye fry are stocked generally every other year or after winterkill events. A significant winterkill of gamefish and carp occurred during January/February of 2013. The helixor aeration system was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due in part to high snowfall accumulations. <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked each year during the 2014 and 2013 springs. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye were captured (464.00 YOY/hour, 7.91 inches average length) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 5.93 inches average) were captured in the previous (fry stocked year) 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 YOY/hour, 5.78 inches average) were also observed in the (fry stocked year) 2009 fall electrofishing survey. However, most of the 2011 and 2009 year class walleyes died during the January of 2013 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe helixor aeration system was not operated during the 2013-14 winter in part to facilitate a winterkill of undesirable fish (carp) in Wakanda and also because the 2013 walleye fry stocking was a failure. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured from 1 to 1.9 ppm during early February of 2014. Common carp and black bullhead were present in 2014 ice out nets in Wakanda. It appears that even with a severe and prolonged winter with low oxygen conditions that a complete winterkill of undesirable fish species (carp, bullheads) did not occur in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nThe helixor aeration was moved into shallower water with more rock substrates and away from silt and muck substrates in the fall of 2014. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation resulting in good oxygen levels in many susceptible winterkill lakes. The Wakanda helixor aeration system appeared to maintain dissolved oxygen levels at 5.0 ppm throughout the 2014-15 winter, however nearby shallow lakes without aeration had higher oxygen levels (>7 ppm). The Lake Wakanda fishery will be surveyed in the 2016 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wagonga Lake is a shallow, aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Atwelve subsurface helixor aeration system is operated during the winter months to preventwinterkill of gamefish. However, recent operational problems with the system in conjunctionwith adverse winter conditions have resulted in partial winterkills (1995-1996, 1996-97, and1999-2000 winters). A special assessment netting (five single frame 1/2 inch bar measure meshtrapnets) was conducted in Wagonga on March 21, 2000 in order to determine the extent of fishsurvival from the previous winter. We observed numerous dead carp, northern pike, walleye,and yellow perch along the shoreline of Wagonga during the special assessment. We caughtabundant numbers of black bullhead (215.80 fish/trapnet) and yellow perch (61.80fish/trapnet); moderate numbers of carp (8.60 fish/trapnet); low numbers of northern pike(1.60 fish/trapnet); no walleye in the special assessment trapnets. Wagonga was restockedwith 1.68 million walleye fry, 303 adult walleye, and adult northern pike following the 1999-2000 partial winterkill.     In the summer of 2000, a standard population assessment was conducted to determinegamefish numbers, sizes, and growth rates. Low numbers of northern pike (1.50 fish/gillnet)were present in the 2000 summer assessment. The 2000 summer northern pike average size wasmoderate (2.96 lbs. and 23.31 inches, gillnets).     There were no walleye captured in the 2000 summer assessment nets. In 1996, the walleyeabundance was low (0.75 fish/gillnet).     Yellow perch abundance was low (3.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2000 summer assessment. The2000 summer yellow perch average size was small (0.14 lbs. and 6.35 inches, gillnets).     Black bullhead were abundant in the 2000 summer assessment (863.60 fish/trapnet). The2000 summer black bullhead average size was small (0.10 lbs. and 5.74 inches, trapnets).     Carp were abundant (53.47 fish/trapnet), but small (0.32 lbs. and 7.41 inches, trapnets)in the 2000 summer assessment. It appears that the surviving adult carp from the 1999-2000partial winterkill naturally produced a strong year class of carp in the spring of 2000.     It appears that sufficient numbers of yellow perch are present to repopulate the lakethrough natural reproduction. Northern pike and walleye are being used as a biologicalcontrol on carp and bullheads in Wagonga. Yellow perch and northern pike may be stocked intoWagonga as needed. It was hypothesized that mixing of sediments near the helixors, a prioralgae bloom, a heavy snowfall event, and the late start (early January of 2000) of theaeration system in the 1999-2000 winter were to blame for the low dissolved oxygen levelsadjacent to the aeration system. Operational plans were changed for the aeration system in2000-2001. The aeration system was turned on for two weeks in November of 2000 preceding iceconditions in order to distribute sediment away from the subsurface helixors. Also, theaeration unit was turned on in early December of 2000. High oxygen conditions were presentin Wagonga adjacent to the aeration system throughout the 2000-2001 winter. Walleye fry orfingerlings will be stocked in 2001 if the 2000 fry stocking was a failure as determined bya spring night electrofishing survey. Wagonga will be surveyed in the 2002 summer todetermine gamefish numbers, size, and growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Wakanda during September 16, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Wakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Partial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. A significant winterkill of gamefish (Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie) and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013 and a partial winterkill in 2014. Black Bullhead and Northern Pike appeared to be two species that survived in adequate numbers during both winterkill events. The helixor aeration system was moved from deeper water with softer substrates to shallower water with rock substrates in the 2014 fall. Local anglers reported good fishing success for Walleye and large Northern Pike during the 2016 summer. Oxygen levels were good through January of 2019, but heavy snowfall during February lowered oxygen levels in many shallow area lakes. A partial winterkill occurred in February of 2019 even though the aeration system was operational all winter. We observed abundant numbers of dead Common Carp, White Sucker and Bigmouth Buffalo. We also saw low numbers of dead adult Walleye, Black Bullhead and Yellow Perch. However, we caught low/moderate numbers of gamefish in the 2019 spring trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is insignificant during most years based on previous surveys, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Spicer Strain Walleye fry (404,928 fish) were stocked in 2019. Pike River Strain Walleye fry (1.2 million Pike River strain) were stocked in 2018. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked each year during the 2016 (Pike River Strain), 2014 (Private and Spicer Strains) and 2013 (Pike River Strain).  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (276.00 YOY/hour, 7.31 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were also abundant in 2018 (285.00 YOY/hour, 6.20 inches), 2016 (90.00 YOY/hour, 6.84 inches) and 2014 (464.00 YOY/hour, 7.91 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye (48.00 YOY/hour, 5.93 inches) were captured in the (fry stocked year) 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 YOY/hour, 5.78 inches) were also observed in the (fry stocked year) 2009 fall electrofishing survey. However, most of the 2011 and 2009 year class walleyes died during the January/February 2013 winterkill. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2019 or 2018. We observed abundant numbers of YOY Yellow Perch; moderate numbers of bass; low numbers of Black Bullhead, YOY Common Carp and adult Yellow Perch in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (39.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016 was above the historical average (20.71 fish/gillnet) for Wakanda. The 2016 Walleye average weight and length were 1.05 pounds and 14.66 inches from gillnets. The 2014 year class comprised 96% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. It is likely that Walleye numbers from this 2014 year class are substantially reduced due to prior fishing harvest and the partial winterkill in February of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Lake Wakanda was conducted during early July of 2016. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2016 to assess young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance. Wakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development is limited to the south shore. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and eventually outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Partial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. A significant winterkill of gamefish and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013. The helixor aeration system was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due in part to high snowfall accumulations. The helixor aeration system was not operated during the 2013-14 winter in part to facilitate a winterkill of undesirable fish (Common Carp) in Wakanda and also because the 2013 Walleye fry stocking was a failure. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured from 1 to 1.9 ppm during early February of 2014. Common Carp and Black Bullhead were present in 2014 ice out nets in Wakanda. It appears that even with a severe and prolonged winter with low oxygen conditions that a complete winterkill of undesirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullhead) did not occur in 2014. The helixor aeration was moved into shallower water with more rock substrates and away from silt and muck substrates in the fall of 2014. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation resulting in good oxygen levels in many susceptible winterkill lakes. The Wakanda helixor aeration system appeared to maintain dissolved oxygen levels at 5.0 ppm throughout the 2014-15 and 2015-16 winters, however nearby shallow lakes without aeration had higher oxygen levels (>7 ppm). <br> \n <br> \nSubmergent vegetation densities are variable in Wakanda. Sago pondweed is usually the most frequently occurring submergent species. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and common during mid to late summer months. Wakanda receives high flows of agricultural and storm sewer runoff via tiles and ditches. Water clarity is often good from ice out to mid-June, but poor during the remainder of the summer. The secchi disc reading was 2.0 feet on July 15, 2016. Intense blue-green algae blooms were notably absent in Wakanda during July of 2016 unlike previous years and other nearby lakes (Big Kandiyohi). Water levels were above normal during the summer and fall of 2016. Dissolved oxygen levels were moderate (6.4-9.1 ppm) throughout the water column during the July 2016 survey. Total phosphorus levels (0.177 ppm) were high on June 13, 2016. Local residents and various government officials are developing a new comprehensive management plan for Wakanda. A large upstream wetland restoration (Grass Lake Project) is currently underway to potentially reduce or buffer storm water runoff from the city of Willmar and improve incoming water quality flowing into Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2016 (15.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average 17.99 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was large (0.38 pounds and 9.2 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of Yellow Perch 8.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent. The 2014 year class comprised 76% of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2016 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average (7.68 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was large (6.77 pounds and 31.5 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.91 pounds from gillnets. The Northern Pike catch rate of 28.00 inches and larger was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016. Northern Pike growth rates were excellent. The 2013 and 2012 year classes each comprised 36% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. Local anglers reported good success catching large northern pike during the 2016 summer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2016 (0.53 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.26 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 4.6 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.10 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area 75th quartiles for ages 1-5. The 2015 year class comprised 88% of the 2016 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2016 (0.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 0.61 fish/trapnet. Low numbers of small sized Black Crappie (1.50 fish/gillnet, 0.18 pounds average weight) were captured in the 2016 gillnets. The 2016 Black Crappie average size was small (0.25 pounds and 7.52 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.41 pounds and 0.12 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively. Black Crappie growth rates were excellent. The 2015 year class comprised 75% of the Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (39.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (20.71 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate (1.05 pounds and 14.7 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.28 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant Walleye 15.0 inches and larger (16.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2016 survey catch. Walleye growth rates were good. The 2014 year class comprised 96% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. Local anglers reported good angling success for Walleye during the 2016 summer. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is probably insignificant during most years, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked each year during the 2016, 2014 (Spicer strain) and 2013 springs. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (90.0 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) in 2016. Abundant YOY walleye numbers were captured (464.0 YOY/hour, 7.9 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance was moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2016 Channel Catfish average size was large from gillnets (8.22 pounds, 27.7 inches). Channel Catfish were first documented in Wakanda during a 2006 survey. Channel Catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. The Channel Catfish may have moved into the Wakanda from the outlet via the connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo numbers were low in 2016 (0.40 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Bigmouth Buffalo average size was 3.48 pounds from trapnets. The historical average weight is 7.54 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2016 (14.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (215.35 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead abundance in 2016 gillnets (42.50 fish/gillnet) was also below the historical average catch rate (82.07 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.34 pounds and 8.4 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.19 pounds and 0.26 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (12.27 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 19.90 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Common Carp average size was large (8.40 pounds and 25.1 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 3.61 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",
