                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest 4 Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which includes lakes that are average sized, are fairly deep, have clear water and moderate chemical fertility.  This lake class is one of the most productive in northeast Minnesota in terms of its potential to produce fish.  Eagles Nest Lake 4 differs from these lakes, however, in that it is smaller and clearer than average, and has historically produced fewer fish.  Eagles Nest Lake 4 stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen below about 30'.  The total catch of fish in the gillnets (all species combined) in 1995 was lower than average for this lake class, although it was higher than in past surveys and assessments dating back to 1955.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets also was higher than in the past, and reflects increasing numbers of crappie, bluegill, and rock bass.  Overall fish populations in 1995 were dominated by black crappie and walleye.Black crappie numbers in 1995 were well above average for this lake class and higher than in past surveys and assessments.  Most crappie were small, averaging 6\".  Several crappie, however, were over 12\", and the largest was 13\" (1.4 lb).  Crappie successfully reproduced in most years, including the cold summer of 1993 which produced few crappie in many area lakes.  Crappie growth was faster than average.Walleye numbers were average for this lake class, and higher than many previous catches in this lake.  Walleye successfully reproduced in most years; many walleye were from the cold summer of 1992 which produced few walleye in many area lakes.  Walleye averaged 14\" in length; the largest was 20\".  Walleye growth was faster than average for the area.  One fifth of the walleye had \"black spot\", also known as Neascus.  Neascus is a small parasite in or under the skin of fish.  It is harmless to humans, is usually removed by filleting, and is killed by cooking.Northern pike numbers were below average for this lake class, but similar to previous catches.  Two large pike were captured in this assessment: 41\" (14.5 lbs) and 39.8\" (15.5 lbs).  One-fourth of the pike had Neascus.Bluegill numbers were average for this lake class, but were higher than in previous surveys and assessments.  Most bluegill were 6-7\", with only one over 8\".  Nearly one-half of bluegill were infested with Neascus.  No bluegill were captured that had been produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.Rock bass numbers were average for this lake class.  Smallmouth bass numbers were above average, and fish were present up to 17\".  No smallmouth were present from 1992 and 1993.  Smallmouth growth was fast.  White sucker and yellow perch numbers were below average for this lake class.  The abundance of these two species has always been low in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake Four is located 11 miles southwest of Ely.  There is currently no public access on this lake.  This 177 acre lake has a maximum depth of 49 feet and the water color is clear.  On July 24, 2013 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 72F and a bottom temperature of 43F.  Oxygen levels were 7.8 ppm at the surface, peaked at 12.5 ppm 24 feet down, and dropped to below 2.0 ppm at 40 feet.  Shoreline substrates consist mostly of rubble with some boulder, gravel, and muck. \n\nThe overall gill net catch rate for all fish combined was 7.2 fish/gill net.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were northern pike (40%), walleye (37%), white sucker (9%), yellow perch (5%), golden shiner (5%), smallmouth bass (2%), and rock bass (2%).  The overall trap net catch rate for all fish combined was 10.8 fish/trap net.  Fish species sampled in trap nets were black crappie (37%), bluegill (16%), northern pike (13%), rock bass (12%), pumpkinseed (9%), walleye (5%), hybrid sunfish (5%), golden shiner (2%), and smallmouth bass (1%).\n\nSixteen walleye were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.7 fish/net which is better than 25% of other similar lakes throughout the state and on par with previous assessments on the lake.  Sizes in gill nets ranged from 8 to 27 inches with an average of 15 inches.  Average weight was 1.5 pounds/fish which is better than 50% of other similar lakes in the state.  Growth rates appeared good.  Ages in 2013 ranged from 1 to 12 years with 75% of the fish coming from the 2010 and 2011 year classes.\n\nSeventeen northern pike were captured in gill nets for a rate of 2.8 fish/net which is slightly below 50% of other similar lakes throughout the state but good when compared to historic catches from this lake.  Average weight of gillnetted fish was 2 pounds/fish.  Lengths of gillnetted fish ranged from 18 to 27 inches with an average of 21 inches.  Growth appeared slow when compared to other lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 3 to 6 years.  Fourteen of the seventeen pike examined for diseases and parasites were infested with neascus (black spot).  \n\nTwo smallmouth bass were captured in the 2013 survey.  Sizes were decent with lengths being 16 and 18 inches, and weights being 2.2 and 2.9 pounds respectively.  Ages were 7 and 9 years old.  \n\nThe black crappie trap net catch was 3.9 fish/net which is good compared to other similar lakes throughout the state but is the lowest catch on record for Eagles Nest 4.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 13 inches with an average of 10 inches.  Average weight was 0.7 pounds/fish which is better than 75% of other similar lakes in the state.  Growth rates were good compared to other area lakes.  Ages ranged from 1 to 7 with the 2007 year class making up 54% of the total catch.\n\nThe bluegill trap net catch was 1.7 fish/net which is below 25% of other similar lakes throughout the state and slightly lower than the average historic catch rate for the lake.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 9 inches with an average of 6 inches.  Average weight was 0.3 pounds/fish which is good compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Growth rates were good compared to other lakes in the area.  Ages ranged from 2 to 8 with 47% of the fish coming from the 2011 year class.  Eleven of the fifteen bluegill observed for diseases and parasites had neascus (black spot).  \n\nNine rusty crayfish were captured in the 2013 survey.  The 1995 survey captured two.  Compared to other lakes in the area that are infested with this invasive species, this is a relatively minor increase since they were first documented.\n</p>",
