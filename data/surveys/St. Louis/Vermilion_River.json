Sampling occurred in the area upstream of Table Rock Falls to the downstream end of Everett Rapids.  The \"Chain of Lakes\" section of the Vermilion River is located 16 miles east of Orr, MN and is approximately 1,071 acres.     <br> \n <br> \nAn effort was made to determine if rusty crayfish were present in this section of the Vermilion River and none were found even though they are present just upstream in Lake Vermilion. <br> \n <br> \nGenerally fish abundances were near or lower than levels found in similar lakes.  However, length and weight are generally above average and growth is good for most species.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was near the lower end of the expected range but a fair number were present and the size was very nice.  Total length in the sample ranged from 8.5-11.9 inches and the mean was 10.7.  The mean weight was 0.75 pounds, which was greater than the normal range for this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was within the normal range for this lake type, but at the moment, most fish were small.  Total length ranged from 3.8-7.8 inches and the mean was 4.6.  The mean weight was 0.08 pounds, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Only two year-classes were captured and the age ranged from 4-5 years.  The 2006 year-class represented 98% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the normal range for this lake type and fish up to 37.4 inches were recorded in the sample.  The mean weight of northern pike was 2.22 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nFew smallmouth bass were captured but they were large.  An effort was made to use angling as a way to increase sample size; however, after several attempts at targeting smallmouth bass, none were captured.  The largest smallmouth bass captured in the survey nets was 20.9 inches, an exceptional size for northern Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was below the normal range for this lake type.  Mean weight was near the lower end of the normal range for this lake type.  However, large fish are present and fish up to 23.5 inches were captured.  Eight year-classes were captured and most year-classes were generally weak with no single year standing out from the others.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance and size was within the normal range for this lake type.  Perch up to 11.0 inches were recorded in the sample.  </p>",

Within this system is a shallow 1,071 acre body of water commonly referred to as the \"Chain of Lakes\". The lakes are located approximately 8 miles south of Buyck, Minnesota. This is a shallow and heavily vegetated system with water clarity of 5.7 feet during the 2018 survey. Anglers can boat to the Chain of Lakes via a public access on Twomile Creek.   <br> \n <br> \nGood panfish populations are available to anglers in the Vermilion River. Black Crappie catch rates were fairly low during the 2018 survey. However, average size was impressive. Crappies up to nearly 14 inches were sampled, and the average was nearly 12 inches. Bluegill catch rates were near the average for similar lakes, as was their size. Bluegill averaged nearly 6 inches and fish up to 8 inches were sampled during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were generally small, which is typical of lakes similar to this system. An average pike weighed 1.7 pounds and was 20 inches in length. While the pike are typically small, it is likely that the occasional Muskellunge from Lake Vermilion takes up residence in the Chain of Lakes, which could give anglers some opportunities to target trophy fish.  <br> \n <br> \nA naturally reproducing population of Walleye exists in the Vermilion River. Catch rates during lake surveys have been low, and attempts to stock Walleye fry since 2013 have not appeared to increase abundance as of this survey. The average size of Walleye sampled in 2018 was 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is a very healthy Yellow Perch population in the Chain of Lakes. Perch provide a good source of forage for larger predator fish, and the size of the Yellow Perch should be of interest to some anglers as well. Perch over 11 inches were sampled, and the average length was 8.5 inches. The sample showed that these fish have fast growth rates and fairly consistent year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nBass are not typically caught in high numbers in traditional netting gear used during this survey. Two Smallmouth Bass were sampled and it is likely that there is a population in this system that would be of interest to bass anglers. Other fish sampled in low abundance included Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
