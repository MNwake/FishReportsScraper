Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except three sites where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish, including one intolerant species (Iowa Darter). The near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2016 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Emma Lake is located in the Mississippi River - North Fork Crow River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lake Emma was conducted on June 12, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot beach seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with two sites sampled from the boat.  Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native species of fish with Yellow Perch and Bluegill most commonly sampled. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake Emma based on this survey is just one point above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes, indicating acceptable water quality and habitat conditions exist for aquatic life but the lake is vulnerable to future impairment.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Emma Lake is a 180-acre lake located three miles southeast of the City of Howard Lake in Wright County.  It is shallow with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  A state-owned public access on the east side of the lake has a steep grade, almost requiring 4 wheel drive for  access.  The last lake survey was conducted in 1990.  Emma Lake is very lightly developed and could provide a quiet day of angling for those looking to escape the crowd. <br> \n <br> \nEmma Lake is immediately downstream of Ann Lake.  The two lakes receive run-off from a 20,000 acre agricultural watershed.  Poor water quality, a history of winterkill, and abundant carp and bullhead populations are limiting factors. Cattle graze along the shoreline and have access to the water.   Eurasian water milfoil was discovered in Emma Lake in 2006. <br> \n   <br> \nThe results of the test netting were more positive than expected because: 1) drought conditions and lack of run-off in 2006 seemed to result in better water quality; 2) a commercial fisherman removed 120,000 pounds of carp from Lake Ann in February 2006; and 3) no winter kill has occurred since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not sampled by electrofishing, but were on nearby Lake Ann on May 2, 2006.  Since the lakes are similar and connected, those results are reported here also.  Only 13 fish were taken.  The catch rate was 12.2 fish/hr.  The Montrose Area average catch rate of largemouth bass is 59/hour.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked in Emma Lake since 1990.  The walleye catch in 2006 (0.8/gill net) was below expected values and reflects the lack of stocking and lower walleye population levels in Ann Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of northern pike was moderate but still significantly higher than 1990.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17-34 inches with an average length and weight of 25.3 inches and 3.8 lbs.  Northern pike grow to 24 inches in five years.  Anglers can expect good fishing for above-average size northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was significantly higher in 2006 than 1990.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5-10 inches, meaning that some harvestable size perch are available.  Grow is fast too, with perch attaining seven inches in two years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was considerably higher than 1990.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3- 9 inches with an average length of 5.8 inches.  Bluegills from Emma Lake take three years to reach seven inches.  At the level of abundance and growth, anglers can expect good fishing for sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie was much lower than 1990.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4-11 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.   Black crappies from Emma Lake take 4-5 years to reach eight inches.  Anglers have enjoyed good success fishing for crappies during the winter of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and carp catches were much lower than in 1990.  Other species sampled during the survey included: bowfin, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of this writing the commercial fisherman removed 12,000 pounds of carp and 100 pounds of bigmouth buffalo in a seine haul on 2/20/07.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Emma Lake is a small (180 acre) lake in Wright County located three miles southeast of the City of Howard Lake. It has a maximum depth of 16 feet and is connected to Ann Lake by a shallow channel on the west side. A small state-owned access with limited parking is located on the east side of the lake. Access is difficult due to a steep, unpaved grade. Emma Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Black Crappie and was last surveyed in 2006. Anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass and smaller Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was moderate; Secchi depth was 6.0 feet on June 13. However, the 10 year average summer Secchi depth was 3.3 feet. The lake has a history of partial winterkills due to shallow depth and poor water quality. Bluegreen algae is common in the lake and dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 11 feet during the survey. Vegetation was not surveyed in 2016; however, in 2006 cattail, coontail, and curly-leaf pondweed were abundant in the lake. Eurasian milfoil was discovered in the lake in 2007 and anglers should use care not to transport aquatic vegetation to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were higher than expected for lakes similar to Emma and higher than in 2006. Lengths ranged from 15.3 to 33.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.1 pounds. Most Northern Pike were small; only 16% were 24 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in early June and the catch was higher than the average daytime catch for the Sauk Rapids Area. Size was good; of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 41% were longer than 15 inches. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 3.7 to 19.9 inches with an average length of 12.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were above the expected range of values for lakes similar to Emma. Most Black Crappie were small; lengths ranged from 3.7 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches. Bluegill numbers were within the expected range of values, but much lower than in 2006. High water during the survey may have reduced netting effectiveness along shore. Lengths ranged from 2.7 to 9.2 inches with a mean length of 5.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were higher than expected, but most were small. Lengths ranged from 4.6 to 9.3 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches. One Walleye was also caught during the survey. Walleye are not stocked in Emma Lake, but can immigrate from Ann Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were numerous, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Other species caught during the survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted. Results from this survey can be found in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
