                "narrative": "<p>Little Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Lake was thermally stratified on 07/05/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 14 ft, where the temperature was 59 F.  A small inlet drains local swamps.  The outlet to Kangas Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  Shoal substrates are mostly boulder and sand.  Plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft; yellow waterlily, largeleaf pondweed, cattails, and sedges are the most common plants.  Access to this lake is by a 1/4 mile portage from Co. Rd. 402.  All riparian land around Little Lake is State or Federal.This fish population assessment consisted of four gillnet sets.  Seven previous lake surveys or fish population assessments, dating back to 1966, consisted of 2-4 gillnet sets.  Due to the difficult access, trapnets were set only during the 1980 lake survey.The total catch of fish in 2000 (all species combined) of 5.1 fish/gillnet (6.3 lb/gillnet) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 8.8 fish/gillnet (14.6 lb/gillnet) in all investigations on this lake.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (1.3/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 21.2\" (2.1 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 19.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike was 23.2\".  Pike growth appeared to be in the normal range for area lakes, although few pike were captured and their scales were difficult to read.Walleye numbers in 2000 (1.5/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 4.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 15.8\" (1.4 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 17.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye was 18.6\".   Growth of age two and four walleye was in the fourth quartile for area lakes, while growth of age five and six walleye was in the normal range.White sucker numbers in 2000 (0.5/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 1.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes averaged 19.0\" (2.7 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the median length of 15.9\" in all investigations on this lake.Yellow perch numbers in 2000 (1.8/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 0.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes averaged 6.3\" (0.1 lb), which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch was 6.9\".  Perch growth was in the third quartile for area lakes.  </p>",

The total number of fish (3.8/gillnet) and pounds of fish (7.0/gillnet) is very low.  Trapnets were not set due to inaccessibility and because trapnet sets in 1980 showed results similar to the gillnet sets. Northern pike sizes are smaller than average for the area, while walleye sizes are larger than average.  Walleye are from four year-classes, although no walleye under age four were captured.  Walleye and northern pike scales were difficult to read.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Little Lake was thermally stratified on 6/21/2005 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 47 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 18 ft, where the temperature was 50 F.  Later in the summer, adequate oxygen for fish in Little Lake is retained to a depth of about 12 ft, where the temperature is about 60 F.  A small inlet to Little Lake drains local swamps.  The outlet, to Kangas Lake has beaver dams with a 2 ft head in 2005, causing high water levels.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft; the most common plants are floating leaf burreed and yellow waterlily.  Little Lake is surrounded by State of Minnesota and U.S. Forest Service lands.  Access is by two trails to the west shore of the lake off rough (four wheel drive) logging roads.  There are private boats stored on the lake where the trails end on State land.  Fishing pressure is probably light-to-moderate.Fish sampling in the 2005 Fisheries lake survey consisted of four gillnet sets.  Eight previous investigations, dating back to 1966, used 2-4 gillnets.  Trapnets were used in the 1980 investigation.  Trapnets and shoreline seines were not used in the 2005 survey due to the difficult access and lack of suitable seining areas.Catches of fish in gillnets in Little Lake have always been low, with a median catch of 8 fish/gillnet and 10 lb fish/gillnet.  The 2005 catch was even lower: 3 fish/gillnet and 6 lb fish/gillnet.  Three species of fish were caught in 2005:  northern pike, walleye, and white sucker.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (0.8/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median pike catch of 1.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 25.1\", which was larger than the average size of 19.7\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike caught in 2005 was 30.3\".  Pike scales were difficult to read and the sample size was small, but it appeared that pike growth was faster than normal by area standards.  Walleye numbers in 2005 (1.8/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median walleye catch of 4.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes averaged 15.3\", which was smaller than the average size of 16.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 2005 was 18.5\".  Walleye scales were difficult to read, but it appeared that five of the seven walleye captured in 2005 were from years stocked with walleye fry (walleye fry are stocked every other year in this lake).  Walleye growth appeared to be somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.  Neascus (black spot) was observed on four of the seven walleye captured in 2005.  Neascus is a native parasite that is common to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed when filleting the fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

This 71 acre remote lake is characterized by its rugged shorelines of ledgerock with large boulders present and a surrounding forest that is dominated by conifers such as jack pine and black spruce.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically there have been two separate portages located on the N side of the lake for public access. Currently the 80 rod portage that is located more towards the east is the one being used and maintained. This portage is located off a primitive forest road that is east of CR 402, which is south off CR 120. It should be noted that the forest road is in poor condition and the distance of the portage will most likely lengthen for interested users. Parking space is limited to road edges or adjoining ledgerock outcrops. Two user developed campsites were identified by the crew during the 2018 survey. <br> \n <br> \nSeven northern pike, five walleye and one white sucker were sampled in 4 gill nets during the 2018 survey of Little Lake. Four small yellow perch were also sampled with minnow traps. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (1.8/gill net) were identical to the long term average for this lake and below average (4.5/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area.

                "narrative": "<p>Little Lake is approximately eight miles south of Ely within the Superior National Forest. This 71-acre remote lake is characterized by its rugged shorelines of ledge rock with large boulders and a surrounding forest that is dominated by conifers such as jack pine and black spruce. Historically, anglers reached the lake via two separate portages on the north side of the lake. Currently the eastern-most portage, which is 80 rods long, is being used and maintained. This portage is located off a primitive forest road that is east of CR 402, which runs south off CR 120. The forest road is in poor condition, which makes the portage longer. Best travel options are a 4-wheel drive vehicle with high clearance or ATV/UTV. Parking space is limited to road edges or adjoining ledge rock outcrops. Two user developed campsites were identified on the lake by previous DNR crews. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in this survey were above the historic average for this lake and comparable to lakes with similar habitat. The average walleye was 15.5 inches long, which was slightly smaller than the historic average in Little Lake. Over 75% of the walleye sampled were 14 inches or larger, which should provide good harvest opportunities for anglers. The largest walleye was 22.0 inches. Walleye fry are currently stocked in Little Lake in odd numbered years, and there is also evidence of natural reproduction within the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were below the historic average for this lake and below average compared to similar lakes. The average northern pike was 22.6 inches long, which was larger than the historic average length. The largest pike was 27.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included burbot, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
