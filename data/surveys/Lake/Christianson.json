                "narrative": "<p>Christianson Lake is located sixteen miles north of Two Harbors. It covers an area of 150 acres and has a maximum depth of eight feet.  There is a gravel access at the road right of way of Lake County 202 (Christianson Lake Road) with parking for up to four vehicles.  The lake has bog stained water with dark brown color that limits visibility to less than two feet deep during summer.  Although a majority of the riparian land is under private ownership much of the shoreline remains undeveloped. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2017 to monitor the status of the fish community and associated aquatic habitat.  The survey documented 14 plant species growing within the lake and included mapping 8.9 acres of floating leaf and emergent plant beds.  Survey nets captured several common game fish species including Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled for the first time in Christianson Lake in 2017.  It is unclear how Walleye got into the lake.  The Walleye catch was average compared to similar lakes in Northeastern Minnesota with 69 Walleye captured during the survey.  Fish averaged 16.5 inches and 1.4 pounds with 95% of the catch over 15 inches long.  Walleye growth was average for the Finland Area and the largest Walleye caught was about 23 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Age analysis determined that eight year classes were represented in the 2017 survey indicating fairly regular recruitment to the population.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that occasionally have strong year classes and Christianson Lake is no exception.  The spawning habitat for Black Crappie appears to be good, but the cool climate of northeastern Minnesota may contribute to inconsistent reproduction.  Although eight year classes were identified from this survey 81% of the sample was the result of recruitment from only three years (2009, 2011, and 2014).  Size was favorable for anglers with 69% of the total catch greater than 10 inches and the largest Black Crappie captured over 14 inches long and 1.5 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2017 was below average for similar lakes in the Finland Area.  Size structure from standard survey nets was poor with an average of 19 inches and about 2 pounds while the largest Northern Pike caught was 23.7 inch long and weighed 3 pounds.  Four year classes were present in the sample and age-3 fish comprised 63% of the total catch.  Growth of Northern Pike appeared to be average for the Finland area.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch were sampled in below average numbers relative to similar lakes in Minnesota.  The average weight was 0.4 pounds and 40% of the total catch was greater than 10inches.  The largest Yellow Perch caught was a respectable 12.60 inches and 0.93 pounds.  Age analysis identified six year classes and growth of Yellow Perch appeared to be fast for the Finland Area.  <br> \n <br> \nA small number of adult Pumpkinseed were sampled in standard survey gear and several small fish were captured using quarter inch mesh trap nets that target small bodied fish species.  This information indicates that the Pumpkinseed population has remained at a low density similar to the last fisheries survey in 1984. <br> \n <br> \nChristianson Lake is an average Walleye lake with a decent number of eater size Walleye in the population at the time of this survey.  The lake also has Black Crappie and Yellow Perch populations that may be of interest to anglers.  Christianson Lake does offer a scenic lake setting even with the small number of cabins located along the shore.   <br> \n</p>",
