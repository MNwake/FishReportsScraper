All three species of bullhead are present in the lake, with yellow bullheads being the most abundant.  Most of the bullheads were average in size.  Yellow perch and black crappies are both doing very well with the perch three and a half times the gillnet median and with small crappies eight times the median.  The largemouth bass are reproducing well with the population ten times above the trapnet median.  The sunfish are also abundant with some larger fish present.  Walleye fry were stocked for the first time in the spring of 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mill Lake has been noted for its black crappie winter fishery.  Nettingresults indicate there is still a high population, but numbers have declined andsmaller fish are more prevalent.  Ten inch crappies were observed, however, averagesize was around 4 inches.  The northern pike population has increased with theaverage size about 19 inches.  Annual fry stocking of walleye since 1989 has shownlittle success in establishing a walleye fishery and will likely be discontinued. The largemouth bass population was dominated by small, fast growing fish, although,a fair number of bass over 12 inches were observed.  Mill Lake has an abundantyellow perch population with many over nine inches.  The high perch numbers shouldprovide a good prey base for the northern pike.  The lake has a fair population ofbluegill with a majority of the fish sampled about seven inches in length.  Anotherspecies of sunfish available were pumpkinseeds, many of which were over six inches. Roughfish present in the lake were bullheads, bowfin and suckers.     Voluntarily releasing larger gamefish and panfish and keeping the smaller fishwould help toward maintaining a balanced fish community.  Implementing properlakeshore and watershed use practices may work toward improved water quality andslow aquatic vegetation growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An ice-out assessment was conducted in late April primarily to evaluate the Northern Pike and Walleye size structures in Mill Lake and to document whether significant winterkill occurred.  In the past, gill nets indicated that the lake had the potential to produce quality size pike and a Walleye fingerling stocking program was initiated in 2016 in the hopes of developing a desirable Walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 42 Northern Pike were captured in the 2023 ice-out assessment ranging in length from 19 to 38.7 inches. Mean length was exceptional for this work area at 29.2 inches. The 2023 length frequency data exhibited other quality characteristics such as 88% of pike exceeding 24 inches, 36% longer than 30 inches, and five fish over 36 Inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 assessment produced a sample of 35 Walleye which ranged from 9.6 to 25.2 inches in length. Ice-out assessment catches are usually dominated by spawning adults. In the case of Mill Lake, the largest Walleye could not be older than Age 7 thus few would be expected to exceed 25 inches. The 2023 size distribution shows good representation of many size classes indicating success from most if not all stocking events. The 2019 gill net assessment captured 2.83 Walleye per lift indicating a population level approaching management goals. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of Black Crappie have been consistently high in all gear types used on Mill Lake indicating a historically elevated abundance level. A total of 442 Black Crappie were captured in the 2023 ice-out assessment ranging in size from 3.9 to 11.9 inches. Size structure has also been consistently poor and 89% of the 2023 sample was less than 9 inches long. Mean length was 6.8 inches. Aging results from electrofishing in 2019 indicate that growth rates are poor with growth slowing dramatically once the fish reach 8 inches and many older fish (Ages 6-10+) never reaching 9 inches.  Size structure is not limited by harvest but the high population and slow growth.  Excessive angler harvest is not a problem on Mill Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Bluegill sample consisted of 117 fish ranging from 3.4 to 8.6 inches in length with 42% greater than seven inches long and 5.2% over 8 inches. Bluegill over 9 inches have never been sampled in spring trap net assessments.   Bluegill growth is slow with Age 6 fish averaging 6.5 inches and Age 8 fish  <br> \naveraging 7 inches. The low prevalence of fish over 8 inches may be caused by poor growth, excessive angler harvest or both.   A total of 21 Largemouth Bass between 6 and 14.1 inches long were also netted. Other species sampled in modest numbers included Hybrid Sunfish (20 fish) and Pumpkinseed (34 fish).   Catches of gamefish species were good suggesting the winterkill was insignificant and should have little or no impact on the fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mill Lake is a moderately hardwater lake of 160 acres.  It has a maximum depth of 17 feet and a median depth of 9 feet.  About 78% (125 acres) of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.No inlets are present, but an intermittent outlet was present on the southwest shore of the lake.  The outlet was dry at the time of the survey.The shoal water bottom of the lake consisted of sand to 1- to 3-foot depth along most of the shoreline, and of mud beyond this depth.Submerged pondweeds and muskgrass were dense in the shallows in most of the bays of the lake, and sparse along the remaining shoreline.A secchi disk reading of 1.5 feet at the time of the survey indicated that the lake was quite turbid, and dissolved oxygen and temperature analysis indicated that no thermocline existed at that time.The test net catches indicated that the lake contained (1) high populations of perch, bullheads, and crappies, (2) good populations of golden shiners and pumpkinseed sunfish, and (3) a low population of bluegills at the time of the survey.Spawning conditions were considered to be poor for walleyes, fair for northern pike, and to range from fair to good for the species of centrarchids present.Local residents reported that some crappies have been caught in past fishing trips, and that fishing pressure is very light on the lake.The lake had no public access at the time of the survey, but local residents reportedly were willing to donate land for this purpose.The lake was opened to promiscous fishing in March of 1960 because of critically low oxygen levels.  However, the test net catches of the survey indicated that the fish kill, if any, was light.Previous northern pike and largemouth bass stocking in the lake has apparently been unsuccessful.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1960.  These fish should start entering the fisherman's creel in 1962 if survival is good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Mill Lake is a shallow (18' maxium depth) lake with moderate to poor water clarity as the secchi disk reading was only 4 feet in mid-July. The shallow nature of the lake along with the dense weed beds has made the lake susceptible to partial winterkill in the past, although it has been many years since the last occurrence.  Most anglers are drawn to the lake for its panfish.  At the time of the survey there were good numbers of 6 to 7-inch bluegills with some exceeding 7 inches in length.  Mill Lake also has an abundance of small black crappies as all the fish caught in both spring and summer assessments were under 9 inches in length.  A reduction in abundance through fishing or natural means will be required to improve the size structure of the crappie population.\n    The lake has a desirable northern pike population.  Though not abundant, the fish averaged about 4 pounds or almost 26 inches and pike exceeding 30 inches are not uncommon.  A healthy yellow perch population provides the prey base necessary to grow these nice northern pike.  Anglers may also want to pursue perch as fish up to 10 inches were sampled during the assessments. Both black spot or neascus and yellow grubs were common on the perch.  Even though the fish do not look aesthetically pleasing, normal cooking kills the parasites.  Although few largemouth bass were caught in the survey, the lake has a history of supporting a good population with trophy size fish being present.  Anglers have also reported good bass fishing.  Other fish species in the lake include bowfin (dogfish), black bullheads, brown bullheads, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullheads.  Bullhead numbers were low to within the normal range when compared to similar type lake with some of the fish being up to 15 inches in length.\n   Voluntarily releasing large northern pike and bass would be helpful in maintaining population size structures and a balanced fish community.  Increased harvest of black crappies under 8 inches is encouraged as these fish are too abundant and growth rates are poor.  Much of Mill Lake's shoreline is undeveloped and provides good habitat for fish and wildlife.  Minimizing impacts to the lake's remaining undeveloped shoreline will be critical, especially if more shoreline is developed for residential uses.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 88.5 (+/- 1.6) out of 100 possible. Approximately 20 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 80.3 (+/- 6.2), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.6 (+/- 1.1).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mill Lake is a 167-acre lake about 8 miles southeast of Browerville. The lake has light residential development and activity is generally pretty quiet. Water clarity historically has been variable. In July 2019, clarity was measured to 11 feet. There is a variety of submerged, floating-leaf and emergent vegetation around the lake's perimeter. Maximum depth is 18 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery is characterized by abundant Black Crappies that grow very slowly and are small in average size, usually around eight inches. Bluegills are similarly abundant; most sampled are less than seven inches. The Largemouth Bass population is comprised of a wide range of sizes with fish up to 18 inches sampled during spring electrofishing surveys. Bass fishing can be very good at times. Walleyes are stocked, most recently with fingerlings and adults however, it appears that only a low-density population has been established. A total of 21 Walleyes ranging from 11-22 inches were sampled in 2019. Perhaps the most notable fishery in Mill Lake is Northern Pike. While the population is best described as low-density, individual sizes can be impressive with fish over 30 inches regularly sampled during surveys. This population of large pike however is very fragile and the removal of just a few can have serious negative impacts. Additional survey efforts are planned to better understand pike abundance and size structure. At this time, anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest only pike less than 22 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Mill Lake July 15 and 16 of 2019 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted July 15-19.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 10 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.  Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.  The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.  Mill Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 4 for comparative scoring and evaluation.  FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 40 which is slightly above the impairment threshold of 38.  These results indicate that the lake is approaching an impaired status based on the FIBI score which is very near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \nA total of 16 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  One of these species (Iowa Darter) is considered intolerant of habitat disturbance.  Two tolerant fish species were also sampled (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish).   Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass made up a majority of the catch in near shore sampling.  Bluegill were the most numerous species in the gill nets and trap nets and were also the highest in biomass in both gears.  Northern Pike were second in terms of biomass in the gill nets.  Golden Shiners were the only minnow/cyprinid species observed.    <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mill Lake is a shallow (18'max. depth) lake with moderate water clarity.  Its shallow nature makes it susceptible to partial winterkill, though the occurrence is infrequent.  Bottom types are primarily sand and detritus(muck) and aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 7 feet in most areas.  The most common aquatic plants are coontail, flat-stem pondweed, and water lilies.      Bluegill and black crappie probably draw the most anglers to Mill Lake.  Bluegill abundance is high and fishing is expected to improve as growth rates are good and there are currently many fish in the 6-7 inch range.  There are also good numbers of pumpkinseeds that may be of interest to anglers.  Black crappie numbers are quite high, however growth rates are poor and few if any fish over 8 inches are present.  A reduction in abundance through fishing or natural means will be required to improve the size structure of the crappie population.    Mill Lake has a desirable northern pike population.  Though not abundant, they average almost 5 pounds and fish exceeding 30 inches are not uncommon.  A healthy yellow perch population provides the prey base necessary to grow these nice northern pike.  Anglers may also want to pursue perch as fish up to 10 inches were sampled in 2001.  Largemouth bass should provide good fishing as good numbers are present and fish in the 16 to19 inch range make up a considerable portion of the population.  Few if any walleye are present as past fry stocking efforts showed little success and were discontinued after 1995.  Suckers, bullheads, and bowfin are also present in the lake.  Bullhead numbers are moderate and individuals up to 14 inches have been observed.    Voluntarily releasing large northern pike and bass would be helpful in maintaining population size structures and a balanced fish community.  Increased harvest of black crappie under 8 inches is encouraged as these fish are too abundant and growth rates are poor.  Much of Mill Lake's shoreline is undeveloped and provides good habitat for fish and wildlife.  Minimizing impacts to the lake's remaining undeveloped shoreline will be critical, especially if more shoreline is developed for residential uses. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A panfish assessment was conducted on Mill Lake in late May to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations along with the summer lake survey conducted in July.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and enough panfish caught from the one night set that the nets were pulled the next day.  A similar trapnet assessment was done the first week in June in 2001 but three lifts were needed for a total of 17 net sets to catch an adequate sample size. <br> \n     Mill Lake has an abundant population of small black crappies.  A total of 424 crappies were caught in the overnight set that measured from 5 to 8 inches in length.  Mean length for the measured sample was 6.8 inches and modal length 6.5 - 7 inches.  The majority of the crappies (78%) were from 6.5 -7.5 inches in length.  In 2001, 297 crappies were caught in the spring assessment.  Fish in that sample also measured from 5 to 8 inches in length  with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches, but mean length was 6.6 inches.  Most of the crappies in the 2001 assessment were smaller than in 2007 with the majority of the fish (78%) being between 6 and 7 inches in length. Ages 2 thru 9 were represented in the spring assessment with the age 2 fish showing normal growth while the older fish displayed slow growth.  The 2002 year class accounted for 46% of the catch and the 2001 year class 40%. <br> \n      Both of the summer gillnet surveys in 2007 and 2001 indicated high numbers of black crappies.  The 2007 gillnet catch of 43.5/set and 2001 gillnet catch of 77/set were well above the 75% quartile for the lake class (interquartile range = 1 - 4.8).  Size structure of the samples were similar to that seen in the spring assessments with the fish measuring around 5 to 8 inches in both years.  Mean lengths were also comparable, 6.6 inches in 2007 and 6.4 inches in 2001.  A more desirable modal length was exhibited in the 2007 sample, 7 - 7.5 inches compared to 6 - 6.5 inches in 2001.  Like in the spring assessment, most of the crappies in the gillnet catch (54%) were from 6.5 to 7.5 inches while in the 2001 gillnet sample most of the crappies (84%) were between 6 and 7 inches in length.  The poor size structure is due to the high density and slow growth.  The management goal for Mill Lake is have catches where at least 10% of the crappies are more than 9 inches in length.  Few crappies exceeding 9 inches have been documented in any survey on Mill Lake and the 1995 lake survey,when the population was at its lowest recorded level, was the only survey to sample 10-inch crappies. <br> \n     The bluegill population displayed a more desirable population size structure than the black crappies.  A total of 523 bluegills were sampled in the 2007 spring assessment  and measured from 3 to 8 inches in length.  Mean length for the measured sample was 6.3 inches with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Over half of the catch (54%) was between 6 and 7 inches in length with 19% of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  Bluegills in the 2001 sample ranged from 4 to 8 inches in length with a mean length of 6.2 inches and modal lengths of 6 - 6.5 and 6.5 - 7 inches.  Like in 2007, most of the bluegills (58%) were from 6 to 7 inches in length, however, only 8% were more than 7 inches in length.  The catch in the 2007 spring assessment was just below the desired management goal of having at least 20% of the bluegills exceeding 7 inches in length.   The summer lake survey trapnets in 2001 did sample 518 bluegills but less than 1% of the sample was over 7 inches in length.  The summer trapnet catch (n=92) in 1995 displayed an impressive population size structure where 56% (n=52) of the bluegills caught exceeded 7 inches in length.  In the 1989 summer trapnet catch, 7% (n=148)  of the bluegills caught were over 7 inches in length and fish up to 9 inches were documented.  Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment with the age 4 fish displaying normal growth while the remaining age classes showing fast growth.  The dominant year class in the sample was from 2002 which comprised 62% of the catch.   <br> \n     The spring trapnet assessment was very successful at catching both black crappies and bluegills in Mill Lake.  The population size structure for the crappies was not very desirable in either the spring netting or summer gillnets.  Attaining the black crappie management goal will be a challenge without reducing the population to improve growth rates.  The spring netting appears to be efficient at catching adult bluegills.  Few bluegills over 8 inches in length appear to be in the population which may be the result of heavy fishing pressure.  Other species that were counted but not measured during the assessment included brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds, and yellow bullheads.  Some of the bigger yellow perch that were sampled were measured and found to be from 8 to 10 inches in length.  <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Mill Lake is a shallow (18' maximum depth) lake with moderate to poor water clarity and a secchi disk reading of 5.5 feet in mid-July. Coontail, flat-stem pondweed, and largeleaf pondweed were the most common submergent vegetation species and grew to depths of 12 - 13 feet.  White and yellow waterlily were common floating leaf plants. The most common shallow water substrates were sand and rubble. The shallow nature of the lake along with the dense weed beds has made the lake susceptible to partial winterkill in the past, although it has been many years since the last occurrence.  <br> \n      Most anglers are drawn to the lake for its panfish. At the time of the survey there were good numbers of 6 to 7-inch Bluegills with some exceeding 7 inches in length. Mill Lake also has an abundance of small, slow growing Black Crappies as most of the fish caught in the summer survey were under 9 inches in length. A reduction in abundance through fishing or natural means will be required to improve the size structure of the crappie population. The lake has a desirable Northern Pike population. Though not abundant, the fish averaged about 4.3 pounds or almost 27 inches and pike exceeding 30 inches are not uncommon.  A healthy Yellow Perch population provides the prey base necessary to grow these quality Northern Pike.  Anglers may also want to pursue perch as fish up to 10 inches were sampled during the assessments.  <br> \n         Mill Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population.  Although few were caught in the summer survey, spring electrofishing documented bass up to 20 inches with a fair number between 12 and 15 inches.  Anglers have also reported good bass fishing.  Some Walleye natural reproduction appears to occur as Walleye stocking was discontinued in the 90's.  The population is low and catching one would likely require some luck.  <br> \n        Other fish species in the lake include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullheads, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   Bullhead numbers were within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes with some of the fish up to 15 inches in length.  Voluntarily releasing large Northern Pike and bass would be helpful in maintaining population size structures and a balanced fish community. Increased harvest of the slow growing Black Crappies under 8 inches may actually help improve future growth rates. <br> \n       Much of Mill Lake's shoreline is undeveloped and provides good habitat for fish and wildlife. Minimizing impacts to the lake's remaining undeveloped shoreline will be critical, especially if more shoreline is developed for residential uses. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The bowfin catch was about eight times the state average for gillnets.  Northern pike numbers have been historically low, because of winter kills and poor spawning sites.  No winter kills have taken place in many years so several year classes are present including some very large northern pike.  Golden shiners were not present in this survey.  Black bullheads were dominant in this survey (they were not identified in the 1960 survey).  Yellow bullheads were present for the first time in this survey.  Brown bullheads were present at twice the state average.  This represents either a big decline or misidentification of them in the last survey.  Commercial bullhead removal in 1982 showed populations were not at problem levels.  Pumpkinseeds are the dominant sunfish due to their ability to tolerate low dissolved oxygen levels.  Pumpkinseeds are present at five times the state average.  Only one bluegill was taken in the 1984 survey (2 were caught in the 1960 survey).  The 400' N.R.C. check captured 100 young of the year and 15 other size bluegills, and 17 other pumpkinseeds.  Black crappies are the most important fish to anglers on this lake.  The range of sizes collected in this survey was far more narrow than the range of sizes collected in 1960.  The net catches for gillnets were over twice the 1960 catch and thirty times the state average numbers.  They were only twelve times the state average weight so they are about 1/3 the size of the statewide average.  Average size has always been fairly small in this lake with an average size of 9.4 per pound in 1984 compared to 7.9 per pound in 1960.  Yellow perch numbers are down considerably from the 1960 survey but are still three times the state average.  They dropped from 175 in 1960 to 23 per gillnet lift in 1984.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Mill Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 19, 2019. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with two sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two sites, a 15-foot seine was used at six sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured ten native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted on July 1, 2019 by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Nine trap nets were set the week of July 1, 2019 along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill dominated the trap net catch; 81% by numbers and 66% by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was higher than 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 29 lakes and the average length was 6.6 inches. Of the 617 Bluegills sampled, 50% were between 5 and 7 inches, 36% were over 7 inches and one individual was over 8 inches. The number of Largemouth Bass per net was near the 25% quartile for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThese trap net and nearshore survey data are combined with data from a July 2019 gill net survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
