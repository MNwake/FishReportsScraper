The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes withsimilar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.3 - 9.2 fish/net.  Catches averaged 8.0 fish/net in1989 and 8.5 fish/net in 1985.  The average weight of fish captured in 1993 was 2.4 pounds. Approximately 50% of the fish are 21 inches in length or greater.  Lakeshore residents have recentlyexpressed concerns about winter spearfishing and over-harvest of northern pike.  However, testnettingresults indicate that northern pike density and size structure is typical for lakes with similarchemical and physical characteristics.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 3.0 fish/net in 1993 which iswithin the normal range of mean catch rates for similar lake types (1.2 - 5.3 fish/net).  Previouscatch rates have ranged from 0.8 - 11.0 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1980.  Grove Lake  could beconsidered a quality walleye fishery in terms of fish size.  The average weight of fish captured was1.8 pounds.  Twenty-eight percent of the fish are 20 inches in length or greater.  Stocking of mixedage fish does not allow for an evaluation of natural reproduction in Grove Lake.  Effectiveness ofwalleye stocking success is difficult to determine without knowing the extent of natural reproduction. Electrofishing yielded 13.3 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Thirty-five percent of the fishcaptured were 15 inches in length or greater, however there were few in the 12-15 inch length category. Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be inconsistent.  Fish ages 3 and 4 were poorly represented inthe age class distribution of captured fish.  Bluegill are abundant at the present time.  Trapnetcatches averaged 40.6 fish/net in 1993.  Catches have been highly variable in previous surveys;averaging 9.5, 34.3, and 5.8 fish/net in 1989, 1985, and 1980, respectively.  Approximately one-halfof the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however none exceeded 8.0 inches.  The averageweight of bluegill captured in 1993 was 0.2 pounds.  Yellow perch catches averaged 20.2 fish/gillnet. The average weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds and none exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  Thecatch rate and size structure is similar to past surveys.  Black crappie may be an important componentof the sportfishery, yet they are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summermonths.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.1 fish/net.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is a 379-acre basin located 12 miles southeast of Glenwood in Pope County.  Approximately 40% of the lake is shallow, marsh habitat, which is heavily fringed by emergent vegetation.  Floating leaf and submergent vegetation are also dense in this area.  This area provides ideal spawning habitat for many fish species.  The deeper part of the lake also provides good habitat for fish.  There are scattered beds of emergent vegetation around the shoreline and submergent vegetation is dense in shallow areas.  Curly leaf pondweed, an exotic species, is prevalent in June and early July.  Lakeshore residents feel that aquatic vegetation has reached nuisance levels and impaired recreational pursuits in many areas of the lake.   Water clarity is relatively good.  Seechi disk measurements average about 7 feet during summer months.  Water clarity has been exceptional in June in recent years.The fish community in Grove Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish provide ample fishing opportunities.  The average size of northern pike is small, averaging about 18.5 inches in length and 1.4 pounds.  The bluegill population is exceptional.  About 80% of the fish captured in trap nets were 6 inches in length or greater and 17% exceeded 8 inches.  The size structure of the largemouth bass population is relatively good.  Over one-half of the fish captured were 12 inches in length and 11% exceeded 15 inches.Walleye should be considered a bonus fishery.  Gill net catches averaged 3.2 fish/net, which is within the normal range for this type of lake.  Most of the fish captured were less than 19 inches in length.  Average weight of fish captured was slightly over one pound.  Walleye stocking efforts have failed to provide a relatively good and consistent fishery.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is a 379-acre basin located 12 miles southeast of Glenwood in Pope County. Approximately 40% of the lake is shallow, marsh habitat, heavily vegetated with emergent, floating-leaf and submerged vegetation. This area provides ideal spawning and nursery habitat for many fish species. The remainder of the lake has scattered beds of emergent vegetation and dense growths of submerged vegetation in shallow areas. Water clarity is very good. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Grove Lake is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota. Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish support much of the fishing.  Northern pike are abundant and slow growing.  Average size of northern pike is small, averaging 2.0 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie populations exist at moderate to low densities.  A high proportion of the 2007 bass catch was comprised of young fish.  The largest bass measured was 17.4 inches.  Mean length was only 9.7 inches.  Grove Lake currently supports a high quality bluegill fishery.  Reproductive successes were very good from 2001 through 2003.  Growth is above average since the population is not overabundant.  Seventy-four percent of bluegill caught in trapnets exceeded 6.0 inches. Eight-inch and larger bluegill were common.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked into Grove Lake, but success and contributions from stocking have been marginal and inconsistent.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.2 fish/gill net, which is within the normal range for this type of lake, but few young fish were evident from recent stockings. Twelve of the nineteen fish captured in gill nets exceeded 17.0 inches in length. Average weight was 1.8 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is a 345-acre lake located approximately 12 miles southeast of Glenwood.  Grove Lake occurs in the headwaters of the North Fork Crow River watershed.  The lake has a unique basin morphology.  The western half of the lake is very shallow and densely vegetated making fishing and recreational boating difficult during summer months.  The deeper eastern half of the lake has a maximum depth of 31 feet.  Water transparency measures during summer months average 7.2 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey of the fish community was completed in 2017 to gain updated estimates of gamefish abundance and size distribution.  Survey methodology included an electrofishing survey completed May 19 to best sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of standard surveys was conducted June 5 through June 8.  Survey efforts included nine trap net and six gill net sets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass captures during the electrofishing survey were lower than anticipated.  Only twenty-one bass were captured in 1.0 hour of daytime electrofishing.  Sampling effectiveness was questioned, particularly given the extent of aquatic plant growth in the west half of the lake.  Size distribution of bass catches was atypical.  Catches were either young fish less than 8.0 inches in length or older fish exceeding 15.0 inches.  One 19.1 inches fish was measured. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike proved to be abundant.  The average gill net catch of 15.5/net was the highest catch rate recorded among recent surveys.  Pike catches ranged from 15.4 inches to 32.5 inches and averaged 21.1 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of expanded daily bag limits beginning with the 2018 fishing opener to harvest this surplus of small pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked in odd-numbered years to sustain a modest fishery.  Walleye catches in gill nets averaged 4.5 fish/net which is a modest, but greater catch rate than recorded in preceding surveys. Average size was 15.7 inches.  Age distribution of the Walleye catch extended to age 12.  Twenty-one percent of Walleyes were 20.0 inches and larger. <br> \n  <br> \nCurrent panfishing opportunities are limited, with exception of the quality Bluegill population.  Black Crappie catches were very limited.  The abundant Northern Pike population keeps Yellow Perch numbers in check.  Most perch do not grow large enough to be harvestable.  Bluegill catches in trap nets were modest, averaging 15.3 fish/net.  Average length of Bluegill captures in trap nets was 6.8 inches.  The largest Bluegill caught measured 9.5 inches.  Nineteen percent of Bluegills captured in trap nets exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to be conservative when harvesting large sunfish.  Based on limited abundance and moderate rate of growth, size-selective harvest of these large, old Bluegills could quickly degrade fishing quality. <br> \n</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with five sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample one site, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Most of the western half of this lake is very shallow, densely vegetated, and has deep soft sediment. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Grove Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is a 345-acre lake located approximately 12 miles southeast of Glenwood. Grove Lake occurs in the headwaters of the North Fork Crow River watershed. The western half of the lake is very shallow and densely vegetated making fishing and recreational boating difficult during summer months. The deeper eastern half of the lake has a maximum depth of 31 feet. Water clarity was 12 feet during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill relative abundance (25.3/trap net) is high for Grove Lake. Even with high densities, the size structure is good. Mean length in trap nets was 7.1 inches, with the largest being 9.5 inches. Sunfish anglers are reminded that a special regulation was implemented in 2021 that reduced the daily bag limit of sunfish from 20 to 10 to help protect and improve sunfish quality on this lake.  For more information regarding the Quality Sunfish Initiative, see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/sunfish/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nFew Black Crappie have been sampled in past surveys. The 2023 Black Crappie trap net catch (0.2/trap net) was low, while the gill net CPE (4.5/gill net) was the highest to date. This is likely the result of higher than normal surface water temperature for this time of year causing crappie to move deep. Mean length of Black Crappie in gill nets was 9.9 inches, with the largest being 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass relative abundance was low, but similar to the last survey. Bass have never been very abundant in Grove Lake. Sampled fish ranged in length from 7.7 to 17.7 inches, with a mean of 12.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were extremely abundant (29.8/gill net), the most of any survey. Size structure is poor, with a mean length of 19.8 inches. Eighty-five percent of fish were under the 22-inch protected slot limit. However, the largest pike sampled was 37 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike. New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase size structure. Grove Lake is in the North-Central Zone, where all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Anglers can keep 10 pike, but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules, except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to past surveys, few Walleye were sampled (1.5/gill net). Walleye ranged in length from 13.6 to 28.7 inches; with a mean of 19.6 inches. Fingerling stocking takes place every other year. However, with sustained high pike densities, Walleye stockings are not likely to be successful. <br> \n <br> \nToo few Yellow Perch were sampled for any meaningful analysis. Other species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nGrove Lake is currently not an infested water and lake users should take extra precautions to keep it that way. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are easily moved from infested to non-infested waters and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is relatively shallow and densely vegetated.  Water quality has been a concern of lakeshoreresidents in recent years.  Increases in algal blooms and submergent vegetation, as well as a decreasein emergent vegetation has been noted by residents.  Diagnostic studies have documented significantnutrient and sediment loading from agricultural ditches and tiles within the watershed.  Northern pike catches averaged 10.7 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 4.4 to 8.5 fish/netin previous surveys dating back to 1985.  Gillnet catches averaged 24.3 fish/net in 1980; followingseveral years of stocking winter rescue yearling and adult fish.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997was 1.8 pounds.  Age-3 fish comprised 67% of the fish captured in gillnets.  Northern pike fry werestocked in 1995, the year following the formation of this strong year class.  Bluegill catches averaged13.6 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have been highly variable; ranging from 5.8 to 40.6 fish/net inprevious surveys dating back to 1980.  The bluegill population is comprised of mostly largeindividuals.  Most of the fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater and about one-fourthexceeded 8 inches.  This size structure is related to poor reproductive success during the unusuallycool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Age-4 and age-5 fish were not present in trapnet catches. Electrofishing yielded 30.0 largemouth bass per hour.  Size structure of the population is indicativeof a quality fishery.  Fifty percent of the fish were 12 inches in length or greater and one-fourthexceeded 15 inches.  Black crappie catches averaged 2.8 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have ranged from0.0 to 5.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Fish ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 inches intotal length.  Age-3 fish comprised 88% of the fish captured.  Yellow perch catches decreased from 20.2fish/ gillnet in 1993 to 2.2 fish/gillnet in 1997.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 3.7 - 28.4 fish/gillnet.  Numerous small yellow perch ( less than 4.0 inches in total length)were observed during electrofishing sampling for largemouth bass.  These small fish were likely notvulnerable to the experimental gillnets.  Walleye were not captured during the 1997 populationassessment.  Gillnet catches have been highly variable in past surveys; ranging from 0.8 to 11.0fish/net.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.2 - 5.3 fish/gillnet. Anecdotal reports suggested that walleye angling was good earlier in the year.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake is a 379-acre, fertile basin located in Pope County, 12 miles southeast of Glenwood.  Most of the western half of the lake is five feet in depth or less and heavily vegetated.  Most shoreline development, fishing, and other surface water uses occur in the deeper, eastern half of the lake.   Maximum depth of the lake is 31.0.  Mean depth of the open water area of the lake is approximately 10.0 ft.   Water clarity can vary greatly depending upon weather patterns and volume of runoff, but averages approximately 7.0 ft. during summer months.   <br> \n <br> \nGrove Lake supports self-sustaining populations of largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfishes, northern pike, and black crappie.  Walleyes are stocked to round out fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nRecent survey findings describe a moderately abundant bluegill population.   Bluegills grow well and offer high quality fishing experiences.  The largest bluegill captured during the 2012 survey was 9.7 inches in length.  Fourteen percent of bluegill measured exceeded 8.0 inches.  A strong year class of four-year-old bluegills will enhance harvestable numbers and sustain quality fishing for several years.  Largemouth bass and black crappie catches were unexpectedly low.  Most captures proved to be young fish.   Average length of black crappies caught was 7.3 inches.  The largest bass measured were captured in trapnets.  Survey results for largemouth bass and black crappie catches were not considered representative of the existing population.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are overly abundant.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of this surplus and harvest more pike.  Based on 2012 survey information, northern pike are over-exploiting the yellow perch population as prey and may also be limiting survival of stocked walleyes.   Pike captures ranged from 13.0 to 30.5 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked during odd-numbered years.  Returns from stocking have not met expectations.  Gillnet catches during the 2012 survey averaged 2.5 walleye/net.  Walleye are not abundant, but this popular fish grows fast and can grow to 16.0 inches in length in four years.  A high percentage of walleyes measured during the 2012 survey exceeded 20.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBased on survey findings, Grove Lake can provide quality fishing experiences.  Harvest pressure is moderately light.  Its a good choice for quiet, family fishing outtings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grove Lake was sampled during May 2021 to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2021. The goal of the new regulation is to increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate the effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. At the time of the 2021 survey, the panfish community was dominated by younger, smaller fish. Bluegill catch rates were moderate and growth rates are above average. Most of the Bluegill sampled were age 6 or younger and only 6% of the Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches in length. The largest Bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were low and most of the fish were 2 years old. Black Crappie grow fast in Grove Lake, but because most of the fish were younger, only one fish over 10 inches was observed.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities can exist for multiple species in Grove Lake. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help improve and sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nAt the time of the 2021 survey, no invasive species have been recorded in Grove Lake. But people must remain vigilant to keep it that way. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Grove Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the North Fork Crow River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSixteen species were collected during this survey.  Three species (Banded Killifish,Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  No \"tolerant\" species were collected. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Grove Lake.</p>",
