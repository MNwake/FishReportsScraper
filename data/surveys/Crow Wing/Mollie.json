Brown bullhead catch indicates a very high abundance, exceeding the third quartile of the regional median. Bluegill, black crappie, and walleye numbers are below the first quartile of the regional median, thus indications are that the respective populations are below average. The walleye population is made up entirely of young-of-the-year. Abundance of young-of-the-year was shown to be present in moderate numbers when 1/4 averaged 0.15 lbs each.</p>",
