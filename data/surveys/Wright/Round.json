                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake experiences winterkill nearly every year. The fish population is dominated by Black Bullhead and Common Carp, species tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations. Black Bullhead numbers (26.0/trap net) were above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Round. Black Bullhead ranged in length from 4.5 to 13.9 inches and averaged 8.0 inches. Young-of-year Common Carp were the most numerous species caught in shoreline seining. \n\nAdult Bluegill and Black Crappie are stocked periodically in Round Lake to provide some opportunity for sport fishing. The trap net catch for Bluegill and Black Crappie were 56.2 and 5.7 fish per net, respectively. The Bluegill trap net catch was above the expected range of values for similar lakes and the Black Crappie catch was within the expected range. Growth rates for Bluegill were exceptional; Bluegill averaged 6.3 and 7.8 inches by ages 3 and 4, respectively. Black Crappie averaged 3.8 inches at age 1. Frequent winterkills have prevented Black Crappie from living long enough to grow to large sizes. </p>",
