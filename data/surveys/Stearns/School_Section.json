                "narrative": "<p>School Section Lake is a 188 acre lake located in southeast Stearns County, near Kimball. The lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet and has a history of infrequent winterkill, most recently in 2001. The watershed is modest and the primary land uses are row crops, open water, and pasture. A public access is located on the north end of the lake. School Section Lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and the last survey was in 2008. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and small Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was good; Secchi depth was 10 feet in late June.  Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 11 feet. No submerged vegetation surveys were done on School Section Lake in 2018 but a point intercept plant survey was conducted by DNR Wildlife staff in 2011. This survey found 12 species of submerged plants with coontail (98%) Illinois pondweed (70%) and flat-stem pondweed (64%) being the most common sampled species. Eurasian watermilfoil was also discovered in this survey and was sampled at 21% of the plots. In 2018, emergent vegetation covered only 1% of the lake area (primarily bulrush). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were higher than 2008 and above the expected range for lakes similar to School Section. Lengths ranged from 16 to 28 inches with an average length of 22 inches. In 2018, 16% of Northern Pike were 24 inches or longer compared to 28% in 2008 when fewer pike were captured. Anglers should experience good fishing for northern pike of 22 inches or less. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured by daytime electrofishing on May 17 in high numbers and average size. The catch rate was over four times greater than the Sauk Rapids area average and lengths ranged from 7 to 18 inches with an average length of 14 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 31% were 15 inches or longer. Anglers should find good fishing for largemouth bass. <br> \nBluegill were abundant and small. Bluegill numbers were higher in 2018 than 2008, and exceeded the expected range of values for lakes similar to School Section. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches with a mean length of 4.4 inches. Only one percent of Bluegill sampled were larger than seven inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were uncommon and small but remained similar to the 2008 results. Lengths in 2018 ranged from 5 to 11 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled for the first time since the 2001 winterkill but were still well below the expected range for lakes similar to School Section. Lengths ranged from 6 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted on School Section Lake; results for this survey can be found in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in School Section Lake was conducted on August 29-30, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured only six species of fish including none that are intolerant or tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates School Section Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>School Section Lake is a natural environment lake located in southeast Stearns County, near Kimball.  The lake is shallow (12 feet maximum), and susceptible to winterkill.  During the winter of 2000-2001, winterkill was observed on many area lakes, including School Section.  Following ice-out in late April only four black bullhead and three golden shiners were captured in trap nets.  After the assessment, adult northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie were stocked.  Yellow perch were stocked in 2003.  This was the first full survey since 1990. <br> \n <br> \nWinter kill species dominated the net catches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were abundant and captured at a rate above the range of expected values for lake class 39.  Bullheads were large and averaged eleven inches in length.  Yellow bullheads which had been so abundant in 1990, were not captured. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant and ranged from 13 to 28 inches in length.  Anglers should experience good fishing for northern pike of 22 inches or less.   <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were captured whereas perch were abundant in 1990.  Apparently the 2003 stocking was not successful.  The lake could be considered for a \"re-establishment\" stocking of yellow perch brood fish since there is a local source.  The fish community is not in balance without the presence of yellow perch.  Northern pike growth rates will be slow in the absence of perch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were assessed on May 16, 2008.  Daytime electrofishing produced a catch of 38 largemouth per hour.   Largemouth ranged in length from five to 17 inches with an average length of 11 inches.  Anglers should find good fishing for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant and small.  The trap net catch was above the range of expected values for the lake class.  Bluegill ranged from three to seven inches, however, only one fish was larger than seven inches.  Black crappie were uncommon and small.  All were less than seven inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe aquatic plant community was diverse and vegetation grew throughout the lake to a depth of 12 feet. A total of nine different species of aquatic plants were identified.  Illinois pondweed, northern water milfoil, and muskgrass were common, but all other aquatic plant species were rare.  Curled pondweed which had been so abundant in 1990,  was rare in 2008 covering an area less than one tenth of an acre.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance (5.3/gill net) was similar to the first quartile value for lake class 39.  This appears to be a decline from the 1978 survey when 20 Northern Pike were caught in one gill net.  The median length increment (23 inches) has increased from 1978 (20 inches). Ages 3-7 were present with above average growth during the first two years, but slowed to average for subsequent years. A total of 101 Largemouth Bass were sampled by spring seining and night electrofishing. The median length increment was 8.0-8.4 inches and 14 fish were 12 inches and larger.  Ages 2 and 3 were prevalent and growth was good for all ages. Sunfish were present in numbers above the third quartile: Bluegill (82.0/trap net), pumpkinseed (23.8/trap net) and hybrid sunfish species (111.3/trap net).  The median size Bluegill was larger than for other sunfish species, with 55% of trap net caught Bluegill seven inches and larger.  Ages 2-6 were present and growth was good.  Shoreline seining produced high numbers of young of the year sunfish. Black Crappie were abundant only in the gill nets (12.7/gill net).  Most fish were 7.5-8.4 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance (131.7/gill net) was well above the third quartile value (35.8 /gill net).  Nearly half of the Yellow Perch sampled were 6.0-6.4 inches in length. No perch were collected in shoreline seining.  Golden Shiners were another important forage species present in high numbers (13.0/gill net). Yellow (94.0/trap net) and Black Bullheads (26.8/trap net) were abundant.  Black Bullhead were not previously reported as being present during the 1978 survey.</p>",
