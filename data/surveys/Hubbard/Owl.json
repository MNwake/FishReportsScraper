                "narrative": "<p>Owl Lake is an 85 acre lake located one mile northeast of Nevis in Hubbard County. It has a maximum depth of 26 feet; most of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. There is no public access. Minnesota lakes are classified into 43 numbered classes based on physical characterics; Owl Lake is in Lake Class 36. Other area lakes in this class include Lord and Twenty-One. Species management is for northern pike with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill as secondary species. The catch rate for northern pike in trap nets was 2.40/set; trap net catches are usually not a reliable indicator of northern pike abundance. Most of the northerns were between 20-27 inches, with an average weight of 2.7 pounds. Growth rates were slow compared with averages for area lakes, suggesting competition for a scarce food supply. Poor northern pike growth rates indicate that this lake would not be a good candidate for stocking of additional predator species such as walleye.  Abundance of black crappie was within the normal range for this lake class. Lengths of black crappie fell into three distinct size groups: 5-6 inches, 8.5-9.5 inches, and 11.5-13 inches.  Bluegill abundance was within the normal range for this lake class. The mean length was 5.3 inches, with a maximum of 7.9 inches. Ages 2-6 were present in the sample, and growth rates were slightly above average. Other species seen in survey nets included largemouth bass, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Owl Lake is located in Hubbard County, one mile northeast of Nevis.  Owl Lake has a surface area of 85 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  Owl Lake is shallow, with most of the lake less than 15 feet in depth.  There is no public access on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Owl Lake is in lake class 36.  Other area lakes in this same class include Lord and Lake Twenty-One. <br> \n <br> \nOwl Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.   Northern pike abundance (22.0 pike/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and higher than past surveys.  Northern pike numbers in past surveys have fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 2.75 pounds, with pike measured up to 28.8 inches.  Anglers will find a good largemouth bass population in both numbers and size of fish.  The proportion of largemouth bass over 15.0 inches was high when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 19.5 inches were sampled.  Owl Lake supports a good panfish population composed of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-12 inch size range and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Bluegill abundance (1.1 bluegill/trapnet) was down from past surveys and below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill numbers in past surveys have fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers (4.0 perch/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Yellow perch are small in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 26 feet of which about 92 percent is shallower than 15 feet.  Much of the open water area is covered by floating-leaved and submerged plants.  Because of these factors the lake has partial winterkills of fish during extreme winters.Fish taken during test netting, in numbers which exceed the statewide median catch per set were: northern pike, black bullhead, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Although largemouth bass were reported to be an important fish to the lake a few years ago, none were taken at this time.Shoreline development at this time includes two cabins and eight boats.</p>",
