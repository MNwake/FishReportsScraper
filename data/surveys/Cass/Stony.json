SEVENTY-ONE PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF AGE III AND IV FISH THAT RANGE IN LENGTH FROM 14 TO 29 INCHES.  NO FISH GREATER THAN V+ WERE COLLECTED.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR NORTHERN PIKE IS NEAR NORMAL.THE TRAPNET CATCH OF BLUEGILL HAS BEEN HIGH IN STONY SINCE THE 1970'S.  THE QUALITY OF BLUEGILL SAMPLES COLLECTED AS DETERMINED BY PSD AND PERCENTAGE GREATER OR EQUAL TO 7 INCHES HAS SHOWN NO OBVIOUS TREND OVER TIME.  THE PRESENT SAMPLE COLLECTED IS DOMINATED BY SAMLL FISH - PSD=28; 6% GREATER OR EQUAL TO 7 INCHES.  THE GROWTH RATE OF BLUEGILL IS SLOW.THE NET CATCHES OF LARGEMOUTH BASS HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN SIMILAR LAKES IN THE AREA.  THE 1989 SAMPLE CONTAINED FISH FROM 4 TO 17 INCHES LONG.  EIGHTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE LARGEMOUTH BASS SAMPLED WERE AGE II+ AND III+, RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 6 TO 11 INCHES.THOUGH NOT SAMPLED IN LARGE NUMBERS, BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES HAVE STAYED CONSISTENT OVER TIME.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES OF BLACK CRAPPIE WITH NEARLY EQUAL REPRESENTATION WERE SAMPLED INDICATING GOOD ANNUAL NATURAL REPRODUCTION.THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH OF 29.8/GN IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 33.2 TO 50.4/GN.  YELLOW PERCH UP TO 14 INCHES LONG WERE SAMPLED.THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH SINCE 1952 - RANGE OF 3.0 TO 4.0 PER GILLNET.  ALL AGE CLASSES OF WALLEYE WERE SAMPLED DURING 1989.  THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN YEAR CLASS STRENGTH AND WALLEYE STOCKING IN ANY OF THE POPULATION ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED ON STONY LAKE.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO BE MAINTAINING MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE WALLEYE POPULATION IN STONY LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stoney Lake is a medium sized (595 acres), moderately deep (maximum depth = 50 feet) lake.  Most of the lakebottom along the shoreline consists of sand, gravel, and rubble.The 1994 Stoney Lake survey recorded the highest number of walleye ever sampled.  Most of the sampled walleye wereage two and three.  The average size walleye was 15 inches long and weighed 1.4 pounds.  There is strong evidenceindicating that natural reproduction responsible for the strength of the walleye population.  Fall Electrofishingto sample naturally reproduced young-of-year walleye yielded an excellent sample. This should be expectedconsidering the amount and quality of walleye spawning habitat. However, if this habitat is altered or destroyed,a decline of natural reproduction could also be anticipated.  The number of northern pike sampled declined from 1989 but was still typical of lakes of this type.  Most northernpike were small with the average size of 18.5 inches and 1.5 pounds. The main food fish for northern pike and walleye is yellow perch.  Yellow perch are quite abundant and ranged inlength from 5.1 - 12.5 inches with one out of four yellow perch larger than 9 inches.  Yellow perch of this sizemay be of interest to anglers.Bluegill were sampled in good numbers,but, were small in size.  Only 1% of the sampled bluegill were over 7inches.  In order to produce larger bluegill (> 8 inches) present in the population, fewer large bluegill shouldbe harvested.Only two black crappie were sampled.  Summer netting is a poor means to capture a good sample of this species. Angling for this species can be good at times on Stoney Lake.  A good sample of largemouth bass was captured using both summer netting and electrofishing.  Many of the sampledlargemouth bass were over 12 inches. In order to maintain the quality of the water and of the fisheries, we need to protect the aquatic habitat. Increasing development of the shoreline is making this difficult.  We need to maintain stands of emergentvegetation (bulrush, cattails, wild rice, etc.) as well as submerged vegetation.  Fish utilize vegetation forspawning, cover, and a source of food.  Aquatic vegetation helps \"tie up\" nutrients and/or pollutants.  They alsohelp protect the shoreline from erosion.  Leaving the lakeshore wild and natural is beneficial to fish andwildlife populations and to the maintenance of good water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake is a 595-acre lake with a maximum of 50 feet.  The lake is located 1.5 miles northeast of Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Stony Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Baby, Big Deep, Ponto, and Mule Lakes.  Approximately 30% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR public access on the south side of the lake off of 40th Ave.  Stony Lake provides good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.There is an abundance of northern pike for the angler to catch in Stony Lake.  Fish ranged in length from 9 to 36 inches but most were small.  The small vegetated bays around the lake are important spawning areas for northern pike in the spring and need to be protected so they will produce more fish in the future.There is an abundant walleye population that is being supported entirely by natural reproduction.  No walleye stocking has been done since 1993.  Ninety-two percent of the numerous walleye sampled in 1999 were from year classes produced since 1993.  Fish sampled by DNR personnel ranged in length from 9 to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye abundance is above what is typically found in lake class 23 lakes.  Stony Lake has an abundance of good spawning habitat along the shoreline that needs to be protected by shoreline owners.Stony Lake has a good reputation for bluegill and black crappie angling.  Historically bluegill abundance has been high.  The quality of bluegill has improved since 1994.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint is large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  Rock bass and yellow perch are also abundant in Stony Lake.  Both make good table fare and are of quality size.Largemouth bass are fairly abundant in Stony Lake and reportedly provide good angling.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Stony Lake and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Large fish can help maintain balance in the fish community.Lakeshore development on Stony Lake has increased considerably in the last 25 years.  The number of lakehomes has increased from 63 in 1973 to 139 in 1999.  This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  An inventory in 1999 shows that Stony Lake has few stands of emergent vegetation such as bulrush, cattail, and wild rice.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen tress or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake is a 563-acre lake with 6.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 feet located east of Hackensack, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the south shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally deep and very clear lakes. Other Lake class 23 lakes in the Walker Area include Mule, Man Horseshoe, and Long lakes. Stony Lake possesses a highly developed shoreline. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass and secondarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance failed to meet the long-range management for the third consecutive survey. Walleye lengths ranged from 12 to 28 inches with a mean length of 18 inches. Northern Pike are abundant, exceeding the maximum management goal the past 2 surveys. Sampled pike ranged in length from 9 to 38 inches with a mean length of 19 inches. Black Crappie abundance and size met long-range management goals, and lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches with a mean length of 10 inches. Bluegill abundance was similar to recent surveys and lengths ranged from 3 to 10 inches. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5 to 15 inches. Yellow Perch abundance has remained below management goals since 2005. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in Stony Lake included, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Stony Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake (DOW#11-371) is a 576-acre lake located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota that has 7.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 ft. There is a public access owned by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) on the south shore of the lake. The MNDNR has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; other nearby lakes in this class includes Baby and Ponto Lakes. Lakes in this class tend to be deep and have a low percentage of area less than 15 feet deep. These lakes also tend to have hard water and be very clear.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 12- to 20-inch protected slot limit implemented in 2004 to improve the quality of Largemouth Bass fishing on Stony Lake was removed at the start of the 2014 fishing season.  Stony Lake supports an excellent Largemouth Bass population with fish up to 18 inches sampled. In 2006, smallmouth bass were captured on Stony Lake for the first time in MNDNR sampling and numbers in surveys have been steadily increasing overall.  Smallmouth Bass up to 17 inches were collected in the most recent survey with an average length close to 14 inches. Abundance of bluegill was similar to that found in similar waters, but was lower than most previous assessments on Stony Lake. Stony Lake has a good population of walleye. Although the walleye gillnet catch rate of 6 fish per lift was lower than the previous four surveys it still exceeds the range typically expected for this type of lake.   Sampled Walleye had an average length of 17 inches and fish up to 28 inches were found.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has excellent quality with lengths ranging from 3 to 9 inches. The catch of Black Crappie in experimental gill nets compared favorably with other lakes in this class, and was greater than catch rates in previous assessments.  The average size of Black Crappie was 8 inches and fish ranged from 4 to 12.5 inches. Yellow Perch abundance was similar to other lakes of this type but was the lowest observed in Stony Lake.  The average yellow perch sampled in 2013 was 7 inches, and lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches.  Northern Pike were abundant in when compared to other Class 23 lakes with a gill net catch of over 14 fish per net lift. Sampled northern pike had an average length 19 inches and fish up to 27 inches were found.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species available for anglers include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Stony Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake is a 595-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 6.0 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp on the south shore.  The MNDNR has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally deep clear lakes with very little littoral areas.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass and secondarily for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Walleye are abundant when compared to previous gill net assessments and the fish are a result of natural reproduction.  Fish up to 24 inches were sampled and the mean length was 15 inches.  Forty-seven percent to the fish were between 10 to 15 inches, which will provide fishing opportunities for anglers.  Largemouth bass are abundant and fish up to 16 inches were sampled.  An experimental regulation of 12-inch maximum with one over 20 inches was implemented in 2004.  Since the regulation was implemented, the abundance has been consistent.  Plenty of angling opportunities exist for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  Other fish species sampled include: brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Stony Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake. The Fish IBI score (FIBI) uses fish community data to measure a lake's health. The types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the http://www.dnr.state.mn.us website.  <br> \n <br> \nAn FIBI score was calculated for Stony Lake of 58, which is above the impairment threshold (45) but below the exceptional threshold (64). Data from this survey indicates Stony Lake is healthy. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake (DOW#11-0371) is a 563-acre lake located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota. Stony Lake has 6.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 ft. A state-owned public access is located on the south shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; other nearby lakes in this class includes Baby, Jack, Mule and Ponto Lakes. Lakes in this class tend to be deep and have a low percentage of area less than 15 feet deep. These lakes also tend to have hard water and be very clear. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth, Smallmouth Bass and Walleye. Secondary management species are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were similar to recent electrofishing surveys and the catch rate met the management goal. Lengths ranged from 5 to 17 inches from all sampling gears. Smallmouth Bass below the management goal but size quality as good with lengths ranging from 10 to 19 inches. The Walleye catch rate below the management goal despite stocking fingerlings during even years.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 23 inches. Stony Lake has an abundant Northern Pike population with fish ranging in length from 10 to 36 inches. Bluegill catch rates were below the management goal but fish up to 9 inches were sampled. Black Crappie catch rates were also below management goals but targeted spring sampling is needed to better assess the population. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches. Yellow Perch were caught at a low rate and did not meet the management goal. Most Yellow perch were small with fish 5 to 9 inches sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Stony Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake (#11-371) is a 595-acre lake located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota that has 7.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 ft. There is a public access owned by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) on the south shore of the lake.  The MNDNR has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; other nearby lakes in this class include Baby and Ponto Lakes.  Lakes in this class tend to be very deep and have a very low percentage of area less than 15 ft deep.  These lakes also tend to have hard water and be very clear. <br> \n <br> \nStony Lake has a good population of walleye.  The walleye catch in 2008 in MNDNR experimental gillnets (10.5/net) was similar to that found during the three previous assessments and was greater than the catch found in most lakes of this class.  Sampled walleye had an average length of 15.3 inches and an average weight of 1.19 lbs.  Walleye up to 26.5 inches were found.  Stony Lake has a history of good walleye natural reproduction.  In 2008, all of the first seven year classes were present in the gill net sample. During the past two assessments, several abundant year classes in each assessment were products of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nStony Lake supports an abundant population of largemouth bass, and fish up to 18 inches were taken in the 2008 netting and electrofishing sample.  Stony Lake has a 12- to 20-inch protected slot limit in effect for largemouth bass that requires release of all largemouth bass 12 inches or larger, except that one over 20 inches is allowed in possession.  This regulation, which was implemented March 1, 2004, is intended to increase the average size of largemouth bass and to maintain a good population of this species.  In 2008, smallmouth bass were reported on Stony Lake for the first time.  Smallmouth up to 15.7 inches were collected.  This species was apparently introduced through an un-permitted private stocking. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant in Stony Lake compared to other lakes in Lake Class 23, with a gill net catch of 10.00/net.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.57 lbs, and fish up to 31.5 inches were found.  Abundance of bluegill was similar that found in other Lake Class 23 waters (9.00/net), however, this was lower than in most previous assessments on Stony Lake.  Average length of bluegill was 4.7 inches, and lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.3 inches.  The catch of black crappie in experimental gill nets (1.63/net) compared favorably with other lakes in this class, and was greater than catch rates in previous assessments.  Average size of black crappie was 8.5 inches and fish ranged from 5.5 to 11.5 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was similar to other lakes of this type.  Average length of Stony Lake yellow perch sampled in 2008 was 7.2 inches, and lengths ranged from 4.9 to 12.7 inches.  Other species available for anglers include black bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Stony Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stony Lake (DOW#11-0371) is a 563-acre lake located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota. Stony Lake has 6.58 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 50 ft.  A state owned public access is located on the south shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Stony Lake is in Lake Class 23; other nearby lakes in this class includes Baby and Ponto Lakes. Lakes in this class tend to be deep and have a low percentage of area less than 15 feet deep. These lakes also tend to have hard water and be very clear. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth, Smallmouth Bass and Walleye. Secondary management species are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nStony Lake has an abundant Northern Pike population however catches are lower than the most recent survey, with an average length of 19 inches and fish measuring up to 35 inches.  The Walleye catch rate was low compared to previous surveys with an average length of 18 inches, and lengths ranged from 11 to 22 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were higher than similar area lakes and the highest historical catch.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5 to 13 inches with an average of 8 inches.  Largemouth Bass numbers were similar to the most recent surveys, and lengths ranged from 5 to 18 inches. Smallmouth Bass were first sampled in 2006 and have since become more common with some large fish present.  Lengths for Smallmouth Bass were 6 to 19 inches.  Few Bluegill or Yellow Perch were sampled and most were small.  Other species sampled were, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lake shore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Stony Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office <br> \n</p>",
