                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nWashington Lake is a 1,519 acre lake located in Le Sueur County about 7 miles northeast of Mankato. Separate basins form Washington Lake into 2 main bays; an east bay and a west bay. The east bay is deeper, with a maximum depth of 51 feet. Two DNR- operated public accesses are available for use; one on the north end of the east bay and one on the southwest corner of the west bay. Washington Lake is a popular lake for angling and recreation. Much of the shoreline has been altered with residential development. Washington Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Walleye is the only fish species that is stocked in Washington Lake. The base stocking plan calls for Walleye fry on odd years. <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake was surveyed the week of August 8, 2016 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, electrofishing was conducted on May 24, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Additionally, a seining component was added to this survey on August 30, 2016. The main purpose of the seining effort was to assess young Bluegill abundance. Washington Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 9.3 fish/gill net, which was higher than the long-term average for Washington Lake (4.1 fish/net) and the second highest catch rate on record (10.5 fish/net in 2002). Walleye were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 3.8 fish/net, which was the highest trap net catch rate on record for Washington Lake. Walleye from both gear types ranged in total length from 7.6 to 27.0 inches and averaged 15.4 inches. About 43% of all Walleye were 15.0 inches or longer. Age-2 Walleye (2014 year class) comprised 47% of all aged fish, which suggested that the 2014 stocking effort was successful. Non-stocked year classes were also present, which resulted from natural reproduction. The average length of walleye at the time they were captured was 8.9 inches at age-1, 12.9 inches at age-2, 16.5 inches at age-3, and 19.2 inches at age-5. Walleye fry were recently stocked in Washington Lake in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Starting in 2017, Walleye fry will be stocked on odd years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 2016 was 2.3 fish/gill net, which is near the long-term average for Washington Lake (2.0 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.3 fish/net. The total lengths of fish from both gear types averaged 22.2 inches. The largest fish measured was 31.7 inches. The average length of northern pike at the time they were captured was 18.0 inches at age-1, 22.0 inches at age-2, and 27.9 inches at age-3. Northern Pike are not stocked in Washington Lake, so the population is the result of natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 17.6 fish/net, which marked the highest trap net catch rate on record for Washington Lake. This catch rate was above the long-term average of 11.5 fish/net. Total lengths ranged from 6.9 to 13.0 inches and averaged 9.4 inches, suggesting a high quality size structure. Seventy-five percent of all aged fish were age-2 or age-3. The average length at capture was 6.1 inches at age-1, 8.4 inches at age-2, 10.4 inches at age-3, and 11.5 inches at age-4. These parameters suggest a fast-growing population. Black Crappie are not stocked in Washington Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 6.6 fish/trap net, which was far below the long-term lake average for Washington Lake (24.7 fish/net). Despite the low abundance, the Bluegill population exhibited a good size structure. The total lengths of Bluegill from trap nets averaged 7.6 inches, with the largest individual measuring 9.6 inches. The average length of Bluegill at the time they were captured was 4.6 inches at age-1, 6.7 inches at age-2, 7.4 inches at age-3, 8.5 inches at age-5, and 9.1 inches at age-6. Numerous young Bluegills (n = 1,867) were sampled in the seining effort completed on August 30, 2016, which suggested that younger year classes are present in Washington Lake and should contribute to the fishery in years to come. The Bluegill population in Washington Lake is completely self-sustaining.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets). As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on Washington Lake on May 24, 2016 to target Largemouth Bass. The catch rate was 11.2 fish/hour in 2016, which was below the long-term average for Washington Lake (33.5 fish/hour) and the lowest catch rate on record. Largemouth Bass were sampled in trap nets in low abundance (0.7 fish/net). Total lengths of all Largemouth Bass in the survey ranged from 6.2 to 17.3 inches and averaged 14.7 inches, which suggested a quality size structure. Largemouth Bass are not stocked in Washington Lake. Spring electrofishing surveys targeting Largemouth Bass will be completed in conjunction with each Standard Survey on Washington Lake (every three years). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2016 was 18.2 fish/gill net. This catch rate was above the long-term average for Washington Lake (17.1 fish/net). Total length averaged 6.5 inches and ranged from 5.0 to 9.8 inches. Most fish (63%) measured less than 7.0 inches, so most fish in the survey were small. The average length at capture was 5.7 inches at age-1, 7.3 inches at age-2, 8.0 inches at age-3, and 9.3 inches at age-4. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for predator fish, especially Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nFreshwater Drum, often referred to as \"sheepshead\", were the most abundant fish species sampled in the 2016 Washington Lake survey. A total of 1,207 Freshwater Drum were sampled throughout the survey, which was the by far highest abundance on record. The average length was 13.2 inches and the largest fish was 21.7 inches. Freshwater Drum are native to Minnesota and are often caught on common angling gear. Other fish species sampled throughout the survey included Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Bowfin, Bluntnose Minnow, Spotfin Shiner, Spottail Shiner, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nWashington Lake draws anglers primarily targeting Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. Walleye size structure and abundance was strong in 2016 and shows promise for quality fishing for years to come. Black Crappie and Bluegill abundance is lower than previous years, but the quality size structure makes these species worth targeting. High numbers of young Bluegill in the seines showed potential for stronger year classes in the future. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Washington is a 1,519-acre lake located in Le Sueur County about 7 miles northeast of Mankato. Separate basins form Lake Washington into 2 main bays; an east bay and a west bay. The east bay is deeper, with a maximum depth of 51 feet. Two DNR- operated public accesses are available for use; one on the north end of the east bay and one on the southwest corner of the west bay. Lake Washington is a popular lake for angling and recreation. Much of the shoreline has been altered with residential development. Lake Washington is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Walleye is the only fish species that is stocked in Lake Washington. The base stocking plan calls for Walleye fry on odd years at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre. <br> \n <br> \nLake Washington was surveyed the weeks of August 3 and August 8, 2022, by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey included deploying 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, daytime electrofishing was conducted on May 18, 2022, to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Lake Washington is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2025. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 5.5 fish/gill net, which was similar to the long-term average for Lake Washington (5.7 fish/net). Walleye were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.4 fish/net. Walleye from both gear types ranged in total length from 10.1 to 27.2 inches and averaged 18.2 inches. About 90% of all Walleye were 15.0 inches or longer. Age-3 Walleye (2019 year-class) comprised 33% of all aged fish, which suggested that the 2019 stocking effort was successful. Non-stocked year classes were also present. The 2018 year-class was the second most abundant year-class (25% of aged fish) which resulted from natural reproduction. Starting in 2017, Walleye fry have been stocked on odd years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 2022 was 2.2 fish/gill net, which is near the long-term average for Lake Washington (2.0 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.3 fish/net. The total lengths of fish from both gear types averaged 28.0 inches. The largest fish measured was 39.0 inches. Northern Pike are not stocked in Lake Washington, so the population is the result of natural reproduction. Lake Washington is subject to southern zone Northern Pike regulations of 2 fish daily and a 24-inch minimum length limit. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 5.0 fish/net, which was down from 2019 (7.7 fish/net). This catch rate was below the long-term average of 10.9 fish/net. Total lengths ranged from 5.1 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.8 inches. Black Crappie were aged using scales and otoliths. Fifty four percent of aged fish were age-2. These parameters suggest a moderate-growing population. Black Crappie are not stocked in Lake Washington, so the population persists through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Bluegill catch rate was 2.0 fish/trap net, which was far below the long-term lake average for Lake Washington (17.5 fish/net). Despite the low abundance, the Bluegill population exhibited a quality size structure. Total lengths of Bluegill from trap nets averaged 7.4 inches, with the largest individual measuring 9.5 inches. The Bluegill population in Lake Washington is completely self-sustaining. There is a special 10 fish limit on sunfish regulation in place on Lake Washington,  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets). As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on Lake Washington on May 18, 2022, to target Largemouth Bass. The catch rate was 8.9 fish/hour in 2022. Largemouth Bass were sampled in trap nets in low abundance (0.5 fish/net). Total lengths of all Largemouth Bass in the survey ranged from 4.7 to 20 inches. Largemouth Bass are not stocked in Lake Washington. Spring electrofishing surveys targeting Largemouth Bass will be completed in conjunction with each Standard Survey on Lake Washington (every three years). <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2022 was 2.7 fish/gill net. This catch rate was below the long-term average for Lake Washington (14.2 fish/net). Total lengths averaged 7.8 inches and ranged from 5.8 to 9.9 inches. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for predator fish, especially Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum, often referred to as \"sheepshead\", were the most abundant fish species sampled in the 2022 Lake Washington survey. A total of 1,450 Freshwater Drum were sampled throughout the survey. The average length was 10.9 inches, and the largest fish was 18.3 inches. Freshwater Drum are native to Minnesota and are often caught on common angling gear.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled throughout the survey included Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Bowfin (dogfish), Bigmouth Buffalo, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements recorded in the 2022 survey included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. The secchi depth reading was 2.0 feet. During the week of August 3, 2022, water temperatures ranged from 79.3 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 55.2 degrees at a depth of 45 feet.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 8.5 mg/l at the surface to 0.0 mg/l at a depth of 45 feet.  A thermocline was detected at a depth of 29 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Washington is a relatively large water (1487 acres) located northeast of Mankato in Le Sueur Co.  A fishery survey was conducted in 2002 to monitor the fish community and lake characteristics.  Walleye abundance was at an all time high for this lake in 2002.  The walleye population consisted of many fish less than about 17 inches.  The largest walleye were 27 inches long.  The small walleye will continue to grow and will provide good angling opportunities in the next few years.  Excellent panfish angling is available, particularly for black and white crappie and bluegill.  Black crappie around 7 to 8 inches long are common, and fish up to around 12 inches long are present.  Small bluegill (4 to 6 inches long) are abundant, and bluegill up to around 8 inches are common.  Largemouth bass angling is popular in Lake Washington.  Northern pike are present at a low level of abundance.  Freshwater drum have been abundant since at least the 1980's.  Other fish species in Lake Washington include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin, common carp, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE BLUEGILL POPULATION REMAINS AT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL, WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. THE POPULATION IS LITTLE CHANGED FROM 1985, 25.71 PER TRAPNET LIFT IN 85 AND 25.67 PER LIFT IN 86. THREE YEAR OLDS ARE THE DOMINATE AGE CLASS IN 86, AS THEY WERE IN 85. BLUEGILLS ARE SLIGHTLY LARGER IN 86 THAN IN 85, AND MOST ARE OF AN ACCEPTABLE SIZE TO ANGLERS. BLACK CRAPPIES HAVE CONTINUED A DECLINE IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE FROM A HIGH OF 20.00 FISH PER TRAPNET LIFT IN 82, TO 7.50 FISH PER LIFT IN 85, TO 3.17 FISH PER LIFT IN 86. IN 85 THE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY THREE YEAR OLDS, WHILE IN 86 AGE CLASSES WERE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED WITH TWO AND THREE YEAR OLDS BEING DOMINATE. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE SLIGHTLY LARGER IN 86 THAN IN 85. AND MOST ARE OF AN ACCEPTABLE SIZE TO ANGLERS. GILLNET CATCHES OF WHITE CRAPPIES NEARLY DOUBLED FROM 85 TO 86. CATCH RATES WENT FROM 9.50 FISH PER NET IN 85 TO 17.0 FISH PER NET IN 86. WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. AGE CLASSES ARE WELL DISTRIBUTD WITH THREE YEAR OLDS BEING DOMINATE. SIZE CLASSES ARE ALSO WELL DISTRIBUTED WITH MOST FISH BEING BETWEEN 8.5-10.0 INCHES, VERY ACCPTABLE TO ANGLERS YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS ARE UP SHARPLY FROM 8.50 PER GILLNET SET IN 85 TO 30.67 PER SET IN 86. THE POPULATION HAS NEARLY RECOVERED TO 82 LEVELS (37. 66 PER SET). TWO AND THREE YEAR OLDS ARE THE DOMI- NATE AGE CLASSES PRESENT, WITH MOST FISH BETWEEN 5.5 AND 8 INCHES. NORTHERN PIKE NUMBERS REMAIN AT NEARLY THE SAME LEVEL AS IN 85, 1.67 FISH PER GILLNET SET IN 85 AND 1.50 FISH PER SET IN 86, BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. TRAPNET CATCHES, HOWEVER, DOUBLED IN 86 FROM 1.00 PER TRAPNET SET IN 85 TO 2.17 PER SET IN 86. AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTIN IS FAIRLY EVEN WITH THREE YEAR OLDS THE DOMINATE AGE CLASS. GROWTH IS EXCELLENT WITH 2 YEAR OLDS AVERAGING 17.55 INCHES AND THREE YEAR OLDS AVER- AGING 23.61 INCHES. CURRENT HIGH WATER LEVELS, HIGH PERCH POPULATION, AND LOW WALLEYE POPUALTION SHOULD FAVOR AN INCREASE IN NORTHERN PIKE NUMBERS. IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO LIMIT TRAPPING OF NORTHERN PIKE BROODSTOCK, FOR NPSA IN STREAMS ADJACENT TO L WASHINGTON TO ENSURE ENOUGH BROODSTOCK REACH SPAWNING AREAS. THE WALLEYE POPULATION REMAINS AT A LOW LEVEL, 0.50 PER GILLNET SET IN 85 AND 0.50 PER SET IN 86, WELL BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. NO WALLEYES UNDER 5 YEARS OLD WERE SAMPLED, INDICATING POOR SUCCESS OF STOCKINGS IN RECENT YEARS. WALLEYES SAMPLED WERE ALL BETWEEN 19 AND 23 INCHES. THE BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION IS AT A LOW LEVEL, DROPPING FROM 20.33 FISH PER GILLNET SET IN 85 TO 7.50 FISH PER SET IN 86. AVERAGE SIZE INCREASD FROM 58 LB. IN 85 TO .70 LB IN 86.GILLNET CATCHES FOR YELLOW BULLHEADS DROPPED FROM 31.33 FISH PER SET IN 85 TO 17.0 FISH PER SET IN 86; HOWEVER, TRAPNET CATCHES INCREASED FROM 31.67 PER SET IN 85 TO 83.83 PER SET IN 86. BOTH GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH REATES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. THE YELLOW BULLHEADS ARE QUITE LARGE, AVERAGING .85 LB. EACH. FRESHWATER DRUM REMAIN VERY ABUNDANT, 35.33 FISH PER GILLNET SET IN 85 AND 48.33 FISH PER SET IN 86. THEY ARE LARGE, AVERAGING .87 LB. EACH BOWFIN, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, WHITE SUCKER, CARP, GOLDEN SHINER, AND PUMPKINSEED WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS. ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS, 19.0 INCHES WAS SAMPLED; HOWEVER, PAST ELECTRO- FISHING DATA, SHORELINE SEINING, AND ANGLER REPORT INDICATE LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT. GROWTH IS GOOD FOR ALL GAMEFISH SPECIES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Washington is a 1,519-acre lake located in Le Sueur County about 7 miles northeast of Mankato. About half of the lake (783 acres) is less than 15 feet deep. Separate basins form Lake Washington into 2 main bays; an east bay and a west bay. The east bay is deeper, with a maximum depth of 51 feet. Two DNR- operated public accesses are available for use; one on the north end of the east bay and one on the southwest corner of the west bay. Lake Washington is a popular lake for angling and recreation. Much of the shoreline has been altered with residential development. Lake Washington is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. Walleye is the only fish species that is stocked in Lake Washington.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Washington was surveyed the week of August 5, 2019 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This standard survey included deploying 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, electrofishing was conducted on May 20, 2019 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 2.3 fish/gill net, which was less than the long-term average for Lake Washington (4.0 fish/net). Walleye were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 2.2 fish/net. Walleye from both gear types ranged in total length from 9.5 to 27.2 inches and averaged 17.2 inches. About 80% of all Walleye were 15.0 inches or longer. Age-4 Walleye comprised 42% of all aged fish, which suggested that the 2015 stocking effort was successful. The previous survey reported the 2014 year class was made up 47% of aged fish.  In 2019 the 2014 year class was the second most abundant making up 13% of aged Walleye.  Non-stocked year classes were also present, which resulted from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 2019 was 2.1 fish/gill net, which is near the long-term average for Lake Washington (2.0 fish/net). Northern Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 0.8 fish/net. The total lengths of fish from both gear types averaged 23.7 inches. The largest fish measured was 34.3 inches. Northern Pike are not stocked in Lake Washington, so the population is the result of natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Washington is located in the Southern Northern Pike Regulation Zone.  In this zone a Northern Pike must be over 24 inches in length in order to be harvested.  The daily bag limit for this zone is 2 fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 7.7 fish/net, down from 2016 which was the highest trap net catch rate (17.6 fish/net) on record for Lake Washington. The 2019 catch rate was below the long-term average of 11.1 fish/net. Total lengths ranged from 4.9 to 12.2 inches and averaged 9.7 inches. Sixty percent of all aged fish were age-2 or age-3. Black Crappie are not stocked in Lake Washington, so the population persists through natural reproduction. <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2019 Bluegill catch rate was 9.3 fish/trap net, which was far below the long-term lake average for Lake Washington (23.3 fish/net). Despite the low abundance, the Bluegill population exhibited a quality size structure. The total lengths of Bluegill from trap nets averaged 7.2 inches, with the largest individual measuring 9.9 inches. The Bluegill population in Lake Washington is completely self-sustaining.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears (gill and trap nets). As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on Lake Washington on May 20, 2019 to target Largemouth Bass. The catch rate was 28.3 fish/hour in 2019. Largemouth Bass were sampled in trap nets in low abundance (0.8 fish/net). Total lengths of all Largemouth Bass in the survey ranged from 4.0 to 18.1 inches and averaged 13.2 inches. Age groups from 1-10 were represented.  The largest year class represented was the 2015 (age 4) year class. Largemouth Bass are not stocked in Lake Washington. Spring electrofishing surveys targeting Largemouth Bass will be completed in conjunction with each standard survey on Lake Washington (every three years). <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2019 was 10.2 fish/gill net. This catch rate was below the long-term average for Lake Washington (15.4 fish/net). Total lengths averaged 6.5 inches and ranged from 5.7 to 9.9 inches. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for predator fish, especially Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum, often referred to as \"sheepshead\", were the most abundant fish species sampled in the 2019 Lake Washington survey. A total of 732 Freshwater Drum were sampled throughout the survey. The average length was 13.3 inches and the largest fish was 18.8 inches. Freshwater Drum are native to Minnesota and are often caught on common angling gear.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled throughout the survey included Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Bowfin (dogfish), Bigmouth Buffalo, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements recorded in the 2019 survey included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. The secchi depth reading was 3.5 feet. During the week of August 5, 2019 water temperatures ranged from 79.2 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 65.1 degrees at a depth of 30 feet.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 12.3 mg/l at the surface to 0.0 mg/l at a depth of 30 feet.  However at a depth of only 9.0 feet the reading was only 1.2 mg/l. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, natural resources specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Washington Lake is a 1,487 acre lake located in Le Sueur County northwest of the city of Madison Lake.  There are two DNR owned public access locations available for use; one is located on the north shore of the east basin off County Road 103 and the second is located just off Squirrel's Nest Point.  Washington Lake has a maximum depth of 51.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake was surveyed the week of August 12, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota Department of Natural Resource (DNR).  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets and electrofishing to monitor the fish community.  Freshwater drum was the most abundant fish species observed in the 2013 survey.  Catch rate values were 37.0 fish/gill net and 17.0 fish/trap net, both of which rank above average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The average total length of freshwater drum was 13.0 inches, with the largest drum measuring over 18.0 inches.  Although freshwater drum are not often targeted by anglers, they offer hard fighting action and good table fare.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch were captured in moderate to low numbers during the 2013 survey relative to previous surveys.  Black crappie abundance was modest in the 2013 survey.  Catch rates were 5.0 fish/gill net and 6.0 fish/trap net.  The 2 prior surveys (2002 and 2008) averaged 20.0 black crappies/gill net and 14.0 crappie/trap net, suggesting that black crappies were lower in abundance during 2013 than recent survey years.  However, the black crappie population in Washington Lake was still comprised of quality sized fish.  The average length of black crappies from both net types was nearly 9.0 inches with the largest individual measuring in at over 12.0 inches.  White crappies were also present in Washington Lake, although in lower abundance than black crappie.  Catch rates were 2.0 and zero white crappies in gill and trap nets, respectively.  The total length of white crappies was relatively large with an average length of 11.0 inches. Bluegill abundance was below the historic average for Washington Lake.  The trap net catch rate was 8.0 bluegills/net, while the historic average was nearly 31.0 fish/net.  The total length of bluegills in 2013 averaged 7.0 inches, with the largest fish measuring over 9.0 inches.  Despite the relatively low numbers in the 2013 survey, Washington Lake likely provides a quality bluegill angling opportunity.  The yellow perch catch rate in 2013 was 8.0 fish/gill net, which was below the Washington Lake historic average of 19.0 fish/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance has been variable throughout the last few decades and overall size structure was generally small, averaging less than 7.0 inches in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass were the primary predator species sampled during 2013.  Northern pike were apparently present from natural recruitment, since northern pike are not stocked in Washington Lake.  The 2013 gill net catch rate for northern pike of 2.0 fish/net tracked closely with the historic average for the lake (2.0 fish/gill net).  The size of northern pike from gill and trap nets averaged nearly 24.0 inches in length, with the largest fish measuring nearly 30.0 inches.  Northern pike sampled in this survey ranged in age from 2 to 5 years.  Washington Lake has supported a strong population of walleye in recent years, which results from stocking fry 3 of every 4 years.  The 2013 catch rate was over 5.0 walleye/gill net.  The average total length of walleye overall net sampling gear was just over 16.0 inches, while the largest fish measured was 26.0 inches.  Most walleye sampled during this survey were from the 2011 stocked year class.  Washington Lake is best known for the panfish opportunities available, but quality walleye fishing also exists.  The largemouth bass population was assessed using electrofishing, since that is the most effective sampling method for the species.  Electrofishing yielded 34.0 largemouth bass per hour of sampling, which averaged nearly 13.0 inches and 1.3 lbs each.  Largemouth bass sampled in this survey ranged in age from 1 to 6 years old, with most fish coming from the 2012 year class. The largest largemouth bass measured in this survey was nearly 18.0 inches in total length, so Washington Lake offers quality largemouth bass fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates were 5.0 fish/gill net, which was typical for Washington Lake.  Black bullhead averaged 12.0 inches in total length.  Yellow bullhead catch rates were 3.0 fish/gill net and 3.0 fish/trap net, which averaged nearly 13.0 inches in total length.  Other fish collected in the survey nets during 2013 in low numbers included common carp and bowfin. <br> \n <br> \nA near shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was also conducted in Washington Lake during the weeks of August 9 and September 9, 2013 to assess the populations of nongame species and young-of-the-year game fish using backpack electrofishing and beach seining.  Residential development was evident along much of the shoreline. The riparian zone has been altered; trees have been removed; manicured lawns extend to the water's edge and rip rap was present along the shoreline.  Emergent vegetation was abundant in select portions of the lake.  Near shore sampling collected several species of fish including black bullhead (N=67), black crappie (N=485), bluegill (N=16,179), bluntnose minnow (N=572), common carp (N=16), emerald shiner (N=153), freshwater drum (N=10), golden shiner (N=92), Iowa dater (N=33), johnny darter (N=98), largemouth bass (N=147), northern pike (N=6), pumpkinseed (N=3), spotfin shiner (N=2), spottail shiner (N=126), white crappie (N=1), yellow bullhead (N=12), and yellow perch (N=494).  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data to develop an IBI score which is indicative of the health of Lake Washington. This sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool that is being developed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

Low water, due to drought throughout the summer, made running close to shore difficult. The lake had a large algae bloom which made visibility near zero. DNR staff were able to collect 57 age-0 Walleye per hour of electrofishing. Many adult \"eater\" sized walleye were observed. <br> \nFin clips were taken for genetic analysis to determine if Lower Mississippi Strain ancestry is persistent in Lake Washington.</p>",

DNR staff were able to collect 12 age-0 Walleye per hour of electrofishing. Many adult \"eater\" sized walleye were observed. <br> \n <br> \nFin clips were taken for genetic analysis to determine if LMS ancestry is persistent in Lake Washington. <br> \n.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tWashington Lake is a 1,487 acre lake in LeSueur county northwest of the city of Madison Lake. Two DNR owned public accesses are available on the lake; one is located on the north shore of the east basin off LeSueur county road 103 and the other can be found off Squirrel's Nest Point next to Westwood Marina.  <br> \n\tWashington Lake was surveyed the week of July 21st, 2008 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. Freshwater drum (sheephead) were gill netted at a record level for the lake at 70 fish per net. A large stock of 9 and 10 inch drum are working their way through the fishery.  <br> \n\tBlack crappie were abundant in gill nets, averaging 19.6 fish per set. This value exceeds the upper quartile. Black crappie were trap netted near but not over the upper quartile, at 16.7 fish per trap net. Size distribution of black crappie looks good; fish ranged from 5.3 to 12.6 inches, with a combined gears average (mean) of 8.8 inches. White crappies are also available; 9 fish were caught each in gill and trap nets. Crappies should provide favorable angling opportunities in current and coming years. <br> \n\tDespite intense year round angling pressure for the species, Washington Lake again had large average (mean) size bluegills. Trap netted bluegills averaged 7.2 inches. The average size was heavily weighted by a large catch of older individuals. Younger fish and all bluegills overall were not well captured in trap nets during the assessment. The 2002 Washington Lake survey trap netted 862 fish; the 2008 survey captured 52. Further special assessments will be used to monitor the bluegill population. <br> \n\tWalleye dropped from the historic net catch highs of 2002 to a more modest 3.4 fish per gill net in 2008. Average (mean) walleye length was 17 inches. Walleye fry are stocked 3 out of 4 years. <br> \n\tThe Washington Lake northern pike population exhibits low density and large size traits. Three pike were caught in trap nets and eight pike were caught in gill nets, including a 39 inch fish. Of eleven fish, four were 30 inches and longer. Anecdotal reports from darkhouse spearers corroborate with netting data; many large fish are observed including a 43 inch fish harvested in early 2009. Other species present in Washington Lake include bigmouth buffalo, common carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and golden shiner.  <br> \n\tLargemouth bass were sampled in mid-May using a Smith Root electrofishing boat. Thirty fish per hour of on time were sampled. Most bass were under 11 inches. <br> \n     A point-intercept or grid sampling survey of aquatic plants was conducted August 12 -19, 2008 according to the methodology of Perleberg 2006. This survey was conducted to better quantifiy aquatic plant distribution and abundance, and to support the Lake Washington Clean Water Partnership.  An early season aquatic vegetation survey was also conducted by a private contractor and that data is available from Le Sueur County Environmental Services.  Figures 1-2 show sampling point locations in relation to depth contours of Lake Washington.  Thirty-six additional points were sampled but these points were not included in the analysis.  Lake Washington's plant community continues to maintain relatively good diversity and abundance.  Nineteen species or species groups were sampled (Table 1).  Their distributions are shown on the following map series, Figures 3-5. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Washington Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nPerleberg, D. 2006.

                "narrative": "<p>Washington Lake is a 1,519 acre lake located in Le Sueur County about 7 miles northeast of Mankato. Separate basins form Washington Lake into 2 main basins, an east basin and a west basin. The east basin is the deeper, with a maximum depth of 51 feet. Two DNR- operated public accesses are available for use, one on the north end of the east basin and one on the southwest corner of the west basin. Washington Lake is a popular lake for angling and recreation. Much of the shoreline has been altered with residential development. Washington Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey focused on Bluegill was performed the week of May 13th, 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nFourteen trap nets sampled 115 Bluegill. Average Bluegill length was 7.6 inches and lengths ranged from 3.8 inches to 9.5 inches. The average length of the ten largest Bluegills sampled was 8.8 inches. Almost 60% of Bluegills sampled were greater than 8 inches and 4% were greater than 9 inches. No Bluegills over 10 inches were sampled. Bluegill size in Washington Lake is categorized as \"Exceptional\". <br> \n <br> \nSix age-groups were present representing Bluegills 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 years of age. Catch was dominated by age-3 Bluegills which represented 45% of the catch and by age-4 Bluegills which represented 35% of the catch. Mortality of Bluegills is high in Washington Lake, however it is unknown what portion of annual mortality is natural versus fishing. Fishing pressure is heavy year-round. Reproduction appears consistent with occasional strong or weak year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills grow fast in Washington Lake. Growth is much more rapid than in similar lakes around the state. For example, the average length of age-4 Bluegill in Washington Lake was 7.6 inches compared to the lake-class average of 4.6 inches. Bluegill growth slows after age-5 which may signify fish are putting energy into reproduction rather than body growth. <br> \n <br> \nWashington Lake was selected for a targeted spring trap net survey because it is being considered for special regulations via the Quality Bluegill Initiative. Potential regulations could include a 5 or 10 Bluegill creel limit. To comment on potential regulations contact the Waterville Area Fisheries office by either phone or email. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder assistant area supervisor <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
