As late as 1995 it supported a small number of naturally-produced Brook Trout, and fairly high numbers of White Sucker.  By 1999 Northern Pike had become established in the lake.  Since then Brook Trout appear to have been eliminated, and White Sucker numbers have been greatly reduced.  This survey was done to check the lake for new species introductions, and to determine whether it still held a remnant Brook Trout population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant and surprisingly large in this lake in 2017.  Despite slow growth caused by a lack of forage, several fish larger than 24 inches (up to 30 inches) in length were sampled.  Fish as old as eight years were taken.  On average they reached a length of just 21.7 inches by the end of their fifth year. <br> \n <br> \nNo other fish species were found in 2017.  Eight minnow traps set around the shoreline caught no fish.  White Sucker and Brook Trout appeared to have been eliminated since 1995.  <br> \n <br> \nMissouri Lake can be tough to find, but for an angler willing to do a little extra work to get there, it could provide some surprisingly good Northern Pike fishing. <br> \n</p>",
