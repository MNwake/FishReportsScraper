GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE AVERAGE BUT SURVEY CREW DESCRIBED THEM AS VERY THIN. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS CATCH WAS 0.5/TRAPNET. AGES II, III, AND IV AND YY WERE SAMPLED AND GROWTH WAS FAST. BLUEGILLS AND BLACK CRAPPIES ARE PRESENT. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH WAS TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH RATE AND THE BLUEGILL CATCH WAS ABOUT HALF THE LMCR. BLUE- GILLS RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 8 INCHES, MEDIAN SIZE WAS ABOUT 5.5 INCHES AND PSD=29% CRAPPIES RANGED FROM 7 TO 10 INCHES, THE MEDIAN WAS ABOUT 8 INCHES AND PSD=38%. THOUGH PRESENT IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS, GREEN SUNFISH, PUMPKINSEEDS AND HYBRID SUNFISH APPEARED LATER IN THE SEINING SAMPLE. THE BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY HIGH AND REMAINS SO. CATCH RATES WERE 200/GILLNET, THE BULK OF THE TOTAL GILLNET CATCH, AND 55/TRAPNET. ALL WERE LESS THAN 9.5 INCHES IN LENGTH. YELLOW AND BROWN BULLHEADS WERE ALSO PRESENT BUT NOT ABUNDANT. THE CARP POPULATION WERE NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIAN. OTHER SPECIES PRESENT WERE WHITE SUCKER, GOLDEN SHINER, WHITE BASS, AND BLUNTNOSE MINNOWS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2009 Lake Susan population assessment occurred 8/03-06/09.  Fish abundances were low in both gillnets and trapnets as historically been the case.  In total, 216 fish were sampled in 2 gillnets and 9 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike indices for number (6.5 fish/gillnet) and mean weight (3.53 lbs) were above median values for similar lakes and have been increasing in each of the three most recent lake surveys.  Sampled northern pike ranged from 18-31 inches indicating a quality northern pike population exists in Lake Susan.  Northern pike growth was faster than other area class 38 lakes with northern pike reaching an average length of 22.0 inches by age 3.  Only 5 year-classes were sampled (1-5) which may indicate northern pike mortality may be high in Lake Susan. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye relative abundance (2.5 fish/gillnet) was above the median value for similar lakes.  Walleye fry historically have been stocked annually, however no stockings have occurred since 2003.  Two walleyes were sampled that originated from the 2006 year-class; these walleyes were assumed to have immigrated into Lake Susan from Lake Riley which lies downstream.  Two of the other three walleyes originating from Lake Susan stockings were 11 and 12 years old.  One walleye was sampled during the 2003 survey and no walleyes were sampled during the 1993 survey.  These factors indicate walleye fry stocking in Lake Susan is not a viable option for creating and sustaining a viable walleye fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill relative abundance (5.78 fish/trapnet) remained below the 25th percentile for similar lakes.  Bluegill average size was small with mean weight at the 25th percentile for similar lakes and a mean length of 5.7 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3.5-8.5 inches, with only five fish sampled over 7 inches.  The low abundance of bluegills and the productivity of Lake Susan account for the fast growth of bluegills in Lake Susan.  Bluegills averaged 4.0 inches by age 2 and 7.4 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie relative abundance was near average for similar lakes, but increased dramatically when compared to past surveys in 1993 and 2003.  The bulk of sampled black crappie ranged from 7.0-8.5 inches with an average of 7.7 inches.  Black crappie are known to have widely variable recruitment from year to year, and this is true in Lake Susan.  Only four year-classes were sampled with 71% of aged crappies originating from the 2007 year-class.  Only one black crappie was sampled during the 1993 survey and 9 were sampled during the 2003 survey.  Black crappie growth was above average with fish reaching an average length of 8.2 inches by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nThe University of Minnesota is conducting research on common carp in Lake Susan.  The goal of carp research in lakes Susan is to determine the relationship between carp abundance (biomass) and 'lake health' measured as water quality, vegetation density and native fish. To do so, the population of carp is estimated by employing mark-release-and recapture techniques, and initial measurements of water quality (such as total phosphorous and clarity), vegetation and native fish are collected. Then, specific numbers of carp are removed from each lake while improvements in water quality, vegetation, and native fish are monitored. This was done to determine at what densities the carp are no longer damaging to lakes to set achievable management goals.  Using this approach it was estimated that Lake Susan was inhabited by 4,180 carp (+- 800 carp) in 2008, of which 3,270 were removed in January 2009, and an additional 187 carp were removed in January 2010. This reduction of carp biomass from ~300 lbs/acre to ~60 lbs/acre resulted in doubling water clarity in this lake during May and June 2009. Currently the lake is inhabited by ~700 carp and additional removal will be attempted while measurements of water clarity and native fish will resume in spring 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nSmall numbers of black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and white sucker were also captured. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Susan is an 88-acre lake located in the city of Chanhassen, Carver County. A public city-owned boat launch is on the northwest corner of the lake within Lake Susan Park. A fishing pier is adjacent to the boat ramp, and a bike path along the north and west shores provides shore fishing opportunities. Maximum depth is 17 feet. A standard survey was conducted during July 2019 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was below-average but average size was large at over 28.5 inches. With the largest measuring just over 37 inches. Walleye have not been stocked into Lake Susan since 2003 but 4 Walleye were captured in this survey and all were between 23.00 and 24.99 inches. A downstream, connected water, Lake Riley, has been regularly stocked with Walleye, and is a likely origin of the fish sampled during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Bluegill have been caught in low numbers in Lake Susan.  Abundance was below average in trap nets for similar lakes but 31 Bluegill were captured in gillnets in this survey.  Combined statistics from gillnets and trap nets showed that Bluegill averaged just over 6 inches in length and ranged from 3 to just over 7.5\" inches. Of 77 Bluegill sampled, 61% were greater than or equal to 6.5 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was below average at 2.56/net in trap nets but was above average for gillnets at 21/net. Combined statistics show Black Crappie were just under 8 inches on average in Lake Susan and range from 4.72-9.96 inches with an average length of just under 8 inches.  Just over 53% of Black Crappie sampled were greater than or equal to 8.5 inches in length, and 17% were greater than or equal to 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance in the survey were Yellow Perch, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and Golden Shiner.  Largemouth Bass were captured in this survey but gillnets and trap nets are not optimal for sampling this species.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Susan is an 88-acre lake located in the city of Chanhassen, Carver County.  A public city-owned boat launch is on the northwest corner of the lake within Lake Susan Park.  A fishing pier is adjacent to the boat ramp and a bike path along the north and west shores provides shore fishing opportunities.  Maximum depth is 17 feet and water clarity in late July was 2.5 feet.  At that time, the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 8 feet.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNote: this survey was made following extensive recent (c. 2007-present) manipulations of the lake's fish and plants, most notably large-scale removals of Common Carp from 2007-2010, plantings of native aquatic vegetation, introductions of Eurasian-watermilfoil-eating weevils, and restoration of an adjoining wetland. This multi-agency research and management project aims to improve water quality and the fish and plant communities of Lake Susan, as well as the rest of the Riley Creek watershed.  Work was done by University of Minnesota researchers and the Riley Purgatory Bluff Creek Watershed District.  As of this DNR Fisheries report (spring 2015), Watershed-provided information on the project can be found at:  http://rpbcwd.org/locations/lake-susan-wetland-restoration/ <br> \n <br> \nThe number and size of Northern Pike caught in gill nets has been increasing since the 1988 survey.  Northern Pike gill-net catch has ranged from 1.0-10.5/net over the previous 5 surveys.  In 2014, relative abundance was high (10.5/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Mean size was large as pike averaged 25.8 inches and 3.89 lbs, with the largest measuring 34.1 inches.  Twenty-one Northern Pike were sampled in the gill nets and 6 (29%) were 28 inches or longer and 3 (14%) were 30 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Lake Susan since 2003.  Previous to that, approximately 150,000 fry were stocked annually.  In 2014, 3 Walleye from 22.0-23.2 inches were netted.  It is not likely there are any remnants from the 2003 or earlier stockings.  It is suspected Walleye migrate upstream into Lake Susan from Lake Riley, though other reasons for Walleye presence in Lake Susan are possible. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have historically been caught in low numbers (average = 7.0/trap net) in Lake Susan; however, in 2014, trap net catch (18/net) was the highest since the 1983 survey and near the median (15.9/net) when compared to other similar lakes.  The size structure was small where 84% of the Bluegill sampled were between 4.0 and 6.5 inches.  Mean length and weight were 5.4 inches and 0.15 lb, with the largest measuring 8.4 inches.  Only 31% were 6 inches or longer and 7.4% were 7 inches or longer.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie in Lake Susan exhibit variable recruitment that creates large variations in catch among surveys.  Abundances have ranged from 48.2/net in 1983 to 0.1/net in 1993.  In 2014, they were sampled at a rate of 3.4/trap net, which is low and below the median (15.9/net) when compared to other similar lakes.  As with abundance, Black Crappie average sizes have fluctuated over time, from 0.17 to 0.46 lb, with an average of 0.29 lbs.  In 2014, average size was 8.2 inches and 0.31 lb which is relatively large.  Thirty-two Black Crappie were sampled in the trap nets; of these 18 (56%) were 8 inches or longer and 8 (25%) were 9 inches or longer.  The largest measured 10.6 inches.         <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have never been abundant in Lake Susan and have always been sampled at a rate well below the median (8.5/gill net) for Class 38 Lakes.  In 2014, 3 fish were collected (0.5/gill net) and averaged 6.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the survey were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Susan Lake is a 93-acre, class 38 lake, located in the city of Chanhassen in Carver County.  The fish community was dominated by black bullheads; black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch were also present in limited numbers.  Walleye fry have been stocked in consecutive years since 1990.Northern pike, walleyes, and largemouth bass were present in low to moderate numbers. Based on gill net catches, northern pike were sampled with moderate abundance.   Sixteen pike between 14.0 and 31.0 inches were sampled.  Although walleye fry have been consecutively stocked since 1990, only two walleyes measuring 13.0 and 17.8 inches were sampled.  Although gill nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, two bass averaging 12.1 inches and 1.1 pounds were caught using gill nets.        Susan Lake has a panfish community consisting of bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and yellow perch.  Based on trap net catches, bluegills are present in relatively low abundance.  Eighty-six percent of sampled bluegills were below 6.0 inches.  Black crappie numbers are low but size is good.   Of the 11 total crappies sampled, 91% of the sampled population was greater than 8.0 inches and 55% was greater than 9.0 inches.   Four yellow perch averaging 8.5 inches and 0.3 pounds were sampled by gill nets.  Additionally, seven hybrid sunfish and one pumpkinseed sunfish were caught in trap nets.  Black bullheads, yellow bullheads, common carp, and white suckers were sampled in varying numbers.  Black bullheads comprised approximately 78% of all fish caught in gill net and trap nets combined.  Black bullhead net catches (188/gill net) exceeded the upper quartile for other class 38 lakes.  Six yellow bullheads averaging 11.1 inches and 0.7 pounds were additionally sampled in trap nets.  Two common carp averaging 25.4 inches and 6.5 pounds and two white suckers were also sampled during this survey.  The largest white sucker was 18.7 inches and 2.3 pounds.  </p>",
