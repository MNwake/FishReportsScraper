Dissolved oxygen readings were adequate to 7 feet. Sprite Lake has poor water clarity and is very bog stained. Northern pike were the only fish species sampled. Yellow perch remains were identified in some of the pike stomachs. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by portage from Phantom Lake (24 rods) or Meat Lake (90 rods). There are no designated USFS campsites present on Sprite Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2013 (16.0/gill net) were higher than similar lakes in the area. The pike are small and slow growing. The average pike sampled was 19.4 inches long and about 6 years old. The largest pike sampled was only 21.2 inches long.</p>",
