                "narrative": "<p>Moberg is a 36 acre lake with 17 (47%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 27 feet.  Moberg Lake is located 8 miles south of Floodwood, MN off Highway #73.  Moberg Lake has no developed public access but can be accessed across Highway #73 right-of-way.  There are three homes around the shoreline.     Black crappie, northern pike, white sucker and yellow perch were sampled by gillnet.  Catches of all but the white suckers were relatively high. Mean length of northern pike was 21.2 inches and growth was average, with length at age four of 22.4 inches.  Mean length of yellow perch was 6.6 inches and growth was average, with length at age four of 5.8 inches.     Black crappie abundance of 59.4 per trapnet lift was far above average compared to other Minnesota lake of similar type.  Mean length for black crappie of 5.4 inches was small.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 6.8 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a very strong 1999 year class and all year classes from 1994 through 1999 represented.     Other fish species sampled in Moberg Lake include golden shiner, largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.     Due to the relative difficulty of access, fishing pressure on Moberg Lake is considered light.  Future DNR fisheries management activities will be limited by its difficult access, small size and low fisheries management priority rating.</p>",
