Above average precipitation over the last 10 years has increaced the water level of Barry Lake approximately 4 feet according to flooded timber located on west and south west shorelines.  A rookery consisting of 76 Double-crested cormorants and four Great Blue Heron nets was located on the west shore.     Eleven fish species were sampled during this investigation, with black bullhead most abundant.  Most bullhead measured 7-8 inches, however individuals up to 13 inches were also caught.  Although one walleye measuring 18 inches was sampled, a fishable population probably does not exist in Barry Lake.     Three species of sunfish were represented in the trap net catch.  These species were comprised of a low abundance of green and pumpkinseed sunfish, and abundant orangespotted sunfish.  None of the sampled sunfish would draw much angler interest.     Other species sampled included low abundance of golden shiner, johnny darter and white sucker, moderate abundance of brook stickleback and Iowa, and abundant fathead minnow.    Monitoring during the winter of 2003/2004 measured low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and winterkill was possible.     Fisheries management activities for Barry Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring to evaluate winterkill potential.</p>",
