                "narrative": "<p>Bennett Lake is a popular local fishing resource in Central Park, City of Roseville. The lake is 23 acres in size and has a maximum depth of nine feet. An aeration system located on the east shore prevents winterkill and a fishing pier is located on the west shore. Additionally, there are many points around the lake at which shore anglers can access the lake. The lake is managed for Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Black Crappie and Northern Pike. Fish management consists primarily of stocking panfish and catfish in the spring. Central Park provides many amenities including ballfields, playgrounds, bathrooms, picnic areas, walking paths and a band shell. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill Sunfish are very abundant and can be readily caught from the fishing pier. The average length of Bluegill sampled in 2016 was 4.8 inches and is smaller than the previous survey (5.6 inches, 2011). Although Bluegill abundance was less than what was observed in 2011 it is still considerably above average for lakes with similar characteristics to Bennett. Bennett Lake is sometimes stocked in the fall with large Bluegill measuring up to 8.5 inches, these stockings are done opportunistically when large Bluegill are available. A few small Black Crappie were sampled in 2016, the average length was 4.8 inches. Historically the Black Crappie catch and size structure has varied greatly from survey to survey and this may represent only a temporary drop in average length for Black Crappie. Northern Pike were the most abundant large predator species seen in this survey with twenty two of them caught that ranged from 13.3 inches up to 28.0 inches in length. Northern Pike are not stocked into Bennett and are sustained through natural reproduction. A total of 1800 Walleye of various size categories have been stocked into Bennett since 2011. Despite these stocking efforts no Walleye were sampled during this survey. Largemouth Bass, which were stocked in 1983 and again in 1990 were found in low numbers, with just one fish caught that measured 13.0 inches. Past surveys have caught Channel Catfish however none were sampled in 2016. Other species sampled in low abundance included Black Bullhead (N=9), Green Sunfish (N=2), Hybrid Sunfish (N=4) and Pumpkinseed Sunfish (N=15). <br> \n</p>",

Pumpkinseed sunfish exhibited a similar size structure, but only 1.5% of all individuals sampled measured 6.0 inches or larger. Northern pike from 5 different age classes were captured. The average size of northern pike was 25.0 inches and 3.75 pounds. Approximately 36% of all northern pike measured 26 inches or larger. Walleye were sampled above median levels for abundance and averaged 19.0 inches in length and 2.5 pounds. Of all walleyes captured, 28% measured 20.0 inches or longer. Black bullhead were sampled above median levels for abundance, but averaged only 7.7 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bennett Lake is a popular fishing lake.  It is 23 acres and has a maximum depth of 9 feet.  An aeration system is operated to prevent winterkill.  This has allowed the lake to be managed for a variety of species - including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and channel catfish.  It is located in a large city park (Central Park in the City of Roseville) that has ample parking, bathrooms, playgrounds, a walking path around the lake, picnic areas, ball fields, and a band shell.  There is a fishing pier on the west side and several other shorefishing spots around the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant and readily caught from the fishing pier.  Average length was typical of metro area lakes at 5.5 inches.  However, the lake is stocked in the fall with several hundred bluegill between 7 and 8.5 inches.  The largest bluegill sampled in this assessment was 8 inches; 16% of the fish sampled were over 6 inches.  Anglers survey in 2003 also reported bluegill up to 8 inches.  Black crappie abundance is moderate.  Most crappie were between 5 and 6 inches, but 18% were over 7 inches, with the largest being 8.5 inches.  Northern pike are abundant, with lengths ranging from 16 to 33 inches and a 24-inch average length.   Largemouth bass are moderately abundant.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 15 inches.  Walleye and channel catfish were both sampled in low numbers, but the fish were large.  A survey of anglers in 2003 found Bennett to be a fairly popular catfish lake.  Black bullhead are present in low to moderate abundance, but are large with a 10.5-inch average length.  Other species sampled in low to moderate abundance were pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, carp, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bennett Lake is a popular local fishing resource in Central Park, City of Roseville. The lake is 23 acres in size and has a maximum depth of nine feet. An aeration system located on the east shore prevents winterkill and a fishing pier is located on the west shore. Additionally, there are many points around the lake at which shore anglers can access the lake. The lake is managed for bluegill, channel catfish, black crappie and northern pike. Fish management consists primarily of stocking panfish and catfish in the spring. Central Park provides many amenities including ballfields, playgrounds, bathrooms, picnic areas, walking paths and a band shell. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are very abundant and can be readily caught from the fishing pier. The average length of fish sampled in 2011 (4.8 inches) was smaller than the previous survey (5.6 inches) though abundance was similar. However, the lake is stocked almost annually in the fall with large bluegill measuring up to 8.5 inches. A few small black crappie were sampled in 2011, the average length was 5.5 inches. Historically the black crappie catch and size structure has varied greatly from survey to survey and this may represent only a temporary drop in abundance. Northern pike were the most abundant predator species seen in this survey with twelve of them caught that ranged from 18.9 inches up to 31.3 inches in length. Northern pike are not stocked into Bennett and are sustained through natural reproduction. Walleye have been stocked into Bennett most recently in 2010 and the three fish sampled were all from this stocking (age one fish, under 10 inches long). Channel catfish, which have been stocked almost every year since 1996 were found in low numbers, with just one fish caught that measured 11.1 inches. Past surveys have caught channel catfish up to 19 inches long. No largemouth bass were seen during the 2011 survey. Other species sampled included black bullhead (six fish), golden shiner, yellow perch, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
