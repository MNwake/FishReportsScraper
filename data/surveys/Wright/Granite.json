                "narrative": "<p>Granite Lake is a 339 acre recreational development lake six miles south of Annandale in Wright County.  It has a maximum depth of 34 feet.  Granite Lake on the EPA List of Impaired Waters because of mercury in fish tissue and high nutrients.  Secchi depth was measured to only 3.0 feet on 11 August, and dissolved oxygen dropped from 8.2 to 0.2 between 17 and 18 feet.  Aquatic plants were found down to eight feet.  Bushy and sago pondweed and coontail were common.  Curly-leaf pondweed, first recorded in 1980 on Granite Lake, was found on 22.2% of the lake (75.4 acres).  Nongame fish collected were carp; green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish; black and yellow bullhead; Johnny darter; golden and pugnose shiner; and bluntnose minnow.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, the northern pike catch rate of 4.3/gill net was similar to the 1999 rate of 3.7/ gill net.  Both years were near the average for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged from 17-34 inches.  Average length was 23 inches and weight was 3.3 pounds.  Northern pike greater than or equal to 24 inches were 39% of all pike sampled.      <br> \n <br> \nGranite Lake has been stocked with walleye regularly since 1970.  It has been part of a statewide study to evaluate stocking that began in 2000.  The study involved stocking of fingerlings in 2001 and 2007, marked frylings in 2003 and fry in 2005.  To evaluate the effects of the various stocking strategies, gill net assessments were conducted in 2004, 2006 and 2008.  The catch rates were all within the expected range.  Walleye sampled in 2008 ranged from 10-28 inches.  Average length was 19 inches and weight was 3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on May 12, 2008.  Seventy-eight fish were sampled for a catch rate of 77.3 fish/hour on-time.  This was similar to other Wright County lakes at 67/hour.  Bass ranged in length from 9-18 inches.  Average length was 10.4 inches and weight was 0.6 pounds. Growth of largemouth bass was within statewide averages. Largemouth reached 13 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of bluegill 26.1/trap was nearly identical to that of 1999 (29.3/trap net) and within the expected range for similar lakes.  Growth was above lake class averages for bluegill from both trap nets and gill nets, but average weight was low at 0.15 pounds.  Bluegill ranged between three and nine inches and 27% were six inches or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch (1.6/trap) was low and somewhat less than that of 1999 (2.8/trap).  Growth of black crappie was within averages for similar lakes. Black crappie reached nine inches by age four.  However, average weight (0.4 pounds) was above the expected range.  There were no fish larger than 11 inches in either trap or gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 yellow perch was sampled in gill nets in 2008.  Fish ranged from six to nine inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  The average weight was 0.17 pounds.  The catch rate was 4.2/net, which was significantly lower than the 1999 catch rate of 19.8/net, but still within the expected range of values.  The highest catch rate was 79.0/net in 1980.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Granite Lake was conducted on September 11-12, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including no species that are intolerant of disturbance and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2014 population assessment to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Granite Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Granite Lake is a 353 acre lake located south of the City of Annandale in Wright County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The watershed is small and primarily composed of agriculture (57%), open water (19%), and forest (10%).  A public access is located on the southwest side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked regularly since 1970 and Granite Lake has been included in the statewide stocking study since 2000.  As part of the study, Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2001 and 2007, oxytetracycline (OTC) marked frylings were stocked in 2003, 2009, and 2011, and OTC marked fry were stocked in 2005.  Gill netting was conducted in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012, and 214.  Catch rates were within the expected range of values for Lake Class 24 for surveys from 2004 to 2008, and above the expected range in 2012 (7.8/gill net) and 2014 (7.8/gill net).   <br> \n <br> \nBased on these positive results, 320,000 Walleye fry were stocked in 2015 on an experimental basis in the hope that fry would prove to be a more cost effective stocking strategy in Granite Lake.  Unfortunately fall electrofishing failed to sample any young of the year Walleyes and in response to these results, a combination of fingerling and yearling Walleye were stocked in the fall of 2015. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Granite Lake is a 353 acre lake located south of the City of Annandale in Wright County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The watershed is small and primarily composed of agriculture, open water, and forest.  A public access is located on the southwest side of the lake off County Road 5.  The last survey was conducted in 2008.  Anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation was mainly located in the south bay and on the hump in the center of the north end. The only species found were cattails, white waterlily, and yellow waterlily. Submerged plants were not surveyed, but Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in 2010. Water clarity was moderate: Secchi depth was 4.5 feet in mid August and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Secchi depths averaged 5.0 feet for July and August, 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked regularly since 1970 and Granite Lake has been part of a statewide stocking study since 2000.  Walleye fingerlings, frylings, and fry were stocked in different years and the results assessed by frequent gill netting.   Catch rates were within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Granite from 2004 to 2008 and above the expected range in 2012 and 2014.  Lengths in 2014 ranged from 10.0 to 28.0 inches, with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Results from the stocking study, such as the best Walleye age to stock, are not yet available.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2014 was more than double the catch in 2008 and above the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 9.3 to 35.0 inches and average length and weight were 25.2 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Fifty eight percent of Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were surveyed by daytime boat electrofishing on May 20, 2014.  The catch rate (46/hr) was above the average Montrose Area daytime catch (38/hr), but below the 2008 nighttime catch (77/hr).  Clear water in May and bright sun may have limited the catch; nighttime results would likely have been higher.  Lengths ranged from 6.3 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 13.9 inches.  Among catchable size fish (>8 inches), 48% were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches were within the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Past catches have varied widely and crappies are known for up and down population cycles.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.2 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  The Bluegill catch was lower than in 2008, but within the expected range of values. Past catches have differed greatly, similar to Black Crappies.  Lengths ranged from 3.5 inches to 7.9 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates declined since 2008 and were the lowest on record.  Yellow Perch catches were high in the early 1980s, but have been declining over time, similar to the statewide trend  Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 6.4 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches.  Other species sampled included: Bluntnose Minnow, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Central Mudminnow, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill net catch rates for Northern Pike were in the low range for lakes similar to Granite and declined significantly since the last assessment.  This was apparently due to a lack of consistent, successful repro- duction; the only year classes present were from 1990 and 1985.  Most Northern Pike were 15-16 inch yearlings.  Growth of these yearlings was fast. Walleye numbers were high (6.7/gill net), but average size was small (0.8 pounds).  Nearly all of the Walleye sampled were age 2 fish from the 1989 stocking and were 10-12 inches in length.  Growth rates of Walleye were average.  Yellow Perch showed average numbers (5.7/gill net) and growth rates.  Lengths ranged from 6-8 inches.  \n\nBluegill numbers remained similar to the 1986 assessment and were still in the high range for similar lakes.  Growth rates and average size (0.16 pounds) were both average.  Lengths ranged from 2-7 inches, with most Bluegill in the 5 inch group.  Black Crappie numbers and average size were both within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Granite and growth was average.  The average length of Black Crappie was 8 inches.  A total of 21 Largemouth Bass (25.5 pounds) were captured in 90 minutes of electrofishing, for a catch rate of 14.0 per hour.  Lengths ranged from 9.5-17 inches, and 38% of catchable size Largemouth Bass were over 12 inches.  Growth of Largemouth Bass was average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Granite Lake is located in Wright County, six miles south of Annandale.  The lake is 339 acres in size, and has a maximum depth of 34 feet and a mean depth of 18 feet.  A public access is located near the southwest end, with a parking lot and a boat ramp.  Granite Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and has been stocked with fingerlings in six of the past ten years.  Based on the 1999 summer survey, the Walleye population appeared normal compared to lakes similar to Granite, and the average size (2.9 pounds, or 20 inches) was large.  In the previous survey (1991), Walleye numbers were higher, but average weight was only 0.84 pounds.  Walleye sampled during spring netting averaged 25 inches, with some as large as 30 inches.  Northern Pike numbers during the summer survey were also normal for Granite Lake, but average size of pike (3.5 pounds) was relatively large.  The population appears to have increased since 1991.  Northern Pike up to 35 inches were captured during spring netting.  Yellow Perch numbers have increased since 1991, and are within the normal range.  Based on spring electrofishing, it appears that Largemouth Bass are abundant in Granite Lake.  The catch rate in 1999 was much higher than in 1991.  Largemouth Bass sampled in 1999 averaged 8 inches in length, but fish up to 20 inches were captured.  Bluegill abundance appeared to be down from 1991, but still was within the range expected for lakes like Granite.  Bluegill were small on average (4.9 inches), but a few individuals over 8 inches were seen during spring netting.  Black Crappie numbers were down from 1991, but remained within the normal range.  Crappies averaged 8 inches in length, or 0.3 pounds.  Some large crappies were seen during the survey, including one over 15 inches.  Growth rates of all game species sampled from Granite Lake in 1999 were normal when compared to statewide averages.  Black Bullhead numbers have fallen and are now low, while Yellow Bullheads are within the normal range.  Average weight for both species is relatively high.  Green, Hybrid, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish are also present in Granite Lake, as well as White Sucker and Common Carp.</p>",
