                "narrative": "<p>Lory Lake is a 212 acre lake located in northern Isanti County near the town of Day.  There is a public access on the west side of the lake with roadside parking available.  It is fairly shallow, with a maximum depth of 21 feet, and an average depth of about seven feet.  The lake has a full survey every ten years and a population assessment every five years.  There is some development on the lake, as there are 14 cabins on it.  The rest of the shore (70%) is mostly undeveloped marshland and mixed deciduous forest.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, and black crappie).  There is also secondary management for walleye, as the lake is stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings.  The population survey was conducted over two sampling periods.  One was on 5/20/99 when an electrofishing survey was conducted to determine largemouth bass populations, the other occurred from August 30 to September 2, 1999 with six gill nets and nine trap nets.  Three seine hauls were made on 9/2/99 to determine young-of-the-year (YOY) production and abundance of forage species.  The results of the survey show there is a good population of largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, walleye, and bullheads.The catch rate for largemouth bass while electrofishing was 92.48 fish/hour.  This indicates that there is a good number of largemouth bass in the lake.  The size distribution of the bass was good, as there were fish caught from 5.4 to 17.8 inches in length, with an average length of 11.3 inches and average weight of 1.2 pounds.  Growth of the bass was also good, as the fish were at or above average growth rates for all ages.  There was also a good representation of year classes present, with fish ranging from 2 to 10 years old, with most of the fish being two and three years old.  Overall, the largemouth bass population in this lake appears to be healthy and stable.The northern pike gill net catch in 1999 was 5.83 fish/set and is in the normal range for this type of lake.  The size distribution of the northerns was good, as there were fish caught from 14.8 to 33.9 inches in length, with an average length of 21.9 inches and average weight of 2.5 pounds.  Natural reproduction of northern pike in this lake is very good, as there were fish from most year classes dating back to 1992.  The northern pike showed average growth for every age class.  Overall, the northern pike population in this lake appears to be healthy and stable.The bluegill trap net catch in 1999 was 14.78 fish/set and is normal for this type of lake.  The average size fish was 5.2 inches, with fish ranging in size from 3.2 to 7.1 inches.  Most of the fish (70%) were between 4.5 and 6.5 inches.  There is good natural reproduction, as evidenced by the large number of smaller fish caught.  There is one noticeable trend, however, in that there is a good number of fish sampled up to seven inches, but very few larger than that were sampled.  This is similar to catches in previous surveys.  The reasons for this could be due to angler harvest of fish over seven inches, or it could be that our sampling gear is missing the larger bluegills, which tend to be deeper than the trap nets can sample.  Other than the fact that there were few large fish sampled, the bluegill population appears to be healthy and stable.The black crappie trap net catch of 6.0 fish/set was also within the normal range for this lake.  The average size of the black crappie was 7.9 inches, with fish ranging in size from 5.7 to 9.7 inches.  Fifty percent were between 7.5 and 8.5 inches.  The crappie population, at this time, appears to have a higher number of larger fish, as there were none caught below 5.5 inches. Overall, the crappie population appears to be healthy.The walleye population in this lake is dependent upon stocking to maintain the population, as it is stocked every other year with fall fingerlings.  There is some limited natural reproduction, but not enough to sustain the fishery by itself.  The walleye gill net catch was 2.67 fish/set, which is average for this lake, and is normal for this type of lake.  The walleyes showed average growth for all year classes.  The fish ranged from 13.3 to 26.8 inches.  Average size of the walleyes was 21.8 inches and 4.1 pounds.  The reason for the high average size is because these fish are seven years old or older.  Once these larger fish are gone, it will be a few years before there is a large number of them again.  The lake was stocked in 1998 and will be stocked in 2000, so these stockings should bring back the walleye population, although it will take 7 or 8 years for the fish to attain the average size they are now.  In two to three years though, there should be some 13 to 15 inch fish to be caught.Of the three bullhead species present, yellow were the most abundant, followed by black and then brown.  Catch rates for all three species were similar to those in previous surveys.  The brown bullhead had the highest average size, with all fish over 12 inches.  Yellow bullhead were second largest, averaging 11 inches in length.  The black bullheads averaged 10 inches in length.  Overall, the bullhead population is normal for this lake.The yellow perch gill net catch in 1999 was 2.83/set which is below normal for this type of lake.  This is below the long term average of this lake as well.  This is most likely related to high predation by northern pike and walleye, because in the 1994 and 1999 surveys both northern pike and walleye numbers were high.  But this should not be of great concern, because after the previous low in 1984, the catch jumped to 11.8/set five years later, the highest recorded catch.  So the perch have shown the ability to replenish their numbers when predator numbers are lower.  The average size of the perch was 6.0 inches, with a range of 5.2 to 7.2 inches.  Overall, the perch population at this time is low, but could return to higher numbers in the next few years.The pumpkinseed sunfish trap net catch was below average for the lake, but was still normal for the lake type.  The average size was 4.7 inches, with a range of 2.9 to 7.3 inches.  Overall, the pumpkinseed sunfish population looks healthy and normal for this lake.This lake is a good fishing lake for east central Minnesota.  There are a wide variety of species available, with everything from bluegills to walleyes.  There is an excellent population of largemouth bass, with fish averaging over a pound.  A lot of the bass were 2 and 3 years old, so good bass fishing should continue for the next few years as these fish get larger.  Northern pike fishing should be good as well, with a good population and fish averaging 21.9 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Bluegill fishing in the lake should be good, with plenty of fish that have an average size of 5.2 inches.  Black crappie fishing should be good for the next couple of years, as there was a good number of fish, with all fish surveyed 5.5 inches and longer.  Currently, walleye fishing at this time could be good, especially if you are looking for a nicer fish.  The walleyes caught in the survey averaged 21.8 inches and 4.1 pounds, which is a very good average size.  This may not last too much longer though, as most of the fish are seven years old or older, and once they are gone it will take awhile for the fish stocked in 1998 and 2000 to reach that size.  But there should also be some 13 to 15 inch fish from the 1998 and 2000 stocking in 2 to 3 years, so good walleye fishing should continue.  Yellow perch fishing at this time is probably not that good, as there were very low numbers, and the average size fish was small at 6.0 inches.  Bullhead fishing should be good, with average numbers and some species averaging 12 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also available, with average numbers and average size fish.One thing that anglers could do to try to improve the size structure of the panfish, especially the bluegills, is to keep smaller fish, and release some of the larger fish.  By practicing this selective harvest, it could eventually lead to a better quality size in the bluegill population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN AUGUST OF 1989 A POPULATION ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED ON LORY LAKE. 5 GILL NETS AND 4 TRAP NETS WERE SET, AND THESE ALONG WITH SHORELINE SEINING WERE USED TO ASSESS THE CURRENT FISH POPULATION. BASED ON LOCAL MEDIANS AND OTHER DATA, THE STATUS OF THE CURRENT FISH POPULATION IS AS FOLLOWS: THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH OF 2.80/SET SHOWS A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY'S CATCH OF 5.80/SET IN 1984, BUT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE VALUES MEASURED IN THE 1980 POPULATION ASSESSMENT AND 1974 RESURVEY. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGES FROM 22.0 TO 31.9 INCHES, AND THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP IS 25.0-25.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT OF NORTHERN PIKE IS 3.84 PDS, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN OF 3.12 PDS FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE 14 FISH AGED RANGED FROM AGE II TO AGE XI, WITH AGES III, IV AND X MISSING FROM THE DISTRIBUTION. GROWTH RATES ARE SLOW IN THE YOUNGER AND OLDER FISH, BUT NORMAL FOR THE MIDDLE YEARS OF LIFE. THE WALLEYE NET CATCH OF 1.00/SET IS THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES FROM 17.0 TO 25.9 INCHES, WITH THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP BEING 19.0-19.9 INCHES. THESE VALUES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. MEAN WEIGHT OF WALLEYE CAPTURED IS 3.69 POUNDS; THIS GOOD SIZE NOT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE 6 FISH AGES RANGED FROM AGE II TO AGE IX. GROWTH IS NORMAL. YELLOW PERCH NET CATCH IS NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIAN. CATCH SHOWS A REAL INCREASE FROM THE MOST RECENT SURVEY, BUT HISTORICAL COMPARISONS ARE DIFFICULT DUE TO WIDELY FLUCTUATING CATCH LEVELS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES FROM 4.5 TO 8.9 INCHES, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES. THESE VALUES SHOW NO CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE 17 FISH AGED RANGED FROM AGE I TO AGE VI, WITH THE 1984 AND 1985 YEAR CLASSES BEING HEAVILY REPRESENTED. BLUEGILL NET CATCH HAS NOT CHANGED FROM THE PRE- VIOUS SURVEY, WHEN IT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ALL PREVIOUS SAMPLES. THE CATCH IS HIGHER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN  20.00/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 2.5 TO 8.4 INCHES, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.5-5.9 INCHES. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGE OF THE LAST SURVEY WAS 5.0 TO 7.4 INCHES. THE APPEARANCE OF THE SMALLER SIZE CLASSES SINCE THE LAST SURVEY, ALONG WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF AGE 0+ BLUEGILLS IN THIS SURVEY'S SHORELINE SEINING INDICATES HIGH LEVELS OF SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION. THE 30 FISH AGED RANGED FROM AGE I TO AGE VI. GROWTH IS NORMAL. BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH IS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND IS NEAR THE LOCAL MEDIAN 5.75/SET. A GILL NET CATCH OF 30.40/SET REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY'S CATCH OF 5.00 SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES FROM 4.0 TO 13.9 INCHES, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 8.5-8.9 INCHES. THESE VALUES HAVE NOT CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. MEAN WEIGHT HAS NOT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. THE 34 BLACK CRAPPIE AGED CAME FROM BOTH TYPES OF NETS, AND RANGED FROM AGE II TO AGE VIII. GROWTH IS CLOSE TO NORMAL. 40 AGE 0+ BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED IN SHORELINE SEINING. ONLY TWO LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAPTURED IN TEST NETS, BUT 113 AGE 0+ WERE CAPTURED IN SHORELINE SEINING. THIS REFLECTS GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR THIS SPECIES. TWO OTHER SPECIES OF FISH (BROWN BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED) WERE CAPTURED AT LEVELS NEAR LOCAL MEDIANS. FIVE OTHER SPECIES OF FISH (WHITE CRAPPIE, BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, WHITE SUCKER, GOLDEN SHINER) WERE CAPTURED AT LEVELS BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS. OF THESE SEVEN, ONLY YELLOW BULLHEAD AND PUMPKINSEED SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, WITH THE PUMPKINSEED CONTINUING A PATTERN OF LARGE POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN SAMPLES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lory is a fertile, 212 acre lake in northern Isanti County.  Lakeshore development and water clarity are fairly low.  A public boat access is located on the west side of the lake with roadside parking.  Managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, the lake is stocked with 150 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially.  Fishing pressure is low to moderate in summer and moderate to high some winters.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on 2009 field results, anglers can expect good numbers of quality sized largemouth bass.  Bass averaged 13.2 inches and 1.4 pounds with 30% of the catch topping 15 inches.  Northern pike have decreased in abundance since 2004 with a compensatory jump in size.  Northerns average 25.1 inches and 3.4 pounds with memorable fishery over 30 inches present.  Black crappie are more common in Lory Lake than in most similar lakes.  Crappie size has improved with 40% of the catch exceeding 8 inches.  Bluegill remain in good supply with the best size structure since 1984.  Just over 30% of the bluegill catch topped 7 inches, providing additional harvest opportunity for panfish.  Walleye abundance has rebounded to a level more typical of the historic mean.  Hopefully, the increased stocking rate will help maintain walleye at this level or higher.  All captured walleye were 20 inches or larger.  Yellow perch numbers remain low.  Other fish species present in the lake included; brown and yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",

A public boat access is located on the west side of the lake with roadside parking. The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Fishing pressure is low to moderate in summer and moderate to high some winters.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on 2021 assessments results, anglers can expect good numbers of quality sized Largemouth Bass. Bass averaged 12.9 inches and 1.4 pounds with more than a third of the catch topping 15 inches. Northern Pike abundance decreased slightly since 2013 but size bumped up some. Northerns averaged 23.2 inches and 2.7.   <br> \nBlack Crappie are still abundant in the lake and with bass receive the bulk of anglers' attention. While 30% of the crappie catch from trap nets exceeded 9 inches, gill netted crappie were notably smaller. Most were under 7 inches.   <br> \nBluegills provide additional harvest opportunity. Their abundance in the trap nets increased with a subsequent decrease in size. Less than 15% of the catch topped 7 inches. Walleye abundance was down compared to the lake's historic mean. Lory Lake was removed from the regular stocking list after 2015. Walleye will now only be stocked when a surplus is available. The three walleye captured ranged from 21 to 27 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lory is a fertile, 212 acre lake in northern Isanti County.  Lakeshore development and water clarity are fairly low.  A public boat access is located on the west side of the lake with roadside parking.  Managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, the lake is stocked annually with 150 pounds of Walleye fingerlings.  Fishing pressure is low to moderate in summer and moderate to high some winters.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on 2013 assessments results, anglers can expect good numbers of quality sized Largemouth Bass.  Bass averaged 13.4 inches and 1.5 pounds with a fourth of the catch topping 15 inches.  Northern Pike abundance increased some since 2009 with a compensatory drop in size.  Northerns average 22.3 inches and 2.4 pounds with fish over 30 inches still present.  Black Crappie remain plentiful in the lake and with bass receive the bulk of anglers' attention.  While crappie size has dipped since 2009, 30% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill provide additional harvest opportunity.  Present in typical abundance, the catch mirrored the 2009 data in size and number with just over 30% of the Bluegill catch topping 7 inches.  Walleye abundance remains typical of the lake's historic mean.  Hopefully, the move to annual stocking will maintain Walleye at this level or higher.  As in 2009, Walleye were atypically large with all captured fish exceeding 18 inches.  Walleye fry were stocked in May of 2013.  However, night electrofishing in September failed to sample any young of the year Walleye.  Yellow Perch numbers showed a slight increase but remain low.</p>",

The largemouth bass was absent in the trap net catch, but 1 fish was taken in the gillnets and 59 young of the year were captured during the shoreline seining.  The yellow bullhead at 10.50 per set was high while the brown bullhead (2.25) was low and the black bullhead was very low (absent in the trapnet catches but 2.20 in the gillnet).

                "narrative": "<p>Lory Lake provides a diverse fishery for its relatively small size.  In an area where lakes are scarce, Lory receives considerable fishing pressure in both summer and winter.  DNR Fisheries crews conducted a lake survey on Lory Lake in 1994.  Gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing were used to evaluate the fish population.     Northern pike and walleye both had their highest numbers ever in 1994.  Most of the northern pike were in the 17-21 inch range, with an average weight of 1-1/2 pounds.  Walleye had a wide range of sizes, up to 27 inches, but the highest numbers were 13-14 inches with an average weight of 1-1/2 pounds.     Largemouth bass abundance was good in 1994.  Electrofishing results showed bass up to five pounds, with good numbers of bass 11-16 inches on length.     Numbers of panfish were average for this type of lake.  Both black and white crappies are found in this lake, but black crappies outnumbered whites in test nets.  The average length of black crappies was 6.2 inches, with lengths ranging from 4-10 inches.  Good numbers of medium-sized bluegills were present, with lengths ranging up to 7-1/2 inches.     Other species present in Lory Lake include yellow perch, bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and golden shiner.  Brown bullheads reach fairly good sizes, up to 14 inches.  Carp have been seen in the past, but none were seen in survey nets in 1994.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lory is a fertile, 212 acre lake in northern Isanti County.  Lakeshore developement and water clarity are fairly low.  A public boat access is located on the west side of the lake with roadside parking.  Managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, the lake is stocked with 150 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially.  Fishing pressure is low to moderate in summer and moderate to high some winters.  Based on 2004 field results, anglers can expect good numbers of quality sized largemouth bass.  Bass averaged 12.9 inches and 1.5 pounds with 44% of the catch 15 inches or more in length.  Northern pike increased in abundance and size since 1999.  With an average of 23.6 inches and 3 pounds, there's a good availability of northerns from 21 to 26 inches.  Black crappie are more common in Lory Lake than in most similar lakes.  Crappie size has improved since 1999 but more than 3/4ths of crappies measured were less than 8 inches.  Bluegill are also in good supply but size may be an issue to some anglers.  Less than 25% of the bluegill catch exceeded 6 inches in length and few reached 7 inches.  Despite an increased stocking rate, walleye abundance in Lory Lake has been in decline.  Only one walleye was sampled in 2004.  Yellow perch abundance has also decreased.  Other fish species present in the lake included; black, brown, and yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish. </p>",
