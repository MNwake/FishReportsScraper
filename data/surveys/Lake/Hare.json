There is a steep gravel back-in ramp on the southeast end of the lake.  Hare Lake is not a Designated Stream Trout Lake and so live minnows as bait, two lines while ice fishing are allowed, the fishing season is the same as other inland lakes.  A trout stamp is not required to angle on Hare Lake, however to have trout in possession a trout stamp is required. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout yearlings are stocked annually in Hare Lake in the spring.  Occasionally, adult brook trout culled from the hatchery brood stock are stocked in late fall.  There are still brown trout present in Hare Lake, last stocked with brown trout in 2005. <br> \n   <br> \nBrook trout numbers in Hare Lake were above average for the Finland Area and similar to catches in previous investigations.  The average length of brook trout was 9.7 inches (0.3 pound); the largest brook trout sampled was 14.9 inches (1.3 pounds).  Thirty-six percent of the brook trout sampled were 10 inches or greater.  One brown trout 18.9 inches (2.6 pounds) was also collected in the 2011 population assessment. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find large populations of undesirable fish (yellow perch, white sucker, creek chub) competing with the trout population for the forage base and anglers bait.  Expect some nuisance bites while fishing for trout on Hare Lake.  The average length of yellow perch was 5.8 inches, the largest was 10.5 inches.  Many of the yellow perch had yellow grub parasites. <br> \n</p>",

The access to Hare Lake is a small gravel back-in on the southeastern shore of the lake, located 18 miles northeast of Finland, MN on Lake County Road #7 in the Superior National Forest.  Although the lake is stocked with Brook Trout, Hare Lake is not a Designated Stream Trout Lake, thus use of live minnows for bait and two lines while ice fishing are allowed.  A trout stamp is not required to fish Hare Lake, however to be able to harvest trout, a trout stamp is required.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough 2,000 yearling Brook Trout were stocking in the spring of 2014 only one Brook Trout was sampled during the assessment.  The Brook Trout was 8.3 inches and weighed 0.2 pounds.  The fish was determined to be age-1 and was from the spring stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of White Sucker were also sampled in the nets and ranged in length from six inches to sixteen inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were lower than previous assessments class and averaged 6.5 inches with the largest being 10.75 inches.  Forty-two Creek Chubs were sampled with the nets and averaged 8.00 inches.  Golden Shiner and Common Shiner were also sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2015 targeted survey on Hare Lake was conducted to assess the survival of stocked Brook Trout, after a 2014 population assessment sampled only one Brook Trout.  Hare Lake is a 48 acre lake located 18 miles northeast of Finland, MN on Lake County Road #7 in the Superior National Forest.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22.0 feet and 89% of the lake is littoral.  Water clarity was 6.0 feet and color was brown from bog-stain.  The shoreline consists of mixed coniferous forests and bog.  The majority of the shoreline is under private ownership with the remainder being federal and county.  Although the lake is stocked with Brook Trout, Hare Lake is not a Designated Stream Trout Lake, thus use of live minnows for bait and two lines while ice fishing is allowed.  A trout stamp is not required to fish Hare Lake, however to be able to harvest trout, a trout stamp is required. <br> \n <br> \nThe access to Hare Lake is a small gravel back-in on the southeastern shore of the lake.  The lake access is off of Lake County Rd #7.  The access is suitable for small to medium size boats and canoes.  There is a small area for parking for 2-3 vehicles with trailers.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough 2,000 yearling Brook Trout were stocked in the spring of 2015, zero Brook Trout were sampled during the survey.  It is not known why no Brook Trout were sampled but is thought to be due to low survivability of Brook Trout due to significant competition with abundant non game fish.  Similarly, a population assessment in 2014 only caught 1 Brook Trout.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough no Brook Trout were sampled, other fish species were caught.  High numbers of White Sucker were sampled in the nets and ranged in length from 3.5 inches to 16.7 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were lower than previous assessments on the lake and averaged 6.0 inches with the largest being 11.5 inches.  Many of the Yellow Perch sampled were heavily infested with the fish parasite, yellow grub.  Creek Chub, Golden Shiner, and Common Shiner were also sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFishing Pressure on Hare Lake has been recently very minimal with anglers reporting very little success for trout.  The past two investigations indicate that stocking Hare Lake with Brook Trout is not meeting management objectives.  Therefore, other management options will be considered.   <br> \n</p>",

Annual stockings of yearling Brown Trout maintains an abundant population with 10\"-12\" being the most common size caught. The largest Brown Trout observed in the 1993 survey was 17.2\" however individuals of 24\" and 26\" have been sampled in previous assessments.     Shorefishing is very popular and productive with easy access from Lake County Rd. #7.</p>",

Live bait (minnows) are allowed at all times and two lines are allowed during the winter stream trout season.  As on other stream trout waters an angler must have a trout stamp in order to have trout in possession.  The lake is stocked each spring with 3,000 yearling brown trout.     Fish collection in DNR test nets in 1999 were: brown trout, yellow perch, white sucker, common shiner, golden shiner and creek chub.  Hare Lake has above average numbers of brown trout with some quality size fish present.  The fish collected in the lake survey ranged from 8.4 inches to 17.8 inches with trout from 2 pounds to 2.7 pounds in the sample.  The majority of the brown trout however were less than 12 inches.  Hare Lake has a very high population of fish species that are undesirable in a stream trout lake including yellow perch, white sucker and various minnow species that are probably competing with trout for the available food.  The yellow perch are not large enough to interest anglers with almost all of those taken in the survey between 5 inches and 7 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hare Lake is located about 18 miles northeast of Finland and is 48 acres in size with a maximum depth of 22 feet. The lake was previously managed for stream trout however low dissolved oxygen levels in the summer likely contributed to poor success of stocked trout. The management was switched to Walleye stocking as the lake had abundant forage and habitat appropriate for the species. There is a small gravel back-in access suitable for small to medium sized boats located along the southeast shore. The access is on private property with an easement that provides for respectful public use. The area is small and limited to a few vehicles with trailers. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 survey was the first since Walleye fingerling stocking began in 2017. The number of Walleye caught was much higher than the normal range for similar lakes indicating the first years of stocking have been successful. The average length of Walleye was 11.6 inches with fish ranging from 6.9 to 23.3 inches long. Only 14% of the catch measured longer than 15 inches. Growth appeared to be average for the area. The stocked 2018 year class accounted for 65% of the catch and averaged just over 12 inches in length at the time of the survey. The first few years of Walleye stocking has been extremely successful, but the abundance and size structure sustainable in the lake long-term is yet to be determined.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important forage fish in the lake and were sampled at close to normal numbers compared to similar lakes in the area. The longest perch was 7.5 inches, and they are likely not of interest to anglers. White Sucker are another important forage species in the lake and were sampled at above average numbers for the lake class. Common Shiner, Creek Chub, and Golden Shiner were other forage species sampled with the trap nets. All the forage species sampled are potentially important to the success of the Walleye stocking.</p>",

The brookies average 10 inches in length with an occasional fish over 14 inches.  A few brown trout, average size of 12 inches, were also present.  Numerous small yellow perch and white sucker will keep anglers rebaiting their hooks while they wait for a trout.</p>",

Brown trout ranged from 8.1 to 19.0 inches (3.5 lb) with the majority of the fish (76%) from 9 to 12 inches.  The lake supports very high populations of white sucker, yellow perch and various minnow species.  Brook trout are not stocked in Hare Lake, although they have been sampled occasionally in some assessments.  A 9.8 inch brook trout was collected in the 2004 assessment.

A possible cause for this decline is because no Brown Trout yearlings were stocked in 1987 although scale reading indicates there may be some natural reproduction of Brown Trout.     Brook Trout are occasionally taken by anglers and in test nets ('79, '80, '81) from a naturally reproducing population.       Yellow Perch numbers are still high but significantly lower than the 200-400/gillnet lift of seven years ago.  The decline of Yellow Perch could possibly be the result of removing 800 pounds of Yellow Perch.</p>",
