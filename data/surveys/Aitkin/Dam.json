                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in central Aitkin County, with a public access on the southwest end of the lake.  Historically, the lake has supported a quality fishery for several species.  <br> \n <br> \nLarge bluegills were common in Dam, however, average size has been decreasing.  Bluegill natural reproduction and recruitment occurs annually. Strong reproductive success, fishing pressure, slower growth rates and apparent insufficient predation suggest that the size of bluegill will remain relatively small. In 2002 and 2007, no bluegill over 8 inches were sampled in the trap net assessments. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have decreased in abundance since 2002, from 8.5 to 3.4 per gill net lift, which is comparable to levels found in the 1980s. The population is maintaining a decent size structure. The average northern pike sampled in gill nets was 22.3 inches long and fish up to 30.5 inches were sampled. Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch decreased in abundance to the second lowest observed in 8 gill net assessments since 1960.  Since the 1985 survey, few perch over 8 inches have been observed in the assessments.  This decrease in the abundance of large perch, and the lack of their predation on young bluegill, may partially explain the increase in density and decrease in growth rates of small bluegill.  If perch abundance continues to decline, northern pike growth rates would be expected to decrease, and bluegill abundance likely will increase, decreasing bluegill growth rates even further. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have exhibited a stable population since the 1960's. Length frequency distributions from the various surveys have consistently shown a black crappie size structure that ranges from 5 inches up to 13 inches. The 2007, the trap net catch for crappie was 8.5 per net, which is as high as it has been since 1960 when it was 14.8 per net. The mean length for crappie was 7.3 inches, and fish to 11.8 inches were observed. Recruitment was consistent from 2003 through 2005. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gillnet abundance has increased from 2.7 per net in 2002 to 3.8 per net in 2007.   The 2004 year class is currently the most abundant in the fishery and are 12 to 16 inches long. Fluctuations in walleye abundance have been observed over the years; however, overall the walleye population has not changed significantly since the first sampling in 1960. While there is evidence that some natural reproduction is taking place in Dam Lake, most of the walleyes sampled came from year classes that were stocked with fingerlings. Although it is too soon to be sure, there did not appear to be any appreciable increase in walleye numbers due to the increase in stocking rate in 2004.  At age 3, the 2004 year class (N=20) while abundant, was not sampled in any greater numbers than the 1991 (N=18) and 1994 (N=40) year classes that were sampled at age the same age in 1994 and 1997.  We will have more information after a special gill net assessment, which is planned for 2009. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass offer anglers another opportunity on Dam Lake. A spring electrofishing survey was conducted in 2007, and good numbers of fish between 14 and 16 inches were sampled, along with some up to 18 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>It was determined through fishery assessments in 2007, 2009, and 2012 that aggressive fingerling stocking, which began in 2004 was not increasing the walleye population.  A new strategy was implemented in 2012, which called for annual fry stocking in combination with alternate year contingent fingerling stocking if needed.  To help evaluate the new strategy a special gill net assessment of the walleye fishery was conducted in July of 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate increased from 2012 (1.5/gill net) to 2015 (2.5/gill net), but remained below the long term average (since 1960) for walleye in Dam Lake of 3.4/net.  The management goal for walleye in Dam Lake is 6-9/gill net, which has not yet been achieved.  Historical catch rates from 11 previous surveys dating back to 1960 have ranged from 1.5-5.1/gill net and have averaged 3.4/gill net.  Walleye ranged from 1 to 15+ years of age with no missing year classes for ages 1 - 8.  Walleye ranged in size from 7.5 to 28.5 inches with a mean length of 16.8 inches.  Since fish from the 2013 year class were evident in the assessment, this indicates at least some success from fry stocking or natural reproduction since fingerlings were not stocked in 2013.  The current walleye stocking plan will be evaluated again in 2017 and adjusted at that time, if necessary. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed in the assessment included black crappie and yellow perch, both of which showed statistically significant increases in gill net catch rate when compared to 2012.  Although the yellow perch catches (13/gill net) were near median for Dam Lake (11/gill net), the black crappie gill net catch rate (7.7/gill net) was the highest observed in all 11 assessments conducted since 1960, and were well above levels typical for this lake type (0.4-2.7/gill net).  Although age analysis was not conducted on the black crappie, most of the fish in the sample were 6.5\"-8.5\", suggesting a strong year class or two would be soon recruiting to the angling fishery.  Northern pike catch rates remained about the same at a moderate 4.75/ gill net. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in central Aitkin County.  Historically, the lake has supported a quality fishery for several species.  Large bluegill were common historically, however a trend since 1977 of increasing abundance and smaller average size of bluegill continues.  Bluegill natural reprduction and recruitment has occured annually since 1996.  This strong reproductive success and apparent insufficient predation suggest that size of bluegill will remain relatively small.Northern pike have increased significantly in abundance since 1994 but the population is still maintaining a good size structure.  The average northern pike sampled in gill nets was over 20 inches long with fish up to 32 inches in length.  With the increasing abundance of northern pike and with decreasing growth rates, the size structure for northern pike may shift toward a smaller average size in the future.Black crappie have exhibited a stable population since the 1960's.  Length frequency distributions from the various surveys have consistently shown a black crappie size structure that ranges from 5 inches up to 13 inches.  The walleye population, while below the first quartile for lakes in this lake class, is within the historical range observed on Dam Lake.  Six samplings have occurred on Dam Lake during the period 1977 to 2002.  Fluctuations in walleye abundance observed in these samplings have at times been significant, but the overall walleye population has not changed significantly during that twenty-five year period.  While there is evidence that there is some natural reproduction taking place in Dam Lake, most of the walleyes sampled came from year classes that were augmented by fingerling stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderate sized lake located about ten miles east of the City of Aitkin. There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake. Fish habitat is diverse with a good amount of emergent vegetation (bulrush), areas with floating-leaf plants (waterlilies), a variety of submerged plant beds, as well as open water areas. In addition to providing excellent fish and wildlife habitat, emergent plants help stabilize sediments and protect shorelines from erosion by breaking wave action.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking began with regularity around 1950, with fingerlings having been stocked at a variety of rates and frequencies in the past. More recently experimental fry stocking with supplemental fingerling stocking in alternate years was tried for a period of years with no measureable increases in the Walleye population. The management plan for the lake was amended and current stocking plans call for stocking fingerling walleye annually, which began in 2018. Also, when available surplus fish may be stocked but no more than every other year. This was a change from annual fry with alternate year fall fingerling stocking contingent upon low electrofishing catches. Catch rates for Walleye have been below the interquartile range for this lake type the previous four assessments going back to 2009.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is also known for its Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass populations. Black Crappie abundance has decreased since 2015, but size structure remained good with 30% larger than 10 inches and a maximum length of 11.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nDam Lake is considered a good bass lake for the area with a respectable size structure as fish up to 18 inches were sampled. Typically spring night electrofishing is a method used to gauge the abundance and size structure of Largemouth Bass populations, but in lakes where they are abundant they will also show up in gill nets. There were 1.3 bass caught per net in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of Northern Pike as measured by gill net catch rates increased slightly between 2017 (5.0/net) and 2019 (8.6/net). Catches have been reasonably stable over survey history and this was the highest catch on record, similar to numbers observed in 2002. Average size was 23 inches and 2.8 pounds, with fish nearing 38 inches sampled. Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike, thereby multiplying opportunities for anglers to catch big fish through recycling, as well as helping to maintain a better size distribution in this keystone predator. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance (5.1/gill net) has bounced all over the place and showed a significant decrease since 2017 (17.6/gill net). Yellow Perch catches have varied greatly in previous surveys from less than 1 to over 24 per gill net. Yellow Perch continue to provide invaluable forage for Northern Pike and Walleye populations. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have declined steadily since the late 1990's and only 2 have been caught in the previous 3 surveys. This cold-water species has sensitive requirements for oxy-thermal regime and recent weather patterns may be contributing to their decline.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are reminded to follow current MN-DNR Aquatic Invasive Species guidelines as described in the MN fishing regulations handbook in order to prevent the spread of unwanted invasive species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake supports a fishery for several species of gamefishes, including bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, walleye, tullibee and largemouth bass. These fisheries appear to be relatively stable, with the exception of the bluegill fishery. Bluegills have become smaller and slower growing since 1960, and abundance has increased. Bluegill abundance decreased from 1990 to 1994, however bluegills are still abundant and the growth rates remain below normal. The largest bluegill in the current assessment was only 7.9 inches long. Less than a third of the bluegills caught in trap nets were 6.0 inches or larger.The black crappie population is balanced, the fish are fast growing and they ranged up to 12.2 inches long. The mean length of black crappies in the trap nets was a respectable 9.5 inches. The 1991 year class was particularly large relative to the rest of the population.The northern pike catch remains low for this type of lake. The mean length is 21.3 inches and fish up to 31.3 inches were caught. Growth of northern pike is above the Aitkin area average.Walleyes have been caught in the gill nets at normal rates in past surveys for this type of lake. The 1991, 1989 and 1988 year classes were well represented in the gillnet catches. The walleyes ranged from 9.3 to 26.1 inches long and averaged 15.0 inches. The gillnet catches of walleyes have consisted mainly of fish less than 20 inches long and the two and three year old fish have dominated the catch. This trend towards small size indicates the harvest of small walleyes may be substantially reducing the population and restricting the abundance of larger walleyes.Tullibees were caught at a normal rate for this type of lake. The mean length was 14.2 inches, which is a size preferable to anglers. Largemouth bass were not efficiently sampled with the nets in this survey. The presence of a large bluegill population and adequate numbers of minnows in the seining efforts both indicate a good forage base for largemouth bass in Dam Lake. The lake contains an abundance of bulrush beds and other vegetative structure which should support good largemouth bass fishing.</p>",

Sampling was conducted on September 12, 2016. The total sample time was 1.0 hours with no walleye captured. Fry stocking began in 2012 and no YOY walleye have been sampled in either the 2012, 2014 or 2016 fall electrofishing surveys. The current walleye stocking strategy will be evaluated following a population assessment in 2017.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderate sized lake located about ten miles east of the City of Aitkin. There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake. Fish habitat is diverse with a good amount of emergent vegetation (bulrush), areas with floating-leaf plants (waterlilies), a variety of submerged plant beds, as well as open water areas. In addition to providing excellent fish and wildlife habitat, emergent plants help stabilize sediments and protect shorelines from erosion by breaking wave action.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking began with regularity around 1950, with fingerlings having been stocked at a variety of rates and frequencies in the past. Current stocking plans, which began in 2012, call for annual fry stocking with supplemental fingerling stocking in alternate years, if needed. No young of year walleye were sampled during fall electrofishing runs in 2012, 2014 or 2016 indicating low or no survival of stocked fry. Historical catch rates from twelve previous surveys dating back to 1960 have ranged from 1.5-5.1/gill net and averaged 3.3/gill net. The 2017 walleye catch (2.0/gill net) decreased slightly, but not significantly, from the 2015 special gill net assessment (2.5/gill net). Catch rates for walleye have been below the range for this lake type the previous four assessments going back to 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is also known for its black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass populations. Black crappie are not overly abundant, but were above the normal range for this type of lake at (3.4/gill net) and within the normal range for trap nets (1.2/net). The size structure was good with 29% larger than 8 inches and a maximum length of 11.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has been stable over the past decade and at 13.5/trap net was similar to the previous two assessments. The size structure wasn't great with an average size of 5.7 inches and only one fish greater than 8 inches was sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing is a method used to gauge the abundance and size structure of largemouth bass populations. This year's survey resulted in a catch rate of 62.5 bass/hour, which is a good catch rate for the Aitkin area.  Dam Lake is considered a good bass lake for the area with a respectable size structure as fish up to 21 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of northern pike as measured by gill net catch rates increased slightly to 5 net. Catches have been reasonably stable over survey history and this year was no exception. Average size was 22 inches and 2.5 pounds, with fish up to about 34 inches sampled. Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike, thereby multiplying opportunities for anglers to catch big fish through recycling, as well as helping to maintain a better size distribution in this keystone predator. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance (17.6/gill net) was relatively unchanged since the 2015 special assessment.  Perch catches have varied greatly in previous surveys from less than 1 to over 24 per gill net. Yellow perch continue to provide invaluable forage for northern pike and walleye populations and are thought to help sunfish populations from becoming stunted by reducing competition.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have declined steadily since the late 1990's and were absent in the 2017 survey. This cold-water species has sensitive requirements for oxy-thermal regime and recent weather patterns may be contributing to their decline. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are reminded to follow current MN-DNR Aquatic Invasive Species guidelines as described in the MN fishing regulations handbook in order to prevent the spread of unwanted invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Dam Lake was conducted on July 5, 2022 by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used at seven stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Mimic Shiner and Rock Bass) and none that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Dam Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Dam Lake was conducted on June 21, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen stations with one site sampled from the boat due to a steep drop with large boulders. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native species of fish including a couple species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Dam Lake based on this survey was below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 nearshore survey was conducted early in the sampling season when water temperatures were lower and there are concerns that the sampling was not representative of nearshore fish assemblages. Therefore more weight is given to the data collected in the 2012 survey, which resulted in a score above the threshold. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

This data is pre-regulation and will help provide a baseline to determine if a 10 fish bag limit (implementation 2021) is having any effect on the fishery. Four daytime electrofishing runs were completed for a total of one hour of sampling effort. The catch rate for Bluegill was 101 per hour with 1 netter. Bluegill sampled ranged from 3.3 inches to 8.5 inches with an average size of 5.8 inches. Only two fish larger than 8 inches were sampled.

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderate sized lake located about ten miles east of the City of Aitkin. There is a state-owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake. Fish habitat is diverse with a good amount of emergent vegetation (bulrush), areas with floating-leaf plants (waterlilies), a variety of submerged plant beds, as well as open water areas. In addition to providing excellent fish and wildlife habitat, emergent plants help stabilize sediments and protect shorelines from erosion by breaking wave action. This lake is part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative where the limit is 10 fish.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking began with regularity around 1950, with fingerlings having been stocked at a variety of rates and frequencies in the past. More recently experimental fry stocking with supplemental fingerling stocking in alternate years was tried for a period of years with no measurable increases in the Walleye population. The current management plan for the lake was amended in 2018 and current stocking plans call for stocking fingerling Walleye annually. Also, when available surplus fish may be stocked but no more than every other year. This was a change from annual fry with alternate year fall fingerling stocking contingent upon low electrofishing catches. Catch rates for Walleye were slightly below the management abundance objective for this lake (3/net) the previous five assessments going back to 2009, although age class objective of at least 4-year classes has been met regularly. The current stocking regime will continue and will be evaluated on a regular basis. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is also known for its Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass populations. Black Crappie abundance had been decreasing since 2015, but abundance improved in the 2022 survey. Size structure remained good with 20% larger than 10 inches and a maximum length of 12.4 inches. Bluegill abundance in 2022 (5.9/trap net) was a decrease from the previous survey. The average size was 5.9 inches and ranged from 2-11 years old with 7-year old's being the most abundant. Only a few fish over 8 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nDam Lake is considered a good bass lake for the area with a respectable size structure as fish up to 19 inches and beyond are usually sampled. Typically, spring night electrofishing is a method used to gauge the abundance and size structure of Largemouth Bass populations, but in lakes where they are abundant, they will also show up in gill nets. There were 1.4 bass caught per net in 2022. <br> \nAbundance of Northern Pike as measured by gill net catch rates decreased slightly between 2019 (8.6/net) and 2022 (5.0/net). Catches have been reasonably stable over survey history, with a long-term average of around 4/net. Average size was down in this survey with an average size of 19.9 inches and 1.6 pounds. No fish larger than 30 inches were sampled. Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike, thereby multiplying opportunities for anglers to catch big fish through recycling, as well as helping to maintain a better size distribution in this keystone predator. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance (0.6/gill net) has bounced all over the place and showed a decrease in the previous two surveys. Yellow Perch catches have varied greatly in previous surveys from less than 1 to over 24 per gill net. Yellow Perch continue to provide invaluable forage for Northern Pike and Walleye populations but are currently at a low level of abundance. <br> \nTullibee have declined steadily since the late 1990's and only 4 have been caught in the previous 4 surveys. This cold-water species has sensitive requirements for oxy-thermal regime and recent weather patterns may be contributing to their decline.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are reminded to follow current MN-DNR Aquatic Invasive Species guidelines as described in the MN fishing regulations handbook to prevent the spread of unwanted invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

The trap net indices for bowfin and pumpkinseed were above the lake class 31 third quartiles. The trap net index for black bullhead was below the lake class 31 first quartile. Tullibee sampled ranged from one to seven years of age. A strong 1989 year class was indicated with no fish sampled from 1984, 1987, or 1988. The growth rate for the second and third increment were faster than normal. Northern pike sampled ranged from one to eight plus years of age. The growth rate for the first and second increments were fast. The growth rate for the fourth, fifth and sixth growth increments were slow. Bluegill sampled ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987. The growth rate for the first, second and third increments were slower than nor- mal. Black crappie sampled ranged from two to four years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1987. The growth rate for the third growth increment was faster than normal. Yellow perch sampled ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1987. The growth rates for the first and second increment were slower than normal. The growth rates of the fourth and fifth growth increments were faster than normal. Length at formation of the fifth annulus was smaller than normal. Walleye sampled ranged in age from one to eight years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988. The growth rates for the first six growth increments were normal. From these data an increase in walleye abundance from stocking could not be determined. The gill net indices for yellow perch and walleye indicate a significant increase in abundance for those species since the 1985 netting. The trap net indices for pumpkinseed and bluegill indicate a significant increase in the abundance for those species since the 1985 netting. The increase in abundance of bluegill has been accompanied by a decrease in growth rates since 1977. The first growth increment showed a decrease in growth rate from 2.6 inches to 2.1 inches. The growth rates of the other growth increments showed no change over that period. The 1990 sample showed a decrease in the growth rate for the first growth increment from 2.1 inches in 1985 to 1.4 inches in 1990. The growth rate for the second growth increment decreased from 1.4 inches in 1985 to 1.0 inches in 1990. The third and fourth growth increments showed similar decreases in growth rates. The overall length at annulus formation for age five bluegill decreased from 7.9 inches in 1977 to 6.7 inches in 1985 to 5.0 inches in 1990. This is a decrease in growth rate of 36.7 percent over the thirteen years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderately clear water lake located in central Aitkin County. Historically, the lake has supported a quality fishery for several species.   As called for in the management plan, a special gill net survey was conducted in the summer of 2009 to evaluate the status of the walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nDam Lake has a long history of walleye stocking, and in 2004 fingerling stocking rates were increased.  Since the inception of the higher stocking densities two evaluations of the fishery have been conducted, (2007 and 2009).   Neither of these investigations has shown statistically measureable differences in the walleye population, nor has the management goal of 6 walleye per gill net lift been met.  In 2009, the gillnet cpue for walleye was 3.0 per net, which is near the long term average of 3.6/net, but below the normal range for this lake class.  Walleye from the 2006 year class were the most abundant and averaged 13.4 inches. Although more than 77% of the fish observed in past assessments were from stocked year classes, in the last 3 assessments this value has increased to nearly 100% (92 of 93 fish).  Reasons for the decrease in natural reproduction should be evaluated. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has decreased over the last three surveys conducted in this decade, and size structure has improved.  Nearly half of the sample, in 2009, was over 24 inches long, and the largest pike observed was over 34 inches.   The lower northern pike density, as well as the tullibee and abundant yellow perch populations are key factors in maintaining healthy pike fisheries.   Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance spiked in 2009.  A catch of 21.25 per net was second only to a catch of 24.25 per net observed in 1990.  Since the 1985 survey, few perch over 8 inches have been observed in the assessments.  When present, perch provide an ecological benefit to the lake by supplying walleye and northern pike with a source of forage and by acting as predators of young bluegill, thereby helping to keep panfish numbers in check.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have exhibited a stable population since the 1960's. Length frequency distributions from the various surveys have consistently shown a black crappie size structure that ranges from 5 inches up to 13 inches.  Gill net catches for black crappie have increased since 2007 and are above the normal range for lakes of this type. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass offer anglers another opportunity on Dam Lake. Gill net catches indicate a population of bass within the normal range for this lake type.  A spring electrofishing survey was conducted in 2007 and fish up to 18 inches were sampled, along with good numbers between 14 and 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nDam Lake supports a population of tullibee that appears to be down from levels observed in the 1990's.  This appears to be a common occurrence in many lakes in the area, suggesting an environmental effect that may be limiting tullibee production. In 2009, only three age classes were present and all fish measured between 16 to 18 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Lake is a moderate sized lake located about ten miles east of the City of Aitkin.  There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake.  Extreme weather conditions were experienced in 2012.  Many lakes in the area were ice-free earlier than any other year since data has been collected.  Above average temperatures occurred in every month from January to September. Unusually large rainfall events in late May and June resulted in approximately 22 inches of precipitation, compared to the 7.5 inches during average years.  Lake water levels were still above normal at the time of this survey. <br> \n <br> \nFish habitat is diverse with a good amount of emergent vegetation (bulrush), areas with floating-leaf plants (waterlilies), a variety of submerged plant beds, as well as open water areas.  In addition to providing excellent fish and wildlife habitat, emergent plants help stabilize sediments and protect shorelines from erosion by breaking wave action.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking began with regularity around 1950, with fingerlings having been stocked at a variety of rates and frequencies in the past.  Current stocking plans, which began in 2012, call for annual fry stocking with supplemental fingerling stocking in alternate years, if needed.  The 2012 walleye catch (1.5 per gill net) was below normal for similar lakes and below the average of the nine previous fisheries surveys of the lake (3.6 per gill net).  Age analysis revealed all walleye were from the three most recent fingerling stocked years (2006, 2008, 2010). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured within the normal range for this type of lake in gill nets (2.7 per net) and trap nets (1.5 per net).  Size averaged 7.7 inches with 20% greater than 10 inches and fish up to 11.6 inches observed in the sample.  Bluegill were also captured within the normal range at 12.4 per trap net.  Size was poor with an average of 6.0 inches and only one individual sampled that was over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile traditional survey gear captured only ten largemouth bass, additional spring night electrofishing collected 122 fish in one hour of sampling. This is very high for the Aitkin area.  These bass averaged 13.0 inches long, with 12% measuring greater than 15 inches and the sample included fish up to about 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike provide additional angling opportunities for large predators.  Pike catch in gill nets was within the normal range at 4.1 per net.  Size and growth were good and averaged 21.1 inches and 2.2 pounds with fish reaching 23.5 inches in five growing seasons.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike, thereby multiplying opportunities for anglers to catch big fish through recycling, as well as helping to maintain a better size distribution in this keystone predator. <br> \n</p>",

Fall sampling was conducted on September 26, 2012.  The total sample time was 1 hour with no YOY or age-1 walleye sampled and only one adult walleye captured.  Fry stocking began in 2012 and continued fall electrofishing will be useful in determining the effectiveness of the current fry with contingent fingerling strategy.</p>",
