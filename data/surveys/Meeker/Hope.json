                "narrative": "<p>Gill nets, trap nets and shoreline seining were used to sample the Hope Lake fish population during the 2004 summer.  Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  Hope Lake has a history of winterkill, and fish population levels can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of this phenomenon.  There is no developed public access at Hope Lake.  Hope Lake is shallow and very fertile.  Submergent vegetation would be considered rare in this lake, but quality patches of emergent bullrush and cattail still exist.  The lake's watershed is dominated by row crops and much of the shoreline and island remain undeveloped.  High numbers of yellow perch were gill netted in 2004.  Yellow perch were 5.3-11.3 inches long averaging 8.6 inches.  An impressive 69% of the sample was at least 8 inches and 17% reached the 10 inch mark.  Most of the perch were from the strong 2001 year class.  High numbers of northern pike were also gill netted.  Northern pike were 19.5-30.5 inches long averaging 24.5 inches.  The last time this lake was netted (1991), a handful of small bluegill and small yellow perch were all the gamemfish the lake had to offer anglers.  Hopefully the present population will provide some angling opportunity before the next winterkill occurs.  Black bullhead, which have dominated past nettings, were only sampled in moderate numbers in 2004.  Trap netted black bullhead averaged 4.3 inches.  Moderate numbers of carp were also trapped, averaging 19.8 inches.    </p>",
