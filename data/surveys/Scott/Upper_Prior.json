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p>",

Largemouth bass were not targeted during the survey, which is reflected in the small sample size. Walleyes were sampled in much more abundance. The number per net set was greater than that found during the 1996 survey. The average length measured was over 16 inches and weighed over 2 pounds. Over 18% were larger than 20 inches in length.        The northern pike population remains relatively stable since 1996. One half of the total sample of northern pike exceeded 25 inches in length. The average length and weight sampled in the gillnets was 24.9 inches and 3.8 pounds.        Bluegills are by far the most abundant species sampled, but they are small. The average size measured from the trapnets was only 5.9 inches in length. Only 7% of the total sample exceeded 7 inches long. Black crappies are also abundant but small. The average length of the trapnet sample is only 7.4 inches. White crappies were also sampled during the survey. Their population is within the normal range of abundance for this type of lake. The average length sampled in the trapnets was 8.2 inches.        Yellow perch are currently at the highest level of abundance in 20 years. The average length of perch sampled in the gillnets was only 6.5 inches. White suckers and carp were sampled within the normal range for this type of lake. Black bullheads and yellow bullheads were sampled in average abundance while brown bullheads were sampled slightly below average. The average length for each species exceeded 10 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior Lake is a productive, 354-acre lake located in the City of Prior Lake in Scott County.  It is connected to Lower Prior Lake to the northeast via a navigable channel that passes under Eagle Creek Ave.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass and secondarily managed for northern pike and bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch in gill nets was moderately low averaging 5.5 walleye per net, which is near the average of 5.4 per net from the previous 5 assessments (1996-2004).  The 2007 stocked year class contributed 46% of the walleye sampled and these age-1 and age-5 walleye combined to produce 86% of the sample.  Walleye were exclusively observed in all stocked years since 2001, giving no evidence for any natural reproduction.  Average length and weight were 15.7 inches and 1.74 pounds, and the longest measured was 22.8 inches.  Eighty-six percent of the walleye were 15 inches or longer, and 32% were 20 inches or longer.  Growth was slower than average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Walleye continue to be stocked on odd-numbered years.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant in Upper Prior Lake.  Catch averaged 114.4 per trap net, which is high relative to other similar lakes in the state.  This has historically been the case as trap net catch averaged 86.9 bluegill per net during the past 5 assessments.  Average length and weight were 6.6 inches and 0.23 pounds, and the longest measured 8.5 inches.  Eighty-two percent were 6 inches or longer and 4 percent were 8 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample with 62% being age 3 and 30% age 4.  Bluegill growth was average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch was high in both trap nets (47.4 per net) and gill nets (16.3 per net).   Trap net catch was higher than the previous 5 assessments, which had an average of 12.4 per net.  Average length and weight was 8.0 inches and 0.27 pounds, with the largest reaching 9.1 inches.  Fifty-three percent of black crappie were 8 inches or greater.  Ages 2 through 4 were observed and 57% were age 3 and 36% were age 4.  Growth was average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was moderately high (18.5 per gill net) and about average compared with the past 5 assessments (mean = 18.4 per gill net).  Average length and weight were 7.8 inches 0.21 pounds, with the longest measuring 10.3 inches.  Thirty-seven percent were 8 inches or longer and only 1% were 10 inches or longer.  Ages 3, 4, and 5 were represented in the sample with  67% age 3 and 25 % age 4.  Yellow perch growth was average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.        <br> \n <br> \nA special assessment was conducted in May 2008 to characterize the largemouth bass population in detail.  In 1 hour and 15 minutes of nighttime boat electrofishing, two netters collected 81 largemouth bass at a rate of 64.8 per hour.  Average length and weight was 10.8 inches and 0.79 pounds, with the largest measuring 18.9 inches.  Twenty-five percent of the sampled population was 12 inches or longer, and 11% were 15 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample, 66% were age 2 through 4 and 49% were age 3.   <br> \n  <br> \nNo northern pike were observed in the 2008 assessment.  Historically, Upper Prior Lake has had a low northern pike density, averaging 2.7 per gill net over the previous 5 assessments.  Other species collected in low abundance were black, yellow, and brown bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, white bass, white sucker, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior Lake is managed primarily for walleye and largemouth bass. Only two largemouth bass were captured during the 1996 survey. The type of sampling gear used, trapnets and gillnets, is not effective at capturing high numbers of adult largemouth bass. Numerous young of the year largemouth bass were sampled during shoreline seining.Walleyes were sampled in the lowest numbers since 1977. The average size of walleyes caught was 20.4 inches long and weighed 2.9 pounds. Nearly 60% of the walleyes measured execeeded 20 inches in length.Northern pike were sampled within the normal range for this type of lake. This is at a higher level than any previous survey. The average length and weight sampled was 18.2 inches and 1.2 pounds.Yellow perch, white suckers, and golden shiners were all sampled within normal levels. These species are high quality forage for predators such as walleye and northern pike.Bluegills are extremely abundant in this lake. The average size sampled was 6.8 inches long and weighed 0.2 pounds. Over 50% of the fish measured were over 7 inches in length.Black crappies were sampled in normal abundance. The average black crappie was only 7.4 inches in length. White crappies were sampled in lower abundance, but were much larger. The average length white crappie was 10.0 inches.Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were each sampled during the survey in somewhat low abundance. Both brown and black bullheads averaged over 11 inches in length.</p>",

The average length and weight of walleyes sampled in the gill nets was 22.64 inches and 4.4 pounds. Over 50% of the walleyes measured exceeded 20 inches. To help achieve new walleye management goals in the West Metro area, the stocking rate for Upper Prior was doubled in 1999. The lake will be stocked each odd numbered year with 658 pounds of walleye fingerlings. The northern pike population is currently at the lowest level since 1991, but the average size of pike sampled is good. Bluegills are very abundant in Upper Prior Lake. The average size sampled was 6.46 inches and weighed 0.19 pounds. Approximately 18% were larger than 7 inches. Black crappies were also very abundant. Their average size was approximately 7.8 inches and 0.25 pounds. Largemouth bass were not abundant in this surveydue to the type of gear used. Bass are not sampled effectively by gill nets or trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Upper Prior Lake.  Walleye abundances are at historical highs.  But they are, on average, smaller, and younger than they were in the 2000 survey.  This change is primarily being influenced by the recruitment of a strong year-class of 3 year-old fish (1999 year-class), which made up 73% of the sample.  These fish were stocked as fingerlings as were other year-classes, as there is no evidence to support the occurrence of natural reproduction.  The catch of 12.5 per gillnet is between median and 75th percentile levels for class 41 lakes.  Average length and weight is 16.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Mean weight is between median and 75th percentile levels.  Fifteen percent of the population is longer than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 24.1 inches and 5.5 pounds.  The average age decreased from 5.0 years in 2000 to 3.2 years in 2002.  From the last survey, growth rates have slowed to about average for walleye comparable lakes.Only 4 northern pike were caught in all gears on Upper Prior.  This is not historically unusual, as the highest catch rate was only 5.0 per gillnet in 1996.  The 2002 catch of 0.3 pike per gillnet is below that of 25th percentile levels for comparable lakes.  The largest individual was 28.9 inches and 8.5 pounds.  Growth rates are about average for pike in comparable lakes.Yellow perch abundances have risen since the 2000 survey.  The gillnet catch of 21.2 per net is near the 75th percentile level.  Growth rates are slightly below average.  Bluegill abundances are at historical highs, which are considerable for Upper Prior, and they are slightly larger than in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 157 per trapnet is over 10 times above the 75th percentile level.  Average length and weight is 6.5 inches and 0.21 pounds.  Twenty-seven percent of the bluegill population is longer than 7 inches but only 4% is longer than 7.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 7.95 inches 0.34 pounds.  Many year-classes were represented in the catch (ages 1 though 9).  Growth rates are below average for this lake class as they were in the last survey.  Shoreline seine hauls yielded a moderate number of young-of-the year bluegill.Black crappie abundance has not changed significantly from 2000.  Both the trapnet catch of 16 per net and the gillnet catch of 22 per net is well above 75th percentile levels.  The 2002 trapnet sample average length and weight were 7.3 inches and 0.21 pounds.  Twenty-four percent of the black crappie sample caught in trapnets was larger than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 10.8 inches and 0.61 pounds.  The population is represented by many year-classes, especially 1999-2001.  Growth rates are average.  Smaller numbers of white crappies were sampled including some large individuals.  The largest was 13.1 inches and 1.1 pounds.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets but 6 were captured in gillnets and trapnets.  No electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass was conducted this year.Yellow and black bullheads were sampled in normal numbers for this lake type, but no brown bullheads were observed as in past surveys.  White bass, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner and carp were also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Upper Prior Lake.  Walleye abundance dropped precipitously from historical highs in 2002 to historical lows in 2004.  The reasons for this change are unknown.  Walleyes may have emigrated to the Lower Lake or to Spring Lake where catches remained relatively stable in the 2004 surveys.  Alternatively, fishing or natural mortality rates would have to be very high to account for this change.  The catch of 0.8 per gillnet is below the 25th percentile level for class 41 lakes.  Mean length and weight is up to 21.7 inches and 3.6 pounds in 2004 from 16.6 inches and 1.7 pounds in 2002.  Mean weight is almost twice the 75th percentile level.  Sixty percent of walleyes sampled were larger than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 26.2 inches, 6.8 pounds and 9 years old.  The mean age increased from 3.2 years in 2002 to 5.7 years in 2004.  Growth rates are slightly below average for lakes of this ecological type.  The population is suffering from a lack of recruitment from the 2001 year-class seen in adjoining lakes, and the disappearance of previously strong 1999 year-class.  No walleyes from non-stocked years were sampled indicating that natural year-classes did not form, as has been the case historically.As in the Lower Lake, northern pike abundance increased in Upper but the catch of 3.0 per gill net is still slightly below median levels for this lake type.  However, pike were larger than they were in the 2002 survey.  Mean length and weight increased to 28.7 inches and 6.0 pounds in 2004 from 21.0 inches and 2.5 pounds in 2002.  Mean weight is over two times the 75th percentile level.  Forty-four percent of pike sampled were larger than 28 inches.  The largest individual was 36.9 inches and 12.1 pounds.  The mean age was 6.4 years in 2004.  Growth rates are above average for this lake type.Bluegill abundances decreased from the 2002 survey at which time they were at historical highs.  Still, the trapnet abundance of 59.2 per net is 4 times the 75th percentile level.  Mean length and weight is 6.7 inches and 0.18 pounds.  Thirty-one percent of bluegill sampled were larger than 7 inches and 10% were larger than 7.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.2 inches.  Eight year-classes from 1996 to 2003 were represented in the catch.  Growth rates are slightly below average for this lake type as they were in the last 2 surveys.Black crappie abundance has decreased from 2000, but the size structure is impressive for a high fishing pressure metro-area lake.  The trapnet catch of 6.9 per net in 2004 is down from 16 per net in 2002 and is between median and 75th percentile levels.  The 2004 trapnet sample mean length and weight was 8.4 inches and 0.32 pounds while 89% were larger than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 9.7 inches and 0.52 pounds.  Growth rates are about average.  White crappies were also sampled and add to the fishery.  White crappies averaged 9.1 inches and 0.35 pounds.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey; however, Prior is one of the best bass fisheries in the metro area.  Bass fishing tournaments occur annually on the lake, and anglers have needed 5 fish averaging over 4 pounds a piece in 2003 and 2004 to win.Yellow perch abundances have fallen from 2002.  The gillnet catch of 11.2 per net is between median and 75th percentile levels.  Mean length and weight is 7.7 inches and 0.22 pounds.  Growth rates are about average.  The 2001 and 2000 year-classes are strong and constitute most of the population.A white bass was sampled in this survey as they have been historically in Upper Prior.  Yellow bullheads were sampled at median levels and averaged 0.86 pounds.  Black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, golden shiner, and carp are also present in Upper Prior Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior Lake is a productive, 386-acre lake located in the City of Prior Lake in Scott County.  It is connected to Lower Prior Lake to the northeast via a navigable channel.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  In 2009, zebra mussels were confirmed in Prior Lake.  It is important that all livewells, bait buckets, and bilges be drained and all vegetation be removed from boat trailers prior to leaving the boat ramp to prevent the spread of this invasive species.  A standard population assessment was conducted during July, 2010 to determine the abundance and size structure of game fish in the lake.      <br> \n <br> \nWalleye population abundance was moderately low (4.5/net) and similar to the 2008 assessment (5.5/net).  Gill net catch was lower than the mean of 5.9/net observed over the previous five assessments (1998-2008).  In 2010, 61% percent were 15 inches or larger and 11% were 20 inches or larger. In 2008, 86% were 15 inches or longer and 32% were 20 inches or longer.  The proportion of larger walleye (>20 inches) in the population appeared to decrease in 2010; however, both trap net and gillnet catch revealed good survival of the stocked 2009 year class (56% of total catch).  The 2007 year class had a strong presence as well (33% of total catch).  Ages of walleye matched exactly years when walleye were stocked, giving no evidence for any natural reproduction.  Walleye continue to be stocked on odd-numbered years.  Average length and weight of walleye in the gill nets were 15.0 inches and 1.5 pounds, and the longest measured was 25.3 inches.  Walleye grew fast in Upper Prior Lake, averaging 17.7 inches at age 3.      <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant in Upper Prior Lake.  Trap net catch (62.0/net) was high; however, numbers are below the previous five-assessment average (100.9/net) and down 45% from 2008 when trap net catch was 114.0/ net.  Mean length and weight of a bluegill in a trap nets was 6.9 inches and 0.26 lbs.  Similar to 2008, 88% were 6 inches or larger and 2% were 8 inches or greater.  Bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 9, with most (82%) ages 3 to 5.  Bluegill averaged 6 inches by age 3 and 8 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2010 assessment, the black crappie population was lower in abundance but improved in size structure compared to 2008.  Black crappie were moderately abundant in both gill nets (4.5/net) and trap nets (5.6/net).   Compared to the average of the previous five assessments, abundance was 69% lower in gill nets and 73% lower in trap nets.  Mean length and weight of a black crappie from trap nets was 8.3 inches and 0.32 lbs, with the largest reaching 10.3 inches. (2008: 8.0 inches and 0.27 pounds, largest was 9.1).  Sixty percent of the total (GN and TN) sampled population was 8 inches or longer and 3% were 10 inches or longer (2008: 53% were 8 inches or greater and 0% were 10 inches or greater).  Eighty-eight percent of the black crappie sampled were age 2 through 4, with 51% age 3.  Black crappie reached 8 inches by age 3 and 10 inches by age 5.       <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance and size structure has remained relatively stable.  Gill net catch (13.5/ net) was lower than 2008 (18.5/net), and is less than the previous five-assessment average of 20.7/net.  Similar to 2008, 39% were 8 inches or larger with the largest reaching 9.8 inches.  Yellow perch ages ranged from 3 to 7 with 42% age 3.  Yellow perch reached 8 inches by age 4.    <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented in these nets for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Three largemouth bass were collected in trap nets and 4 in gill nets.  Average length of bass in trap nets was 14.8 inches and the longest measured 17.7 inches.  A special assessment was conducted in May of 2008 to characterize the largemouth bass population in detail.  In 1 hour and 15 minutes of nighttime boat electrofishing, two netters collected 81 largemouth bass at a rate of 64.8/hour.  Average length and weight was 10.8 inches and 0.79 pounds, with the largest measuring 18.9 inches.  Twenty-five percent of the sampled population was 12 inches or longer, and 11% were 15 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample, 66% were age 2 through 4 and 49% were age 3.     <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, northern pike have been found in low abundance in Upper Prior (previous five-assessment average of 1.7/gill net).  This was the case in 2010, two were sampled at a rate of 0.5/gill net.  Two were captured in trap nets as well.  All four ranged from 19.0 to 34.5, averaging 26.3 in length. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass continue to increase in abundance.  In 2010, we saw the highest catches on record in trap nets (1.6/net) and tied for highest in gill nets (1.0/net).  At these densities, white bass are considered to be moderately abundant based on similar lakes.  Fifty-six percent were 12 inches or larger and 17% were 15 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nOther species found during the assessment were black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white crappie white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nWith the exception of white bass and northern pike, from 2008 to 2010 the abundance of most game fish species has shown a decline in abundance in both gill nets and trap nets.  The reason for this is unknown.  There was no reported winterkill on Upper Prior during the previous two seasons.  There is a possibility that sampling efficiency was reduced due to environmental factors such as low summer oxygen, temperature, weather, or barometric pressure.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A record-high walleye catch occurred in the 2006 special assessment with a 16.5 walleye per gillnet average, surpassing the previous historic high of 12.5 walleye per gillnet in 2002.  Of all walleye observed in 2006, 86% were from the 2003 year-class, 9% were from the 2001 year-class, and 5% were from the 1999 year-class.  The absence of observed year-classes between stocking events provides evidence that natural reproduction was nil. Mean length and weight decreased from 21.7 inches and 3.6 pounds in 2004 to 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds in 2006.  The largest walleye measured 26.8 inches, weighed 6.6 pounds, and was seven years old. Eight-percent of all walleye observed were greater than 20 inches.  Growth rates were above average from ages one throguh three and below average for ages four and older. Walleye stocked in 2003 and 2005 were purchased from private sources as part of the Accelerated Walleye Program.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch was down from three fish per gillnet in 2004 to 1.2 fish/gillnet in 2006.  The average northern pike measured 21.5 inches and weighed 2.2 pounds, the largest measured 23.6 inches and weighed 2.6 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch nearly doubled since 2004. Mean length and weight increased from 7.7 inches and 0.2 pounds in 2004 to 8.2 inches and 0.25 pounds in 2006.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough trap nets were not used in the 2006 special assessment, gillnet catches can be compared to those from previous surveys.  The gillnet catch of black crappie has increased from 3.5 fish/net in 2004 to 29.5 fish/net in 2006.  The abundance of bluegill averaged 21/gillnet, lower than values from 2000 through 2004 (range of 21-37/GN), but greater than the 1998 value of 10/GN.  This assessment's sample indicates continued good size structure, with a mean size of 6.5 inches/0.22 lb and 39% of bluegills 7 inches or larger (largest fish sampled was 8.8 inches). <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected included: black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, white bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior Lake is a productive 386-acre lake located in the City of Prior Lake in Scott County.  Maximum depth is 50 ft and the littoral zone (<15ft) covers 85% of the lake.  It is connected via a navigable channel to Lower Prior Lake, which is north/downstream of Upper Prior; \"Prior Lake\" is a reference to either or both basins.  Upper Prior is highly developed and gets heavy recreatinal use.  It is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  In 2009, zebra mussels were confirmed in Prior Lake.  A standard population assessment was conducted during July, 2012 to characterize the fish community in the lake.  Population assessments have been completed every other year since 1996.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, walleye abundance in gill nets was low (2.8/net).  Abundance was lower than the previous assessment in 2010 (4.5/gill net) and lower than the long-term average (5.3/ gill net, 1996-2010).  The size structure of walleye from both gill nets (11 fish) and trap nets (14 fish) was skewed toward larger fish (83% were 15 inches or longer, 38% were 20 inches or longer, 4% were 25 inches or longer).  Walleye from both gears averaged 17.1 inches and 2.15 lbs, with the largest measuring 24.8 inches and 6.49 lbs.  Ages ranged from 1 to 11, with the 2007 (33%) and 2009 (38%) year classes the strongest.  All walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a low probability of natural reproduction.  Growth was consistently faster than the statewide average.  Walleye averaged 15.2 inches by age 3 and 20.6 inches by age 5.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was high (18.3/trap net) and above the 75th percentile compared to other similar lakes.  Numbers have fluctuated over the previous 3 assessments, ranging from 5.6 to 47.4/trap net.  The average from 1996-2010 has been 16.4/net.  Mean weight was the highest on record for Upper Prior Lake and was near the 75th percentile for similar lakes.   <br> \nBlack crappie in trap nets averaged 9.4 inches and 0.47 lbs, with the largest measuring 11.2 inches and 0.74 lbs.  Size structure was skewed toward larger individuals, where 92% were 8 inches or longer, and 30% were 10 inches or longer.  Black crappie ages ranged from 1 through 6.  Forty percent were age 3, and 53% were relatively evenly distributed among ages 2, 4, and 5.  Seven percent were either age 1 or 6.  Growth was fast compared to the statewide average.  Black crappie were 9.4 inches by age 3 and 10.2 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has varied over time.  From 1996 to 2010, relative abundance has ranged from 44.6 to 157.2/net.  The 29.9/net sampled in 2012 was the lowest since 1987, but is still considered high (above the 75th percentile) compared to other similar lakes.  Mean length and weight in trap nets was 6.9 inches and 0.27 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.8 inches and 0.39 lbs.  Size structure was skewed toward larger individuals (83% were 6 inches or longer, 10% were 8 inches or longer).  Recruitment is consistent as ages ranged from 2 to 6.  Thirty-nine percent were age 4, and age 3 and 5 were both 25% of the sample.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Bluegill reached 6.1 inches by age 3, and 8.4 inches by age 6.    <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass, which were first sampled in 2002, have established themselves at a moderate density in Upper Prior Lake.  Gill-net catch (0.75/net) is at the 25th percentile for similar lakes and trap-net catch is between the median and 75th percentile.  The 2012 assessment is the third consecutive with increased catch in the trap nets.  Multiple year-classes are present; however the 2009 year class (age 3) dominated the sample (75%).  Forty-four percent were 15 inches or longer, and the longest measured 18.1 inches and 2.36 lbs. <br> \nFive white crappies were sampled in trap nets (0.63/net), which is near the 25th percentile for similar lakes.  They averaged 9.8 inches and 0.44 lbs, with the largest reaching 10.4 inches and 0.56 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate of 1/gill net.  This is the lowest value ever observed in Upper Prior Lake, well below the long-term (1996-2010) average of 17.8/net.  Yellow perch from both trap nets (7 fish caught) and gill nets (4 fish caught) averaged 7.8 inches and 0.21 lbs, with the longest measuring 9.4 inches.    <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been low in abundance.  Only one pike was sampled in 2012.  The gill-net catch of 0.25/net is below the long-term (1996-2010) average of 2.0/net. The pike was 23.9 inches and 3.3 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments.  In 2012, 16 largemouth bass were collected in trap nets and 5 in gill nets.  Average length and weight of bass in both gears was 10.9 inches and 0.64 lbs. The longest measured 14.4 inches.  A special assessment was conducted in May of 2008 to characterize the largemouth bass population in detail.  In 1.25 hours of nighttime boat electrofishing, two netters collected 81 largemouth bass at a rate of 64.8/hour.  Average length and weight was 10.8 inches and 0.79 pounds, with the largest measuring 18.9 inches.  Twenty-five percent of the sampled population was 12 inches or longer, and 11% were 15 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample, 66% were age 2 through 4 and 49% were age 3.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted in 2012.   Using backpack electrofishing and seining, 11 species were sampled which included Johnny darter, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment (including gill nets and trap nets).  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.   <br> \nUpper Prior Lake scored 34.8 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment. <br> \n <br> \nIn late May 2012, some dead fish (mostly crappie) were reported. This small-scale die-off was likely a result of fish-specific bacterial mortality; these conditions can periodically occur in fertile waters during the first large water-temperature increase in late spring-early summer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior Lake is a productive 386-acre, Class 41 lake located in the City of Prior Lake in Scott County.  Maximum depth is 50 ft and the littoral zone (<15ft) covers 85% of the lake.  Upper Prior is connected via a navigable channel to Lower Prior Lake, which is north and downstream of Upper Prior Lake; these two basins are often referred to in aggregate as Prior Lake.  Upper Prior Lake is highly developed and is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  A Standard Survey was conducted during 2015 to assess the gamefish community.  Standard Surveys have been completed every other year since 1996.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Walleye abundance in gill nets was low.  The catch rate of 2.5 fish per net was below the 25th percentile for this Lake Class.  From 1996 to 2012, relative abundance ranged from 0.83 to 12.5 fish per net.  The 2.5 fish per net sampled in 2015 was below the 19 year average of 4.9 fish per net, and a slight decrease from the previous survey's catch, of 2.8 fish per net, in 2012.  The size structure of Walleye from both gill nets (n = 10) and trap nets (n = 4) was skewed toward larger fish.  Walleye from both gears averaged 17.3 inches and 1.85 lbs, with the largest measuring 23.4 inches and 3.60 lbs.  Ages ranged from 2 to 14, with 69% of fish originating from the 2011 year class.  All Walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a low probability of natural reproduction.  Growth was consistently faster than the statewide average.  Walleye averaged 17.1 inches by age 4, and 19.8 inches by age 6.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years.   <br> \n    <br> \nIn June of 2015, nighttime boat electrofishing was conducted to assess Prior Lake's Largemouth Bass population.  In 1.88 hours of electrofishing, 164 Largemouth Bass were collected at a rate of 87.0 fish per hour.  Average length and weight was 8.6 inches and 0.34 pounds, with the largest fish measuring 15.8 inches and 1.96 pounds.  Five percent of the sampled population was 12 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high (17.8 fish per gill net, above 75th percentile) compared to other Class 41 lakes.  The fish tended to be small; the average size was 5.3 inches and 0.10 pounds.  Six percent of the fish exceeded 8 inches, and the largest fish was 10.4 inches and 0.67 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance, as measured with trap nets, has varied over time.  From 1996 to 2012, relative abundance ranged from 29.9 to 157.2 fish per net.  The 12.0 fish per net sampled in 2015 was the lowest value since 1987, but is still considered above average (between the median and 75th percentile) compared to other Class 41 lakes.  Mean length and weight in trap nets was 6.2 inches and 0.21 lbs, with the largest trap-netted Bluegill measuring 8.9 inches.  Size structure reflects a balanced population.  Thirty-six percent of the fish exceeded 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 3.5/gill net.  Yellow perch from both trap nets (n = 2) and gill nets (n = 14) averaged 8.5 inches and 0.29 lbs, with the largest fish measuring 10.7 inches and 0.54 pounds.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically been low in abundance.  The catch rate in 2015, 3.5 fish per gill net (the median for this Lake Class), is a noticeable increase from the 2012 catch rate of 0.25 fish per gill net.  The size structure is skewed toward large fish; average size was 26.0 inches and 4.23 pounds and the largest fish was 33.1 inches and 8.1 pounds.  Eighty-six percent of the fish exceeded 21 inches, and 43% exceeded 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, White Bass, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior is a 386-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet. Upper Prior Lake is located west of the City of Prior Lake, in northern Scott County. It is connected via a navigable channel to Lower Prior Lake. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the south side of the lake off of Dewitte Ave. The lake is subject to periodic, small-scale fish die-offs associated with stressful temperature and/or oxygen levels. Crappie and sunfish are the species most often affected, and fish population levels and fish-consumption safety are not comparably worse than other regional lakes. Crappie species form the majority of fish in these die-offs. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels has been found in Upper Prior Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Prior is primarily managed for Walleye, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. White Bass are also present in low numbers for anglers seeking that species. Management includes scheduled walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years; other sizes/ages and amounts are substituted if insufficient fingerlings are available. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Upper Prior Lake during the week of 7/16/2018. During the survey, water clarity was low-- with 2.5 feet of visibility and low oxygen below 12 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Upper Prior were low, with 2.8/net. One factor related to low Walleye numbers was the limited availability of fish for stocking in 2015 and 2017, when fewer than 1,000 walleyes were stocked; the range from 1999-2013 was 3,310-23,300 fish. Average length of Walleye sampled in gill nets was 21.2 inches, with the largest measured at 26.2 inches. Despite low numbers, Walleye grow fast in Upper Prior and anglers should find the sizes favorable. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at moderate numbers (3.3/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was 26.7 inches, with the largest measured at 30.7 inches. While Upper Prior lacks the largest individuals (34+ inches), most pike are of quality size and should provide good angling opportunity. In addition, new statewide Northern Pike regulations went into effect during 2018, which allow harvest of 2 fish greater than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (12.5/net) and trap nets (12.6/net), with both gear exceeding the average catch of similar lakes. There were 162 Black Crappie sampled, with an average length of 7.9 inches with the largest measured at 9.6 inches. Despite high numbers, over 75% of Black Crappie sampled were greater than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high (34.8/net), a catch rate more than twice the catch of similar lakes in the area. There were 311 Bluegill sampled, with an average length of 5.9 inches and a maximum length of 8.5 inches. The Bluegill population in Upper Prior is mainly composed of small individuals, but anglers still have the opportunity to catch fish greater than 8+ inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Upper Prior Lake, but there was no targeted sampling during the 2018 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 3 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 9.5 inches and the largest measured at 13.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Prior is a 386-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet. Upper Prior Lake is located near the City of Prior Lake, and is connected to Lower Prior Lake. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the south side of the lake off of Dewitte Ave.  Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels are present in Upper Prior Lake. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Prior is primarily managed for Walleye, but also holds populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. White Bass are also present in low numbers. Management includes Walleye stocking every other year, and a special regulation for sunfish and crappie.  A new possession limit of 5 sunfish and 5 crappies is in place on Upper Prior.  A Standard Survey was conducted on Upper Prior Lake in 2021 to assess the status of the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Upper Prior were moderate, with a broad range of sizes present.  Fish were between 12 and 28 inches, with an average size of 18 inches.  Almost half of the fish sampled were between 12 and 13 inches, indicating success of recent stocking.  Over the next couple of years those fish should attain a good harvestable size.  Despite modest abundance, Walleye do well in Upper Prior, and management will continue to focus on this species.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Upper Prior Lake, but targeted bass electrofishing was not conducted as part of the 2021 survey. The fish were caught in both gill nets and trap nets; however, survey nets don't sample bass well so insight into the population is limited.  The 11 fish caught in the nets ranged in length between 8 and 17 inches.  When the lake was last electrofished for bass, in 2015, an abundant population of moderately sized fish were observed.  Average fish size during that survey was 9 inches, and the largest fish sampled was just under 16 inches.  Only 5% of bass sampled in 2015 were larger than 12 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically been present in Upper Prior in low numbers, and that was true again in 2021.  Only two fish were sampled by gill nets; one just under 24 inches, and the other just over.  Four northerns were caught in the trap nets, and they were between 21 and 31 inches long.  The abundance of the fish is so low that anglers probably won't spend too much time targeting them.  However, if one were to catch a northern while fishing for bass, then there's a good chance that the fish would be over 24 inches and harvestable under the Northern Pike regulation.  Two northerns over 24 inches can be kept per angler.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in low numbers in 2021.  Crappie populations (more so than other species) have a tendency to fluctuate in abundance, with a single year class dominating the population until they are replaced with a successive year class.  During the previous survey, in 2018, crappie were sampled in high numbers, with most of the fish exceeding 8 inches.  Those fish are likely gone from (or leaving) the population now.  With favorable conditions for reproduction, the low abundance population in the lake in 2021 could produce a large year class of offspring.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in high numbers in 2021, and size was modest.  The fish were between 3 and 8 inches long, with only 6% of the trap net catch exceeding 7 inches.  A new regulation took effect in 2021 for sunfish and crappies on Upper Prior.  Only 5 Bluegill and 5 crappie may be harvested per angler.  Upper Prior was chosen for this regulation because panfish grow fast in the lake, and the lake has a history of producing large Bluegill and crappie.  The goal of the regulation is to limit harvest in order to give fish a chance to grow to large sizes.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
