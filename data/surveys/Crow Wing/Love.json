Bluegill was abundant in 1986 (75.25/trapnet), but the catch dropped nearly ten- fold to 8.75/trapnet in 1991, still average for the lake class.  Size remained small (0.10 lbs), median length fell to 4.0 inches, and ranged from 3.5 to 7.4 inches. Black crappie abundance also remained low at 0.75/trapnet, and their average size remained large (0.47 lbs).  Fish to 11.4 inches. The walleye catch doubled (1.0/gillnet) to two fish. They were 20 and 21 inches long.  Yellow perch (2.5/ gillnet) were present in average numbers for the lake class.  Size (0.12 lbs) was average and unchanged from 1986.  Bullheads were found in generally average numbers for the lake class. Black bullhead (22.5/gillnet) were only sampled in gillnets.  Average size (0.73 lbs) was large. Yellow bullhead (3.75/trapnet, 0.58 lbs) were present in expected numbers and size.  Brown bullhead (0.5/trapnet) were of low abundance in trapnets but high abundance (16.5/lift) in gillnets.  Yellow bullhead  to 12 inches, and brown bullhead to 13 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Love is a 78 acre lake located on the east side of Gull Lake and about seven miles northwest of Brainerd.  Public access can be gained via a channel between Gull and Love lakes.  The lake's maximum depth is 27 feet and about 80% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel, with some areas with silt and muck bottom.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species are important.  Bulrushes help maintain water quality and improve  the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice may provide spawning habitat for northern pike in shallow water areas of the lake.  Submerged species provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish sampled in the 1996 test netting, while bluegill was the most abundant panfish.  The catch of northern pike was \"average\" when compared with similar type lakes and was similar to past catches in Love Lake.  Three year classes were sampled and growth was good.  About 73% of northern pike sampled were from the strong 1993 year class.  As a result, size averaged only 16 inches and 1.0 lb. in '96.  Three walleyes were sampled, producing a catch rate in the \"average\" category and similar to past catches for Love Lake.Largemouth bass were taken in \"average\" numbers, which were also similar to previous catches in the lake.  The bluegill catch was also in the \"average\" category and similar to the 1991 catch.  A number of age classes were sampled and growth was good.  About 9% of bluegills caught in trapnets were at least 7.0 inches long, compared to 6% in 1991.  Black crappies were not sampled in 1996 but most likely remain present in the lake.Yellow perch and white sucker are generally important food sources for gamefish like northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass.  Past perch catches have been fairly low.  Perch were only sampled by shoalwater seining in 1996.  Young perch averaged 2.2 inches long in mid-August.  White sucker was sampled for the first time in 1996 and the catch rate was in the \"low\" category.Other species sampled in 1996 included bowfin (dogfish), pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and three species of bullheads.  Most were caught at rates which are typical when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Love is a 78 acre lake that is part of the Gull Lake Reservoir system and is connected to the east side of Gull Lake by a boat channel.  The lake is located seven miles northwest of Brainerd.  The lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet and about 81% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Water clarity is moderate, with a light green color present.   Wild rice is usually very abundant on this lake and provides excellent northern pike spawning habitat.  The lake is moderately developed and a marina is present.The catch rate for northern pike, at 9.3/gill net, is typical for both the lake and similar lakes.  Pike ranged from 13-35 inches with the majority being rather small, averaging only 19 inches long.  Only one walleye, 20.1 inches, was sampled.  Bluegill numbers were typical for the lake but size tended to be small, with only 3% of sampled fish reaching a size larger than 7.0 inches.  Black crappie, largemouth bass yellow perch and bullhead species were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Catches lower than the first quartile were observed for rock bass, black crappie and walleye indicating low population levels. Bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, largemouth bass and yellow perch catches indicated average size populations since these catches all fell between the first and third quartile of the range around the regional median for these species. Northern pike aged (18 fish) were all in the 1-3 age classes with all three relatively equal in abundance. Annuli 1 fish averaged 8.2 inches and annuli 3 fish were averaging 17.6 inches. All three age classes exhibited average growth rates when compared to the statewide average. Size range present was from 9.3 to 24.5 inches with the median size group being 16.0-16.9 inches and weighing approximately 1.0 pound. Bluegill age classes 3-5 present in the nets with 3 and 4 comprising 93% of fish aged. Growth rate is considered slow for age class 3 and average for 4 and 5 when compared with statewide growth rate averages. Size range was from 3.9 to 7.2 inches with a median size group of 4.5 to 4.9 inches. Two largemouth bass were aged showing age class 3 and 4 present in the nets. Age class 3 at annuli 3 were 7.3 inches long, and 14.3 inches at annuli 4 for age class 4. Age class 3 had a below average growth rate, and age class 4's growth rate was average when compared to the state wide average growth rates. The 2 black crappies aged belonged to age class 3 and were 8.0 inches long at annuli 3. The growth rate is considered average. Age classes 4-6 were present in the yellow perch catches with age class 4 exhibiting a slow growth rate, and age classes 5 and 6 exhibiting average growth rates when compared to statewide average growth rates. The size range present was 5.0 to 8.8 inches. One 17.3 inch walleye was caught in the nets and it belonged to age class 5 and was 16.3 inches at annuli 5. That is considered average growth rate. Hybrid sunfish (bluegill x pumpkinseed) were abundant and had a size range of 3.5 to 7.9 inches with a median size group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches.</p>",

The lake received decent fishing pressure the week of the survey (July 1st), with several boats fishing the lake each day during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe only fish that were caught in any real numbers were northern pike (9.3/gill net) and bluegill (15.5/net).  Size of both were small.  Average size of northern pike was 17.6\" and 7% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  Average size of bluegill was 5.6\" and 16% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Other fish captured included black bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware that lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is heavily developed and also has a campground on it with a marina, so the lake gets plenty of traffic.  The lake received heavy fishing pressure the week of the survey (July 1st), with as many as 10 boats at a time fishing this little lake. <br> \n <br> \nAt 13 fish per net, northern pike were present in high numbers for this type of lake, with an average size of 19.3\" and only 13% measuring 24\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were normal at 17.2/net.  Average size was 6.3\" and 22% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Walleyes were also caught in average numbers (1.7/net) with an average length of 20.4\". <br> \n <br> \nLove Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels in Gull Lake.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
