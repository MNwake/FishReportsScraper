This was the highest recorded since 1975 when 3.7 walleye/gill net were also sampled.  Most of the walleye aged (91%) in this assessment were from fingerling stocked years.      Yellow perch have remained relatively stable over the past years.  The mean length of the perch sampled in this assessment was 6.5 inches     The largemouth bass population appears to have declined.  This species was not sampled in this assessment except for a few young of the year which were captured while seining.     Black crappie were captured at the lowest rate of any of the past assessments (0.6/trap net).  These fish had a mean length of 7.1 inches.     The bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (12.0/trap net) but the mean length was only 5.7 inches.               </p>",

The walleye gill net CPUE is 1.6 fish per net which is normal for this type of lake.  Although this catch rate is down from previous surveys, the size structure has shifted to larger somewhat older fish.  Most walleyes in past surveys were age 2 fish compared to age 3 fish in this survey.  Growth was excellent for age 3 walleyes.  Natural reproduction appears to be very limited on the lake; therefore, the walleye population is maintained by stocking.The northern pike CPUE is up slightly and consists of mostly age 2 and 3 fish which have good growth rates.The largemouth bass sample is larger than usual and consists of age 1 and age 2 fish which have growth rates near the state average.Bluegill and black crappies are small-sized, 80% of bluegills caught in trap nets were less than 6 inches total length and were represented by mainly age 2 and age 3 fish.  Most (23 of 24) of the total black crappie caught were less than 8 inches total length and were predominately age 2 fish.  The growth rate for both these panfish species is also within the normal range for this type of lake.Yellow perch gill net CPUE of 5.4 fish per net is also normal for this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burrows Lake is 291 acres and is located within the Chippewa National Forest in northeastern Itasca County.  The lake contains relatively \"soft water\" (alkalinity=11.5 ppm) with excellent water clarity (Secchi Disk =12.0 ft) and low fertility due to low phosphorus levels which limit biological productivity.  Bulrush and three-way sedge were rare in the shoals while water lilies, water shield, and burreed were growing in a band around most of the lake with larger stands in shallow bays. Various species of pondweeds, coontail, and muskgrass were growing on most of the lake bottom down to a depth of 14 feet due to the excellent water clarity.  Submerged plants provide dissolved oxygen to support gamefish throughout the littoral (<15 feet) zone, which comprises about 78% of the surface area of this lake.  A temperature and dissolved oxygen profile was conducted during this survey which indicated that the lake was stratified and the thermocline existed between 15 and 26 feet. Suitable dissolved oxygen levels to support gamefish (>2 ppm), were recorded down to a depth of 24 feet while dissolved oxygen levels remained at 1.8 ppm to the lake bottom.  These dissolved levels, although too low to support fish for long periods are adequate for short forays to the lake bottom for food items such as bloodworms.   Walleye were sampled at a rate of 3.2/gill net during this assessment, which was similar to previous assessments and exceeded the expected range of 1.5 to 2.3/net for similar lakes.  Nineteen walleye were sampled, which had a mean length of 15.5 inches and a mean weight of 1.3 lbs.  Fourteen walleye (74%) were age 3, which correlated with fry stocked in 1999, while four walleye corresponded to year classes in which no fry were stocked indicating natural recruitment.  Growth was determined to be normal for all age classes.        Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 9.2/net, which exceeded all previous catch rates, and slightly exceeded the upper range of 8.9 fish/net, for similar lakes.  Although high northern pike abundance is usually associated with small fish, the average weight was 2.24 lbs, which was near the median mean value of 2.1 lbs for similar lakes.  The average length of all northern pike (55) sampled was 20.7 inches.  The sample of northern pike contained fish from age 1 through 10 and growth was normal for northern pike compared to similar lakes.Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time during this lake survey.  Twenty smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets and varied in length from 12 to 18 inches.  Spring electofishing also captured 10 smallmouth bass, which ranged from 11.6 to 13.5 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass were aged and varied from three to six years old.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Since smallmouth bass have never been sampled in any of the previous five net surveys or assessments, this species was most likely introduced into this lake by anglers.  Smallmouth bass have been suspected of competing directly with walleye populations and reducing their abundance in many northeastern Minnesota Lakes.  It has yet to be determined what impact introduced smallmouth bass will have on the walleye population in Burrows Lake.Burrows Lake is considered by local anglers to provide a quality largemouth bass fishery.  Summer test netting is ineffective for sampling largemouth bass, therefore, electrofishing was attempted to more adequately sample bass species.  Electrofishing sampled largemouth and smallmouth bass at rates of 23.4 and 7.5 fish per hour, respectively.  Catch rates exceeded mean catch rates (13.7 largemouth bass and 2.0 smallmouth bass) for similar lakes in the Grand Rapids area.  Largemouth bass varied in length from 9 to 18 inches, 67% were over 12 inches and 17% exceeded 15 inches.  Largemouth bass ranged from age 3 to 6, however 59% were age 4.  Largemouth bass attained 15 inches during their fifth year of growth, while statewide they usually attain this length during their sixth year of growth.         The population of yellow perch can best be defined as a low abundance of small fish from 6.0-8.0 inches.  The catch rate of 5.3 fish/net was within the expected range of 1.0-10.3/net for similar lakes and was similar to the values for previous surveys.  The yellow perch population contained similar proportions of age 3 and 4 fish.  Growth was slow for each year of growth from ages 2 through 4.  Yellow perch provide prey for northern pike and walleyes and the small size structure usually indicates heavy predation.Black crappie were sampled at a relatively low catch rate of 1.7/gill net.  Black crappie are difficult to sample because they often suspend over open water in the summer months.  Sixteen black crappie were aged and 69% were age 2 while the remaining were ages 4-6.  The combined sample of trap net and gill net captured black crappie had 29% of the fish over 10 inches in length.  Black crappie had fast growth in this lake as the average crappie attained 10 inches in 4 years, while statewide they usually attain this size during their sixth year of growth.     Bluegill are also a popular species on this lake, but anglers generally regard them as too small to be acceptable.  Only 46 % were over six inches and 2% exceeded 8 inches in length.  The catch rate for trap nets was 6.2 fish/net, which was below the expected range for similar lakes.  The trap net catch consisted of fish from ages 2 through 6, however 53% were age 4 and 35% were age-3 fish.  Bluegill growth was above average as they attained 6 inches during their fifth growing season, while bluegill usually require eight growing seasons to attain this length in similar lakes.  Other species sampled included golden shiners and white suckers.  White sucker were sampled at a rate of 4.3/gill net, which exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch contained large fish with a mean length of 17.5 inches and a mean weight of 2.3 lbs.  Although most of the white sucker were too large for northern pike to prey upon, their offspring will provide future prey.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burrows Lake is located about 16 miles east of Marcell, MN, within the Mississippi River Watershed and the Chippewa National Forest.  The 322 acre lake has 227 littoral acres with a 38 foot max depth and is in Lake Class 32.  Walleye and northern pike are primary management species, while black crappie and largemouth bass are secondary management species.  The shoreline is relatively developed with some public ownership along the west shore and northeast corner.  Somewhat diverse aquatic plant life including floating vegetation can be found along the 6.9 mile shoreline.  There is one public access located at the southern tip of the lake with parking available for three rigs. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at an expected rate for lakes similar to Burrows, yet lower than the lake management plan goal.  The catch rate was lower than the previous assessment, which was the second highest recorded and exceeded the expected range.  Fingerling stocking was discontinued in 1994 and replaced with fry being stocked one of three years which appears to have provided a reasonable fishery with a moderate distribution of sizes.  Angler accounts suggest walleye fishing can be good at times.  Lengths ranged from 10.1-24.5 inches with a mean length of 14.1 inches.  Despite a relatively small sample size aged (n=6), scale and bone analysis suggests three age classes with fish up to age-10 present.  Similar to the previous assessment, growth was comparable to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was less than expected and was considerably less than the previous, historically high, catch rate.  However, catch rate and size structure was consistent with management goals.  The pike fishery can best be described as having a modest size structure, however previous assessments had sampled memorable sized fish.  Lengths ranged from 10.3-32.9 inches with an average length of 21.6 inches.  Scale analysis identified five ages with fish up to age-7 in the sample.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth was similar to the statewide average for age 1 fish but by age 2, growth exceeded the statewide average for all middle ages.  Northern pike exceeded 26 inches by age-4. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled black crappie within the expected range, while the trap net catch rate was less than expected.  Similarly, the previous gill net catch rate was within the expected range, while the trap net catch rate was slightly better, near the expected range. Lengths ranged from 4.6-11.3 inches, in the gill net sample, with an average length of 7.5 inches.  The sample size was too small to make any meaningful comparisons of size structure, however angler accounts suggest black crappie are targeted with some success and most assessments sampled fish up to twelve inches.  Scale analysis indicated relatively inconsistent year classes with only two age classes in four years.  Fish up to age-4 were present, while age-1 fish comprised 87% of the sample.  Back-calculated length-at-age indicated growth was near the statewide average.  Black crappie averaged over nine inches by age-4. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate within the expected range, yet over double the previous assessment.  Size structure was moderately poor with 74% of the sample less than 6 inches, however some fish almost ten inches were sampled.  Angler accounts suggest bluegill are targeted with some success at quality fish.  Lengths ranged from 3.2-9.9 inches with an average length of 5.4 inches.  Growth was not assessed; however past assessments suggest growth was faster than expected. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing sampled largemouth bass at a rate of 33.9/hr run-time, slightly higher than the previous assessment (23.4/hr).  Size structure appears favorable with a few individuals nearly 20 inches.  Lengths were from 11.2-19.3 inches with an average length of 13.7 inches.  Scale analysis indicated ages 4-8 were present in the sample.  Back-calculated length-at-age data suggests age-1 growth was slow but similar to the statewide average by age-2. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing also sampled smallmouth bass at a rate of 19.4/hr run-time, over double the previous assessment (7.5/hr).  Lengths were from 10.5-15.9 inches with an average length of 13.1 inches.  Scale analysis indicated ages 3-5 were present in the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average to age-4 and was less by age-5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate near the lake class average, but down slightly from the previous assessment.  Lengths were typically too small to interest most anglers with lengths from 4.6-8.0 inches and an average of 6.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were the only other species sampled in test netting, at a rate within the lake class expected range.  Lengths ranged from 13.5-23.3 inches with an average length of 19 inches.  As part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling, Johnny darter, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, largemouth bass, mimic shiner, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch were sampled in ten seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Burrows Lake was conducted on August 16-17th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations and a 15-foot seine was used at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured seven species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Smallmouth Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Burrows Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Burrows Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burrows Lake is a small lake located 10 miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Like other lakes in this area, Burrows is a soft water lake with low fertility, which limits its potential for fish production.  Burrows Lake has no inlets or outlets and has a moderate amount of development.  A state-owned public access is located at the southwest end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike and Walleye as primary management species and Largemouth Bass as secondary management species.  A standard survey was conducted in 2018 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch was the highest on record and well above average for this type of lake.  High pike numbers are usually viewed negatively because they are often associated with slower growth and poor size quality.  Northern Pike size structure was moderate in 2018.  Pike from the gill nets averaged 20.8 inches, and a few fish over 30 inches were sampled.  Ages 1 through 8 were represented with ages 3 and 4 the most abundant.  Pike averaged 22.1 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nLakes like Burrows typically do not support large Walleye populations.  The 2018 survey captured only four Walleye despite annual fry stocking since 2014.  The combination of high pike numbers and few Yellow Perch limits the potential for a Walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing.  The catch rate was similar to previous surveys and average compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth Bass had poor size structure and average growth.  Sampled fish averaged 11.1 inches and only two exceeded 15 inches.  Ages 2-8 and 11 were represented, but age 3-5 fish made up the majority of the sample.  Largemouth Bass averaged 12.4 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been sampled in surveys since 2002, typically in lower numbers than Largemouth Bass.  The 2018 electrofishing catch was similar to previous surveys.  Smallmouth Bass from electrofishing averaged 12.1 inches.  Age analysis indicated ages 3-6 were represented and fish averaged 12.9 inches at age 5.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for Bluegill was average for the lake and similar lakes.  Size structure was good; the average length of fish from trap nets exceeded 7 inches and 17% exceeded 8 inches.  Ages 3-9 were represented with age 6 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was considered good with Bluegill averaging 7.2 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net and gill-net catches for Black Crappie were typical for Burrows Lake and slightly above average compared to similar lakes.  Crappie ranged from 4.1 to 12.1 inches, averaging 9.2 inches from trap nets and 7.8 inches from gill nets.  Ages 1-6 were represented, with a strong 2014 year class (age 4) comprising over half the sample.  Crappie averaged 9.9 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have typically been low, but within the normal range for lakes with similar habitat.  The 2018 catch below the normal range and the lowest on record.  Yellow Perch are likely not targeted by anglers given their low numbers and small average size, but perch can be an important prey species for predators like Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",

A state-owned public access is located at the southwest end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike as the primary management species and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as secondary management species.  The LMP goals were to maintain a moderate Northern Pike gill-net catch with pike over 34 inches present; and maintain a Largemouth Bass night electrofishing catch rate of 30/hour of on-time.  A targeted gill net survey was conducted in 2023 to assess the status of the fish community.  Bass electrofishing was not conducted due to late ice out date resulting in workload constraints.   <br> \n <br> \nHigh Northern Pike catches are often associated with poor size quality and slow growth and are generally not desirable.  Prior to the 2002 survey, pike catches in Burrows Lake were generally low to moderate.  In three of four surveys since, pike catches were higher than expected.  The Northern Pike gill-net catch was the highest on record in the 2018 survey.  The 2023 catch rate remained high but size quality resembled past surveys.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged from 13.0 to 37.0 inches with a mean length of 21.4 inches.  Size structure goals were generally achieved, and three memorable-length pike (>34 inches) were sampled.  Ages 2-9 were represented with ages 3 and 5 the most abundant.  Northern Pike averaged 21.91 inches at age 4.  Good pike fishing opportunities appear to exist given the numbers and size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass are important components of the Burrows Lake fishery.  Gill nets are often a poor indicator of abundance but both species were sampled in 2023.  Previous electrofishing surveys have suggested a moderate to abundant Largemouth Bass population and a moderate Smallmouth Bass population.  Both species have had moderate size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important prey species for predators like Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass.  Perch catches from Burrows have typically been low to moderate compared to similar lakes.  The 2018 and 2024 catches were the lowest on record.  Lakes with similar characteristics do not typically support strong Walleye populations, although catches in Burrows have occasionally been above average.  Only three Walleye were sampled in 2023.  The current combination of high pike numbers and few Yellow Perch makes Burrows a poor candidate for Walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nLike many northern Minnesota lakes, Black Crappie catches on Burrows have fluctuated between surveys.  The 2023 catch was higher than expected compared to similar lakes and above average for Burrows Lake.  Size quality was good as crappie ranged from 5.6 to 13.2 inches and averaged 10 inches.  Recent recruitment appeared fairly consistent.  The oldest fish were 8 years old from the 2015 year-class.  Growth was moderate with fish averaging 8.3 inches by age 4.  It appears that good crappie fishing opportunities exist.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
