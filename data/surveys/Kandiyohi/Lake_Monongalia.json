                "narrative": "<p>Mud/Middle Fork Crow River Reservoir is a large, shallow, productive, aeratedimpoundment located in Kandiyohi County. There are two distinct basins on the Mud/Middle ForkCrow River Reservoir. Mud is the largest basin with a maximum depth of 6 feet and abundantaquatic vegetation. Middle Fork Crow River Reservoir (MFCR) portion contains several distinctbays, but with deeper water and more river characteristics. Floating cattail bogs are commonplace in the Mud Lake basin which sometimes prevents access by water between Mud and MFCRbasins. Shoalwater substrates include mostly sand, silt, muck, and detritus in the twobasins. The MFCR basin is aerated in the winter with subsurface helixors and surfaceagitators. The Mud Lake basin is too shallow for any aeration system to maintain good oxygenlevels during the winter. Low oxygen levels in the MFCR basin can become a problem duringsome winters with heavy snowfall accumulation or late start up of the aeration systems. Theoutcome of low winter dissolved oxygen in Mud/MFCR basins is an occasional partial winterkillthat negatively affect certain gamefish species such as walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass,and black crappie which are more susceptible to low dissolved winter oxygen levels than otherspecies such as northern pike, yellow perch, and black bullheads. Mud and MFCR basins arepopular northern pike fisheries with local residents. Recent fish stockings during 1998included adult bluegill (2,104 fish,380 lbs.) in the Mill Pond Bay of the MFCR basin andwalleye fry (950,880 fry) throughout the MFCR basin.     Northern pike were moderately abundant (5.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999. The 1999 northernpike average size was small (16.76 inches and 1.19 lbs., gillnets). Northern pike growthrates were below average compared to other local lakes. The 1997 year class comprised 59% ofthe 1999 northern pike catch.     Yellow perch numbers were low (4.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to other local lakes,but similar to the historical average (5.56 fish/gillnet). The 1999 yellow perch average sizewas moderately large (8.54 inches, gillnets).     Walleye numbers were low (3.63 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to local lakes, but abovethe historical average (1.53 fish/gillnet). The 1999 walleye average size was good (15.48inches, gillnets). Growth rates were average to good compared to other local lakes. The 1997year class (fry stocked) comprised 41% of the total 1999 walleye catch. It appears that fairwalleye natural reproduction occurred in 1996 as documented by the 1999 survey gillnets.      Black crappie numbers were low to moderate (2.38 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to locallakes, but slightly above the historical average (1.15 fish/gillnet). The 1999 black crappieaverage weight was moderate (0.38 lbs., gillnets).     Sunfish numbers were low (3.60 bluegill/trapnet, 3.07 pumpkinseed sunfish/trapnet). The1999 bluegill (3.83 inches) and pumpkinseed sunfish (4.61 inches) average sizes from thetrapnets were small.     Bullhead numbers were abundant (28.00 black bullhead/gillnet, 15.00 brownbullhead/gillnet, 18.75 yellow bullhead/gillnet) in 1999. The 1999 average bullhead sizeswere small for black bullhead (0.11 lbs., gillnets), but moderate for brown bullhead (0.28lbs.) and yellow bullhead (0.30 lbs.).     Northern pike numbers have been abundant with small average sizes and poor growth ratesin Mud/MFCR basins both historically and in 1999. Ideal and abundant northern pike spawninghabitat and relatively low forage fish densities (i.e. yellow perch) are probably the causefor overly abundant numbers of small slow growing northern pike in Mud/MFCR. Walleye numbershave improved from previous surveys and growth rates were good in Mud/MFCR due to theabundance of acceptable forage fish (black bullheads) and absence of recent partialwinterkills. Although panfish (bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish) numbers were lowto moderate in 1999, the numbers appear to be increasing in Mud/MFCR compared to previoussurveys. Potential options for decreasing the occurrence of partial winterkills in Mud/MFCRbasins include operating additional aeration units and the early winter startup of theseaeration systems. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor adult fishpopulations by summer test netting every four years in order to evaluate the effectivenessof management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Mud/Middle Fork Crow Reservoir \"MFCR\" was conducted in June of 2008. The MFCR is a large (1,565 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with three distinct basins starting upstream to downstream include: Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, the Middle Fork of Crow River Reservoir, and the Mill Pond located within the City of New London. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the Mill Pond near the New London Dam. The depth in Mud Lake is usually less than 4 feet. The reservoir basin maximum depth is about 6 feet deep. A helixor aeration system operates in the mid-portion of the reservoir basin during the winter months. Low dissolved oxygen and high levels of hydrogen sulfide can be persistent problems during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Residential development (153 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the west shoreline and bay areas of the reservoir portion adjacent to the city of New London. There are four public access sites located adjacent to the MFCR basins, which include one on the north shore of Mud Lake and three adjacent to the reservoir. Storm water and residential lawn runoff from the city of New London and residential homes enters the reservoir portion. Agricultural row crop drainage into the MFCR occurs via several inlets/tiles mostly into the Mud Lake basin. The Middle Fork of the Crow River enters Mud Lake near the north shore, flows through Mud and into the reservoir basin, then the Mill Pond, and eventually outlets at the New London Dam (southwest portion of the Mill Pond).  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality (total phosphorus=0.032 mg/l) was moderate during June of 2003 for MFCR. Water clarity was good (12.5 feet) during June of 2008. Emergent vegetation (cattail species, wild rice, and waterlily species) densities were prevalent within the MFCR, especially in the Mud Lake basin. Submergent vegetation species are varied and often dense within the basins. Submergent vegetation densities were lower in 2008 compared to 2003, especially within the Mud Lake basin. Boat travel was almost impossible during 2003 due to abundant vegetation, unlike 2008. The most commonly occurring submergent species present within the MFCR basins were celery, coontail, marestail, and northern milfoil. Filamentous algae blooms were uncommon during the start of the survey, but extensive by the end of the 2008 survey week. The most commonly occurring substrates included detritus, muck, and silt. Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye during the May opener and large sunfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed) during the summer of 2003. A 2007-08 partial winterkill of mostly largemouth bass and carp were observed dead along the shoreline in the spring of 2008. Dissolved oxygen levels were low during January of 2009 in many aerated and non-aerated shallow lakes in the Spicer Area. A winterkill assessment in the 2009 spring will determine whether restocking of gamefish is needed. MFCR is also a popular fishery for northern pike and largemouth bass. MFCR is managed primarily for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not captured in either gillnet or trapnet sets during the 2008 or 2003 MFCR resurveys. Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers during other previous surveys and assessments. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2008 due to time constraints.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (1.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but at the high end of the normal range for MFCR (25th=0.80, 50th=0.90, 75th=1.60 fish/gillnet). The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 1.17 fish/gillnet. The 2008 black crappie catch rate from trapnets (0.33 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (0.75 fish/trapnet). The 2008 black crappie average size was small (0.08 pounds and 5.13 inches) from gillnets. The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.35 pounds and 8.17 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weights were 0.32 and 0.34 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Black crappie growth rates in MFCR were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2006 black crappie year class comprised 69% of the 2008 total black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were last stocked in 2008 (468 fish, 117 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (15.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for MFCR (25th=5.75, 50th=9.20, 75th=11.60 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 9.35 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was small (1.92 pounds and 20.76 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 1.41 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (6.40 fish/gillnet). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (0.20 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in MFCR were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The three dominant northern pike year classes captured in the 2008 nets were from the 2005 (36%), 2004 (27%), and 2003 (19%) year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2008 (0.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for MFCR (25th=0.80, 50th=1.60, 75th=4.75 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 3.81 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average weight (0.09 pounds) from gillnets was small and below the historical average (0.23 pounds). Yellow perch growth rates in MFCR were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2006 and 2005 year classes each comprised 50% of the yellow perch captured in the 2008 gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were absent in 2008 gillnets and trapnets. The 2003 walleye gillnet catch rate was 4.40 fish/gillnet (MFCR 25th=0.20, 50th=0.75, 75th=3.63 fish/gillnet). The walleye historical catch rate is 1.80 fish/gillnet. The walleye historical average weight is 2.08 pounds from gillnets. The 2007-08 partial winterkill was probably responsible for the lack of walleye in the 2008 MFCR survey. Walleye fry were recently stocked (1.7 million each year) in the MFCR during 2004, 2006, and 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (22.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for MFCR (25th=1.40, 50th=3.60, 75th=10.67 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 7.96 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.97 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (1.87 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2005 year class comprised 66% of the total bluegill catch in the 2008 trapnets. Bluegill adults were last stocked in 2004 (1,365 fish, 195 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species were present in moderate numbers for the MFCR during 2008. Pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were abundant in 2008 (4.93 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The pumpkinseed sunfish historical average catch rate is 6.04 fish/trapnet for MFCR. The 2008 MFCR pumpkinseed sunfish average size was small (4.47 inches and 0.11 pounds). The MFCR pumpkinseed sunfish historical average weight is 0.17 pounds. Hybrid sunfish numbers were high in 2008 (3.47 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (1.83 fish/trapnet). The hybrid sunfish average size was small (4.18 inches and 0.08 pounds) in 2008. The hybrid sunfish historical average weight is 0.33 pounds in MFCR.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2008 (43.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for MFCR (25th=27.40, 50th=28.00, 75th=43.00 fish/gillnet). The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 32.49 fish/gillnet for MFCR. The 2008 black bullhead average weight was moderate to small (0.27 pounds) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from gillnets. Black bullhead sampled from 2008 nets appeared in poor condition. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were low in 2008 (2.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for the MFCR (25th=3.50, 50th=18.13, 75th=20.47 fish/trapnet). The 2008 yellow bullhead average weight was moderate to small (0.24 pounds). The yellow bullhead historical average weight is 0.29 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2008 nets included abundant numbers of carp (5.13 fish/trapnet) and white sucker (4.40 fish/gillnet). The carp and white sucker historical average catch rates were 2.68 carp/trapnet and 2.82 white sucker/gillnet respectively for MFCR. The 2008 carp and white sucker average weights were 9.28 pounds and 2.72 pounds respectively. The carp and white sucker historical average weights were 9.76 pounds and 2.38 pounds respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on MFCR include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. A winterkill assessment will be conducted during the 2009 spring to determine the extent of winterkill due to low oxygen levels. The MFCR fishery will be assessed in the 2013 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Middle Fork Crow Reservoir \"MFCR\", also known as Monongalia or Mud Lake, was conducted in June of 2013. MFCR is a large (1,565 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with three distinct basins starting upstream to downstream include: Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, the reservoir, and the Mill Pond located within the city limits of New London. Residential development (176 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the west shoreline and bay areas of the reservoir portion adjacent to the city of New London. There are four public access sites located adjacent to the MFCR basins, which include one on the north shore of Mud Lake basin, two adjacent to the reservoir basin and one on the Mill Pond basin. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the Mill Pond basin near the New London Dam. The depth in Mud Lake basin is usually less than 4 feet with abundant aquatic vegetation and limited development. The reservoir basin maximum depth is about 6 feet deep with development primarily along the west shores with relatively undeveloped hardwoods and wetlands along the east shore. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.036 mg/l) was moderate during June of 2013 for MFCR. Water clarity was moderate (7.6 feet) during June of 2013. A helixor aeration system operates in the mid-portion of the reservoir basin during the winter months. Partial winterkills are frequent occurrences during winters with abundant snowfall accumulations. Low dissolved oxygen and the release of high levels of hydrogen sulfide can also be persistent problems during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Storm water and residential lawn runoff from the city of New London and residential homes enters the reservoir portion. Agricultural row crop drainage into the MFCR occurs via several inlets/tiles, but mostly into the Mud Lake basin. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Mud Lake basin near the north shore, flows through Mud and into the reservoir basin, then Mill Pond, and eventually outlets at the New London Dam (southwest portion of Mill Pond). The New London Dam was replaced in 2010. It is a formidable fish barrier and is classified as a high hazard dam. The Middle Fork Crow River eventually flows into Nest Lake, Green Lake and Calhoun. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation (cattail species, wild rice, waterlily species, etc.) densities were prevalent within the MFCR, especially in the Mud Lake basin. Submergent vegetation species are varied and often dense within the basins. Submergent vegetation densities were lower in 2013 and 2008 compared to 2003, especially within the Mud Lake basin. Boat travel was almost impossible during 2003 due to abundant vegetation, unlike 2013. Approximately 40 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were observed during the 2013 vegetation transect survey. The most commonly occurring submergent species present within the MFCR basins were water celery, sago pondweed, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil. Other abundant algal/floating/submergent species observed included muskgrass, lesser duckweed and various pondweed species. Intense filamentous algae blooms are common by early July. The most commonly occurring substrates included sand, detritus, muck, and silt. MFCR is also a popular fishery for northern pike, sunfish and largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not captured in either gillnets or trapnets during the 2013 or 2008 MFCR resurveys. Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers during other previous surveys and assessments.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2013 (0.93 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 0.78 fish/trapnet. The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate (0.44 pounds and 8.64 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal range for age 1 and near upper ends of the normal ranges for ages 2-6. The 2011 black crappie year class comprised 50% of the 2013 total black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were recently stocked in 2008 (468 fish, 117 pounds), 2010 (1,056 fish, 264 pounds) and 2011 (944 fish, 236 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high in 2013 (11.23 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the MFCR historical average (9.68 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was small (1.68 pounds and 19.10 inches) from gillnets. Abundant stunted northern pike numbers have been the norm due to abundant spawning habitat and limited preferred prey species (yellow perch). The northern pike historical average weight is 1.46 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of northern pike >21 inches was fair (2.67 fish/gillnet). However, the 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was low (0.20 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 54% and 20% of the 2013 northern pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average (3.29 fish/gillnet). The 2013 yellow perch average weight (0.17 pounds) was moderate from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal range for age 1, but within the normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2007-10 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2013 yellow perch catch. Yellow perch were recently stocked in the 2013 fall (13,494 fish, 519 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2013 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.83 fish/gillnet. The walleye average size was moderately large (2.00 pounds and 17.59 inches) in 2013. The walleye historical average weight is 2.10 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2010 year class comprised 43% of the 2013 walleye catch. MFCR was stocked recently with 0.5 million walleye fry per year during 2009-2011 and 0.1 million fry during 2012. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2013 (0.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the MFCR historical average (6.70 fish/trapnet). The 2013 bluegill average size was large (0.35 pounds and 6.76 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates in MFCR were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 50% and 33% respectively of the 2013 bluegill catch. Bluegill adults were last stocked in 2004 (1,365 fish, 195 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish numbers were abundant in 2013 (9.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The pumpkinseed sunfish historical average catch rate is 6.56 fish/trapnet for MFCR. The 2013 MFCR pumpkinseed sunfish average size was moderate (6.39 inches and 0.24 pounds) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish abundance in 2013 (1.07 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (1.97 fish/trapnet) in MFCR. The hybrid sunfish average size was large (7.16 inches and 0.39 pounds) in 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2013 (64.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 37.74 fish/gillnet for MFCR. The 2013 black bullhead average size was small (0.21 pounds) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were also abundant in 2013 (13.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2013 yellow bullhead average weight was moderate (0.37 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of interest captured in the 2013 included abundant numbers of carp (5.07 fish/trapnet) and moderate numbers of white sucker (2.33 fish/gillnet). The carp and white sucker historical average catch rates were 3.08 carp/trapnet and 2.74 white sucker/gillnet for MFCR. The 2013 carp and white sucker average weights were 5.91 pounds and 2.14 pounds respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on MFCR include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The MFCR fishery will be assessed in the 2018 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Mud/Middle Fork Crow River Reservoir \"MFCR\" was conducted in June of 2003. The MFCR is a large (1,565 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with two distinct basins; Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, and the Middle Fork of Crow River Reservoir. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the reservoir basin. The depth in Mud Lake is usually less than 4 feet. The reservoir basin is aerated with helixors during the winter months. Low dissolved oxygen and high levels of hydrogen sulfide can be persistent problems during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Residential development (153 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the west shoreline and bay areas of the reservoir portion adjacent to the city of New London. There are four public access sites located adjacent to the MFCR basins, which include one on the north shore of Mud Lake and three adjacent to the reservoir. Storm water and residential lawn runoff from the city of New London and residential homes enters the reservoir portion. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles mostly into the Mud Lake basin. The Middle Fork of the Crow River enters Mud Lake near the north shore, flows through Mud and into the reservoir basin, and eventually outlets at the New London Dam (southwest portion of the reservoir). Water quality (total phosphorus=0.032 mg/l) and clarity (secchi=5.42 feet) were moderate during June of 2003 for MFCR. Emergent vegetation (cattail species, wild rice, and waterlily species) densities were prevalent within the MFCR, especially in the Mud Lake basin. Submergent vegetation species were varied and often dense within the basins. Coontail and muskgrass were the most abundant submergent species present within the MFCR basins. The most commonly occurring substrates included detritus, muck, and silt. Local anglers had good fishing success for walleye during the May opener and large sunfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed) during the summer of 2003. MFCR is also a popular fishery for northern pike and largemouth bass.Largemouth bass were not captured in either gillnet or trapnet sets during the 2003 MFCR resurvey. Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers during previous surveys and assessments. Black crappie numbers were low in 2003 (0.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 1.0 fish/gillnet for MFCR. The 2003 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.60 pounds and 9.5 inches) from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in MFCR were within the normal ranges for ages 1-2, but above the normal ranges for ages 3-4 compared to area lakes. Northern pike numbers were high in 2003 (11.6 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.9 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size was small (1.32 pounds and 18.1 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 1.29 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was low (1.80 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in MFCR were below the normal ranges for ages 1-4, but within the normal range for age 5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 66% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 resurvey were from the 2001 year class. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (1.6 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 4.6 fish/gillnet. The 2003 yellow perch average weight (0.39 pounds) from gillnets was above the historical average (0.25 pounds). Yellow perch growth rates in MFCR were within or above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The 2000 year class comprised 57% of the yellow perch captured in the 2003 gillnets and trapnets.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2003 (4.4 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 2.3 fish/gillnet. The 2003 walleye average size was moderate (1.42 pounds and 14.7 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.08 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were above the normal ranges for ages 1-7 compared to area lakes. The 2001 walleye year class (from natural reproduction) comprised 84% of the 2003 total walleye resurvey catch in MFCR. Walleye fry were last stocked in the MFCR during 2002 (588,960 fry).Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2003 (10.7 fish/trapnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 4.3 fish/trapnet. The 2003 bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.1 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.25 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was low (2.1 fish/trapnet) in 2003. Bluegill growth rates in MFCR were generally above the normal ranges compared to area lakes. The 2001 year class comprised 77% of the total bluegill catch in the 2003 nets. The largest bluegill capture in the 2003 MFCR survey nets was 10.4 inches.Other sunfish species were also prevalent both in size and number for the MFCR during 2003. Pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were high in 2003 (15.7 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the MFCR historical average catch rate (6.3 fish/trapnet). The 2003 MFCR pumpkinseed sunfish average size was moderate (5.2 inches and 0.19 pounds). The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger pumpkinseed sunfish was moderate (7.0 fish/trapnet) in MFCR during 2003. Hybrid sunfish numbers were low in 2003 (2.5 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historical average (1.8 fish/trapnet). The hybrid sunfish average size was large (7.8 inches and 0.52 pounds) in 2003. The largest pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish captured in the 2003 MFCR nets were 8.9 inches and 9.3 inches respectively. Black bullhead numbers were moderate in 2003 (27.4 fish/gillnet), compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 29.9 fish/gillnet for MFCR. The 2003 black bullhead average size was small (0.16 pounds and 6.6 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from gillnets.Other fish species of special interest captured in the 2003 included moderate numbers of carp (1.7 fish/trapnet). The carp historical average catch rate was 2.1 fish/trapnet for MFCR. The 2003 average carp weight was large (7.84 pounds) from gillnets.Current fish management activities on MFCR include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The MFCR fishery will be assessed in the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mud Lake (Monogalia) and the Middle Fork of the Crow River Reservoir (MFCR) basins areconsidered one body of water for fisheries management purposes. The headwaters (JudicialDitch #38) of the Middle Fork of the Crow River originates about 8 miles upstream of MudLake. There are also two small inlets which enter the southwest side of Mud. The Mud Lakebasin comprises a surface area of 1,463 acres, a maximum depth of 8 feet, and shorelinelength of 9.2 miles. The shoalwater substrates are mostly muck (50%) and silt (35%) withsmall amounts of marl, sand, and gravel. Both emergent and submergent vegetation are abundantwithin Mud Lake. Floating cattail bogs are common. The immediate watershed is composed mostlymixed hardwoods, willows, and cedars on gently rolling glacial till. Also, numerous wetlandareas and some agricultural row crops\\pastures present. The shoreline is relativelyundeveloped. It is comprised of mixed hardwoods on gradual slopes with fringes of reed canarygrass, reed meadow grass, and cattails. Low winter dissolved oxygen levels results infrequent winterkill in the Mud Lake basin. Historically, Mud has been an important nestingand fall migration resting area for waterfowl.       The Middle Fork of the Crow River Reservoir (MFCR) basin comprises an area from CountyRoad #9 at Dilley's Grade downstream to the dam at the city of New London. The first dambuilt near this site was in 1865. The present dam (high hazard) at New London is state ownedand operated. Fluctuations are relatively minor because water levels are controlled at thedam with a goal of 1,203.48 feet (normal summer pool). The MFCR comprises an area of 855surface acres, shoreline length of 19.0 miles, and a maximum depth of 14 feet in the MillPond. The New London Fish Hatchery (Operated by MNDNR) is located downstream of the dam.Three inlets enter the MFCR basin from the east, the largest of these is the Long Lake (34-066) inlet. The Middle Fork of the Crow River below the dam eventually flows into Nest Lake(34-154), Green Lake (34-079), Calhoun Lake (34-062), and into the North Fork of the CrowRiver. Emergent and submergent species are most abundant along the north portions, eastcentral shoreline and bay areas, the \"narrows\", and the \"Joe Neer's bridge\" area. Theshoalwater substrate of MFCR basin are mostly silt (42%), muck (22%), sand (21%), and gravel(8%). The immediate watershed is characterized by upland woodlands (mixed hardwoods, willows,and cedars on gently rolling glacial till), residential and municipal (city of New London)development. Management activities from the 1940's - 1960's included mostly winter rescueefforts and opening Mud/MFCR to promiscuous fishing during winterkill years. Stocking wasrather limited prior to the installation of two aeration systems in the MFCR basin during1983-84. Recent stockings have included adult bluegill and walleye fry during the late 1980'sand early 1990's. Most fishing pressure occurs within the MFCR basin. In May-June of 1994,a local resident reported seeing over 100 boats at one time within the MFCR basin. Northernpike and largemouth bass are the most sought species by anglers. There is a local northernpike fishing derby held during late-May/early June each year. Fishing pressure within Mud israther limited. Factors that limit fishing pressure in Mud are access problems (floatingcattail bogs, limited public launch sites), difficult mobility due to thick submergentvegetation and shallow depth (< 5 feet).     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (9.2 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.2 - 7.8fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the 1990 survey (5.0 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (1.4 lbs., 18.1 inches) was below the normal range (1.5 - 3.0 lbs) for similarlakes, but was slightly above the 1990 survey (1.2 lbs, 16.9 inches). The largest northernpike caught was 30.9 inches in 1994. Growth rates appear slightly below average. There werereports of good angling success for northern pike in 1994.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (1.4 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 14.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and the same as the 1990 survey. The 1994 average size (6.3inches) was below the 1990 survey (8.2 inches). Growth rates appear below average, however,recent MFCR bluegill stockings were from lakes with stunted/slow growth populations.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.0 -12.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the 1990 survey (2.6 fish/trapnet). The 1994average size (7.1 inches) was below the 1990 survey (9.2 inches).     Walleye abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.2 - 15.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the 1990 survey (0.8 fish/gillnet). Although aboutone million walleye fry have been stocked every odd year since 1989, it appears that frystocking has been unsuccessful in producing a decent walleye fishery in MFCR basin.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (11.5 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 -22.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but above the 1990 survey (0.4 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size was 6.6 inches.     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (13.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (4.6 -83.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the 1990 survey (50.3 fish/gillnet). The 1994black bullhead average size (0.3 lbs) was below the 1990 average weight (0.5 lbs). Brownbullhead abundance in 1994 (12.1 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for similar lakes(0.6 - 7.7 fish/gillnet), but below the 1990 survey (44.7 fish/gillnet). The 1994 brownbullhead average size (0.2 lbs) was below the 1990 survey (0.4 lbs). Yellow bullheadabundance in 1994 (5.6 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (0.3 - 3.6 fish/gillnet) forsimilar lakes, but below the 1990 survey (27.9 fish/gillnet). The 1994 yellow bullheadaverage size (0.3 lbs) was similar to the 1990 survey (0.3 lbs).     Carp abundance in 1994 (4.0 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.7 - 5.1fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but above the 1990 survey (2.5 fish/trapnet). The 1994average size (7.8 lbs) was similar to the 1990 survey (7.4 lbs).     The limiting factor for fish populations in Mud/MFCR basin is probably low winterdissolved oxygen levels. Although, the two aeration systems have produced small refuges forfish in the winter, the sheer amount of potential low oxygenated water (1,463 acres) flowingfrom Mud into the MFCR makes it difficult for the aerators to maintain adequate oxygen levelsover a large area. Fish species that are presently abundant (northern pike, bullhead spp.,)within Mud/MFCR are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels than other species (walleye,black crappie, bluegill). Walleye stocking appears to be ineffective, probably due in partto the limited survival during the winter (low dissolved oxygen conditions). It also appearsthat bluegill and black crappie stocking results have been rather limited. If stockingbluegill and black crappie is to continue, then it should be restricted to the Mill Pond Area(city of New London) where the fish can be more readily utilized by the public. An additionalaeration system may be necessary within the New London Mill Pond (east side of bridge). Thisarea is the deepest portion of the reservoir and has easy access to electrical hookup withinNew London. This would complement good oxygen levels at upstream sites adjacent to the LongLake inlet, the 6 unit helixor aeration unit near the \"narrows\", and the 2 unit aeratorwithin (Neer Park) New London. Another option would be to increase the present area of openwater (oxygenated water) by installing more aeromix/helixor units at the respective aerationsites. Aeration within the Mud basin proper would be ineffective due to the size, shallowdepth (<5 ft), and muck bottom that would be stirred up. Negative impacts of additionalaeration systems could be greater survival of undesirable fish species (bullhead spp., carp)which reduce habitat for waterfowl and greater disturbance (due to increased fishingpressure) of important avian nesting areas in Mud/MFCR basins. Finally, an importantmanagement priority for Mud/MFCR and downstream watershed lakes (Nest, Green, Calhoun) isreducing incoming nutrients from agricultural runoff. This can be accomplished by encouragingfarmers to use appropriate conservation tillage techniques that are feasible. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Middle Fork Crow Reservoir \"MFCR\", also known as Monongalia or Mud Lake, was conducted in late May of 2018. A representative spring day electrofishing survey was conducted for Largemouth Bass during mid-June of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nMFCR is a large (2,271 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with three distinct basins starting upstream to downstream include: Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, the reservoir, and the Mill Pond located within the City of New London. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the Mill Pond basin near the New London Dam. The depth in Mud Lake basin is usually less than 4 feet. The reservoir basin maximum depth is about 6 feet deep. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.036 mg/l) was moderate during June of 2013 for MFCR. Water clarity was good (9.0 feet) on May 29, 2018. A helixor aeration system operates in the mid-portion of the reservoir basin during the winter months. It is adequate at maintaining oxygen levels during mild or low snowfall winters. However, both partial and significant winterkills have been frequent occurrences during winters with abundant snowfall accumulations. A partial winterkill occurred in late February of 2014, but few dead fish were observed in the 2014 spring. The present aeration system is unable to maintain adequate oxygen during these heavy snowfall winters due to the large upstream volume of low/no oxygenated water flowing thru the aeration site and downstream portions of the reservoir. Installing a functional aeration system upstream on the Mud basin that maintains adequate oxygen levels is not feasible due to poor bottom substrates (muck), shallow depth, abundant decaying vegetation, poor accessibility and large size. Low dissolved oxygen often releases of high levels of hydrogen sulfide from the sediments during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Winter oxygen levels in MFCR were adequate from 2015-2018. Oxygen levels were high during January of 2019. However, significant snowfall in February of 2019 resulted in rapid depleted oxygen levels for MFCR and other shallow basins. A partial winterkill of Common Carp and low numbers of gamefish occurred, but spring test netting yielded decent numbers of gamefish (Northern Pike) and panfish (Bluegill, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Black Crappie) in early May of 2019. Residential development (176 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the west shoreline and bay areas of the reservoir portion adjacent to the city of New London. There are four public access sites located adjacent to the MFCR basins, which include one on the north shore of Mud Lake basin, two adjacent to the reservoir basin and one on the Mill Pond basin. Storm water and residential lawn runoff from the city of New London and residential homes enters the reservoir portion. Agricultural row crop drainage into the MFCR occurs via several inlets/tiles, but mostly into the Mud Lake basin. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Mud Lake basin near the north shore, flows through Mud and into the reservoir basin, then Mill Pond, and eventually outlets at the New London Dam (southwest portion of Mill Pond). The New London Dam was replaced in 2010. It is a formidable fish barrier and is classified as a high hazard dam. Water levels have been relatively stable in the reservoir in recent years. The Middle Fork Crow River eventually flows into Nest Lake, Green Lake, Calhoun and connects to the North Fork Crow River near Manannah, Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation (cattail species, bulrush species, wild rice, waterlily species, etc.) densities were prevalent within the MFCR, especially in the Mud Lake basin. Submergent vegetation species are varied and often dense within the basins. Submergent vegetation densities were moderate in May of 2018, but dense during June of 2018. Submergent vegetation densities were lower in 2013 and 2008, but high in 2003 especially within the Mud Lake basin. Boat travel was almost impossible during 2003 due to abundant vegetation, unlike 2013. Approximately 40 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were observed during the 2013 vegetation transect survey. The most commonly occurring submergent species present within the MFCR basins were water celery, sago pondweed, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil. Other abundant algal/floating/submergent species observed included muskgrass, lesser duckweed and various pondweed species. Intense filamentous algae blooms are common by late June to early July. The most commonly occurring substrates included sand, detritus, muck, and silt.

The 2014 year class comprised 21% of the 2018 Northern Pike catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for MFCR in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2018 (0.33 fish/gillnet) The 2018 Yellow Perch average weight (0.08 pounds) was small. Yellow Perch were recently stocked in the 2013 fall (13,494 fish, 519 pounds), 2015 (2,742 fish, 614 pounds) and 2018 (360 fish, 90 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2018 (4.67 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (2.23 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Walleye average size was large (3.67 pounds and 20.7 inches). Walleye growth rates were above average. The 2013 and 2014 year classes comprised 40% and 33% respectively of the 2018 Walleye catch. MFCR was stocked recently with approximately 500,000 Walleye fry per year in 2009-2011, 100,000 fry in 2012, 765,000 fry in 2013 and 1,160,000 fry in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2018 (40.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (11.46 fish/trapnet). The 2018 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.0 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.23 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was high at 15.47 fish/trapnet. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was moderate at 2.78 fish/trapnet. Bluegill growth rates in MFCR were moderate for ages 1-8. The 2015 year class comprised 37% of the 2018 Bluegill catch. Bluegill adults were last stocked in 2004 (1,365 fish, 195 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish numbers were abundant in 2018 (25.36 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted trapnet survey of Middle Fork Crow Reservoir \"MFCR\", also known as Monongalia or Mud Lake, was conducted in early June of 2023. The purpose of the survey was to determine the extent of a partial winterkill in February/March of 2023. Four lake survey trapnets were set at standard stations. At least one trapnet was set in each major basin (Mill Pond, Lower Reservoir, Upper Reservoir and Mud). The surface water temperature was 78.6 F. The water was slightly turbid with a brown stained color. Submergent vegetation density was light. Moderate stands of yellow waterlily were present. Filamentous algae blooms were not apparent during the 2023 early June survey unlike other years. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nMFCR is a large (1,565 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with three distinct basins starting upstream to downstream which includes: Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, the reservoir, and the Mill Pond located within the City of New London. In addition, there are multiple smaller bays within these basins. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the Mill Pond basin near the New London Dam. The depth in Mud Lake basin is usually less than 4 feet. The reservoir basin maximum depth is about 6 feet deep. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.036 mg/l) was moderate during June of 2013 for MFCR. Water clarity was good (6.5 feet) on June 8, 2023. A helixor aeration system operates in the mid-portion of the reservoir basin during the winter months. It is adequate at maintaining oxygen levels during mild or low snowfall winters. However, both partial and significant winterkills have been frequent occurrences during winters with abundant snowfall accumulations. The present aeration system is unable to maintain adequate oxygen during these winters due to the large upstream volume of low/no oxygenated water flowing thru the aeration site and downstream portions of the reservoir. Installing a functional aeration system upstream on the Mud basin that maintains adequate oxygen levels is not feasible due to poor bottom substrates (muck), shallow depth, abundant decaying vegetation, poor accessibility, and large size. Low dissolved oxygen often releases high levels of hydrogen sulfide from the sediments during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Winter oxygen levels in MFCR were adequate from 2014-2018. However, significant snowfall in February of 2019 resulted in rapid depleted oxygen levels and probable winterkill. Winter dissolved oxygen levels were also low (1-2 ppm) during January/February of 2019, 2020 and 2022. Winter oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm in late February and early March of 2023. Sporadic numbers and species of dead fish were noted after ice out during these same years. The aeration system was operated in 2022-2023 winter. The 2023-24 winter was mild. The aeration system was not operated in 2023-24 winter. <br> \n <br> \nVarious fish species were captured in the four standard lake survey trapnets for the MFCR June survey. Yellow Bullhead were the most numerous fish species present with 24.25 fish/trapnet and average size of 8.25 inches.  Black Bullhead numbers were low (4.00 fish/trapnet, 7.43 inches). Pumpkinseed were captured in low numbers (4.50 fish/trapnet, 5.73 inches) during 2023. Northern Pike numbers (2.75 fish/trapnet, 21.80 inches) were moderate in the 2023 trapnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 30.55 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for MFCR in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. Other species captured included low numbers of Black Crappie and Bowfin. No Bluegill or Largemouth Bass were captured in the 2023 trapnets. Walleye were also absent from the 2023 trapnet survey. A local fishing tournament held on June 10, 2023 yielded moderate numbers of Northern Pike (66 fish, 5.5 pounds average) and low numbers of Largemouth Bass (3 fish, 1.42 pounds average). Although a partial winterkill occurred, it appears that adequate numbers of gamefish survived the 2022-23 winter. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on MFCR include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The MFCR fishery will be assessed in the 2027 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
