                "narrative": "<p>Davis Lake is a small, 45 acre lake within the Sandy River system located about three miles northwest of McGregor. The maximum depth of Davis Lake is 32 feet.  Development on the lake is minimal, and there is no public access on the lake. Davis Lake is prone to have periodic fish kills in the summer and winter. Davis collects a large amount of organic input from the Sandy River watershed and can have a high biological oxygen demand.  Game fish present in Davis Lake include: walleye, northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.The catch rate for northern pike was 2.3 fish per net in 2005 and has ranged from 1.7 to 5.0 since the lake was first surveyed in 1984.  The northern pike catch rate documented in this survey is considered below average for this type of lake. The mean length of pike was 20 inches and the longest was 26 inches.  Four walleye were sampled in the 2005 survey all of which were caught in trap nets near shore. The smallest was 10 inches and the largest was 18 inches. There were 17 crappies caught during the survey the largest of which was 12.5 inches long, however the majority of crappies sampled were from the 2002 year class and averaged about 7 inches long.  Bluegill abundance is below average for this lake type at 2.5 fish per trap net and the mean size was 5.5 inches.  Black, yellow and brown bullheads are present in Davis Lake, however black bullheads are the most abundant of the three and dominated the trap net catches.  The Davis Lake fish community is likely to vary greatly dependent upon seasonal variations in temperature and flow regime. For instance anglers would likely find higher numbers of walleye and northern pike early in the year when water temperatures are cooler and there is more water moving through the system.  </p>",

The growth rate for the first growth increment was twenty-three percent faster than normal. The growth rates for the third and fourth growth increments were twenty-four and thirty- five percent slower than normal respectively. Black crappie ranged from six to eight years of age. The growth rates for the eight growth increment checked were normal. Yellow perch ranged from three to six years of age. The growth rates for the first four increment were normal. The growth rates for the fifth and sixth growth increments were twenty-seven and forty-four percent slower than normal respectively walleye ranged from three to eight plus years of age. The growth rates for the fifth through the eighth growth increment ranged from twenty-six to fifty percent slower than normal.</p>",
