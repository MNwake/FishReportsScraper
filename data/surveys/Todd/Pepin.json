                "narrative": "<p>Pepin Lake is a borderline eutrophic lake (fertile) on the west side of theCity of Swanville.  Summer algae blooms and algae growth on the vegetation arecommon.  The local sportsmen's club maintains the access and has supplied a fishingdock to provide more angling opportunities.  A short waterway connects the lakewith the nearby Swan River.  Fish migration is known to occur during spring highwater, however water level fluctuations could limit movement throughout the summerand fall.     Pepin supports a diverse fish community.   Northern pike, bluegills, blackcrappies, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are some of the more commonly angledspecies.  An occasional walleye is caught.  Northern pike numbers have increasedand are above a desirable level for the lake.  Average weight was just under twopounds, with most of the pike between 19 and 21 inches in length.  Walleye may bemore difficult to catch but the average size may be worth the wait.  All thewalleye sampled during the survey were over eighteen inches with an average weightof four pounds.  The population appears to be sustained by migration from the SwanRiver or natural reproduction in the lake.  Yellow perch continue to abundant inthe lake, which is desirable. Perch are an important prey species for both northernpike and walleye, and can also have a positive affect on the bluegill population. While abundance of largemouth bass is difficult to assess with survey gear, Pepinappears to have a quality population with fish up to nineteen inches observed. Bluegills and black crappies were both abundant in number.  Average size forbluegills was five inches and six inches for black crappies.  However, seven inchbluegills were not uncommon in the survey and one eleven inch crappie was alsoobserved.  Other centrarchid species present included pumpkinseeds, green sunfish,hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.     Pepin Lake's fertile water and connection to the Swan River provides for adiverse roughfish community including carp, bowfin or dogfish, white suckers, blackbullheads, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads.  Carp numbers appear normal forthe lake type while white sucker and bowfin numbers were high.  Bullhead abundancefor all the species were low to normal.     Neascus was common on northern pike and yellow perch.  Neascus is a blacktrematode or parasite with a life cycle going from snails to fish to a fish-eatingbird, such as herons, to mature.  Humans cannot be infested.  Skinning the fishremoves most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.      Water quality in Pepin Lake affects the recreational value of the lake andmake-up of the fish community.  Good lakeshore and agricultural practices in thewatershed are encouraged to improve water quality in the lake.  Selective harvestis also encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impact on the fishcommunity.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limitingharvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fishcommunity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pepin Lake is a small lake on the west side of the City of Swanville with a wide connection to the nearby Swan River.  Fish migration is known to occur during spring high water, however, water lever flucuations could limit movement throughout the summer and fall.  Frequent rain events in June put the water level in Pepin Lake at record highs and may have had an effect on fish movement and location during the survey.      The local sportsmens club maintains the lake access and also supplied a fishing dock to help those without boats to have an angling opportunity.  Northern pike, bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are some of the more commonly angled species in Pepin Lake.  Anglers reported that catching small northern pike was common which fit with what was seen in the survey where most of the pike were under 20 inches in length.  Some larger pike up to 36 inches have been observed.      Bluegills are abundant and the size structure of the population appears good despite the high numbers.  Many of the fish seen in the survey were over 6 inches with some fish up to almost 9 inches.  Black crappies are also fairly abundant but most that were seen in the survey would be considered small by most anglers.  Ten-inch crappies were the biggest caught, but most were less than 9 inches in length.  Pepin Lake does support a largemouth bass population but no bass were sampled in this survey.  Bass can be hard to assess with standard lake survey nets.  Spring night electrofishing has proved more effective at catching bass and past surveys have recorded quality size fish up to 19 inches.    Yellow perch was one fish species that was absent from the 2003 lake survey but abundant in the previous survey in 1997.  Perch can be an important prey species for gamefish and can also have a postive affect on the bluegill population.  The population may show a recovery if the northern pike numbers go down.  An occasional walleye can also be found in Pepin Lake.  Although walleye stocking was discontinued because the lake is better suited to northern pike and panfish, fish are thought to migrate into the lake from the Swan River.      Pepin's fertile water and connection to the river provides for a diverse roughfish community including black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  White suckers were the most numerous of the roughfish species and ranged in size from 7 inches up to 21 inches.  The smaller suckers could provide an important food source for the larger northern pike in the lake.  Carp have been observed in the shoal waters of Pepin although none were caught during the survey.    Water quality in Pepin Lake affects the recreational value of the lake and make-up of the fish community.  Good lakeshore and agricultural practices in the watershed are encouraged to improve water quality in the lake.  Selective harvest is also encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and voluntarily limiting harvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Pepin Lake is a small lake on the west side of the City of Swanville.  The access is located in the city park along with a fishing pier.  The local sportsmen club maintains the lake access and also supplied the fish pier to provide those without boats an angling opportunity.  A broad connection to the Swan River allows fish migration when the stream is not blocked by beaver dams.   A fringe of cattail surrounds much of the lake.  Muskgrass was the most abundant submergent species in the shallow water while coontail was abundant in the deeper water out to a depth of 16 feet.  Marl was the most common substrate around the lake. <br> \n       Pepin Lake does not have the fish species diversity that most lakes in the area have.  Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the lake survey and abundance appeared to be normal when compared to similar type lakes.   Average size recorded in the survey was 2.5 pounds, but fish over 36 inches have been documented in past surveys.  Anglers willing to put the time and effort in, have the opportunity to catch walleye.  A single 27-inch walleye was caught in the lake survey indicating low numbers of the species. <br> \n       The lake was known for its bluegill fishery in the past.  Recently, anglers reported an abundance of small bluegill and black crappie.  Trap net catches of both species showed the same results.  While most of the bluegill caught in the survey were less than six inches in length, there were some fish over eight inches measured.  The black crappie catch was also dominated by smaller fish mostly under eight inches in length.  The lake does produce an occasional larger crappie for anglers lucky or skilled enough to find them.  Another panfish species in the survey was pumpkinseed sunfish.  Most of the pumpkinseed caught in the survey, however, were too small to be of interest to anglers. <br> \n       Pepin Lake does not appear to have an abundant largemouth bass population, but quality may make up for quantity.   Anglers can find a wide range of sizes including fish up to 20 inches.  Yellow perch abundance continues to be low.  Perch can be an important food species for gamefish although other species such as white sucker, which were abundant, may provide an alternate food source in the lake.   Other species in the rough fish community include bowfin or dogfish, common carp, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n       The lake survey was conducted in mid-June and water clarity at that time was good.   The lush muskgrass beds and marl bottom are not the most desirable for swimming beach sites.  Filamentous algae was also common in the shallow water.   Selective harvest is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and voluntarily limiting harvest of larger panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Boating or canoeing was the more common form of recreation on the lake.   Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded to carefully clean their boats and trailers before moving between lakes to prevent the spread of exotic species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An electrofishing survey was conducted on Pepin Lake in May 2022. Species targeted included Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie. Other species observed but not netted included White Sucker, Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, all three species of bullheads, Yellow Perch, and Golden Shiners. No Walleye, Northern Pike or Common Carp were seen.  <br> \n <br> \nPepin Lake is a small, 41-acre lake on the west side of the City of Swanville. The local sportsman's club maintains a boat access and a fishing pier located on the northeast side of the lake. There is a broad connection to the Swan River which allows fish migration to and from the lake. Most of the lake is fringed by cattail and there is minimal shoreline residential development.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are abundant in Pepin Lake but their average size is small (8.4 inches); about 75 percent of the sample was comprised of fish 8.0-8.9 inches. The largest crappie sampled was 11.4 inches. A total of 128 Bluegills were caught and measured, average size was 6.3 inches and maximum length was 8.1 inches. Thirty-four Largemouth Bass were netted and average size was 11.6 inches. One 18.6-inch fish was caught. About 25 percent of the population measures 15 inches or greater. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, our management plan for Pepin Lake is to maintain Bluegills and crappies so that good numbers of fish exceeding seven and nine inches are available for anglers. We classify Pepin as a panfish-type lake, we do not manage it for Walleyes. However, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in the past, most recently in 2010 under a private permit issued to the Swanville Sportsman's Club.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pepin Lake is a small, 41-acre lake located next to the town of Swanville. It has a public access/boat ramp on the east side of the lake. There is also a public fishing pier that is popular with shore anglers. The lake has a connection to the Swan River which can influence fish species diversity. Dense chara (muskgrass) and cattail rim the lake's perimeter, beyond which drops off abruptly to deeper water.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey that included three gill nets was completed June 26-27, 2023. Trap nets were not used. The last standard survey completed was in 2010. Northern Pike and White sucker were by far the most common species caught. The pike catch rate was 11.0 fish/gill net, higher than in 2010 and 2003 which were 6.3 and 5.7 fish/gill net, respectively. Lengths in this survey ranged from 15.9-31.3 inches. Twelve percent of the sample was 24 inches or more. Survey infrequency and high variability limit useful comparisons to past data. White Sucker CPE was 9.0 fish/gill net, mean length was 17.1 inches. Other  <br> \nspecies captured included Black Bullhead (1), Black Crappie (2), Bluegill (2), Bowfin (1) and Yellow Perch (3). Pepin Lake is not managed for Walleye, however, private stocking is permitted not to exceed every other year intervals.  <br> \n</p>",
