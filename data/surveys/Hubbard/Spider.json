The present walleye abundance is comparable to similar lakes in the Park Rapids area (e.g. BelleTaine, Little Sand).  Walleye up to 28 inches were sampled during the 1993 survey, and the average weight was 2.1 pounds.  Natural reproduction accounted for 52% of the sampled walleyes.   Walleye fingerling stocking has been discontinued in Spider Lake because it is better suited for largemouth bass and panfish.  Northern pike abundance is also comparable to similar lakes; however, the size is small.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds, and only 5% of the northern pike sampled were larger than 28 inches.  Largemouth bass have not been efficiently sampled with standard survey nets; however, a good largemouth bass population is believed to be present.  Bluegill and black crappie fishing are popular on Spider Lake.  Black crappie abundance is high with good numbers of fish over 10 inches sampled.  Bluegill abundance is low compared to similar lakes, and their size structure is smaller than black crappies.  However, the bluegill fishery remains popular and productive.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 96 feet with 74 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.Fish taken by test nets in numbers which exceeded the statewide median catch per set were yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and bluegill.  The average size of all these species was small.  Although muskellunge have been stocked since 1954, none were taken by the test nets.Shoreline development includes two resorts with ten cabins and 15 boats, plus a boat rental with six boats.  There are also 27 private cottages and 25 boats.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were 12 fish houses located on the lake.Fish Stocking:Year    Species   Size      Amount1949    Black bass         fingerlins       13,5001954    Muskellunge        fingerlings 9121955    Muskellunge        fingerlings 2401959    Muskellunge        fingerlings        1,3021962    Muskellunge        fry       50,0001962    Muskellunge        yearlings  18</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located three miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Like it's name Spider Lake is irregularly shaped with two deep basins and several shallow bays.  Spider Lake has a surface area of 544 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  However, there is lots of shallow water with 75% of the lake area 15 feet or less in depth.  There is abundant aquatic vegetation growth in these shallow water areas.  Numerous bulrush stands and water lily beds are found providing excellent habitat for species such as black crappie and largemouth bass.  The west bay can become almost solid with water lilies and water shield during the summer months.  There is a public access located on the north end of the lake.  Spider Lake is a popular lake for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike fishing.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Spider Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: West Crooked, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, and Ojibway.Demand for larger fish by Minnesota's anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  These regulations are part of an experiment to increase the numbers of large fish in Minnesota's lakes.  Spider Lake was chosen for an experimental regulation for black crappie based on its present and past black crappie population and its estimated capacity to produce large black crappie.  Starting in March of 1997, all black crappie less than 10 inches in length must be immediately returned to the water(10 inch minimum length limit).  Spring trapnetting was conducted from 1994 to 1996 to gather pre-regulation data on the black crappie population.  Moderate abundance of black crappie was found with good average size (9.5 inches).  Larger black crappie were found with fish over 14 inches sampled.  Future spring trapnetting as well as angler creel surveys in 2003 and 2004 are planned.  Objectives of the 10 inch minimum size regulation are to maintain 75% of the pre-regulation harvest and to maintain or improve black crappie growth rates in fish less than 10 inches.  Size structure and catch rates of larger black crappie should increase.  Evaluation of this experimental regulation will be completed by March 1, 2005.Spider Lake provides a good largemouth bass fishery, probably known more for large fish than for numbers of bass.  Spring electrofishing was conducted in 1998 and moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled (31.7 bass/hour).  Over 30% of the sample was greater than 15 inches.  Spring electrofishing from 1994 to 1996 had similar results.Bluegill abundance was low, just within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  While bluegill numbers were down from past surveys, size was large with an average length of 7.6 inches.  Pumpkinseed abundance was within the \"normal range\" for this lake class, and like bluegill average size was large (6.8 inches).Northern pike abundance was just within the \"normal range\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Size of northern pike  was poor,  with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.0 pounds, respectively.  Northern pike growth rates were very slow.  Silver pike (color phase of a northern pike) are found in low numbers in Spider Lake.  Silver pike are sometimes misidentified as muskellunge.  Spider Lake was stocked with muskellunge from 1954 to 1979, but stocking was discontinued because a fishable population was never established.  Spider Lake is still classified as a designated muskellunge lake and is closed to winter dark house spearing.Walleye abundance was low (1.3/net), below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  With the exception of 1993 (3.4/net), historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been similar.  Spider Lake was stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years from 1981 to 1991.  Walleye stocking was discontinued after 1991 when little or any increase in walleye abundance was observed.  The present walleye population in Spider Lake is maintained through natural reproduction, as twelve of the thirteen walleye sampled were from non-stocked years. Other species sampled include rock bass, yellow perch, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Spider Lake  and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 8 and 10, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one site was sampled with a 50-foot seine and nine sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at four sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 14 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Black Crappie, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on June 10, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Spider Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Spider Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located three miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Like it's name, Spider Lake is irregularly shaped with two deep basins and several shallow bays.  Spider Lake has a surface area of 544 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  However, there is lots of shallow water with 75% of the lake area 15 feet or less in depth.  There is abundant aquatic vegetation growth in these shallow water areas.  Numerous hardstem bulrush stands and water lily beds are found providing excellent habitat for such species as black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The west bay can become almost solid with water lilies and water shield during the summer months.  There is a public access located on the north end of the lake.  Spider Lake provides angling opportunities for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Spider Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include West Crooked, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, and Ojibway.Demand for larger fish by Minnesota's anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  These regulations are part of an experiment to increase the numbers of large fish in Minnesota's lakes.  Spider Lake was chosen for an experimental regulation for black crappie based on it's present and past black crappie population and it's estimated capacity to produce larger black crappie.  Starting in March of 1997, all black crappie less than 10.0 inches in length must be immediately returned to the water (10.0 inch minimum length limit).  Special spring trapnetting and a angler creel survey in 2002 will help with the evaluation of this regulation.  Evaluation of this experimental regulation will be completed by March 1, 2005.Spider Lakes supports a good largemouth bass fishery, probably known more for large fish than for numbers of bass. Special spring electrofishing has been conducted in past years and has shown good numbers and sizes of large bass.Spider Lake is know for providing good bluegill fishing.  Bluegill numbers in Spider Lake have fluctuated but their abundance has always remained within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Good numbers of 7.0 inch bluegill were sampled during the surveys.Northern pike abundance was up in Spider Lake.  The gillnet catch rate of 9.0 pike/net was just above the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys have generally been within the \"typical\" range.  While larger pike are present in Spider, the population is dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and  weight of 22.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The northern pike in Spider have very slow growth rates.  Three silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, were sampled during the survey.  A small walleye population is present in Spider Lake.  Walleye abundance (0.9 walleye/gillnet) was below the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Sampled walleye ranged from 9.5 to 22.8 inches.  The walleye population in Spider Lake is being maintained by natural reproduction as walleye have not been stocked into the lake  since 1991.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and brown bullhead.  Low numbers of yellow bullhead, black bullhead, and hybrid sunfish were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located three miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Like it's name, Spider Lake is irregularly shaped with two deep basins and several shallow bays.  Spider Lake has a surface area of 544 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  However, there is lots of shallower water with 75% of the lake area 15 feet or less in depth.  There is abundant aquatic vegetation growth in these shallow areas.  Numerous hardstem bulrush stands and water lily beds are found providing excellent habitat for such species as black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The west bay can become almost solid with water lilies and water shield during the summer months.  There is a public access located on the north end of the lake.  Spider Lake provides angling opportunities for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Spider Lake is in class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include West Crooked, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, and Ojibway.Demand for larger fish by Minnesota's anglers has led to the development of restrictive harvest regulations on certain lakes.  Spider Lake was chosen for a length limit regulation based on its estimated capacity to produce larger black crappie.  Starting in March of 1997, all black crappie less than 10.0 inches in length must be immediately returned to the water (10.0 inch minimum length limit).  During the fall of 2004 a special input meeting was held to gather input about this regulation.  A decision was made to continue this regulation based on public comment, angler creel surveys, and test netting data.  The regulation appears to be working in Spider; however, its effectiveness may be limited by high angler non-compliance with the 10.0-inch minimum size limit.Spider Lake supports a good largemouth bass fishery, probably known more for size than for numbers of bass.  Special spring electrofishing has been conducted in past years and has shown good numbers and sizes of bass.Spider Lake is known for providing good bluegill fishing.  Bluegill numbers in Spider Lake have fluctuated but their abundance has always remained within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range. Northern pike abundance (7.2 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  While larger pike are present in Spider, small, \"hammer handle\" pike dominates the population.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The northern pike in Spider Lake have very slow growth rates.  Silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, have been sampled in past surveys.Walleye are found in low numbers in Spider Lake.  Walleye abundance (0.7 walleye/gillnet) was below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.5 to 30.0 inches.  Walleye have not been stocked into Spider Lake since 1991.  The walleye population in Spider is being maintained by limited and sporadic natural reproduction. Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  White sucker, black bullhead, and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located three miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Like its name, Spider Lake is irregularly shaped with two deep basin and several shallow bays.  Spider has a surface area of 544 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  However, there is lots of shallower water with 75% of the lake area 15 feet or less in depth.  There is abundant aquatic vegetation growth in these shallow areas.  Numerous hardstem bulrush stands and water lily beds are found providing excellent habitat for such species as black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The west bay can become almost solid with water lilies and water shield during the summer months.  There is a public access located on the north end of the lake.  Spider provides angling opportunities for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Spider Lake is in class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include West Crooked, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, and Ojibway. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Spider.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers should be aware that all black crappie less than 10.0 inches in length must be returned to the water (10.0 inch minimum length limit).  Present and past surveys have shown the bluegill population to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nSpider Lake supports a good largemouth bass fishery, probably known more for size than numbers of bass.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (68 bass/hour) during the spring electrofishing survey, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (6.2 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  While larger northern pike are present in Spider, small, \"hammer handle\" pike dominate the population.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 inches, with pike measured up to 34.8 inches.  The northern pike in Spider have slow growth rates.  Silver pike, a color phase of northern pike, have been sampled in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are found in low numbers in Spider.  Walleye abundance (0.1 walleye/gillnet) was well below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye have not been stocked into Spider since 1991.  The walleye population in Spider is being maintained by limited and sporadic natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker, yellow bullhead, and rock bass.

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 3 miles north of Nevis.  Spider Lake has a surface area of 569.5 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  The majority of Spider Lake is relatively shallow lake with over 70% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  An earthen public access is located on the northeast end of the lake off of Washboard Road.  The water clarity of 31.5 in 2014 was excellent.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Spider is in Lake Class 25.  Class 25 lakes are very irregularly shaped, very deep, with hard and clear water.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Straight and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nSpider Lake provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  There is a special regulation that has been in place on Spider Lake since 1997, requiring Black Crappies to be 10 inches or longer before they can be kept.  Black Crappie numbers have fluctuated in the past, but the 2014 catch rates were the highest recorded.  The average length was 7.4 inches, and there are a few fish over 10 inches to meet the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers. Fish were sampled from 6.3 to 18.9 inches, with an average length of 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegills in Spider Lake provide a great angling opportunity.  Bluegills were sampled in normal numbers and had an average length of 6 inches, with fish sampled up to 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was normal, but the size was up from past surveys of Spider Lake.  The average Northern Pike length was 20.4 inches, with the largest of 37.1 inches. <br> \nYellow Perch numbers are down and generally small for anglers with an average length of 6.8 inches and the lengths ranged from 5.5 - 9.2 inches.  These Yellow Perch provide forage for the Walleye and Northern Pike in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpider Lake is not managed for Walleyes, but a limited number of Walleye are sampled most years.  Very few were sampled in 2014, but average size was very good at 22.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Spider. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is located three miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Like its name, Spider is irregularly shaped with two deep basins and several shallow bays.  Spider Lake has a surface area of 570 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  There are several shallow bays, with 71% of the lake area 15 feet or less in depth.  There is abundant aquatic vegetation growth in these shallow areas.  Numerous hardstem bulrush stands and water lily beds are found, providing excellent habitat for species such as Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass.  There is a state owned public access located on the north end of the lake.  Spider Lake provides angling opportunities for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Spider Lake is in class 25.  Class 25 lakes are irregularly shaped, have deep basins, and have hard water with good water clarity. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Spider.  Present and past surveys have shown the Panfish population in Spider to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers should be aware that all Black Crappie less than 10.0 inches must be returned to the water (10 inch minimum length limit).  Anglers will find good numbers of Black Crappie in the 10-12 inch size range and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 to 8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nSpider Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population.  Good numbers and sizes of Largemouth Bass were sampled during spring electrofishing sampling when compared to other area lakes.  Sampled Largemouth Bass had an average length of 11.8 inches with fish measured up to 18.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  While larger Northern Pike are present in Spider, small pike dominate the population.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 30.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include moderate numbers of Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Spider.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Spider Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 3, 2020. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five sites, one of which was a boat assisted seine, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed dominated the trap net catch numbers, but only comprised approximately 28% of total trap net biomass. Of the Bluegills sampled, 21% were between 5 and 7 inches, 46% were over 7 inches and 15% of Bluegills sampled were over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with gill net data from a June 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Spider Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
