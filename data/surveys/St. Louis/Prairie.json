                "narrative": "<p>Prairie is a large, developed, moderately hard water lake located 9 miles south of Floodwood, MN.  A diverse fish community exists in the lake and reflects the river connection to the Mississippi watershed.  Walleye fry were stocked every three years with the most recent assessment in 1995.     The 1995 walleye catch rate, 4.0 per gillnet, was remarkably similar to one of the first investigations done in 1952 when 3.7 walleye per gillnet were sampled.  While the catch rate was stable and within the normal range for this type of lake, the size structure (percentage of fish over 15 inches) has steadily improved.  Average length in the 1995 assessment was 12.4 inches with a maximum length of 23.0 inches.  Prairie Lake walleyes are amoung the slowest growing walleye populations found in the Duluth area.     Northern pike have shown a similar stability in assessment catch rates over the sampling history although their abundance was low when compared to other lakes that have similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Most pike tended to be small, average length was 19.6 inches, with only a few fish over 25 inches.     Tullibee were present in average numbers and showed the same stability in assessment catch rates.  Prairie Lake remains open for sport netting of tullibee and is one of the few lakes within the Duluth area that maintain a population of this species.     The 1995 black crappie catch rate, 2.8 per trapnet, was similar to the 1952 catch rate of 2.3 and within the average catch range for this type of lake.  Size structure (fish > 8.0 inches) was nearly identical (1995, 1952) although it has shown considerable, but expected, variation when all sampling years were examined.     Prairie Lake also has several different species that an angler might catch in limited numbers.</p>",

Walleye are the primary management species for Prairie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked every other year into Prairie Lake.  Walleye abundance of 2.4 per gillnet lift was up from the 2015 survey and is average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Walleye average length was 16.0 inches.  All year-classes from 2014 to 2021 were represented except 2017 and 41% percent of aged Walleye corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.9 per gillnet lift is average when compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 24.8 inches and growth is average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes. All year-classes from 2017 to 2021 were represented.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 8 inches with fish up to 11.6 inches sampled.  Anglers should expect decent catches of Black Crappie in the next couple years as several strong year-classes will be entering the creel.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was average at 4.8 per trapnet lift and average length was 5.6 inches with some up to 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance for the assessment conducted during the spring of 2023 was 0.75 per hour of on-time. The one observed and measured Largemouth Bass was 15.5 inches in length.  Zero were caught in gillnets or trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 12.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Prairie is a 848 acre lake with 272 (32%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  The lake is located seven miles north of Cromwell, MN and has a DNR administered, concrete, back-in access located off State Highway #73.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years since 1998 and every third year from 1986 through 1998.  Northern pike have been managed since 2003 with a minimum length for harvest of 30 inches.     Walleye abundance of 1.7 per lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance, which had increased slightly compared to the 2000 investigation (1.6), has declined from the 1990 and 1995 catch rates of 5.3 and 4.0 per gillnet lift.  Mean length of 13.3 inches was average.  Growth rates had improved considerably since 2000 but were still slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Of the walleye aged from the 2005 investigation, 70% were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  Similarly, 63% of walleye aged in 2000 were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  A spring electrofishing assessment of spawning walleye was conducted in 2005.  A total of 151 walleye were captured for a catch rate of 83.8 per hour.  Mean length was 13.8 inches and growth rates were slow.  Age analysis revealed strong 2000 and 2001 year-classes and all year-classes from 1997 through 2004 represented.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2005.  No largemouth bass were sampled during this investigation.  However, one young-of-the-year largemouth bass was documented from shoreline seining during the summer investigation.     Northern pike abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The percentage of northern pike longer than 21 inches had declined from 55 in 2000 to 48 in 2005.  However, the percentage of northerns longer than 28 inches had increased from 0 in 1995 to 5 and 19 in 2000 and 2005.  Growth rates had improved from average to fast from 1995 to 2005 compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2002 year-class and five year-classes represented from 1998 through 2003.     Yellow perch abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 6.4 inches was small and growth was average.  Age analysis revealed strong 2002 and 2003 year-classes and no fish older than age five.     Tullibee abundance of 2.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Tullibee mean length was 12.4 inches and growth rates had declined slightly since 1995.  Age analysis revealed fairly steady recruitment from 1997 through 2002.     Black crappie abundance of 1.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 9.5 inches was large and growth was average.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and all year-classes from 1999 through 2003 represented.     Bluegill abundance of 1.8 per lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.1 inches was large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and all year-classes from 1999 through 2003 represented.     Other fish species sampled include blacknose shiner, bowfin, brown bullhead, Iowa darter, logperch, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker and yellow bullhead.     In summary, although walleye catch rates have been relatively low from the last two investigations, fry stocking continues to provide significant contributions to the population.  It also appears that the northern pike regulation may initially be resulting in larger pike in the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Prairie is an 848 acre lake with 272 (32%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 47 feet. The lake is located seven miles north of Cromwell, MN and has a DNR administered, concrete, back-in access located off State Highway #73. Walleye fry have been stocked in even years since 1998 and every third year from 1986 through 1998. Northern pike have been managed since 2003 with a minimum length for harvest of 30 inches.  Prairie Lake was last surveyed in 2005.  Prairie Lake was assessed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the walleye stocking program and the northern pike 30 inch minimum size limit regulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.6 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (1.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 12.1 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2009 were represented except 2001 and 2003-2005.  Forty-six percent of walleye aged were from the 2006 year-class.  Seventy-one percent of walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (1.8) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the northern pike CPUE has been relatively low in Prairie and has ranged from 1.0 (1975) to 2.2 (2010).  Northern pike average length was 24.6 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The percentage of northern pike longer than 28 inches has increased from 0 in 1995 to 5 in 2000 and to 19 in 2005 and 2010.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (1.3) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented except 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 2.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (1.8) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.8 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2008 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) gillnet CPUE of 1.0 per lift was down from 2005 (2.3) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Tullibee mean length was 12.7 inches.  Tullibee abundance has been steadily decreasing from 7.4 in 1995 to 5.8 in 2000 to 2.3 in 2005 to 1.0 in 2010.  Average length at age IV was 10.3 inches.  Recruitment was sporadic, with four year-classes present from 2003 through 2009.   Tullibee population dynamics in Prairie Lake are exhibiting characteristics of a stressed population.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 6.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (6.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.1 inches.  Only 2% of the perch captured were greater than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used to detect if an emerging largemouth bass population was present.  Anecdotal reports from anglers have indicated that largemouth bass are becoming established in Prairie Lake.  No largemouth bass were captured by electrofishing.  However, one 4.8 inch yearling largemouth bass was caught in a trapnet.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, pumpkinseed, shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nPrairie Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Prairie Lake during the summer of 2015 to evaluate and update information about fish populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the walleye stocking program and the northern pike 30 inch minimum size limit regulation.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the primary management species for Prairie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked every other year into Prairie Lake.  Walleye abundance of 1.6 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Walleye average length was 15.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Fifty-seven percent of Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 30 inch minimum Northern Pike special angling regulation was implemented in 2003.  Northern Pike abundance of 2.9 per gillnet lift was the highest on record for Prairie Lake dating back to 1952.  Average size was 24 inches and 3.4 pounds.  When evaluating the Northern Pike size structure prior to and after the regulation was implemented, size structure has increased with more Northern Pike exceeding 30 inches available to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 12.2 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  The catch rate observed in 2015 represents a historic high for Black Crappie in Prairie Lake.  Average length was 8 inches with fish up to 10.1 inches sampled.  Angler should expect good catches of Black Crappie in the next couple years as several strong year-classes will be entering the creel.  Bluegill abundance was average at 3.3 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 6.4 inches but only 8% exceeded 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used to determine if an emerging Largemouth Bass population was evident.  Anecdotal reports from anglers have indicated that Largemouth Bass are becoming established in Prairie Lake, and one 4.8 inch yearling Largemouth Bass was captured in a trapnet during the 2010 survey.  Zero Largemouth Bass were captured while electrofishing but several young-of-the-year specimens were captured in 2015 while seining during another assessment.   <br> \n</p>",
