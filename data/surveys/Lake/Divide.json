The negative development since the 1989 assessment netting was the sampling of 5 Muskellunge, 1 (19 inch) Walleye and 1 Rock Bass. Muskellunge ranged from 24 to 30 inches, and averaged nearly 5.0 pounds each. Muskellunge ages ranged from 3 to 6 years. All of these species are present in nearby Dumbbell Lake and may have been introduced from there by anglers.</p>",

Trout populations have been difficult to assess in standard sampling gear and this was the case again in 2006.

Located 4.9 miles east of Isabella, MN on USFS Rd #172 (Dumbbell Lake Road), there are three sites at the USFS campground (fee) with drinking water, outhouse and garbage pickup and a carry-down access to the lake.  A second access has a parking area for two or three vehicles, on the north shore of the lake, then a 50 foot walk down hill to the lake.  Designated Stream Trout Lake signs are posted near each of the accesses. <br> \n <br> \nDivide Lake is one of the more popular managed stream trout lakes in the Finland Management Area and gets moderate fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons. Splake fingerlings are stocked annually in the fall and rainbow trout yearlings are stocked annually in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nSplake numbers in Divide Lake were above average for the Finland Area and similar to catches in previous investigations.  The average length of the catch was 10.3 inches (0.6 pound); the largest splake sampled was 17.8 inches (2.6 pounds).  Slightly more than 50% of the fish sampled in 2011 were yearling splake, stocked as fingerlings in the fall of 2010, which brought down the average size of the fish in this report. <br> \n <br> \nThe rainbow trout sample in 2011was slightly below management goals set for Divide Lake.  The average length of rainbow trout in the catch was 9.4 inches (0.3 pound), the largest rainbow trout 12.6 inches (0.75 pound).  More than 50% of the rainbow trout sampled were yearlings stocked in the spring of 2011, which brought down the average size of the fish in this report.   Rainbow trout populations are difficult to assess with standard sampling gear, many different methods have been tried to attain a larger sample without much success.  Angling for rainbow trout is often better for the public in Divide Lake than population assessment catch rates would indicate. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Divide Lake is a designated trout lake located 4.7 miles east of Isabella off the Wanless Road (FR 172).  It has an area of 61 acres and a maximum depth of 22 feet.  There is a United States Forest Service (USFS) fee campground with three sites on the north side of the lake with a carry-down access and bench for shore fishing.  There is also a short (20 yard) carry-down access directly from the Wanless Road with a bench that provides shore-fishing opportunities.  There are additional shore fishing opportunities along the Wanless Road and there is a USFS trail running around the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nDivide Lake is intensively managed as a stream trout lake with 2,000 yearling Rainbow Trout and 3,000 fingerling Splake stocked annually.  The purpose of this survey was to monitor the populations of Rainbow Trout and Splake in Divide Lake.  The catch rate of Rainbow Trout was below average when compared to similar area lakes with just five fish captured.  These fish averaged 11 inches and about a half a pound, with the largest Rainbow Trout only measuring 12 inches.  Of the Rainbow Trout sampled, three were age-1 fish stocked in May of 2017 as yearlings and two were age-2 fish that were stocked in May of 2016 as yearlings.  The sample size was too small to make any growth comparisons.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Splake catch rate on Divide Lake was well above average when compared to other lakes in the area.  On average the Splake that were sampled measured just under 13 inches with fish as long as 21 inches sampled.  The average weight of these fish was just under a pound.  Splake ranged from age-1 to age-4.  Fish stocked in 2015 (age-2) made up 57 percent of the catch and measured on average 13 inches at the time of capture.  The growth rate of Splake in Divide Lake was fast when compared to other area Splake populations. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Brook Stickleback, and Fathead Minnow.  A single White Sucker was also sampled, which is not desirable since this species competes with stocked trout for resources.  A few individual White Suckers have been sampled in previous surveys, suggesting the population has remained at a low level and is not likely to significantly impact trout stocking success. <br> \n <br> \nDivide Lake supports a vibrant stream trout fishery.  Access to the lake is good with opportunities to fish from shore or from a portable boat or canoe.  Anglers must follow all regulations for designated trout lakes.  The Rainbow Trout catch was lower than hoped for this survey, but Rainbow Trout populations in this part of the state are often underrepresented with netting surveys.  The Splake population was doing very well in Divide Lake at the time of the survey and is worth checking out.  <br> \n</p>",

Divide Lake is one of the more popular managed stream trout lakes in the Finland Management Area and gets moderate fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons.  Splake fingerlings are stocked annually in the fall and Rainbow Trout yearlings are stocked annually in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of this investigation was to determine the availability of suitable thermal and dissolved oxygen habitat within Divide Lake.  Three continuous temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest point in the lake from June 4 to October 19, 2015.  The loggers were suspended at depths of six, 12, and 18 feet. The results of this investigation indicated that water temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen could become limiting factors to trout in Divide Lake if air temperatures were to increase.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to ensure the suitability of Divide Lake for Splake and Rainbow Trout.  <br> \n</p>",

A survey was completed in 2022 to monitor the amount of cool, well oxygenated habitat available for trout during the summer.

In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicate summer dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures likely caused stress to the trout in Divide Lake in 2022. Similar surveys completed since 2015 suggest periods of stress are common in summer months, but the lake currently maintains suitable habitat for stream trout throughout the open water season.

The maximum depth is 22 feet and it has clear water.  The lake is located 4.5 miles east of Isabella, MN along USFS Rd. 172 (Wanless Road).  Divide Lake is one of the more popular managed stream trout lakes in the Finland Management Area and gets moderate fishing pressure in the summer and winter angling seasons.  Shoreline angling is available near the access, forest service campground, and along the road.  Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.  Rainbow Trout yearlings and Splake fingerlings are stocked annually in Divide Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, three automatic temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 6, 12, and 18 feet from May 18 to October 25, 2017.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location. <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that during the summer of 2017, Divide Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.  However, water temperatures were within the levels of \"stress\" from July 22 to August 21 throughout the water column and could be pushed to \"lethal\" levels if recent climate trends continue to warm in Northeastern Minnesota.  Water temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen could become limiting factors in Divide Lake in the future.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to check the suitability of Divide Lake for trout stocking. <br> \n</p>",

There are two carry down access trails for anglers to use; one at the Divide Lake Campground and the other located on Forest Service 172 (Wanless Road) along the north shore of the lake with room for 2 or 3 vehicles to park. There are also several small user made trails along the Wanless Road where anglers fish from shore. The Forest Service also maintains a hiking trail around the lake and one remote campsite. Divide Lake is a designated stream trout lake that is stocked with yearling Rainbow Trout each spring and fingerling Splake each fall. Additional yearling Rainbow Trout have been stocked annually in October since 2021 to provide more fish for the winter fishery. <br> \n <br> \nA fair number of Rainbow Trout were sampled in 2022. The average size was about 13 inches long and 0.8 pounds with the largest fish measuring 16.3 inches. Survey results indicate the current stocking plan is providing good opportunities for anglers to catch 11 to 16 inch Rainbow Trout with some fish surviving from year to year.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Splake gill net catch was 36/lift with an average weight of 0.55 pounds. The catch was between 7.2 and 18.7 inches long with more than one third greater than 14 inches. These results suggest the lake currently supports a good population of Splake that survive for multiple years and provide opportunities for angler harvest of fish in the 11 to 18 inch range. <br> \n</p>",
