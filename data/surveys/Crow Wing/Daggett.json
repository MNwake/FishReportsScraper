Yellow bullhead, bluegill and walleye sizes were small.  Northern pike showed better than average growth. The fish population levels in numbers and average size of fish as determine from the range of median values for appropriate types of gear are indicated in the following table.  High population levels are indicated by catch rates above the third quartile and low population levels by catch rates below the first quartile.  Catch rates falling between the first and third quartiles are indicative of average, or normal numbers for a particular species. Average size of fish for a particular species or mean weight per individual fish are listed as small, average and large.  Average size is indicated by mean weight falling between the first and third quartile.  Small size is indicated by mean weight below the first quartile and large size by mean weight above the third quartile.</p>",

Maximum depth is 23 feet and water clarity is fair with the color being a medium green.  The lake being part of the Whitefish chain is highly developed with heavy recreational boat activity of various use types ranging from boating anglers to much jet ski activity.  At times the channel next to Cross Lake has boats backing up waiting their turn to go under the bridge.In the year 2000 northern pike catch rates hit an all time high.  Sizes ranged from 13.5 to 31.7 inches with the average size being about 21.0 inches long.  Growth rate was good.  Walleye numbers were normal for this lake type but numbers present offer a limited fishery with occasional fish being caught.  The average size was 15.0 inches and about 1.1 pounds.  Bluegill numbers were very high with sizes ranging from 5.6 to 8.3 inches with an average size of 5.6 inches.  Largemouth bass were present in moderate numbers with various sizes observed and growth rate normal.</p>",

Daggett reaches depths of 23', with 58% 15' deep or less. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked into Daggett, but are stocked annually as fry and every other year as fingerlings into the Whitefish Chain.  Walleyes can move through the chain and into Daggett.  The gill net catch of 1.3/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 21.9\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 19.5/gill net.  Average length was 20.5\", with 13% measuring at least 24\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 0.7/net.  Average length was 12.2\".  Largemouth bass electrofishing was done in Daggett, along with various stations across the Whitefish Chain of Lakes, resulting in a combined catch rate of 68.8/hr run-time.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in low numbers in both gill nets (0.7/net) and trap nets (0.7/net).  Average length was 7.5\" in gill nets and 7.9\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 40% measured at least 8\".  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers in trap nets at 22.4/net.  Average length was 5.6\", with 29% measuring at least 7\" in length.  Yellow perch are an important forage species, and were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 8.5/net.  Average length was 5.8\", with no perch over 8\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nDaggett Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

White sucker, rock bass, bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate a normal or average population abundance with catch rates falling between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd area median for similar lake types. Bowfin, white sucker and black crappie abundance is low with net catches below the first quartile of the area median. Northern cisco and lake whitefish populations showed no change with numbers remaining low. The northern pike population has increased dramatically over the past two surveys. The length-frequency distribution is good with size ranging from 15.0 to 26.9 inches long. The median size was 20.9 inches long and weighed 2.2 lbs. Year classes 2-5 were present in the nets with annulus 1 fish showing fast growth rate and the other annuli indicating average growth rate when compared to statewide averages. The bluegill net catch was very high with size small and the growth rate was very slow. The largemouth bass and black crappies that were aged indicated a good growth rate. The yellow perch population remained low with no change in abundance from the 1955 and 1973 surveys growth rates at all annulus was slow. The walleye population, as in past surveys, remained moderate. The length-frequency was 8.0-27.9 inches long. The median size was 16.6 inches long the weighed 1.5 lbs. Growth rate at all annuli was normal or average when compared to the statewide averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted in Daggett Lake beginning on June 28, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and one sampling station had conditions that prevented the use of seines. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including 10 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) as well as two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Daggett Lake based on this survey is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Daggett Lake is part of the 14,000 acre Whitefish chain of lakes in northern Crow Wing County.  At 225 acres, Daggett is one of the smaller lakes in the Whitefish chain.  Access is from Cross Lake via a channel into Daggett.  Boating activity can be high with over 200 cabins on Daggett and over 100 on nearby Little Pine Lake.A population survey was conducted on Daggett Lake in early July 2005 to monitor the fish community.  Northern pike was the most common fish in the gill net catch while bluegill was the most abundant species in the trap nets.  The northern pike gill net catch of 18 per gill net was high compared to other similar lakes.   Many of the northern pike were around 18 to 22 inches long with some fish from 20 to 32 inches.  Yellow perch were the second most common fish in the gill nets, caught at a moderate rate of 12 per net.  Yellow perch were mostly 5 to 6.5 inches long.  Except for bluegill and yellow bullhead which were caught at 3 per gill net, catch of other species was low, at less than 1 per net, consistent with previous assessments, although yellow bullhead have been more abundant in previous surveys.  The bluegill catch of 57 per trap net was high compared to other similar lakes.  Most bluegills were around 3.5 to 7.5 inches long.  Bluegills have been the most abundant fish in the trap nets since the 1987 survey.  Yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed were the second most common species in the trap net catch, both present in moderate number.  Most yellow bullheads were around 10 to 11 inches long while most pumpkinseeds were around 4.5 to 6.5 inches.  The moderate catch of black crappie (3 per net) was comprised of primarily 8-inch long fish.  Besides hybrid sunfish (5 per trap net), catch of other species was low in the trap nets, at one or less per net.  </p>",
