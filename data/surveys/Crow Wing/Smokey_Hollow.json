                "narrative": "<p>Smokey Hollow is a quiet 114 acre lake located one mile south of Outing in Crow Wing County.  Smokey Hollow reaches depths of 25', with 45% being 15' deep or less.  A small public access is located on the east side of the lake.  Water lilies are fairly common along the lakeshore.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey sampled largemouth bass at a rate of 111.4/hr run time indicating a high bass population.  Average length was 12.2\", with 63% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth bass up to 20.0\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 1.2/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average size was nice at 26.7\" and 4.4 lbs.  Northern pike up to 33.8\" were sampled, with 71% measuring at least 24\" in length.  New northern pike regulations effective March 1st, 2018 include a possession limit of 10 fish.  Only 2 may be over 26\" and all fish between 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the harvest opportunity for pike and improve the fish community composition. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch was average in both trapnets and gillnets at 2.3/gillnet and 5.6/trapnet.  Average length was 7.0\" in gillnets, and 7.8\" in trapnets.  For both gears combined 50% were at least 8\" in length.  The bluegill trapnet catch at 12.6/net was also average when compared to similar lakes.  They ran a little on the small side, with an average length of 5.4\".  Only 13% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Smokey Hollow Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
