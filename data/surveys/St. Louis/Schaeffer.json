                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 1995 Schaeffer Lake survey indicate a fishery suited for smallmouth bass or walleye, but dominated by small northern pike.  Schaeffer Lake water levels fluctuate widely throughout the course of the year characterized by spring high water, fluctuating summer levels dependant on precipitation, and declining winter levels.  Landowners around the lake reported that the rate of water level fluctuations can be very dramatic.  This situation limits abundance of aquatic vegetation and in extreme cases could be the cause of severe winter-kill conditions.  Landowners also reported that smallmouth bass were once present but disappeared after a particularly low winter water level event in the 1970's.  Because currently, there is little escape cover for forage speceies such as black crappie, pumpkinseed and yellow perch, and a abundant-small northern pike population, the fishery appears to be very limited.  The abundant northern pike population could limit the success of any efforts to stock species such as smallmouth bass or walleye and also limit improvement of the panfish fishery.  Increasing escape cover through artificial means could reduce the problem.</p>",
