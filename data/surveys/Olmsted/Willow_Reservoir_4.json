The maximum depth is approximately 20 feet depending on precipitation.  Parking is adjacent to Olmsted County highway 101 which is on the north side of Gamehaven. Access to Gamehaven is down approximately a half mile natural surface trail.  The city of Rochester is developing the area into a regional park with several amenities including an archery range, mountain biking trails, and disc golf course.  Electrofishing was conducted on May 8th, 2023, to assess the panfish and Largemouth Bass populations <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies occasionally comprise a significant portion of the fishery in Gamehaven. This electrofishing survey 96 Black Crappies were sampled for a catch rate of 104.6 fish/hour.  Sizes ranged from 5.5 inches in length to 9.7 inches, with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  The proportional stock density for Black Crappies in the quality size (8-10 inches) was 48.  There were no larger individuals sampled. Black Crappies ranged in age from 3 to 10 years.  Twenty five of the 96 Black Crappies sampled were age-4 and an additional 20 were age-8.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill comprise the majority of the fishery on Gamehaven.  This survey sampled 171 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 186.3 fish/hour.  Bluegills sampled ranged in length from 3.5 inches to 8.7 inches with a mean of 6.1 inches.  Approximately 40 percent of the Bluegill sampled were between 5.5 inches and 6.5 inches in length, with another 16 percent between 7 inches and 7.5 inches.  Bluegills ranged in age from 2 years old to 8 years old with most around 3 years old.  These age-3 fish were between 5.3 inches to 6.3 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass comprise a major part of the fishery on Willow Creek Reservoir 4 (Gamehaven).  There were 66 Largemouth Bass sampled for a catch rate of 91.9 fish/hour.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.5 inches to 22.1 inches with a mean length of 18.7 inches.  The proportion of the population of quality size (12 - 15 inches) was 49, preferred size (25-20 inches) was 48, and memorable size (20-25 inches) was 10.  There were no trophy bass size (? 25 inches) in this survey. Fish under 9.0 inches were age-2and 9.0 inches to 10.0 inches were age-3.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Willow Reservoir 4 is a 39 acre impoundment located just east of Hwy 63 and south of Hwy 52, in southern Rochester.  Access is allowed by the City of Rochester through the Gamehaven Boy Scout Camp located off Olmsted County Road 1, on the east side of the pond.  The pond was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Rochester Flood Control Project.  State DNR Fisheries stocked the impoundment with a variety of gamefish including bluegill, black crappie, large and smallmouth bass, channel catfish, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  As an impoundment on Willow Creek, nutrients from upstream sources are trapped, resulting in heavy algal blooms during the summer months.  Currently, WR4 provides a decent summer and winter fishery for bluegill, black crappie and an occassional largemouth bass.Trapnetting during the 2002 assessment collected bluegill and black crappie at rates of 48.4 and 6.8/net, considered high or above average for lakes similar in type.  Average length measured for bluegill and black crappie was 6.4 and 7.8 inches, respectively.Electrofishing to assess the largemouth bass population was completed in the fall of 2002.  Bass were collected at a rate of 46/hour, and only averaged about 8.8 inches.  However, there were some large fish sampled as well, including three between 18 and 20 inches.Willow Reservoir 4 is a bass/panfish pond with moderate to poor water quality.  The public access is about a 1 mile-long walk through woods on the east side of the pond.  The City of Rochester is responsible for the current condition of the access. If you're willing to make the walk in, decent fishing for bluegill and black crappie can be found.    </p>",
