                "narrative": "<p>Big Chippewa Lake is a 1,175 acre natural basin located northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  Water quality is very good.  Water clarity averaged 11.0 feet throughout the summer months of 2013.  Islands, points, shallow rock bars, and shallow bays form rich habitat complexity and thus, diverse fishing opportunities.  Due to good fishing and high quality resource attributes, recreational uses can be heavy, particularly on weekends and holidays. <br> \n <br> \nBig Chippewa Lake supports a naturally-recruiting walleye population.  Walleye fry are also stocked on a biennial frequency to supplement natural reproduction and sustain a more consistent fishery.   Walleye catches averaged 11.6 walleyes/gillnet in 2013.  This catch rate exceeded expectations for comparable lakes in Minnesota.  Size structure of the walleye catch proved good due to the broad age distribution of the catch.  Average size of the walleye catch was 15.4 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The largest walleye captured during the survey measured 25.0 inches.  Fishing success should remain good into the future with documentation of strong year classes established in 2012 and 2013.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are less abundant.  Sizes at capture ranged from 6.9 to 30.6 inches.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size of pike making up the population sample, is relatively good.  Five percent of pike caught in gillnets exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  Big Chippewa supports a robust largemouth bass fishery.  Bass are abundant.  Most captures were young, but large bass are present.  The largest bass caught measured 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfishes such as bluegill sunfish and black crappie are moderately abundant.  Slow growth of bluegills undermines potential fishing quality.  Age distribution of bluegill catches extended to age 7, but few 8.0 inch and larger bluegills were recorded in the catch.  Average size of bluegills caught was 6.3 inches.  Crappie abundance, size structure of the population, and fishing success can be inconsistent due to annual reproductive variability.  The 2013 crappie population sample was comprised of three age groups.  The oldest captures were only three-years-old, so average size was only 7.4 inches.  Crappies grow much faster than bluegills.  A few of the age-3 fish were already 10.0 inches in length.  Other panfishes recorded in the 2013 catch included rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe next fish community survey is planned for 2017.  In the interim, anglers are encouraged to harvest surplus numbers of 6.0-inch and smaller bluegills, 12.0-inch and smaller bass, and all sizes of rock bass.  Such targetted harvest should reduce abundance and stimulate greater growth.  <br> \n <br> \nA single public access to this large basin is located on the east end of the lake.  The access site is low and under-sized.  Manuvering boat trailers can be challenging on busy weekends. <br> \n <br> \nNotes:  <br> \nSimilar to most deeper lakes in west-central Minnesota, Big Chippewa becomes thermally stratified (non-mixed water) during the  summer.  At time of the August survey, dissolved oxygen levels were too low below 23.0 feet to support game species. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic invasive species (zebra mussels) have been documented in nearby basins in Douglas County.  Please check that all equipment is free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Consult the current fishing regulations handbook for rules and regulations pertaining to the cleaning of equipment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chippewa Lake is managed primarily for walleye with largemouth bass and sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  Walleye abundance has declined in recent years due to poor success of the 1999 and 2000 year classes.  A moderately strong year class was produced in 2001 so walleye abundance will likely increase in the next few years as these fish recruit to the fishery.  Although walleye abundance is down, the size structure of this population is excellent.  Seventy-eight percent of all walleye collected in gill nets exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Walleye grow relatively fast in Chippewa Lake and most fish exceed 14.0 inches after four growing seasons.  This population is supplemented with fry stockings on an alternate year basis and each fall, young-of-the-year walleye are sampled to determine the success of these stocking efforts.  If catch statistics indicate that poor natural reproduction or an unsuccessful fry stocking have occurred then walleye fingerlings are also stocked.Largemouth bass are moderately abundant as indicated by a catch of 39.0 fish per hour of night electrofishing.  These fish averaged 11.8 inches in length and 1.2 pounds in weight with the largest fish being over 20.0 inches.  Twenty-five percent of the fish collected exceeded 15.0 inches in length.Bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch comprise the panfish community.  Anglers targeting these species will find moderate numbers but most individuals are relatively small.  Northern pike are relatively abundant and catches remain above desired levels.  The size structure of this population is poor.  Northern pike averaged 20.1 inches in length and 1.8 pounds in weight.  The largest pike collected in gill nets was 30.4 inches.        </p>",

A very strong, fast growing year class of age 2 walleye corresponds with a 1983 fingerling stocking. However, a strong, fast growing year class of age 5 fish corresponds with a 1980 fry stocking. Northern pike numbers remain low and should remain there in order to benefit future walleye populations. Yellow perch abundance indices have significantly increased since the 1980 survey and should provide suitable forage for walleye. Black crappie indices have increased significantly since the 1980 survey and abundance indices are now well above both state and local medians.</p>",

Gillnet catches averaged 14.6 fish/net which exceeds thenormal range of mean catch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics. Catcheshave historically exceeded the normal range, varying from 15.3 to 23.9 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  Average weight of walleye is approximately 1.4 pounds.  Most  walleye range from12 - 20 inches in total length.  Fry stocking, fingerling stocking, and years of no stocking have allbeen correlated with development of strong year classes.  Consistent natural reproduction has also beendocumented through annual fall electrofishing.   Northern pike abundance is low.  Gillnet catch rateaveraged 1.4 fish/net.  Historical catch rates have also been low, ranging from 1.2 - 3.0 fish/net insurveys dating back to 1972.  Mean weight of fish was approximately 2.1 pounds.  Lengths of fish rangedfrom 18 to 23 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant, however the size structure of the population maylimit the quality of angling opportunities.  Average weight is approximately 0.8 pounds and mean lengthis about 12 inches.  Bluegill are also abundant.  Trapnet catch rate averaged 45.5 fish/net whichexceeds the normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes.  Approximately 50% of the fish are 6inches are greater, however few exceed 8 inches in length.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Chippewa Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSixteen species were collected during this survey, indicating a moderately diverse nearshore fish community.  Four species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and only one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Chippewa Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chippewa Lake is a relatively large, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  Residential development is considered moderate to high, especially around the southern half of the lake.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Secchi disk measurements typically exceed 10 feet throughout summer months.  Consequently, recreational pressure can be heavy, especially during weekend days.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore but parking space can be limited.  A bay on the southwest portion of the lake can be difficult to find but it is accessible via a narrow, shallow waterway through dense cattails.  Aquatic habitats are diverse and include islands, shallow rock bars, protected bays, and dense beds of emergent and submergent vegetation.  These habitats support diverse angling opportunities.  Anglers can also find quality fishing on adjacent lakes that comprise the Upper Chippewa chain of lakes.  These lakes include Devils, Little Chippewa, Whiskey, and Stowes.  Chippewa Lake is connected to Devils and Whiskey lakes via non-navigable waterways. <br> \n <br> \nChippewa Lake is managed for walleye.  Largemouth bass and sunfishes are species of secondary management importance.  Walleye abundance has increased in recent years and is currently above levels expected for this type of lake.  Anglers can expect good numbers of fish in a variety of sizes.  Fish collected in gill nets during the 2009 survey ranged from 7.4 to 27.9 inches in length.  Average size was 12.9 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Smaller average size is due to increased abundance of younger fish.  Night electrofishing surveys are completed each fall to capture young walleye and evaluate year class strength.  These surveys have indicated that three consecutive strong year classes were produced in 2006, 2007, and 2008.  The 2008 year class was exceptionally strong.  Catches will likely increase in the near future as this year class recruits to the fishery.  Good walleye spawning habitat is abundant and natural reproduction sustains this population.  However, walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing results indicated a high-quality largemouth bass fishery.  Abundance was high and size structure was excellent.  Mean and maximum size of electrofishing captures were 13.6 and 17.4 inches in length.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch comprise the panfish community in Chippewa Lake.  With exception of the black crappie population, survey data suggests that anglers targeting these species will find moderate to low numbers with most fish being relatively small.  Perch numbers are especially low.  Black crappie abundance and size structure are relatively good.  Northern pike abundance has decreased in recent years.  Smaller fish dominate this population but large pike are present. <br> \n    <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2009 survey include bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheepshead), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2013. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish attracting devices (FAD) were installed in 1987 in four locations around the lake. Fish attracting devices consisted of two areas of log cribs filled with rock and brush and two areas of weighted evergreen trees. FAD's were sunk in 14-17 feet of water to concentrate panfish, particularly black crappie, and increase angler harvest. Walleye gillnet catches remain high. Catch rates averaged 19.40 fish/gillnet night in the 1989 survey. This compares favorably with earlier catch rate values of 15.3 fish/gillnet night in 1980 and 23.9 fish/gillnet night in 1985. Size distribution as described by PSD value decreased from 48.0 percent in 1985 to 14.0 percent in 1989 in response to recruitment of a very strong 1987 year class. The 1987 year class was likely the result of fry stocking. The 1987 year class appears to be growing quite slow. As individuals of this year class continue to grow, PSD should increase to a more desirable level; however, because of their general abundance and intra-specific competition the 1988 year class also appears to be quite strong. Thirteen age 1 fish captured. Age 2 fish averaged only 8.9 inches in total length. Slow growth could also be the result of the larger number of age 2 fish. Age 3 and 4 walleye appear to have better growth rates and averaged 13.1 inches and 16.2 inches, respectively. Northern pike abundance is relatively low with gillnet of only 2.6 fish/net night; however, they do reach quality and larger sizes. Twenty-seven percent of fish sampled were over 25 inches in total length. PSD was calculated at 54.0 percent. Yellow perch abundance has increased steadily over the four assessments and is currently 16.4 fish/ gillnet night. Because most yellow perch are small, little angling pressure is exerted specifically at yellow perch. Bluegill are relatively abundant and growth rates are excellent. Bluegill averaged 4.2 inches in length after three growing seasons and 6.0 inches at age 4. Black crappie abundance was either relatively low or these fish were not vulnerable to the sampling gear during the mid-august assessment. Only 1 crappie over 8.0 inches was netted. A strong year class may recruit to the creel in 1990 since 15 black crappie were captured between 5.0 and 8.0 inches. The largemouth bass population was sampled using electrofishing gear. A broad size range of largemouth bass were captured. Total lengths ranged from 3.5 to 19 inches. The 1986 year class was quite strong and growth rates are excellent with age 3 bass averaging 12.1 inches in length. Bullhead and carp are present but not overly abundant. No ciscoes were captured in the 1989 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chippewa Lake is a relatively large, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  Residential development is considered moderate to high, especially around the southern half of the lake.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Secchi disk measurements typically exceed 10 feet throughout summer months.  Consequently, recreational pressure can be heavy, especially during weekend days.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore but parking space can be limited.  A bay on the southwest portion of the lake can be tough to find but it is accessible via a narrow, shallow waterway through dense cattails.  Aquatic habitats are diverse and include islands, shallow rock bars, protected bays, and dense beds of emergent and submergent vegetation.  These diverse aquatic habitats provide diverse angling opportunities.  Anglers can also find quality fishing on adjacent lakes that comprise the Upper Chippewa chain of lakes.  These lakes include Devils, Little Chippewa, Whiskey, and Stowes.Chippewa Lake is primarily managed for walleye.  Largemouth bass and sunfishes are species of secondary management importance.  Walleye abundance has increased slightly since the 2001 survey and remains above levels expected for this type of lake.  Anglers can expect good numbers of fish in a variety of sizes.  Fish collected in gill nets during the 2005 survey ranged from 7.9 to 24.0 inches in length.  Average size was 15.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye grow relatively fast in Chippewa Lake.  Most fish in the 2005 capture sample exceeded 14.0 inches after four growing seasons.  Night electrofishing surveys are completed each fall to capture young walleye and evaluate year class strength.  These surveys have indicated that a weak year class was produced in 2005. Moderate year classes were produced in 2002 and 2004.  A strong year class was produced in 2003.  Good walleye spawning habitat is abundant and natural reproduction sustains this population.  However, walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  Northern pike abundance continues to increase.  In fact, the 2005 catch rate of 9.5 fish/gill net is the highest catch rate ever recorded.  Similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, size structure of the northern pike population is poor.  Most individuals are relatively small.  However, fish exceeding 30.0 inches are also present.  Selective harvest (i.e., the harvest of small- to medium-sized fish and the release of larger fish) is highly encouraged to help reduce overall pike abundance and increase population size structure.  Spring electrofishing results described a high-quality bass fishery, in terms of numbers and size.  A record-high catch rate of 109.2 bass per hour of night electrofishing was recorded in 2005.  Approximately 69% of the electrofishing sample exceeded 12.0 inches and 10% exceeded 15.0 inches in length.Bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch comprise the panfish community.  Survey data suggests that anglers targeting these species will find moderate to low numbers with most fish being relatively small.  Perch numbers are especially low.Other fish species collected during the 2005 survey include bowfin (dogfish), tullibee, common carp, bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, bullheads, and freshwater drum (sheepshead).  The next fish community assessment is scheduled for 2009.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chippewa Lake (also commonly referred to as Big Chippewa Lake) is a 1,175 acre, moderately productive basin located northeast of Brandon in western Douglas County.  This lake is relatively deep with a maximum depth of 95 feet.  Mean depth is estimated at 24 feet.  Chippewa Lake is located within the Chippewa River watershed.  Water clarity typically exceeds 10 feet throughout summer months.  A further increase in water clarity is likely in the near future due to recent zebra mussel infestation.  This lake becomes thermally stratified in summer months.  The thermocline is typically located between 20 and 25 feet in depth.  As a result of stratification, dissolved oxygen levels during the 2017 survey were too low below 20 feet to support gamefishes.  Basin morphometry presents a rich variety of aquatic habitats (islands, shallow rock bars, protected bays, and large expanses of emergent aquatic vegetation) and offers diverse fishing opportunities.  Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate and is concentrated on the southern half of the basin along east and west shorelines.  Due to the desirable characteristics of the lake, recreational uses can be heavy, particularly on weekends and holidays.  A small public access with limited parking is located in the northeast corner of the lake.  Boaters should be aware of multiple navigation hazards within this basin.  These shallow rock areas are marked with hazard buoys.  Boaters should also note that navigable access to the series of shallow bays in the southwest corner of the lake can be difficult for larger boats, especially during periods of low water levels.  These bays are connected to each other and the main basin via narrow, relatively shallow channels through stands of emergent vegetation.  \n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2017 to assess fish community structure and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Survey methodology included an electrofishing survey completed on May 24 to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the survey was conducted August 8-10.  Survey gear and sampling efforts included 12 gill net and 12 trap net sets.\n\nPrimary management emphasis is directed at sustaining the lake's productive Walleye fishery.  This Walleye population is sustained through natural reproduction and supplemental fry stockings which occur on an alternate year basis.  Walleye catches, which averaged 6.9 fish/gill net were well within the range of expected catches for Chippewa and similar lakes, but this catch rate was much lower than previous surveys.  Reduced Walleye catches could be attributed to poor reproduction and or survival of young Walleyes in recent years.  Few fish from 2015 and 2016 year classes were sampled.  Three- and four-year-old fish comprised approximately 70% of gill net captures.  Average size was 16.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.  The largest Walleye captured was 27.5 inches in length.  \n\nNorthern Pike population abundance remained limited, yet size structure of the population was poor.  Similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, small or \"hammerhandle\" pike comprised most of the total gill net catch.  Mean length was 20.9 inches.  No pike exceeded 30.0 inches.\n\nLargemouth Bass proved to be abundant.  Bass captures ranged from 3.3 to 18.2 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  Three- and four-year-old fish comprised most of the electrofishing catch.  Size structure of this population peaked in the mid- to late-2000s.  Larger bass, some exceeding 18.0 inches in length, are still present but many of those old bass have been replaced and the current population is relatively young.      \n\nQuality panfishing opportunities are available for anglers targeting Bluegills, Black Crappies, or Rock Bass.  Bluegill abundance has increased in recent years and harvestable-size fish, some exceeding 9.0 inches in length, were measured.  Crappie abundance can be highly variable due to the \"boom or bust\" nature of this species.  Abundance estimates from trap net and gill net catches in 2017 were modest, but approximately 25% of crappie captures were 10.0 inches or larger.  The largest crappie caught measured 11.3 inches.  The Rock Bass population has expanded.  Most captures were relatively young.  Trap net captures average 7.4 inches, but 9.0-inch and larger fish were measured.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest from this often undervalued population to free up space and reduce competition with other gamefishes.\n\nVery few Yellow Perch were captured in 2017.  Gill net catches of harvestable-size perch substantially declined in the early 2000s and have remained low ever since.\n\nOther species sampled during the 2017 survey included Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfishes, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2021.\n\nChippewa Lake is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2017.  Immediate downstream basins (Devils, Little Chippewa, and Stowe) have also been designated as infested waters.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

                "narrative": "<p>Chippewa Lake (also commonly referred to as Big Chippewa Lake) is a 1,175 acre, moderately productive basin located northeast of Brandon in Douglas County.  This lake is relatively deep with a maximum depth of 95 feet.  Mean depth is estimated at 24 feet.  Chippewa Lake is located within the Chippewa River watershed.  Primary inflows come from Whiskey Lake to the south. The major outlet is located along the southwest shoreline and flows into Devils Lake under Douglas County Road 7.  Water quality conditions are excellent and exceed averages of similar Minnesota lakes.  Water clarity typically exceeds 10 feet throughout summer months and has increased in recent years following zebra mussel infestation.  This lake becomes thermally stratified in summer months and the thermocline is typically located between 20 and 25 feet.  As a result of stratification, dissolved oxygen levels during the 2021 survey were too low below 24 feet to support most gamefish species.  Chippewa Lake contains diverse aquatic habitats (islands, shallow rock bars, protected bays, and large expanses of emergent aquatic vegetation) and offers diverse fishing opportunities.  Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate and is concentrated on the southern half of the basin along the east and west shorelines.  Due to the desirable characteristics of the lake, recreational uses can be heavy, particularly on weekends and holidays.  A small public access with limited parking is located in the northeast corner of the lake.  Boaters should be aware of multiple navigation hazards within this basin.  These shallow rock areas are marked with hazard buoys.  Boaters should also note that access to the series of shallow bays in the southwest corner of the lake can be difficult for larger boats, especially during periods of low water levels.  These bays are connected to each other and the main basin via narrow, relatively shallow channels through stands of emergent vegetation.  \n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2021 to assess the fish community of Chippewa Lake.  Walleye abundance has improved in recent years due to an exceptionally strong year class produced in 2020.  Strong year classes were also produced in 2018 and 2021.  Gill net catches averaged 10.0 Walleye/gill net and almost 70% of the sample was age 3 or younger.  Average size was just 14.0 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Size structure will improve as the 2020 year class moves through the recreational fishery.  The largest Walleye sampled was 28.3 inches in length.  This population is sustained through natural reproduction, but supplemental fry stockings occur on an alternate year basis.  The Northern Pike population exhibited moderate abundance and poor size structure.  Similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, small \"hammerhandle\" pike dominated the population.  Mean length was just 19.9 inches and only one pike exceeding 30.0 inches was sampled.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018 to help improve pike size structure.  Chippewa Lake is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Very few Yellow Perch were captured.  Gill net catches of harvestable-size perch substantially declined in the early 2000s and have remained low.  Quality panfishing opportunities are available for anglers targeting Bluegill or Black Crappie.  Bluegill abundance and size structure has decreased in recent years but harvestable-size fish, some exceeding 9.0 inches in length, are available.  Harvestable-size Black Crappie are also available.  Crappie abundance can be highly variable due to the \"boom or bust\" nature of this species.  Population characteristics in 2021 were indicative of a \"boom\", as abundance and size structure were both considered high.  Largemouth Bass are abundant.  Size structure of this population peaked in the mid- to late-2000s.  Larger bass, some exceeding 19.0 inches in length, are still present but smaller fish comprise the majority of this population.  Average length of bass sampled during spring electrofishing efforts was 13.1 inches.       \n\nOther species sampled during the 2021 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2025.\n\nChippewa Lake is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2017.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

Gillnet catches averaged 16.8 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of meancatch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (4.0 - 9.6 fish/gillnet). Gillnet catches have exceeded this normal range in all surveys dating back to 1980, ranging from 14.6to 23.9 fish/net.   Mean weight of fish captured was 1.2 pounds.  Previous surveys have indicated thatfry stocking, fingerling stocking, and years of no stocking have all been correlated with strong yearclasses.  Annual, fall electrofishing since 1992 has documented consistent natural reproduction.  Analternate year fry stocking scheme was initiated in 1996 to cost-effectively supplement the walleyepopulation.  Northern pike catches averaged 8.3 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches were lower in previous surveys,ranging from 1.7 to 3.0 fish/net.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.0 - 7.9fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 2.0 pounds.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded36.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Forty-five percent of the fish captured were 12 inches inlength or greater, however only 3% exceeded 15 inches.  A similar catch rate and size structure werereported in 1993.  Bluegill catches averaged 36.8 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 23.4to 59.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Approximately 60% of the fish captured were6.0 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  Yellow perchcatches averaged 28.6 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have increased gradually since 1980 when catchesaveraged 5.3 fish/net.  The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 7.1 - 33.9fish/gillnet.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled during summer months to accurately evaluaterelative density and size structure.  Trapnet and gillnet catches averaged 0.8 and 1.5 fish/net,respectively.  Total lengths ranged from 4.6 to 9.9 inches.  </p>",
