                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Burns Lake was conducted beginning on August 19th, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including seven species that were intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and zero that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July  2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Burns Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burns Lake is a 144-acre lake in central Itasca County within the Big Fork River watershed.  Burns Lake is located approximately 3 miles northeast of Marcell, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 100 ft and 78 littoral acres.  A forest service gravel access is located on the southeast shoreline.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.3/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 7.5 to 12.5/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 24 inches.  Growth was highly variable among individual fish.  The average back-calculated length for age-4 fish was 21.3 inches, which was similar to the statewide average.     Bluegill trap-net catch was 65.4/net, which was higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments varied from 46.3 to 121.8/trap net.  Size structure was poor with a no fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was slightly slower than the statewide average, with fish reaching six inches by age 7.    Black crappie gill-net catch was 5.5/net and trap net catch was 3.6/net.  Both catch rates exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 11.5 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 to 2 and similar to the average for ages 3 to 5.  Black crappie grow to nine inches by age 5. Electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass for the first time on Burns Lake.  Electrofishing catch rate was 94.4/hour, which indicates a high abundance compared to other area lakes.  Size structure was good with fish up to 20 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 to 3 and similar to the average for ages 4 to 10.  Although the growth rates were slightly slower than the statewide average, many of the largemouth bass were quite old with fish up to age 15.  Angler harvest appears to be low allowing a portion of the population to grow old enough to achieve quality size.    Yellow perch gill-net catch was 8.7/gill net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish reaching nine inches.  Other species sampled include brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burns Lake is a 144-acre lake located four miles northeast of Marcell, MN in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  Burns Lake has fairly clear water and moderate fertility.  There is a US Forest Service access located at the east end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe initial lake management plan was drafted in 2004.  Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were considered primary management species, with Bluegill and Black Crappie considered secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in July 2020 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBurns Lake has typically produced high numbers of Largemouth Bass with a small average size.  Spring night electrofishing sampled bass at a rate of 88/hour.  This was a relatively high catch rate compared to other lakes in the area, but similar to the previous survey on Burns.  Sampled bass ranged from 3.2 to 15.8 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches.  Ages 1 through 10 were represented, with age 2 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth rates were slower than the statewide average for most ages.  Largemouth Bass took six years to exceed quality length (12 inches).  Burns Lake is likely to produce good angling opportunities for those looking for high numbers of smaller fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has generally had moderate numbers with relatively good size structure.  The 2020 gill-net catch rate for Northern Pike was average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  As in past surveys, size structure was relatively good.  Sampled pike ranged from 16.9 to 37.6 inches with an average length of 23.5 inches.  Five year classes from age 3 to 10 were represented in the sample, with average growth rates.  Northern Pike averaged 24.0 inches after 5 years.  Two pike exceeding 36 inches were captured, which is somewhat rare for a small lake like Burns.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike to maintain or improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for Bluegill was lower than previous surveys but within the typical range for lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure has been poor with few fish exceeding 8 inches sampled in any survey.  Trap-net sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.7 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches.   Ages 3 through 10 were represented indicating frequent recruitment.  Growth was considered average; Bluegill averaged 6.0 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for Black Crappie was above average compared to similar lakes, but about average for Burns.  Size structure was similar to previous surveys.  Trap-net sampled crappie varied from 5.5 to 11.0 inches with an average length of 8.0 inches.  Eight year classes from age 2 through 10 were represented, with age 3 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  Black Crappie averaged 9.1 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for Yellow Perch was typical for the lake and similar lakes.  Gill-net sampled perch averaged 6.9 inches.  Perch have generally been too small to be of interest to anglers but are an important prey item for other gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the latest survey included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",
