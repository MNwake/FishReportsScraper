Gillnet catch rates averaged 4.9 and 5.9fish/gillnet in 1986 and 1989, respectively.  The size structure of the walleye population is desirableand should enhance fishing quality.  Approximately 60% of the fish are greater than 15 inches and 14%exceed 20 inches in length.  Average weight of fish is about 1.7 pounds.  Recent fingerling stockingsmay have been successful in enhancing walleye abundance, however it is likely that natural reproductionis also important in sustaining the walleye population.  Northern pike density is low.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 1.4 fish/net.  Catch rates have been low in previous surveys, averaging 3.3 and 3.4fish/gillnet in 1986 and 1989, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakesis 1.1 - 6.6 fish/gillnet.  Average weight of fish captured was 2.8 pounds.  Pelican Lake supports aquality largemouth bass fishery.  Electrofishing yielded 32.3 fish per hour.  Average weight of fishcaptured was 1.5 pounds and  approximately one in four fish was 15 inches or greater.  Bluegillabundance has increased significantly in recent years.  Trapnet catches averaged 71.5 fish/net whichgreatly exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates for this lake type (1.1 - 14.0 fish/net).  Incomparison, catches averaged 1.1 fish/net and 8.3 fish/net in 1986 and 1989.  Size structure indicesdescribe a population dominated by small,young fish.  Only 23% of the fish are 6 inches or greater. Yellow perch catches averaged 10.6 fish/gillnet which is within the expected range of mean catch ratesfor similar lakes (3.3 - 23.2 fish/net). Catch rates have ranged from 2.0 - 13.0 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1957.  Average weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds.  Black crappie catchesaveraged 1.5 fish/trapnet in 1993, similar to catch rates of 1.9 fish/net in 1986 and 3.8 fish/net in1989.  White crappie abundance has apparently decreased significantly over the same time period. Catches averaged 2.3 fish/trapnet in 1993, compared to catch rates of 17.3 and 25.8 fish/net in 1986and 1989.  White crappie first became prevalent in the 1983 lake survey.  Many of the white crappiethat were captured in trapnets exceeded 12 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on June 26, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 stations with eight sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 15 stations and conditions prevented the use of seines at nine sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Pugnose Shiner) and two tolerant species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   The FIBI score for Pelican Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a productive 3,760 acre lake located southeast of Ashby in Grant County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 21.0 feet.  Average depth is roughly 10.0 feet.  Water quality is seasonally impaired due to high nutrient levels and wind induced suspension of bottom sediments.  Due in part to Pelican Lake's high productivity and shoreline irregularity, the lake does support very good fishing opportunities.  One public access is located on the western shore, just off Minnesota State Highway 78.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed on Pelican Lake during summer months of 2017.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey completed on May 23 to assess abundance and size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.  A combination of 12 gill nets and 15 trap nets were used to sample the fish community.  The netting survey was completed June 19-23.  A targeted survey of small fishes under-represented in standard survey gear was also completed on June 26 to assess species richness and generate an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) score which provides a measure of habitat suitability or degradation.   <br> \n <br> \nStandard survey catch statistics continue to describe Walleye as abundant.  Population abundance is sustained through natural reproduction, supplemented with biennial fry stockings. Average sizes of Walleyes captured were 13.7 inches or 1.0 pound.  Six age classes were represented in catches.  Much of the gill net catch was comprised of two- and three-year-old Walleyes.  Walleyes grow fast in this productive lake.  Those young Walleyes will approach or exceed 16.0 inches in 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches continued to be low.  Average length and weight of pike captures was 22.8 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Several individuals approached 30.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake supports both Black and White Crappie populations.  More Black Crappies were caught than White Crappies.  Catches of Black Crappie decreased from very high catches recorded in 2012, but this popular panfish remains moderately abundant and can offer good fishing.  Six age groups were represented in survey catches.  Age assignments extended to age 7.  A high percentage of Black Crappie captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Twelve-inch fish were common.  Most White Crappie captures were young fish and thus too small to contribute to the fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches continued to be modest.  Age distribution of catches extended to age 7.  Average length of those captured in trap nets was 5.4 inches.  Due to a lower population density and less competition, Bluegills grow fast.  Some fast growing six-year-olds exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  The largest Bluegill capture measured 8.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance has increased over time.  Most bass captures during the spring electrofishing survey were two- and three-year old fish less than 8.0 inches, but length distribution of bass catches extended to 18.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNumbers of Yellow Perch large enough to be sampled in gill nets has declined over the past decades.  Only 20 Yellow Perch were caught in 2017.  Perch averaged 6.3 inches.  Due to high predation rates, Yellow Perch appear to mature earlier and place more energy towards reproduction rather than body growth. <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake is infested with curly leaf pondweed, an aquatic invasive species.  Curly leaf pondweed can become very dense and negatively influence native aquatic plants and fish species.  Zebra mussels have now been confirmed in Ten Mile Lake which is upstream of Pelican Lake in Ottertail County.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a large, shallow lake located near the town of Ashby in northeast Grant County.  Water quality data indicates that this lake is very fertile.  Blue-green algae often dominate the phytoplankton community during summer months.  Because of the shallow nature of the basin and high productivity levels, water clarity can be much reduced by wind-driven mixing and re-suspension of sediment and/or blue-green algae blooms.  According to Citizen Lake Monitoring Program data, secchi disk measurements average around 2.5-3.0 feet during summer months.  Despite adverse environmental conditions, aquatic vegetation is relatively abundant, especially in protected bays. <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake is managed for walleye.  Sunfish and largemouth bass are species of secondary management importance.  Survey data suggests walleye abundance has increased in recent years with recruitment of an exceptionally strong 2005 year class.  Size structure of the walleye population is very good.  Approximately 83% of the fish sampled in 2009 exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Mean size of captures was 16.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Fall electrofishing efforts documented a strong 2009 year class.  Catches of smaller fish will likely increase in the future as this year class recruits to the fishery.  Stocking evaluations have indicated this population is primarily maintained via natural reproduction and supplemental fry stockings, which occur on an alternate year basis.  A spring electrofishing survey revealed a high-quality largemouth bass fishery.  Abundance was considered moderate but size structure was exceptional.  Mean length was 15.1 inches with the largest bass approaching 20.0 inches.  Panfish anglers can anticipate moderate bluegill abundance but low crappie and yellow perch abundance.  Both black and white crappie are present in Pelican Lake but these populations suffered a partial summerkill in 2007.  Both populations are expected to rebound in the near future.  Record-low perch abundance was documented in 2009.  Most fish were relatively small.  Northern pike abundance was also low.  Mean size was just 21.0 inches and 2.3 pounds but pike exceeding 30.0 inches were sampled.  Because Pelican Lake is a highly productive system, most fish species tend to grow relatively fast. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2009 survey included black, brown, and yellow bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2013.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a large, shallow lake that supports a diverse fish community.  Water quality data indicates that this lake is a very productive system and can be classified as eutrophic to hypereutrophic.  Consequently, blue-green algae often dominate the phytoplankton community during summer months.  Secchi disk readings averaged 4.0 feet in 2001.  However, because of the shallow nature of the lake basin and high productivity levels, water clarity can be much reduced due to wind-driven mixing and re-suspension of sediment and/or blue-green algae blooms.  Despite adverse environmental conditions, aquatic vegetation is relatively abundant in Pelican Lake, especially in protected bays.  Pelican Lake is managed primarily for walleye with sunfish and largemouth bass being species of secondary management importance.Walleye catches averaged 10.8 fish/gill net, which was the highest catch rate recorded since 1983.  Size structure of the walleye population was good; average length was 15.7 inches and the largest fish collected was over 28 inches.  An extremely strong year class was produced in 2001, as indicated by a fall sample of 106 young-of-the-year walleye per hour of electrofishing.  This corresponds with a year of fry stocking but walleye year classes of this magnitude are usually the result of natural recruitment.  If current growth rates are maintained, this year class should recruit to the fishery by 2004.  Other species commonly targeted by anglers are largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike.  Bass numbers are good.  In fact, the electrofishing catch rate of 64 fish/hour in 2001 was the highest ever recorded.  Bass averaged a little over 13 inches in length and 1.3 pounds in weight.  Panfish species are less abundant but should provide anglers with the opportunity to catch relatively large fish.  Ninety-five percent of bluegill collected in trap nets exceeded 6 inches in length and 13% exceeded 8 inches.  Both black and white crappie are present in Pelican Lake.  These populations also exhibit low abundance but good size structure.  Anglers targeting northern pike can expect a moderately abundant population with mostly smaller individuals.  Yellow perch catches have declined since the last survey but should provide some quality angling.  Forty-four percent of yellow perch collected in gill nets exceeded 8 inches in length.A walleye minimum length limit has been proposed to regulate harvest and improve the quality of fishing from Pelican Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Fisheries, initiated a special walleye head collection project, which runs from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 to determine the size and age of walleyes harvested from Pelican Lake.  This information will then be used by biologists to determine the potential effectiveness of the proposed regulation.  Angler cooperation is an essential component of this special project and your help is much needed and appreciated.  Anglers can cooperate by depositing walleye heads at designated locations.  The following resorts are designated locations for resort customers: Shady Lawn, Ashby Resort and Campground, and Indian Mounds.  Alternatively, anglers can also deposit walleye heads at Dave's Shortstop and Bait Store in Ashby.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a large, shallow lake located near the town of Ashby in northeast Grant County.  Water quality data indicates that this lake is a very productive system and can be classified as eutrophic to hypereutrophic.  Consequently, blue-green algae often dominate the phytoplankton community during summer months.  Because of the shallow nature of the lake basin and high productivity levels, water clarity can be much reduced due to wind-driven mixing and re-suspension of sediment and/or blue-green algae blooms.  Secchi disk measurements average around 2.5 feet during summer months.  Despite adverse environmental conditions, aquatic vegetation is relatively abundant in Pelican Lake, especially in protected bays.  Pelican Lake is managed primarily for walleye with sunfish and largemouth bass being species of secondary management importance.  Survey data suggests that walleye abundance is down slightly from the 2001 survey but anglers can still expect moderate numbers of bigger fish.  Approximately 91% of the 2005 capture sample exceeded 15 inches in length and 15% exceeded 20 inches.  A fall electrofishing survey indicated an exceptionally strong year class was produced in 2005.  Catches of smaller fish will likely increase in future years as this year class recruits to the fishery.  If current growth rates are maintained, fish from this year class should be harvestable size by 2009.  Stocking evaluations have indicated this population is primarily maintained via natural reproduction and supplemental fry stockings.  Stocking occurs on an alternate year basis.  Other species commonly targeted by anglers include largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch.  A spring electrofishing survey indicated a high-quality bass fishery, in terms of both numbers and size.  Almost 50% of the electrofishing sample exceeded 15 inches in length with the largest fish being just less than 20 inches.  Bluegill numbers and size structure are also good.  Trap net catches averaged 24.2 bluegill/net.  Fish exceeding 8 inches in length were relatively common in the trap net sample.  Both black and white crappie are present in Pelican Lake.  Although crappie abundance is relatively low, crappie size structure is often good to excellent.  The northern pike population can also be described as having relatively low abundance but good size structure.  Yellow perch abundance has increased in recent years but current size structure of this population is poor and would not be favorable to anglers.  No perch exceeding 8 inches in length were collected during the 2005 survey.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a 3,760-acre eutrophic (nutrient rich) system located southeast of Ashby in Grant County.  Pelican Lake has a maximum depth of 21.0 feet and average depth of 10.0 feet.  Water quality is seasonally poor due to nutrient enrichment and internal recycling of nutrients in bottom sediments during periods of strong winds.  Water clarity during summer months (2009 \u0013 2012) averaged only 2.7 feet due to frequent algae blooms and sediment re-suspension.  Despite periods of poor water transparency, aquatic plants are abundant and are found in depths up to 8.0 feet.  Game fish habitat conditions are not ideal, but due to the lake's high fertility and shoreline irregularity it is highly productive and supports very good fishing. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are abundant due to natural reproduction and biennial fry stocking efforts.  Gillnet catches during the June 2013 survey averaged 10.5 walleye/net.  The catch was comprised of cohorts from 13 age classes.  Due to the broad age structure, lengths at capture varied from 8.1 to 24.3 inches.  Average size was 15.3 inches or 1.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches were also above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average size of pike was 23.5 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Several captures exceeded 30.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nMembers of the sunfish family do surprisingly well in Pelican Lake.  Largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish are abundant.  Bluegill catch rates in 2013 exceeded expectations.  High abundance estimates are likely related to the establishment of a very strong year class in 2010.  These three-year-old fish made up 62% of the total catch in trapnets.  Lengths at capture varied from 3.2 to 10.0 inches. Approximately 7% of collected bluegills exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largemouth bass population supports excellent fishing.  Age distribution of the bass catch extended to age 15.  Average length of bass caught was fairly small (9.6 inches).  Low average size is likely due to the high proportion of young fish recruiting into the population.  Despite a low average size, several large individuals (> 18.0 inches) were collected.  Seventeen percent of bass caught were larger than 15.0 inches.  Both black and white crappies co-exist in Pelican Lake.  Black crappies are abundant and greatly outnumber white crappies.  Much of the catch was comprised of young fish (age 4 or less).  Black crappies collected in trapnets averaged 7.8 inches in length, but the maximum size caught was 13.9 inches.  A high abundance of young crappies in Pelican Lake will afford good fishing in upcoming years.   <br> \n <br> \nPredator densities may be too great for optimal growth and sustainable yields.  Numbers of yellow perch large enough to capture in gillnets has declined dramatically over past decades.  None were large enough to harvest.  Only 16 perch were caught.  These captures averaged 5.9 inches in length.  Due to excessive predation, perch are maturing earlier and channeling energy into reproduction rather than body growth.  Pelican Lake's bass, walleye, and pike are hungry and should be easier to catch. <br> \n <br> \nOne point of public access is available in Pelican Lake.  Public access consists of a concrete boat launch on the western shore (UTM coordinates [zone: 15]; 281117E, 5104789N).  <br> \n <br> \nPelican Lake is scheduled to be surveyed every four years.  Upcoming surveys are scheduled for 2017 and 2021. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is a large, relatively shallow, and highly productive basin located south of Ashby in Grant County.  Surface area is estimated at 3,760 acres.  Mean and maximum depths are 10 and 21 feet, respectively.  Pelican Lake is located within the Pomme de Terre River watershed.  Residential development is minimal and most of the immediate watershed is in agricultural production.  Water quality is seasonally impaired due to high nutrient levels.  Water clarity measurements are typically between 2 and 4 feet, but water clarity can be greatly reduced during summer algal blooms.  A public access with limited parking is available on the west shoreline off State Highway 78.  Boaters should be aware of multiple shallow rock areas found throughout the lake.  These areas are posted with caution buoys.  Anglers should also be aware of fish consumption guidelines for bullhead and crappie due to mercury contaminants.  For more information regarding mercury contaminants see the following:  Contaminants and Minnesota Fish - EH: Minnesota Department of Health (state.mn.us).\n \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2021 to assess the fish community of Pelican Lake.  Walleye abundance has decreased in recent years.  In fact, the 2021 catch rate (5.3/gill net) was the lowest catch rate documented in standardized surveys dating back to 1993.  Lower abundance is due to poor recruitment of young fish in recent years.  Lack of small fish resulted in a larger average size of 19.0 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Walleye grow rapidly in this productive basin and typically reach 15 inches after three growing seasons.  This population is sustained through natural reproduction, but supplemental fry stockings occur on an alternate year basis.  The Northern Pike population tends to exhibit lower abundance and moderate size structure.  In 2021, mean size was 23.7 inches and 3.2 pounds and the largest pike sampled measured 36.4 inches.  Anglers are reminded that new pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Pelican Lake is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Yellow Perch abundance has increased in recent years but smaller fish continue to dominate this population and very few harvestable-sized perch are available.  Both Black and White Crappie are present in Pelican Lake.  Black Crappie are more abundant and provide quality panfishing opportunities.  Numerous Black Crappie exceeding 12 inches were sampled and strong 2018 and 2019 year classes were present.  Crappie fishing should be good into the near future.  Bluegill also offer abundant panfishing opportunities, but size structure of this population tends to be skewed towards small- to medium-sized fish.  Average length was just 4.4 inches and only one Bluegill exceeding 8 inches was sampled.  Similar to Bluegill, Largemouth Bass are also abundant but smaller fish currently dominate this population.  Bass up to 18 inches were sampled during spring electrofishing efforts but average length was just 8.9 inches.\n\nOther species sampled during the 2021 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2025.\n</p>",

Data from this survey will help inform decisions regarding potential management of double-crested cormorants on this basin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (7.5 fish/gill net) has increased from the record-low level (5.3 fish/gill net) observed in 2021.  Current abundance is at or near levels expected for this type of lake.  Size structure has declined in recent years but is still dominated by larger fish.  Mean size was 18.0 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Thirteen year classes were sampled.  The majority of the sample was younger fish (ages 1-3) but Walleye up to age 18 were collected. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has declined since the last survey.  Gill net catches averaged 3.3 fish/net.  Other population attributes were similar to those documented in the 2021 survey.  Size structure was dominated by smaller perch, growth was relatively fast, and only three year classes (ages 2-4) were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

Mean weight has increased slightly to 1.32 lbs. Growth rates determined over the last three surveys would suggest a fairly slow growth rate considering the high fertility and the mean depth of Pelican Lake. Age 3 walleye averaged 12.1 inches, while age 4 Walleye averaged 14.5 in in total length. There appears to be poor correlation between Walleye stocking and year class strength. Although the 1987 year class are probably not entirely vulnerable to the sampling gear, 41% of the Walleye aged came from this year class. It appears to be a very strong year class established by natural reproduction. No stocking occurred in 1987. A 1986 fingerling stocking of small Walleye fingerlings could possibly explain the year class. However, if this was the case, these fish would have taken two growing seasons to attain 5.4 inches in length. Presence of age 5 Walleye may also be attributable to natural reproduction. Fish runs from other lakes are unlikely due to electric weirs upstream and dams downstream. Other year classes may be the result of natural reproduction and/or stocking programs. Northern Pike numbers have remained relatively low but stable over the years. Only 3.38 Northern Pike/gill net were sampled in 1989. Mean weight of the Northern Pike captured was 3.6 lbs. Size structure is correspondingly good. PSD was calculated at 100.0 percent. White Crappie were not captured in 1957 or 1979 surveys and only one was captured in 1969. However in 1983, catch rates averaged 33.0 fish/gill net and 36.6 fish/trap net. White Crappie abundance remains high. The 1989 population assessment showed a catch rate of 25.75 fish/trap net and desirable size distribution. PSD was calculated at 59.0 percent. Black Crappie abundance has fluctuated over the years. A high catch rate of 30.1 fish/trap net was recorded in 1969. The 1989 assessment yielded average trap net catches of 3.75 fish/net. Mean weight was quite small at 0.22 lb. Most Black Crappie measured within a range of 6.5-8.0 inches. The calculated PSD of 11.0 percent was quite low in comparison to the 84.0 percent recorded in earlier surveys. Yellow Perch catch rates have remained stable; however, no quality-size fish were captured in the 1989 survey. The Bluegill population appears to have recovered after experiencing a population crash. Low oxygen readings in the mid 1980's may have resulted in a partial winterkill. Bluegill catches decreased from 34.9 fish/trapnet in 1983 to 1.1 fish/trapnet in 1986. Cpue increased to 8.3 bluegill/trap net in 1989, but the mean weight is quite small compared to previous years. The smaller average size is probably attributable to a greater percentage of young fish. PSD calculated from the 1989 survey decreased to 47.0 percent; however a PSD of 47.0 percent is still good for lakes in the Glenwood area. Carp were not captured in the 1957 survey, but have been captured in all netting assessments since. Bullhead, Buffalo and Carp are underutilized by anglers and could continue to be commercially harvested.</p>",

Water quality data indicates that Pelican Lake is within the hyper-eutrophic to eutrophicclassification of lakes within Minnesota.  Seechi disk readings average 1.5 - 2.0 feet and blue-greenalgae dominates the phytoplankton community during summer months.  Despite adverse conditions,submergent vegetation grows to a depth of ten feet and is dense in protected bays.  Hardstem bulrushand common cattail are also common in shoreline areas.   Walleye catches averaged 6.8 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics.  Gillnet catches have been consistent inrecent surveys; averaging 6.6 fish/net in 1993, 5.9 fish/net in 1989 and 4.9 fish/net in 1986.  Meanweight of fish captured was 1.4 pounds.  Age-2 and age-3 fish comprised 65% of the fish captured ingillnets.  Both year classes correspond to years of fry stocking in 1994 and 1995.  Naturalreproduction is also evident in the age class distribution.  Age-1 fish, which were likely not fullyvulnerable to experimental gillnets, comprised 14% of the fish captured.  This year class correspondsto a blank year in 1996.   Northern pike catches averaged 4.4 fish/gillnet, nearly identical to the median catch rate for similarlakes.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.4 to 3.6 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1983. Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 1.9 pounds.  Daytime electrofishing yielded 36.8 largemouthbass per hour.  Size structure of the population is indicative of a quality fishery.  Over one-half ofthe fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater.  Bluegill catches averaged 11.5 fish/trapnet in1997.  Trapnet catches have been highly variable in past surveys; averaging 71.5 fish/net in 1993, 8.3fish/net in 1989, 1.1 fish/net in 1986, and 34.9 fish/net in 1983.  Highly variable year class strengthis primarily responsible for the variation in trapnet catches.  Size structure of the presentpopulation is poor.  Most of the fish captured were less than 6 inches in length.  White and blackcrappie are both present in Pelican Lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.4 white crappie and 0.2 blackcrappie per net.  Neither species was captured in trapnets.  White crappie were more abundant in the1980's.  Trapnet catches averaged 25.8 fish/net in 1989 and 17.4 fish/net in 1986.  Yellow perchcatches averaged 20.7 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 2.0 to 10.6 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1983.  </p>",
