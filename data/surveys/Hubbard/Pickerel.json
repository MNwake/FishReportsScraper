                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 17, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass).  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in July 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Pickerel Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Crow Wing River watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 10 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Pickerel Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a surface area of 311 acres and a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the east basin.  Pickerel provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked, Crystal, and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and near the current management goal.  Walleye abundance since the 1991 survey has been similar, just above the current management goal.  Walleye were first stocked into Pickerel in 1988 and were not recorded in the net catches of earlier surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 18.8 inches and 2.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.7 inches.  A successful walleye stocking program is helping to maintain the walleye population in Pickerel.  Evaluations showed stronger year classes from stocked years than non-stocked years.  Pickerel is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.   Yellow perch were small in size, and generally not an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.0 inches and 2.6 pounds with pike measured up to 38.2 inches.  The marsh inlet to the west as well as in-lake areas provide the necessary spawning habitat for consistent natural reproduction and recruitment of young pike. <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good angling for black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Black crappie abundance was just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to recent surveys.  Black crappie ran small in size with an average length of 7.7 inches, with crappie measured up to 10.2 inches.  The black crappie population in Pickerel is limited by slow growth rates.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were small in size with few fish sampled over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a good largemouth bass population in Pickerel.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled when compared to other area lakes.  The proportion of largemouth bass sampled over 15 inches was high when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 19 inches were sampled.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Pickerel. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located ten miles north of Park Rapids in central Hubbard County.  Pickerel Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a surface area of 310 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  There is a state-owned earthen public access located on the south shore of the east basin.  Pickerel provides angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, and Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel is in lake class 35.   Class 35 lakes are characterized by having a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet) and an irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 35 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Crystal, Frontenac, Middle Crooked, and Waboose. <br> \nPickerel Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population and has great habitat to support them.  Numbers in 2021 were in line with past surveys, with a larger than average size due to very few small bass being sampled.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 12.4 to 17.4 inches in length. <br> \nPickerel Lake supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 5.5 - 8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 7 - 9 inch size range.  <br> \nPast and present surveys have shown Pickerel Lake to have a moderate Northern Pike population composed of small to medium sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 19.3 inches and weighed 1.6 pounds.  Historically, the number of larger Northern Pike over 28 inches has been low, with only one pike larger than 28 inches in 2021. <br> \nCurrently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Pickerel Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 10 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Pickerel Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a surface area of 310 acres and a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the east basin.  Pickerel provides angling opportunities for Panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel is in lake class 35.   Class 35 lakes are characterized by having a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet) and having an irregular shaped shoreline.  Other class 35 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Middle Crooked, Crystal, Frontenac, and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake supports abundant panfish populations and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  While abundance of panfish is good, anglers will find the size of fish somewhat on the small size.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 8-9 inch size range.  <br> \n  <br> \nPickerel Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers during spring electrofishing, compared to other area lakes.  The proportion of Largemouth Bass sampled over 15.0 inches in length was high compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.9 inches were sampled.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Pickerel. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Pickerel Lake to have a moderate to abundant Northern Pike population composed of small to medium sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.4 pounds, with pike measured up to 28.4 inches.  The number of larger Northern Pike (>28.0 inches) sampled has been low. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species sampled included Yellow and Brown Bullhead, Walleye, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Pickerel Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (3.25 fish/gillnet & 5.16 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 35 of the Schupp Classification System.  1991 was the first year walleye were sampled in Pickerel Lake.  Mean weight was 1.59 lbs.  Walleye exhibit slow and variable growth through age 3, resulting in a low mean length at age 4, of 13.70 inches.  The size structure is fair, however.  The PSD (42) & RSD-P (8) indicate a stable population, with some fish reaching preferred length and the possibility to attain greater lengths.  Walleye were just stocked by the DNR in 1988.  However, fish over age 3 were also sampled.Numbers of northern pike sampled (6.00 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range, but 19.43 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for lakes of this class.  These numbers result in a high mean weight of 3.24 lbs.  The same trend of normal numbers - large sizes has occurred since 1961.  Growth rates are highly variable among individual northern pike, with age 6 fish ranging from 22.60 to 29.10 inches in length.  The size distribution appears unbalanced (PSD=92), however, the lack of small fish may be due to inefficient sampling.  No age 1 to age 3 northern pike were sampled.  Northern pike were stocked into Pickerel Lake until 1985, but natural reproduction is maintaining the population.Largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed catches were above the third quartile.  Bluegill abundance first went above the third quartile in 1986, but pumpkinseed density has been above the third quartile since 1961.  Both species have very small size structure (bluegill PSD=11, pumpkinseed PSD=12) with no fish reaching preferred lengths.  Growth rates for both sunfish species are slow.  Mean length at age 4 for bluegill is 3.65 inches and 4.27 inches for pumpkinseed.  Black crappie catch rates have been declining since 1961, but remain within the normal ranges in 1991.  Like bluegill and pumpkinseed, black crappie exhibit slow growth, averaging only 5.26 inches at age 4.  The size distribution of black crappie is small (PSD=30), however, a few fish have attained preffered length (RSD-P=4).  Yellow perch catch rates (15.25 fish/gillnet and 1.51 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges, decreasing by about half since 1986.  Size structure for yellow perch (PSD=1 for gillnets) resembles the small size distribution of other panfish species.Catches of white sucker and yellow bullhead were above the third quartile for lakes of this classification.  White sucker numbers have been increasing steadily since 1961.  Densities of yellow bullhead have been above the third quartile since 1980 when they were first differentiated from the other bullhead species.  Rock bass were first sampled in 1991 when catch rates were within the normal ranges.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 10 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Pickerel Lake has a surface area of 311 acres and a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  Of the lake acreage, 87% is 15 feet or less in depth (littoral).  Pickerel Lake has suffered partial winterkills in the past.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel Lake is in Lake Class 35.  Other area lakes in this same class include Middle Crooked (5 miles north ofNevis), Crystal (8 miles south of Akeley), and Waboose (7 miles north of Nevis).  The public access is located on the south shore of the east basin and is owned and maintained by the DNR.     The walleye catch of 3.4/gillnet is just above the range typically found in Lake Class 35 (1.0/net - 3.2/net).  The gillnet catch of the previous survey in 1991 was almost identical (3.3/net).  Walleyes had not been sampled in the three surveys prior to 1991.  Walleye were first stocked into Pickerel Lake in 1988.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 6.7 to 22.2 inches, with an average length of 14.1 inches.  Six year classes of walleye were sampled in the 1996 survey.  Most of the walleye population is the result of walleye fingerling stocking, as evidenced by the fact that only two of the 23 walleye aged were from non-stocked years.  Presently, walleye fingerlings are stocked into Pickerel Lake during odd calendar years.  Walleye growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.     The northern pike gillnet catch of 3.7/net is within the range typically found for Lake Class 35, however it is below previous survey gillnet catches (6.0/net - 9.3/net).  Northern pike were small in size, with an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.3 lbs.  However, larger northern pike are present with a 34.4 inch fish sampled.  The marsh inlet to the west as well as in-lake areas provide the necessary spawning habitat for consistent natural reproduction.  Northern pike growth rates were good when compared to other class 35 lakes.     Yellow perch were sampled at 4.3/gillnet which is within the range typically found in Lake Class 35.  The yellow perch provide a forage base for the walleye population and are too small in size to be acceptable to the angler.  Average length of sampled yellow perch was 6.2 inches.       The bluegill trapnet catch of 16.1/net is within the range typically found in Lake Class 35.  Historical trapnet catches have been higher (30.0/net - 51.2/net).  Sampled bluegill were small in size with an average length of 6.0 inches and with the largest fish measuring 7.1 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were good and above the average lengths when compared to other area lakes.     Black crappie were sampled at 4.6/gillnet and 1.4/trapnet, similar to previous surveys and within the range typically found in Lake Class 35.  Black crappie were small in size, with most fish in the 7 to 8 inch range and with the largest fish measuring 9.4 inches.  Black crappie growth rates were slow and below the average lengths of other area lakes.      Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate typical for Lake Class 35 and similar to historical netting.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective tools to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  Largemouth bass up to 15.4 inches were sampled.  To adequately assess the largemouth bass population, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been  conducted on Pickerel Lake.  Pickerel Lake has good spawning areas and aquatic vegetation habitat that will insure a healthy largemouth bass population.  Periodic partial winterkills could reduce largemouth bass numbers.  Largemouth bass growth rates were similar to other area lakes.     Pickerel Lake has an abundant pumpkinseed population.  The trapnet catch of 10.6/net is above the range typically found in Lake Class 35.  Previous surveys had much higher catches (27.8/trapnet - 72.8/trapnet).  Pumpkinseed were small in size with an average length of 5.9 inches, and with the largest fish measuring 7.2 inches.     Yellow bullhead, white sucker, and rock bass were sampled within the range typical of Lake Class 35.  Rock bass had not been sampled in previous surveys.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Pickerel Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.      </p>",

Shoal water soils are mostly sand; some rubble is present on the south side of the east bay.  Fish showing up strongest during test netting were northern pike, perch, bullhead, pumpkinseed, and crappie.  During the summer of 1961 anglers spent approximately 2,516 man-hours fishing on this lake.There is one resort on the lake which has two cabins.  There are six other private cabins and a total of 12 boats located on this lake.Each fall wild rice is harvested on the west end of the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 10 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.   Pickerel Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a surface area of 310 acres and a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the east basin.  Pickerel provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked, Crystal, and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was up from past surveys, with the gillnet catch rate of 16.2 pike/gillnet the highest recorded catch rate of all surveys.  NOP abundance in past surveys has been lower, fluctuating within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.1 inches and 1.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.7 inches.  The marsh area to the west as well as in-lake areas provide the necessary spawning habitat for consistent natural reproduction and recruitment of young pike.  <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.   Panfish abundance for the 2011 survey was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.    While abundance of panfish is good, anglers will find the size of fish somewhat on the small size.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Panfish populations in Pickerel are limited by slow growth rates.  <br> \n <br> \nPickerel Lake supports a healthy largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (61 bass/hour) during spring electrofishing sampling when compared to other area lakes.  The proportion or largemouth bass sampled over 15 inches was high when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 19.8 inches were sampled.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Pickerel. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (1.7 walleye/gillnet) was below the current management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance since the 1991 survey have been similar, generally near the current management goal.  Walleye were first stocked into Pickerel in 1988, and  were not recorded in the net catches of earlier surveys.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 11.1 to 23.8 inches.  Pickerel Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and low numbers of hybrid sunfish and brown bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is located 10 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Pickerel Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a surface area of 311 acres and a maximum depth of 26.0 feet.  Of the lake acreage, 85% is 15 feet or less in depth (littoral).  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the east basin.  Water levels were very high on Pickerel during the summer of 2001.  The public access was flooded with water and boat access was limited until early summer.  Pickerel provides angling opportunities for northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass and walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Pickerel Lake is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked, Crystal, and Waboose.Walleye abundance (3.4 walleye/gillnet) was just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and at the current management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  The 1991 and 1996 surveys had similar walleye abundance.  Walleye were first stocked into Pickerel in 1988 and were not recorded in the net catches of earlier surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.8 inches and 1.7 pounds with fish measured up to 27.5 inches.  A successful DNR stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Pickerel as age analysis showed minimal contribution from natural reproduction.  Pickerel is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at the low end of the range \"typical\"for this lake class.  Yellow perch abundance has fluctuated from low to high numbers in past surveys.  Yellow perch were too small in size to be acceptable to the angler.Northern pike numbers (5.3 pike/gillnet) were within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has been similar, fluctuating within this \"typical\" range.  Sampled northern pike had a average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 2.9 pounds with fish measured up to 31.1 inches.  The marsh inlet to the west as well as in-lake areas provide the necessary spawning habitat for consistent natural reproduction and recruitment of young pike.Pickerel Lake supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good angling for both black crappie , pumpkinseed and bluegill.  Black crappie abundance was at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to recent surveys.  Black crappie ran small in size with an average length of 8.0 inches and with fish measured up to 11.5 inches.  The black crappie population in Pickerel is limited by slow growth rates. Both bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was within the \"typical\" range, but lower than past surveys.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers in past surveys.  Bluegill ran small in size with an average length 4.7 inches, however, larger bluegill are present with fish measured up to 10.1 inches.Pickerel supports a good largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was to be conducted on Pickerel but was canceled due to high water levels flooding the public access.  Spring electrofishing is a special survey sampling method used to assess largemouth bass abundance and size distribution.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Pickerel.Other species sampled include high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of white sucker.  Rock bass and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake (29-0178-00) is a 310-acre lake with a maximum depth of 26 feet Located north of Park Rapids, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 28 July 2016 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one site was sampled with a 50-foot seine and eight sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site. Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 7 - 14 July 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Pickerel Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Pickerel Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
