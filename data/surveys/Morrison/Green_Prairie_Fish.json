                "narrative": "<p>Green Prairie Fish Lake (DOW# 49-0035-00; Lake Class 29) is a 182 acre lake located near Randall, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southwest shore. Green Prairie Fish Lake has 2.49 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 22 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 29; lakes in this class generally have significant percentage of lake area with water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. Green Prairie Fish Lake has a special regulation for sunfish with a reduced bag limit of 10 sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Prairie Fish Lake is a typical bass/panfish lake in the Little Falls area. Largemouth Bass numbers were down compared to past years, however fish up to 20 inches were observed. Bluegill numbers and size structure were similar to past years with a few quality fish up to 8 inches. Anglers are reminded that a special regulation reduced bag limit for sunfish, is in effect on Green Prairie Fish Lake. Besides Bluegill, anglers can expect to find quality Black Crappie in Green Prairie Fish. Angler may also find a bonus Walleye or Northern Pike with some eating sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Green Prairie Fish Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on July 24, 2017. Sampling included trap netting and nearshore sampling completed with seining as well as backpack electrofishing.  Nine trap net locations were sampled along the shoreline in multiple habitat types. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 11 native fish species and none of which were intolerant of habitat disturbance. Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead were the most abundant species by biomass in the trap net gear.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore and trap net survey is combined with data from standard gill survey completed on July 17, 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Green Prairie Fish Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A spring trapnet assessment was conducted in early June to evaluate the panfish population in Green Prairie Lake.  The spring nets were set to replace the summer lake survey trapnets which typicallly catch the smaller bluegills in a lake and few black crappies.  The lake survey that was conducted in mid-July used only gillnets to evaluate the gamefish population.  Six 3'x 5' trapnets were set and lifted over a three day period for a total of 12 net lifts in the 2006 spring panfish assessment. <br> \n     The netting effort sampled 341 bluegills between 2.7 and 8.4 inches in length for a catch rate of 28.4/trapnet.  Mean length for the catch was 5.6 inches with 10% (n=33) of the fish exceeding 7 inches.  A similar assessment in 2000 with 25 net lifts captured 590 bluegills (23.6/trapnet) ranging from 1.1 to 10.3 inches in length.  Mean length was 6.2 inches with 47% (n=277) of the fish between 6 - 7 inches and 22% (n=132) exceeding 7 inches.  The lake management goal for bluegill is to maintain a spring trapnet catch where at least 20% of the fish exceed 7 inches in length.  The 2006 summer gillnets sampled only 44 bluegills which were between 4 and 8.3 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 6.3 inches with 54% (n=25) being between 6 and 7 inches in length and 15% (n=7) exceeding 7 inches.  Ages 1 and 4 - 10 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with the majority of the age groups displaying normal growth.  Year class strengths suggest consistent recruitment. <br> \n      Only 7 black crappies between 8 to 10.2 inches in length were caught in the 2006 spring assessment.  Mean length for the fish was 8.8 inches with 28% (n=2) of the fish more than 9 inches in length.  The lake management goal for crappies is to maintain a spring trapnet catch where at least 50% of the fish exceed 9 inches in length.  A bigger crappie sample was caught in the 2000 panfish assessment where 55 crappies were netted.  Fish in the that sample ranged from 6.8 to 11.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.9 inches which was similar to that seen in 2006 but 64% (n=35) of the fish were over 9 inches.  The 2006 summer lake survey gillnets caught only 4 crappies which were between 4.4 and 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 7 inches.  Ages 2 - 4 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with fast growth being shown in Ages 2 and 3, and normal growth in the older fish. <br> \n      The 2006 spring assessment also sampled 248 pumpkinseeds as well as 6 hybrid sunfish.  The pumpkinseeds were small to average in size, ranging from 3.6 to 6.9 inches in length with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 6 - 6.5 inches.  The hybrid sunfish were between 5.1 to 6.3 inches in length. <br> \n      The gamefish species caught in the 2006 spring assessment included 5 northern pike between 12 and 23 inches in length and 2 largemouth bass between 10 and 12 inches.  Similar results were seen in the 2000 assessment which caught 4 northern pike from 10 to 19 inches and only one 8-inch bass.  Even though walleye are stocked in the lake, the last two panfish assessments have failed to sample any.  <br> \n      The third most common fish species caught in the 2006 spring assessment was yellow bullhead with a catch of 210 fish.  The bullheads measured from 8 to 13 inches in length with a mean length of 10.7 inches.  Yellow bullheads were also abundant in the 2000 assessment where 317 were caught.  None of those bullheads were measured.  A record high yellow bullhead gillnet catch was produced in the 2006 lake survey with a CPUE of 17.7/gillnet recorded.  The catch was also above the third quartile level of 12.1/gillnet for lake class 29 and a significant increase from the 5.8/gillnet seen in 2000.  The lowest catch of 0.7/gillnet was recorded in 1983.  A couple of brown bullheads were caught in the 2006 spring assessment while the summer survey caught black bullhead (n=3) and one brown bullhead.   <br> \n       Some yellow perch (n=7) and bowfin (n=20) were also caught in the 2006 spring assessment <br> \n       An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Green Prairie Fish Lake has undergone significantchanges since the last survey in 1988.  In general, northern pike and walleyenumbers declined while prey abundance increased.     Prior surveys indicate that the northern pike population in Green PrairieFish Lake tends to fluctuate between low and normal levels when compared tosimilar lakes.  Present populations are low and individuals are experiencingexcellent growth, exceeding 26 inches at age 4.  Good growth rates are probablya result of high yellow perch abundance.  Anglers should expect fairly low catchrates of quality sized northern pike.     Walleye abundance is about average when compared to lakes similar to GreenPrairie Fish.  The majority of walleyes caught in the survey were over 20 inchesin length indicating that recent stockings may have been ineffective.  Presentlow northern pike levels and high yellow perch abundance, however, is conduciveto good survival of walleye fingerlings.  Angler reports suggest good walleyefishing success during early season.  Little structure exists in the lake soanglers should concentrate efforts along weedlines.     Green Prairie Fish Lake has a reputation for providing excellent largemouthbass angling.  DNR electrofishing during the spring of 1994 suggests bothquantity and quality are present.  Bass from 12 to 20 inches were wellrepresented in the catch.     Yellow perch abundance increased significantly from the 1988 survey and isabove normal when compared to similar lakes.  This is a desirable situation aspredatory species (northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass) rely heavily onyellow perch as prey for maintaining good growth rates.  Perch also prey heavilyon young bluegills and help prevent sunfish from stunting.     Bluegill abundance was twice what is expected in a lake of this type.  Mostfish caught during the survey were small with only one fish over 7 inches in thesample.  Winter and spring angling pressure is heavy and may impact numbers of\"keeper\" size fish.     Black crappie numbers were about average for this lake class.  Individualsto 10.5 inches were captured in the survey indicating quality sized fish areavailable.  Crappies receive moderate to heavy angling pressure at ice-out alongthe southern shoreline.     Future management will focus on maintenance of water quality and minimizingthe impacts of land use practices in the watershed.  Maintaining a good balancebetween predator and prey will also be a focus in future fisheries management.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Green Prairie Fish Lake is a shallow, 178 acre lake with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Water clarity was fair with a secchi disk reading of 10 feet in the middle of July.   A swimming beach owned by the City of Little Falls is located on the south shore of the lake.  The management goals for the lake focus on largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and bluegills.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years when available.  Several catch rates showed declines since the last survey.  This may have been due to July 2012 as one of the hottest on record.  The excessive heat may have adversely affected fish movement. <br> \n      Spring electrofishing was conducted to evaluate the largemouth bass population.  The catch rate suggests that Green Prairie Fish Lake supports a moderate number of largemouth bass.  The 14-inch average size observed in the spring electrofishing was higher than in most waters with bass up to 18 inches caught.     The northern pike catch was lower than the last survey in 2006 and within management goals for the lake.  Despite fewer numbers, size structure of the pike population was less than desired as few fish in the catch exceeded 24 inches in length.    Although pike over 30 inches were caught, average size was 20.5 inches or about 2 pounds.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from lower pike numbers.   One factor that may influence the harvest of northern pike is that many of the fish had neascus or black spot.   Fish may look bad or unslightly and are released.   Neascus is a trematode or parasite that usually resides in the skin of the fish and usually does not affect the population or cause much mortality.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.   Filleting the fish will remove most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. <br> \n       Even though walleye numbers were down, the summer catch rate was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   The walleye captured in the survey were between 14 and 28 inches with an average size of about 20 inches or about 3.1 pounds.  Anglers reported that the best walleye fishing has typically been in the spring and early ice-up.   The lake has little structure so anglers should concentrate efforts along the weedlines.  <br> \n      Yellow perch numbers continue to show a decline in abundance.   Higher perch numbers are desirable as they can be an important prey species for northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality size individuals.     <br> \n      A panfish trap net assessment targeting bluegill and black crappie was conducted on the lake in early June of 2012.  Panfish assessments will usually show a more accurate picture of the size structure of the adults in the panfish populations than mid-summer nets will.  Average size of the bluegill in the spring assessment was almost six inches with individuals over 9 inches measured.    Black crappie up to 11 inches were caught in the spring assessment but average size was 9 inches.   Anglers reported catching small black crappies in the summer while bigger ones are more common in the winter.  Summer can be good for bluegill angling.        <br> \n      Both brown and yellow bullhead were sampled in the summer survey with yellow bullheads being the most abundant.  Quality size bullheads over 12 inches were present in both species.  Other species that were caught in the spring trap net assessment included bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.   <br> \n      Improving the water quality in the lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners.  Buffer strips along the developed and undeveloped inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake through run-off.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water along with the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will reduce additional nitrogen and phosphorus from entering the water thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Green Prairie Lake is a shallow, 178 acre lake with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Water clarity was fair with a secchi disk reading of 8.7 feet in the middle of July.   Sand was the most common shoal water substrate with abundant vegetation growth out to a depth of 11 feet.  The most common submerged plant species were coontail, flat-stem pondweed, largeleaf pondweed, and wild celery.  The City of Little Falls also has a swimming beach on the south shore of the lake.  The management goals for the lake focus on largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and bluegills.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years when available.\n    Several fish populations in the lake displayed some significant changes since the 2000 survey.  The most notable for fishermen was a decrease in walleye abundance.  Yellow perch abundance also appeared to drop while yellow bullhead numbers went up.  Even though walleye numbers went down, the catch rate was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   The walleye captured in the survey were between 13 and 25 inches with an average size of about 18.5 inches or about 2.4 pounds.  Anglers reported that the best walleye fishing has typically been in the spring and early ice-up.  Fishermen on the lake during the survey reported catching or hearing of an occasional large walleye, some up to 8 pounds.  The lake has little structure so anglers should concentrate efforts along the weedlines.\n     Northern pike numbers stayed about same as in the last survey and even though the catch rate fell within the normal range for this type of lake it was above the desired management goal.  A wide range of sizes was seen in the survey, from 15 to 31 inches in length.  Average size of the pike was about 21 inches or 2.3 pounds.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from lower pike numbers.   The drop in perch abundance may be result of the high pike numbers as the perch can be an important prey species for northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  One factor that may make the possession of northern pike undesirable to fishermen is that many of the fish had neascus or black spot.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that usually resides in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.   Filleting the fish will remove most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans can not be infested.\n     A panfish assessement targetting bluegills was conducted on the lake in early June of 2006.  Panfish assessments will usually show a more accurate picture of the size structure of the adults in the panfish populations than summer nets will.  Average size of the bluegill in the spring assessment was almost six inches with individuals over 8 inches being measured.  The few black crappies that were caught in the spring assessment and summer survey were not that impressive.  The biggest crappie caught was just over 10 inches with the rest being under 9 inches in length.  Anglers reported catching small black crappies in the summer while bigger ones are more common in the winter along with some nice bluegills.  Neither of the netting efforts in 2006 produced much for a largemouth bass catch.  Spring electrofishing which is usually conducted to evaluate the bass in a lake was not done.  The last survey in 2000 indicated that Green Prairie Fish Lake has an abundant bass population and anglers also reported catching lots of bass this year.  Green Prairie Fish Lake has shown in the past that the lake can produce trophy size fish up to 20 inches although bass under 12 inches are more common.  \n     Yellow perch also provide some angling action but the presence of both neascus and yellow grub make most of the fish undesirable to anglers.  All three species of bullhead, black, brown, and yellow, were sampled in the survey with yellow bullheads being the most abundant.  Quality size bullheads over 12 inches were present in all three species.  Other species in the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.  The spring assessment also caught some green sunfish and hybrid sunfish.\n      Improving the water quality in the lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners.  Buffer strips along the developed and undeveloped inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake through run-off.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water along with the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will reduce additional nitrogen and phosphorus from entering the water thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has a good website that provides information for shoreline property owners.\n\nMPCA - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\"\n   www.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html\n     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Prairie Fish Lake is a 182 acre bass/panfish lake located north of Little Falls, MN.  Daytime electrofishing was performed on May 28 and September 28, 2020 to provide mid-term evaluation of the 10 fish bag limit on sunfish which was implemented on March 1, 2016.   The lower bag limit is intended to reduce the harvest of sunfish while improving the sizes of sunfish available to anglers.  The goal is to have the lake produce more 7 to 9 inch sunfish which are most desired by anglers.  Evaluations of lakes that have had similar reduced bag limits for several years have shown that most respond favorably and produce larger sunfish.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating Bluegill populations, however electrofishing was employed due to staff/time shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The May electrofishing produced a sample with a Bluegill length frequency similar to previous spring trap net assessments.  Fall electrofishing was added to enhance the sample and determine the efficacy of fall sampling.  Future evaluations relating to the 10 sunfish bag limit will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring Electrofishing appeared to be moderately efficient in terms of numbers of Bluegill sampled with 142 fish captured in just over 34 minutes of on-time.   Bluegill appeared to be in primarily a pre-spawn stage and most were located in relatively deep water.  Spring electrofished Bluegill ranged from 3.0 - 8.9 inches in length with most length groups well represented up to 8 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 27.5% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up over 6% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing provided a larger sample of 229 fish but much more effort was expended with almost 1.75 hours of on-time recorded.  Fall Bluegill ranged from 3.1-8.4 inches in length.  Fall and spring electrofishing size structures were similar as 25% of the fall sample exceeded 7 inches and 3.5% were over 8 inches.  Fish over 9 inches were absent from both efforts.  Aging structures (otoliths) were extracted in the 2017 spring trap net assessment with the fish displaying below average growth for the area (average length of 6.17 inches at Age 5) and most fish did not sustain their growth past 7.5 inches.  Based on the present electrofishing data there has been little or no improvement to the Bluegill size structure since the enactment of the reduced bag limit. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious spring trap net surveys were conducted in 2000, 2006, 2012, 2014 and 2017.  Trap nets have provided larger sample sizes of 328 to 728 fish.  Bluegill over 7 inches in spring trap net efforts have comprised 10-26% of the catch and fish over 9 inches were observed in 2000 and 2012.  Bluegill greater than 8 inches constituted 0.5-3.7% of the past spring trap net samples. Maximum size in 2017 was 8.50 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were observed in large numbers during spring electrofishing and were in spawning mode.  Although no Black Crappie were netted and measured it appeared that few were larger than 9 inches.  A moderate number of Black Crappie were also noted during fall electrofishing.       <br> \n     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As part of a six-year, regularly scheduled monitoring plan, a standard survey using six gill nets and nine trap nets was completed the week of July 17 on Green Prairie Fish Lake. In addition, one hour of daylight electrofishing was completed on May 17 to evaluate Largemouth Bass. The last standard survey was completed in 2017. Walleye, Northern Pike and especially Yellow Perch populations appear to be doing well, catch rates for all three species were higher than in 2017. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Walleye, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Prairie Fish Lake has good numbers of Walleyes at this time, the highest we've seen since 1988. The majority of Walleyes sampled measured over 18 inches, many fish were products of a fingerling stocking in 2015; these fish averaged 22.3 inches. Past stocking strategies have employed fry, fingerling, yearling, and adult fish to establish a fishery. Success over the years has been mixed. Some stockings have resulted in good year classes but years when no stocking was completed have also resulted in good year classes indicating that a fishable year class can be produced naturally without the help of stocking. In addition to the good numbers of Walleye we saw good numbers of Yellow Perch. Their lengths ranged from 5.3-11.1 inches and growth appears to be very good compared to other area lakes. The largest percentage of the sample (64%) was comprised of 2 year-old fish measuring 6.0-8.5 inches. Healthy numbers of perch help sustain Northern Pike populations however, in many lakes, pike abundance has grown to levels that exhaust the prey base perch often provide. While an increasing trend in pike abundance is not evident at this time, we did record a higher catch rate than in years past. From a management standpoint, we prefer to see fewer pike, but it is too early to tell if future abundance will be problematic. Individual pike measured showed that 70% were from 15 to 21 inches. The largest pike measured was 26.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass fishery is healthy and remains similar in abundance to that of 2017. Size structure of the sample collected by electrofishing showed approximately a third of adult fish captured measured 15 inches or more. Maximum length was 18.3 inches. Almost all near-shore areas on Green Prairie Fish provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass and the recent installment of a fishing pier adjacent to the boat ramp will provide more public fishing opportunities for bass and other species. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were set during this survey to evaluate numbers and sizes of Bluegills, Pumpkinseeds, and crappies. A 10 fish bag limit for sunfish was enacted on the lake in 2016. This regulation is currently under evaluation with spring trap netting as the primary assessment tool with the next effort scheduled for 2025. Early results indicate that the lake is producing a few more 8-9 inch Bluegills. Crappie populations have proven to be more difficult to assess with our gear and may warrant additional efforts to provide the necessary information.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Prairie Lake is a shallow, 178 acre lake with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  Water clarity was fair with a secchi disk reading of 6 1/2 feet in the middle of July.  Management goals for the lake focus on largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and bluegills.     Several fish populations in the lake displayed some significant changes from the 1994 survey.  In general, northern pike numbers increased while some panfish species and yellow bullheads declined.  Prior surveys indicate that the northern pike population tends to fluctuate between low and normal levels when compared to similar lakes.  The present population abundance appeared normal, but was above the management goal for the lake.Anglers report small northern pike are common.       Walleye abundance was high when compared to similar type lakes.  A variety of sizes should be available for anglers with fish up to 28 inches in length recorded.  Fishing reports from anglers suggest the best fishing has been in the spring and early ice-up.  Little structure exists in the lake so anglers should concentrate efforts along the weedlines.     Green Prairie has an abundant largemouth bass population.  While many of bass seen in the spring electrofishing were between 10 and 11 inches, fish over 16 inches were measured.  Bass up to 20 inches have been documented in past surveys, indicating the lake can produce trophy size fish.     Bluegill abundance was normal in the summer survey, but a significant decline was evident from the 1994 survey.  A spring assessment targetting bluegills found many bluegills over 6 inches in length.  Fishing pressure for bluegill can be heavy at times on the lake.     Abundance of yellow perch appears normal for this type of lake with a wide range of sizes available to both anglers and predator fish.  Perch can be an important food source for fish species, especially northern pike and walleye.  Abundance of perch can effect growth and abundance of the larger gamefish and bluegills as well.       Green Prairie Lake has a been known to provide good black crappie action, especially in the spring.  Crappies from 9 to 10 inches in length were common in the spring assessment with fish up to 11 inches measured.       Other fish species providing angling opportunities include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, pumpkinseeds, and yellow bullheads.  Quality bullheads over 11 inches in length were common in both brown and yellow bullhead catches.     Neascus or black spot was common on the yellow perch, northern pike, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and walleye.  Yellow grubs were also common in the yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycles of the both parasites also include fish-eating birds, such as blue herons.  Skinning the fish usually removes most of the neascus, while the yellow grubs can be in the flesh of fish.  Cooking will kill both parasites, humans cannot be infested.     Anglers are encouraged to harvest the small northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger ones.  Keeping the small northerns will reduce competion for food, thus improving growth rates of remaining pike and reducing predation on perch, bass, and juvenile walleye.  Improving water quality in the lake should be a high priorty of the lakeshore owners.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore will reduce nutrients entering the lake through run-off.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water along with the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will reduce additional nitrogen and phosphorus from entering the lake thus keeping down excessive algae and vegetation growth.</p>",

Much of the shoreline was electrofished in a single run.  A new shocker boat was used along with two netters.  The results may not comparable to previous electrofishing efforts which were conducted at night with one netter and an older boat. <br> \n       A total of 46 largemouth bass were netted in one hour of on-time.  The fish ranged from 5.8 to 17.8 inches in length with a mean length of 10.1 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 12 - 13 inches with a PSD of 65.  The lake management goal for Green Prairie is to have a catch rate of more than 60 bass per hour with a PSD from 30 to 50.  The PSD for the 2009 bass catch was better than the lake management goal but the catch rate was less than desired.  Night electrofishing efforts in 2000 and 1994 produced catches of 95.5/hour and 61.2/hour, respectively, which met the management goal.  The PSDs of 26 and 28, respectively, however, were both below the lake management goal.  Fish in the 2000 bass assessment measured from 3.1 to 16.5 inches in length with a mean length of 10.5 inches.  In 1994, bass up to 19.9 inches were netted and the mean length was 10.3 inches.  No scales were taken for age and growth data.   <br> \n       Five black crappie between 7 and 11 inches in length were also netted and measured in the 2009 electrofishing assessment.   <br> \n       Green Prairie Fish Lake was the only lake in 2009 to have a reduced catch rate with the new electrofishing boat during the day verse the older boat at night.  Other factors, such as water temperature, however, may have had an effect on the catch rate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Spring panfish assessments have been used to evaluate the Black Crappie and Bluegill populations in Green Prairie Fish Lake since 2000.  Green Prairie is being proposed in 2015 for a ten fish bag limit for Bluegill.  All fish in the panfish assessment were identified and most were measured.  Bluegill lengths were subsampled due to the high catch.  Scales were taken from both Bluegill and Black Crappie for additional age and growth analysis. <br> \n       The 2014 panfish assessment effort in mid-June produced the highest Bluegill catch of the four panfish assessments with 708 Bluegill sampled.  Previous assessments had catches of 328 Bluegill in 2012, 341 in 2006, and 590 in 2000.  Although fewer Bluegill were caught in the 2000 panfish assessment, the catch produced the highest total weight, 119 pounds compared to 117 pounds in 2014. <br> \n       Bluegill in the 2014 panfish assessment measured from 3.2 to 8.9 inches in length with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Modal length was 5.5 - 6 inches and 16% (n=113) of the fish exceeded seven inches.  Bluegill greater than eight inches accounted for approximately 4% (n=26) of the catch.   The 2006 panfish assessment produced comparable results to the 2014 assessment.  Bluegill that exceeded seven inches accounted for 10% (n=33) of the catch with 3% (n=9) more than eight inches in length.  As in 2014 none of the 2006 Bluegill were over nine inches.   Mean length was slightly shorter in 2006 at 5.6 inches and modal length was also smaller, 5 - 5.5 inches. <br> \n       Catches in 2012 and 2000 displayed more desirable size structure characteristics.  Two Bluegill greater than nine inches were caught in the 2012 panfish assessment while a 10-inch Bluegill was sampled in the 2000 panfish assessment.   Fish that exceeded seven inches comprised 22% of the catch in both assessments, although in 2012 that was 72 fish compared to 132 fish in 2000.  There were eight fish (2%) in the 2012 panfish assessment greater than eight inches and 16 fish (3%) in 2000.  Nine-inch Bluegill accounted for 0.6% (n=2) in 2012 and 0.8% (n=5) in 2000. <br> \n       The Bluegill management goal for Green Prairie Fish Lake is to have at least 20% of the fish caught in a spring panfish assessment exceed seven inches in length.  The goal was met in both 2012 and 2000 but not in 2014 and 2006. <br> \n       Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the 2014 Bluegill sample with two year classes from 2009 and 2010 each contributing approximately 38% of the sample.   All age groups displayed fast growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Black Crappie have proven to be a difficult species to sample in Green Prairie Fish Lake.  Sixteen crappie were caught in the 2014 panfish assessment, 15 in the 2012 assessment, and seven in the 2006 panfish assessment.  Crappie were more cooperative in 2000 with 55 fish sampled in that panfish assessment.   <br> \n       Small crappie dominated the 2014 panfish assessment with only 12% (n=2) of the fish larger than nine inches.  The longest crappie measured was 9.3 inches, but mean length for the sample was 8.1 inches with modal lengths of 7 - 7.5 and 8.5 - 9 inches.  Ten-inch plus crappie were sampled in both 2012 and 2006 while 11-inch plus fish were caught in 2000.  The 2012 and 2000 panfish assessments displayed the most desirable crappie size structures with 67% (n=10) of the fish greater than nine inches in 2012 and 64% (n=35) in 2000.  Modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches in both panfish assessments also as well.  <br> \n        The 2012 and 2000 panfish assessments were also the only two panfish assessment to meet the Black Crappie management goal of having at least 50% of the spring trap net catch exceed nine inches. <br> \n       Ages 3 through 6 were represented in the 2014 spring crappie catch with the majority of fish from the 2011 year class (56%).  Growth rates were variable between the age groups with age 3 fish showing fast growth, ages 4 and 5 normal growth and age 6 slow growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n        Spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass has also provided an additional opportunity to collect Black Crappie data although with limited success.  While electrofishing in 2012 for bass, eight crappie between 5.1 and 9.6 inches were netted.  Mean length for the catch was 8.6 inches and 50% (n=4) of the fish exceeded nine inches.  Five crappie were netted in a 2009 spring electrofishing assessment.  The fish ranged from 7.8 to 10.8 inches in length with a mean length of 9.2 inches and 40% (n=2) more than nine inches in length. <br> \n       Game fish species sampled in the 2014 panfish assessment included seven Walleye between 12 and 24 inches in length, one 14-inch Northern Pike, and four Largemouth Bass between six and 10 inches in length.  Other fish species sampled in the assessment included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Pumpkinseed was the second most abundant species in the 2014 panfish assessment with 85 fish between four and seven inches caught.   <br> \n       Spring trap net assessment have proven useful for evaluating the Bluegill population in Green Prairie Fish Lake.  The spring netting so far has also provided the highest Black Crappie catches of any gear type used in the lake.  Black Crappie gill net catches have ranged from one to eight fish.  Spring trap nets will continue to be used to evaluate the panfish populations in Green Prairie Fish Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Spring daytime electrofishing was employed in 2019 on Green Prairie Fish Lake to calculate a population estimate for Largemouth Bass.  The lake was electrofished on five separate dates between May 6 and June 10.  Bass were marked with a partial left pelvic fin clip to facilitate a mark-recapture population estimate of fish greater than 8 inches.  The purpose of obtaining a population estimate was to aid in the determination of the relationship between catch per unit effort and actual population size.  Local Fisheries Management staff have been collecting population estimate data on a small number of lakes each spring with the intent of compiling sufficient data to assess catch per unit effort and whether it actually reflects abundance.  All bass captured were measured but no aging structures were taken.  The largest catches of bass were observed during the earlier spring efforts.  Catch rates fell noticeably during the last sampling effort on June 10. <br> \n <br> \n     A total of 444 Largemouth Bass were measured during sampling efforts.   The catch rate for the total combined efforts was 82.1 per hour.  Fish ranged in length from 3 to 20.2 inches and mean length was 13 inches.  Largemouth Bass are a primary management species on Green Prairie Fish Lake with corresponding goals of at least 80 fish per hour of electrofishing.  The population of bass greater than 8 inches was calculated at 1813 fish (95% confidence interval 1325-2552).  In comparison, a population estimate conducted in 2018 on Pierz Fish Lake produced a catch rate of 101 per hour and a population estimate of 2906 bass greater than 8 inches.   The 2019 results were typical for Green Prairie Fish Lake and suggest a relatively stable population with consistent reproduction.  Anglers seeking bass should find good numbers and a range of sizes with some potential for larger fish over 20 inches.  Harvest of bass over 16 inches should be considered carefully as many of these fish may be 10 to 15 years old or even older. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Spring panfish assessments have been used to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations in Green Prairie Fish Lake since 2000.   Six standard lake survey trap nets were set in early June of 2012 and lifted twice.  All fish were identified and most were measured so the data could be used to calculate an IBI score.  Scales were taken from both the crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.  A scheduled population assessment was conducted in mid-July using gill nets to evaluate other portions of the game fish population. <br> \n       Fifteen black crappie (1.3/TN) were sampled in the 2012 panfish assessment.  The fish measured from 7.7 to 10.9 inches in length with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  Modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches with 67% (n=10) more than nine inches and 12% (n=2) exceeding ten inches in length. <br> \n      The 2006 panfish assessment, also in early June, netted seven crappie between 8.2 and 10.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Two of the fish (29%) were more than nine inches in length and one (14%) exceeded ten inches.  All of the fish were from two to four years of age. <br> \n      The 2000 panfish assessment, conducted at the end of May, was the most successful panfish assessment to sample black crappie, capturing 55 (2.2/TN).  The fish ranged from 6.8 to 11.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.9 inches.  Modal length was the same as in 2012, 9 - 9.5 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches comprised 64% (n=35) of the sample with 9% (n=5) more than ten inches in length.   <br> \n      The 2012 and 2000 panfish assessments met the lake management goal of maintaining a black crappie catch where at least 50% of the spring catch exceeds nine inches in length.  Ages 3 through 5 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment.  Age 3 and 4 fish displayed normal growth and Age 5 fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back Calculated Length table.  The 2008 year class (Age 4) accounted for 73% (n=11) of the catch. <br> \n      A total of 328 bluegill (27.3/TN) were sampled in the 2012 panfish assessment.  The fish measured from 3.2 - 9.6 inches in length with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Modal length was 5.5 - 6 inches with 22% (n=72) more than seven inches in length, 2% (n=8) exceeding eight inches, and 0.6% (n=2) more than nine inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment with all of the year classes exhibiting fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back Calculated Length table.  Year class strengths suggest high mortality after Age 6. <br> \n      The 2006 panfish assessment produced 341 bluegill (28.4/TN) between 2.6 and 8.4 inches in length with a mean length of 5.6 inches.  Modal length was 5 - 5.5 inches with 10% (n=33) exceeding seven inches and 3% (n=9) more than eight inches in length.  There were seven year classes represented in the sample which displayed normal to fast growth. <br> \n      Bluegill in the 2000 panfish assessment numbered 590 (23.6/TN).  The fish ranged from 1.2 to 10.3 inches in length with a mean length of 6.2 inches.  Modal length was 6.5 - 7 inches with 22% (n=132) exceeding seven inches, 3% (n=16) exceeding eight inches, 0.8% (n=5) exceeding nine inches, and 0.2% (n=1) more than ten inches in length.  A strong year class from 1995 (age 5) accounted for 52% of the catch. <br> \n      Two of the panfish assessments, 2012 and 2000, met the lake management goal and maintained a spring bluegill catch where at least 20% of the fish exceeded seven inches. <br> \nAn ice-out assessment in 1997 was very effective at catching bluegill, netting 3969 fish.  Only 8% (n=299) bluegill were measured and they ranged from 3.2 to 8.3 inches in length with a mean length of 6.2 inches.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 21% (n=63) of the measured sample with 1% (n=4) more than eight inches in length.  <br> \n      Only two crappie around six inches in length were sampled in the summer gill nets along with eleven bluegill between 3.8 and 8.3 inches in length.  While conducting spring electrofishing for largemouth bass in 2012, eight crappie were netted.  The fish measured from 5.1 to 9.6 inches in length with seven of the fish over eight inches and 4 (50%) exceeding nine inches. <br> \n      Game fish species that were sampled in the 2012 panfish assessment included four largemouth bass, seven northern pike, and three walleye.  Other fish species caught included bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  The 2012 panfish assessment caught eleven fish species while the summer gillnets caught seven species.  The four spring species not caught in the summer were bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  </p>",

NORTHERN PIKE are abundant but small.BLUEGILLS are present in good size and numbers as shown in the N.R.C.  They did not show up well in the trapnets or gillnets.  Movement in shallow water may have been affected by high water temperatures.  BULLHEAD numbers are high despite some removal in the winter of 1982.  BLACK CRAPPIE numbers seem to be low, but large size fish are caught.  YELLOW PERCH are present in good numbers and size.  LARGEMOUTH BASS are present in mostly smaller sizes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed June 8-14 to provide data on the Bluegill size structure and evaluate effects of a 10 fish bag limit on sunfish which was implemented on March 1, 2016.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake five previous times since 2000.  Future evaluations relating to the 10 sunfish bag limit will incorporate spring trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2022 captured 282 Bluegill all of which were measured.   Spring sample sizes in the past ranged from 328-708 fish.  Bluegill in 2022 ranged from 2.4- 9.84 inches and mean length was 6.26 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 22% of the catch, fish greater than 8 inches made up 7% of the sample and over 3% exceeded 9 inches.  The previous trap net assessment completed in 2017 exhibited a size structure with 26% exceeding 7 inches, 0.5% over 8 inches and none over 9 inches.  Maximum length was 8.5 inches and mean length was 6.08 inches.  Bluegill over 9 inches were also absent in 2014.   Bluegill size structure goals aim for at least 25% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 5% to exceed 8 inches, 2% over 9 inches and the presence of fish 10 inches or longer.  The 2022 results indicate attainment of the goals for fish exceeding 8 and 9 inches while falling slightly short of the goals for proportion over 7 inches and maximum size of 10 inches or more.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include:  mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.  When combining the four pre-regulation spring trap net surveys mean size was 5.88 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches was 1.1/net, and mean length of the top 10% was 7.82 inches.  The catch rate of Bluegill over 8 inches in 2022 was 1.2/net.  In 2022, mean length was 6.26 inches and the mean length of the top 10% was 8.65 inches with both metrics suggesting improvement since the regulations were enacted.   Most Bluegill in Green Prairie Fish Lake display slow growth reaching 7 inches by Age 7, so the large fish being harvested by anglers are likely 7 to 10 years old and possibly older. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and the lake's catches have demonstrated this variability.  Spring trap net catches in the lake have ranged from 7 to 55 fish.  A total of 10 crappies were captured in 2022 ranging in size from 6.6 to 10.6 inches, mean length was 8.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseeds were captured in moderate numbers in 2022 with 51 fish sampled ranging up to 8.46 inches.  Fish over 7 inches accounted for 18% of the catch.   Nine Walleye were observed ranging in length from 16.9 to 24.7 inches with a mean size of 22.5 inches.  Three Northern Pike were netted with the largest measuring 33.7 inches. <br> \n</p>",
