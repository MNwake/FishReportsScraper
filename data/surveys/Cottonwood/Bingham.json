                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is a shallow prairie lake located just north of the city of Bingham Lake.  Walleye fishing is often good from the fishing opener through June.  Since Bingham Lake is only 259 acres and near two population centers, it may experience over-harvest more than other area lakes. The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species channel catfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch as secondary species.The walleye population was lower than the goals set by the Windom Fisheries staff.  Bingham Lake generally receives a fair amount of fishing pressure for the first month of the fishing season just before our lake evaluation.  Additionally, one year old walleye are often too small in mid June to catch in our nets.  These two reasons partially explain why the population appears to be lower than desired.  However, the netting information still suggests the walleye population is low and that there is room for improvement.  It is believed the walleye population can be improved with the new stocking plan that has been initiated.  Starting in 1999, walleye fry will be stocked three of every four years in Bingham Lake.  If this new stocking plan is effective, anglers should begin to experience better walleye angling in about three years.Walleye from two to seven years old were aged in 1998.  Four of the six year classes were a result of natural reproduction.  Naturally produced fingerlings were also found during the fall of 1998 while conducting night electrofishing.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.7 to 25.3 inches and averaged about 18.0 inches.  As a result of a new stocking plan and natural reproduction, walleye fishing should be fair and then improve during the next few years.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all affect the success of a given year class.  In 1998, yellow perch numbers were very low compared to just four years ago.  Yellow perch fishing will probably be slow for the next few years as the population rebounds from this low period.In 1998, black crappie numbers were the highest ever recorded in Bingham Lake.  Black crappie numbers were better than 75% of lakes similar to Bingham Lake.  Most of the black crappie sampled in 1998 ranged from 6.0 to 9.0 inches.  Black crappie were aged from two to five years old with a strong 1995 year class representing 88% of the fish sampled.  It should take a year or two before fish from the strong 1995 year class attains a size that interest anglers.   Additional species you may catch while fishing Bingham Lake include bluegill, pumkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, channel catfish, and northern pike.  As of 1998, these species were not very abundant but they might contribute to a fun day on the water.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Bingham Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nBingham Lake is a 274-acre lake located near the City of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County.  Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet, a shoreline length of 3.2 miles.  Bingham Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 5-to-1 indicating a small watershed when compared to lake acreage.  The lake is aerated in most years during ice cover by the Cottonwood County Sportsman's Club, but remains susceptible to low oxygen conditions during winter.  Bingham Lake has had several recently documented fish kill events in the past 15 years as a result of low oxygen levels.  During 2008 there was a summerkill event following an algae bloom resulting in low oxygen levels due to decomposition of algae.  Oxygen levels were below 2 parts per million (ppm) and numerous dead Walleye, Channel Catfish, and Fathead Minnows were observed.  When dissolved oxygen is less than 2 ppm the fish populations start to run the risk of mortality due to low oxygen. During the winter of 2013-2014 large amounts of snow cover and cold weather, coupled with a non-functional aeration system, led to increased duration of low to no light penetration on the lake which led to low dissolved oxygen levels.  The lake experienced a severe winterkill of the fish population and the lake's fish population was substantially depleted.  Only Black Bullhead were found alive in netting and electrofishing in the spring of 2014.  Therefore, an intensive re-stocking effort occurred to re-introduce Bluegill, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  A targeted survey was conducted during August 2015 to assess the re-introduction of fish into Bingham Lake.  The re-introduction was successful with common carp absent from netting. Since then, Bingham Lake has been a part of a Walleye study looking at the potential advantage of a local strain of Walleye in relation to a northern Minnesota strain that has historically been stocked.  A standard survey was conducted during June 2022 to assess the continued recovery of the fish community and evaluate the performance of Walleye stocking with 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.    <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Walleye were sampled in gill nets (n=19) and trap nets (n=3).  The gill net catch rate of 6.3 per gill net is the third greatest catch observed but is less than the long-term average of 8.4 per gill net. Walleye caught in gill nets ranged in length from 13.1 inches to 25.9 inches with an average length of 20.1 inches.  The length distribution of the fish in the gill net and trap net sample was good with many harvestable sized fish.  With the exception of a few adult fish in the sample, the overall body condition was good with many healthy looking fish. While Walleye in the sample had an excellent length and weight distributions, catch rates have declined in recent years. Windom Area Fisheries Staff want to continue to develop and sustain good Walleye populations in SW Minnesota.  Therefore, the Walleye population of Bingham Lake was part of a long-term study.  Southwest Minnesota has seen increasing interest with Walleye genetics as the Lake Sarah Walleye strain (aka Canon River Strain) is gaining notoriety.  Lake Sarah Walleye eggs have been fertilized and collected since 2015 by Windom Area DNR staff and those fish are now being stocked and established in southern Minnesota lakes.  To determine whether those fish perform and persist better than northern strains of Walleye used historically, same numbers of Lake Sarah strain Walleye fry and Upper Mississippi strain Walleye fry were stocked each year since 2018.  The study was just completed in 2022, and final results should be available soon.   Very early indications are showing that there is an advantage with Lake Sarah strain Walleye, but the exact impact is not known at this point.  Even so, some lakes still require advanced age stocking to help maintain a good number of fishable Walleye, which may be the case for Bingham Lake.      <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were re-introduced following the 2013 to 2014 winterkill due to the re-emergence of aquatic vegetation (mostly clasping leaf pondweed) that provided excellent habitat.  In 2022, the trap net catch rate of 4.6 per trap net is within the interquartile range but much less than the catch rate in 2018.  The Bluegill in the trap nets ranged in length from 3.4 to 9.1 inches with a mean length of 4.7 inches.  Aquatic vegetation continues to be present and is a major factor in the persistence of a Bluegill population.  The entirely native submerged vegetation that is currently in Bingham Lake is providing habitat for Bluegill and refuge for them to hide from predators.  As a result of this excellent habitat the population appeared to boom during 2018 and is most likely at a more sustainable, albeit lower level now.  Angling should be good for numbers and decent sized Bluegill over the next several years.    <br> \n    <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nSixty-five Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and 29 Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets.  Gill net and trap net catch rates of 21.7 per gill net and 3.2 per trap net were toward the upper range of the expected quartiles for both.  However, the gill net catch rate was less than the long-term average of 25.0 per gill net. Yellow Perch sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 5.6 to 11.0 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  In trap nets Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 10.5 inches with a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Body condition of the Yellow Perch in the sample was less than average, but the fish appeared healthy. Yellow Perch appear to be well established with a balanced size structure.  The population of Yellow Perch should increase in Bingham Lake as they continue to reestablish after the 2014 winterkill and subsequent restocking.  Angling could be very good in the near future.       <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Bingham Lake included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  Black Bullhead catch rates were 135.7 per gill net and 89.2 per trap net, both above expected catch rate ranges.  Black Crappie trap net catch rate was 0.3 per trap net, or 3 fish.  Pumpkinseed trap net catch rate was 2.3 per trap net for a total of 21 fish.  Common Carp were absent in 2022, along with every netting or electrofishing sampling event that was done since the winterkill of 2014.  Bingham Lake is currently a simple fish community with decent abundances of managed gamefish.       <br> \n  <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Bingham Lake has rebounded well from the winterkill in 2013-2014.  Angling has been good for Yellow Perch and large Walleye in recent years.  Northern Pike catch rates should increase with a growing population.  Continued stocking of yearling or adult Walleye will occur and Yellow Perch will be stocked if the gill net catch rate is less than 2.0 per net in any survey.  In the meantime, barring another winterkill or summerkill, angling on Bingham Lake should be good, if not excellent.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is primarily managed for walleye.  The walleye population received a tremendous amount of anglerharvest just before it was sampled in June of 1994.  As a result, the walleye population was relatively low.  Mostof the walleye sampled were from 15 to 20 inches.  The future of the walleye population should be good becausenatural reproduction has been documented and we plan to stock it on a rotational basis.  However, due to therelatively small size of the lake and its location to population centers (fishing pressure), the fishery willlikely fluctuate greatly.     Through a marking study we were able to estimate that 884 one year old walleye were present as a result ofnatural reproduction in 1993.  That corresponds to just over 3 one year old walleye per acre.  Windom Fisheriesintends to continue monitoring walleye natural reproduction in Bingham Lake to better manage the resource.     Yellow perch have really bounced back from four years ago.  Two strong year classes were produced in 1992and 1993, resulting in abundant 5.0 to 9.0 inch yellow perch.  These fish will soon grow into the length rangeanglers prefer.     Additional species you may encounter while fishing Bingham Lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, blackcrappie, pumpkinseed, northern pike, and black bullhead.  As of 1994, these species were not real abundant butthey would contribute to a day on the water.</p>",

Since 2018, Bingham Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium.  Walleye stocking, including the performance evaluation, was restarted in 2021. The total fry quota for Bingham Lake was 137,000, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Bingham Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance in 2022, 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed. Night electrofishing was used to collect the Walleye for the study.  Standard night electrofishing (2 hours) was conducted by DNR research staff on 16 September 2022. <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was not met with standard night electrofishing as no fingerlings were captured during 2 hours of electrofishing (0 per hour).  Additional non-standard sampling utilizing day electrofishing and trap netting also failed to capture any fingerling Walleye.  Therefore, no information regarding the genetic results could be obtained for 2022.  While no fingerling were sampled in 2022, a standard survey was conducted during June 2022 where 22 adults were sampled.  In addition, 9 adults were sampled while electrofishing for fingerlings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is a 274-acre lake located near the City of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County. Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, a shoreline length of 3.2 miles, and is a class 43 lake.  The Cottonwood County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) applied for a Clean Water Partnership grant with the Pollution Control Agency in 2010 but was unsuccessful.  We will continue to encourage and work with the SWCD to apply for the grant again in 2011.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye while largemouth bass, yellow perch, channel catfish, black crappie, and northern pike are managed secondarily.  Bingham has been treated annually for several years with copper sulphate to control algae blooms.  There was a die-off of algae resulting in low oxygen levels due to the decomposition of the algae during the summer of 2008 causing a fairly significant summerkill on the lake.  Oxygen levels were below 2 parts per million (ppm) and numerous dead walleye, channel catfish, and fathead minnows were observed. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population has recovered from the summerkill in 2008.  Walleye numbers are higher than they have ever been on Bingham Lake since we have been doing population assessments on the lake.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 32.0 compared to 3.7 in 2006 and 1.3 in 2002.  No walleye were sampled when we did a special survey in 2008 to assess the extent of the summerkill.  The walleye sampled in 2010 had total lengths ranging from 12.3 to 18.2 inches, with an average length of 15.9 inches.  The majority of fish were in the 15 to 18 inch range.  The fishery will likely provide some good fishing for walleye in the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is also doing very well in Bingham Lake.  The gill net catch rate of 20.5 fish per net was down slightly from the survey in 2006, but considered very good for lakes similar to Bingham Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets in 2010 ranged from 9.1 to 12.2 inches and averaged 10.9 inches.  Many of the yellow perch were in the 11 to 12 inch range.  These sizes of fish are highly desirable for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers are up some when compared to the other fish surveys done on Bingham Lake and are about what we would expect for lakes similar to Bingham.  Lengths of black crappie caught in gill nets ranged from 4.6 to 10.8 inches and had an average length of 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead have provided excellent fishing opportunities in the past on Bingham Lake and based on our fish survey results, should provide excellent opportunities in the future.  Good numbers of large black bullhead were caught in our nets in 2010.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 6.1 to 15.4 inches and averaged 11.3 inches.  The majority of black bullhead caught were in the 11 to 13 inch range.  The summerkill in 2008 had little effect on the black bullhead population. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the fish survey included bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, pumpkinseed, fathead minnow, orangespotted sunfish, and johnny darter.  <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Bingham Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, a shoreline length of 3.2 miles, and is a class 43 lake.  Bingham Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 5-to-1 indicating a small watershed when compared to lake acreage.  The lake is aerated by the Cottonwood County Game and Fish League, but remains susceptible to low oxygen conditions during winter.  Bingham Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Channel Catfish, and Black Crappie.  Bingham Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 6, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 20.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was somewhat successful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 4.4 to 7.3 inches and averaged 5.0 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham lake is a 259 acre lake located just north of the city of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County.  The lake has 3.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 10.0 feet.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while largemouth bass, yellow perch, black crappie, channel catfish, and northern pike are managed secondarily.Results from our survey indicated that the walleye population is low when compared to lakes similar to Bingham.  To address this low number, the Division of Fisheries has changed it's management plan to stock Bingham three out of four years rather than every other year.  When electrofishing for largemouth bass, many small walleye were observed along the shoreline.  These fish would have been too small to capture in our nets.  The largest walleye sampled was seven years old and 24.2 inches in length.The yellow perch population was similar to other lakes like Bingham.  Lengths of perch ranged from 5.7 to 11.5 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.For those of you who enjoy channel catfish, the population in Bingham is high.  Lengths of channel catfish ranged from 21.3 to 25.3 inches and averaged 23.3 inches.  The average weight was 3.4 pounds.The black bullhead population is similar to lakes like Bingham.  Lengths of bullhead ranged from 9.6 to 11.7 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.We know black crappie, northern pike, and bluegill are present in Bingham Lake but none were sampled in gill or trap nets.  We did however sample young of the year black crappie and bluegill while shoreline seining.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bingham Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nBingham Lake is a 274-acre lake located near the City of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County.  Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet, a shoreline length of just over 3 miles, and is a class 43 lake (shallow prairie lake).  Bingham Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 5-to-1 indicating a relatively small watershed.  The lake is aerated by the Cottonwood County Sportsman's Club, but remains susceptible to low oxygen conditions during winter.  Bingham Lake has had several recently documented fish kill events in the past 10 years as a result of low oxygen levels.  There was a die-off of algae resulting in low oxygen levels due to the decomposition of the algae during the summer of 2008 causing a fairly significant summerkill on the lake.  Oxygen levels were below 2 parts per million (ppm) and numerous dead Walleye, Channel Catfish, and Fathead Minnows were observed.  During the winter of 2013 and 2014 large amounts of snow cover and cold weather, coupled with a non-functional aeration system, led to increased duration of low to no light penetration on the lake which led to low dissolved oxygen levels.  The lake experienced a severe winterkill of the fish population and the lake's fish population was substantially depleted.  Only Black Bullhead were found alive in netting and electrofishing in the spring of 2014.  Therefore, an intensive re-stocking effort occurred to re-introduce Bluegill, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  A targeted survey was conducted during August 2015 to assess the re-introduction of fish into Bingham Lake.  The re-introduction was successful with common carp absent from netting in 2015. A standard survey was conducted in June of 2018 to fully assess the fish community with 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets.    <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nTwenty-nine Walleye were sampled in gill nets and 9 were sampled in trap nets.  The gill net catch rate of 14.5 per gill net is the second highest catch observed and is more than the long-term average of nearly 10 per gill net.  Walleye caught in gill nets ranged in length from 10.5 inches to 24.5 inches with an average length of just over 18 inches.  This is an excellent size structure with good numbers present.  We want to continue to develop and sustain good Walleye populations in SW Minnesota.  Therefore, the Walleye population of Bingham Lake is under study at this time.  Southwest Minnesota has seen increasing interest with Walleye genetics as the Lake Sarah Walleye strain (aka Canon River Strain) is gaining notoriety.  Lake Sarah Walleye eggs have been fertilized and collected since 2015 by Windom Area DNR staff and those fish are now being established in southern Minnesota lakes.  To determine whether those fish perform and persist better than northern strains of Walleye used historically we are stocking the same number of Lake Sarah strain Walleye fry and Upper Mississippi River strain Walleye fry.  This started in 2018 and will continue for several years.   Very early indications are showing that there is an advantage with Lake Sarah strain Walleye, but the exact magnitude is not known at this point.     <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nBluegill were re-introduced following the 2013-2014 winterkill due to the re-emergence of aquatic vegetation that created suitable habitat.  In 2018, the trap net catch rate of 28.9 per trap net is the highest catch rate ever observed on Bingham Lake.  Aquatic vegetation continues to be present and was determined to be the most likely factor in the persistence of a higher density Bluegill population.  In addition to the high density, the Bluegill in the trap nets ranged in length from 6.6 to 9.5 inches with a mean length of nearly 7.5 inches.        <br> \n      <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nSixteen Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and 19 Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets.  These relative abundance numbers (8.0 per gill net and 2.4 per gill net) were within the expected catch rate ranges for both gill nets and trap nets.  The Yellow Perch sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 7.3 to 9.4 inches with a mean length of 8.3 inches.  In trap nets they ranged in length from 7.7 to 11.4 inches with a mean length of 9 inches.  The Yellow Perch appear to be well established with many brood size fish.  The population of Yellow Perch should increase in Bingham Lake if the brood fish can successfully spawn.       <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOther species sampled in Bingham Lake included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, and Pumpkinseed.  The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 0.1 per trap net (1 fish).  The Black Bullhead catch rates were 344 per gill net and 238 per trap net, both above expected catch rate ranges.  The Black Crappie trap net catch rate was 0.4 per trap net (4 fish).  The Pumpkinseed trap net catch rate was 5.3 per trap net (42 fish).  Absent in 2018 was Northern Pike and Common Carp.  Common Carp have been absent since the winterkill in 2013-2014.  Northern Pike stocked in the lake were young and most likely not susceptible to the sampling gear, but they could become more abundant in the future. Bingham Lake is currently a simple fish community with good abundances of gamefish.   <br> \n      <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \nOverall, Bingham Lake has rebounded well from the winterkill in 2013-2014.  Fishing in 2014 and 2015 was slow and discouraging for some anglers, but the tradeoff of slow fishing for a lake that no longer has Common Carp is beneficial.  Recent angling in 2017 and 2018 is heating up with some nice Walleye being harvested and many smaller Walleye being caught with some harvested and some released.  No Common Carp were reported in the survey and anglers have not reported any since 2014.  Fishing will continue to get better as the populations of Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill have all re-established well and reproduction of Bluegill is excellent.  Continued stocking of Walleye fry will occur and Yellow Perch will be stocked if the gill net catch rate is less than 2 per net in any survey.  In the meantime, barring another winterkill or summerkill, angling on Bingham Lake should be good if not excellent.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is a 259 acre lake near the Town of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County.   Bingham Lake has a history of Walleye reproduction and has some good spawning habitat.  This history and habitat led to the inclusion of Bingham Lake in a Walleye study.  Department of Natural Resource researchers are comparing the effectiveness of two genetic strains of Walleye.  Historically the Windom area had received \"northern strains\" of Walleye from northern Minnesota Walleye spawning runs.  This was a very cost effective way of stocking Walleye statewide. However, a \"southern strain\" of Walleye was identified as unique and Lake Sarah in Murray County was a source of this strain.  Lake Sarah has not been stocked since 1991 and has maintained excellent numbers of Walleye naturally. An egg take has been conducted on Lake Sarah to raise these fish since 2015.  The two strains were stocked equally into Bingham Lake to test for differences in contribution to the catch.  Electrofishing for fall fingerling Walleye was used in September 2018.  Fin clips of each fish sampled was collected and sent for DNA analysis and determination of strain.  <br> \n  <br> \nFive 15 minute electrofishing stations were used during the night of September 26, 2018 to collect Walleye for DNA analysis.  Twenty-one Walleye fingerling were sampled in 75 minutes of sampling for a total catch rate of 16.8 per hour of electrofishing.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.02 to 7.87 inches with a mean length of 6.90 inches.  Genetic samples indicate that the distribution is skewed toward the northern strain of Walleye after 1 year.  This indicates that the Upper Mississippi strain may have a competitive advantage in Bingham Lake and may be better suited to survive.  However, we need to continue examining the contribution of each strain until they are old enough to be caught by anglers.  This will be the better indication of successful stocking, when fish can be caught and utilized by anglers.  Bingham Lake stocking will be monitored in this way each year, and with samples from older fish in later years, until the study expires in 2023 when a final determination of which strain to use will be determined.  The ultimate outcome should result in additional Walleye available to anglers, with an added benefit that Bingham Lake Walleye may become self-sustaining like Lake Sarah.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is a 274-acre lake located near the town of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County.  Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, a shoreline length of 3.2 miles, and is a class 43 lake.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye while largemouth bass, yellow perch, channel catfish, black crappie, and northern pike are managed secondarily. <br> \n <br> \nBingham Lake was stocked with walleye fry at 1000 per acre two of three years in the past.  This was changed to 500 fry per acre three of fours year to try and create a population with more stable recruitment.  This has appeared to work so far.  The walleye population is similar to other lakes with similar characteristics to Bingham Lake.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 10.5 to just under 16 inches.  Four different ages of walleye were sampled during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is doing very well in Bingham Lake.  The population is higher than other lakes similar to Bingham.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5 to just under 12 inches and averaged just above 9.5 inches.  Nine different ages from 1997 through 2005 were observed during the assessment indicating good natural reproduction is occurring. <br> \n <br> \nNo black crappie were sampled in trap nets in 2002.  Some black crappie were observed during the assessment in 2006 which appear to have hatched in 2002 but numbers are still low when compared to other lakes similar to Bingham Lake.  All the black crappie caught were right around 11 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe pumpkinseed population is similar to other lakes like Bingham Lake.  The pumpkinseed sunfish is in the bluegill family and can be identified by an orange spot at the end of their gill cover.  Lengths of pumpkinseed caught in our trap nets ranged from 5 to 7 inches and averaged just over 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish fingerlings were stocked in Bingham Lake in 1995 and are still doing quite well in the lake.  A fairly good number of channel catfish are present and range in length from 24.5 to 27 inches with an average length just over 26 inches.  The average weight of channel catfish is almost 7.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBingham Lake has historically produced some excellent spring and fall fishing opportunities for black bullhead.  The black bullhead population is typical of lakes similar to Bingham Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in our trap nets ranged from 7 to 12.5 inches and averaged just over 10 inches <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in our nets during the assessment included common carp, white sucker, bluegill, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Bingham Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bingham Lake is a 259-acre lake, located in Cottonwood County near the City of Bingham Lake.  Since 2018, Bingham Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The total fry quota for Bingham Lake was 137,000, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Bingham Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance, 50 Walleye yearlings and 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed from Bingham Lake in 2019.  A gill net, trap nets and electrofishing were used to collect Walleye for the study.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was met as 213 fingerlings were captured with electrofishing (38.2 per hour) and 1 was captured in trap nets (16 net nights).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 6.0 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Yearlings were collected mainly by electrofishing (N=40), however trap nets (N=7) and a gill net (N=2) were also used.  Yearlings ranged in length from 9.7 to 13.9 inches and averaged 12.0 inches. Results of which strain performed better are not yet available.   <br> \n</p>",
