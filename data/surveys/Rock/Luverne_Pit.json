A NUMBER OF OTHER GAME SPECIES EXIST IN SMALL NUMBERS IN LUVERNE PIT, INCLUDING WHC, LMB, WAE AND PMK.  YOY WERE COLLECTED ONLY FOR LMB, WHICH MAY BE MORE ABUNDANT THAN TRAPNETS SUGGEST.  ELECTROFISHING SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF BASS POPULATION SIZE.  BLB AND WTS WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS (5.75 AND 5.25 PER NET, RESPECTIVELY), AND ARE PROBABLY ESTABLISHED AND REPRODUCING, ALTHOUGH NO YOY WERE SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINES.</p>",
