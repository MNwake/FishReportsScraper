                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Big LaSalle Lake on July 31, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 6 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 13.8 feet, which was just below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.4?C (43.5?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within and below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1998-2020 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big LaSalle Lake is 221-acre lake with a maximum depth of 48 feet located in South-eastern Clearwater County.  A public access was developed by the county on the north west side of the lake off of township road 108.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big LaSalle Lake is in lake class 31.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, natural reproduction of walleye supported this population at moderate levels, typical for this lake class.  Walleye stocking was initiated in 1991 and stocking rates were increased in 1999 to improve abundance.  Current data suggests walleye stocking efforts have been successful in increasing walleye numbers.  As part of any stocking plan, La Salle Lake will be monitored and walleye stocking levels will be evaluated in the future to ensure increased walleye stocking efforts are not negatively impacting the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006, northern pike abundance was typical of other class 31 lakes.  Pike ranged in length from 13.0 - 33.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 22.7 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Eight different year classes were identified in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are the most important forage fish for predators such as northern pike and walleye.  Few perch were larger than nine inches.  White sucker and tullibee (cisco) were also sampled in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 black crappie were sampled in 2006.  Five different year classes were identified in the sample, an indication of fairly consistent reproduction.  The 2003 (age 3) year class made up 65% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was typical of other class 31 lakes.  In 2006, bluegill ranged in length from 3.3 - 7.6 inches.  This was the first assessment on Big LaSalle that no bluegill longer than eight inches was sampled.  This may be an indication of the affects of selective harvest on the larger size bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big LaSalle Lake is a 235-acre lake with a maximum depth of 48 feet located in southeastern Clearwater County near Itasca State Park.  A public water access with parking for 4 trucks/trailers is located on the northwest shore of the lake off of TR 108.  The shoreline of the lake is mostly undeveloped with a few lakeshore cabins.  Water quality measurements taken in 2013 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to a depth of 25 feet in mid-July with a Secchi disc reading of 9.2 feet (clear water).  The lake contains little in the way of shoreline structure (points) or shallow areas, with a narrow band of aquatic vegetation around most of the shoreline which drops sharply into deeper water.  Big LaSalle Lake is primarily managed for walleye and is intensively stocked with fingerlings on alternate years; black crappie and bluegill are managed as secondary species.  The 2013 fish population assessment walleye catch rate of 4.17 fish per gill net (4.17/GN) was near the upper end of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Walleye up to 27.4 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 18 inches and 2.1 lbs.  Black crappie abundance declined since the previous assessment in 2006 and was below the typical range for class 31 lakes; fish up to 12 inches in length were captured in the 2013 assessment.  The 2013 bluegill catch rate of 25.89 fish per trap net (25.89/TN) was slightly above the median value of 21.5/TN for class 31 lakes.  Bluegill up to 8.4 inches in length were captured, with an average length of 6.3 inches, which was up from 5.4 inches in 2006.  Sixty-five percent of the bluegill catch consisted of medium-size fish from six to eight inches in length.  Bluegill grow slowly in Big LaSalle lake, averaging 4.3 inches in length at age-5, which is below the average growth rate for class 31 lakes in the Bemidji area (6.6 inches).  The 2013 catch rate for northern pike (7/GN) was similar to the median value of 6.7/GN for class 31 lakes.  Northern pike up to 38 inches in length were captured, with an average length of 21.3 inches and a chunky 2.5 lb average weight.  Twenty-nine percent were greater than 24 inches in length, which is representative of a quality pike population in a small northern Minnesota lake in this day and age.  However, in the previous assessment (2006), 40% of northern pike were greater than 24 inches in length; the 2013 assessment reveals a decline which has become typical of northern pike populations that is likely caused by over-harvest of quality-size pike.  Other species captured in the 2013 assessment that may provide good angling opportunities were rock bass, pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), largemouth bass and brown bullhead.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper LaSalle Lake is long and narrow with a steeply sloping shoreline.  Littoral area is limited to a narrow band of emergent and submerged vegetation around the perimeter of the lake, thus productivity is also limited.  The origin of LaSalle Creek is near the east entrance of Lake Itasca State Park.  It drains bogs and marshland through Upper and Lower LaSalle Lakes, and flows into the Mississippi River just east of Coffee Pot Landing.  Being a headwaters stream, LaSalle Creek, and its watershed, are of special concern to management agencies, and development is highly scrutinized.  Much of the upland shoreline on Big LaSalle Lake is currently developed with cabins and summer homes, but minimal disturbance to the watershed and aquatic plant community has limited erosion and nutrient input.    Walleye abundance has not varied substantially in the three surveys on record; abundance is low but they are of quality size with an average weight of 2 pounds.    Northern pike abundance is normal for this lake type and numbers have remained consistent over time.   Average size is small with mean weight around 1.5 pounds in all 3 surveys.  Most northerns in the current survey were from 17 to 23 inches.  The largest northern pike sampled in 1998 was 35.2 inches.    Yellow perch abundance has declined slightly from 1976 to 1998, but still remains in the normal range for this lake type.  Average length in this survey was 6.8 inches and maximum length was 9.9 inches.  Enough larger perch are present to interest anglers.    Bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass have all been sampled in small numbers in most surveys.  Average size is small for all panfish species, but there are larger fish available for diligent anglers.    A list of other fishes sampled includes: hybrid sunfish, yellow, brown, and black bullheads, burbot, tullibee, white sucker, blacknose, common, and mimic shiners, northern redbelly dace, johnny and Iowa darters, bluntnose minnow, and banded killifish.    Most fish sampled had Neascus (black spot), a parasite that is unsightly but not harmful for consumption.  A few fish also had yellow grub, a similar parasite, also not harmful for consumption.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big LaSalle Lake was conducted on July 6-7, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Big LaSalle Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Public access with room for about 5 trucks with trailers is located on the west shore of the lake off LaSalle Drive.  Big LaSalle Lake is managed primarily for Walleye with Black Crappie and Bluegill managed as secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nBig LaSalle is a quiet fishing lake that receives minimal pressure from anglers.  The Walleye population is maintained through fingerling stocking in odd numbered years. The 2021 survey achieved a catch rate of 4.8 Walleyes per net which is above the statewide average for similar lakes. Walleye captured in 2021 had an average size just over 17 inches in length and 1.7 lb/fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Northern Pike catch rate of 7.7 fish per net was higher than the statewide average for similar lakes. Pike over 32 inches in length were measured during the survey and lengths averaged 20.8 inches. There is currently an abundance of fish directly below the 22-26 inch protected slot limit which are vulnerable to the expanded 10 fish bag limit. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are important as a forage species in Big LaSalle and are present in moderate numbers.  Sixteen percent of Yellow Perch caught were greater than 9 inches in length in 2021, which is similar to findings from the previous survey in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are abundant, though sizes are relatively small. The majority of fish captured were below 7 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",
