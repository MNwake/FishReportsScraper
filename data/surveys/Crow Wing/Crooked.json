                "narrative": "<p>Crooked lake is a 443 acre lake located five miles northwest of Garrison in Crow Wing County.  Crooked reaches depths of 72'. Areas 15' deep or less make up 53% of the lake.  A public access is located in the southwest corner.  Water clarity is good with a secchi reading of 14.5'. <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers at 11.6/gillnet.  Most run on the small side with an average length of 18.2\".  Northern pike at least 24\" in length accounted for 13% of the catch.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger northern pike will help create a balanced population.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has been attempted in the past but return has been poor and thus walleyes are not currently stocked by the DNR into Crooked.   However, walleyes have been stocked three times since 2008 by the lake association under a DNR permit.  The walleye gillnet catch of 0.3/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 18.0\".  High northern pike and low yellow perch numbers limit successful walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nTulibee (cisco) were sampled in high numbers at 11.7/gillnet.  Average length was 13.6\".  Tulibee (cisco) are an important forage fish for larger northern pike and walleyes.  They can also provide a unique fishing opportunity.   Most fishing for tulibee (cisco) is done through the ice.  <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Crooked Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Crooked Lake was conducted on July 10, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and a 15-foot seine was used at one station. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Crooked Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Crooked Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI.  The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The catch rates for these species exceeded the third quartile of the Brainerd area median for lakes that range in size from 230 to 510 acres and are greater than 36 feet deep. Northern cisco, black bullhead, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye exhibited average populations as the net catches were between the first and third quartile of the area median in lake group 6. The yellow perch population was so low as to be almost nonexistent. The catch rates were 0.00 in gillnets and 0.125 in the trap nets. Northern pike abundance is the highest of any year on our netting records. The northern pike ranged in size from 6.0 to 32.9 inches long with the bulk of the population from 13.0 to 17.9 inches at time of capture. The average weight was 1.14 lbs. Age class 2 thru 10 were represented in the nets with growth rates slightly on the low side of average. Yellow and brown bullhead populations remain high with yellow bullhead mean weight being 0.32 pounds and brown bullhead weight being 0.56 lbs. The bluegill population has remained high with age classes 4 thru 8 represented in the net catches and all classes indicated a slow growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. The yellow perch population, as it all past surveys, has remained extremely low with only 1 perch taken, and it was in the trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 7, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with dense abundant vegetation leading all the way to deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 20 native species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net data from a June 2012 standard survey and gill net data from a June 2016 targeted survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Crooked Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a unique body of water that has many bays and points and is connected to Hanks and Portage via channel.  The stretches of lightly developed shoreline along with numerous pine trees give you a true \"up north\" feel.  The access on the SW corner does launch into a shallow, muddier part of the lake so that may limit the size or type of boat people are comfortable putting in.  Water was especially low in 2023 due to the drought conditions and made access into at least Portage Lake difficult to impossible for some boats. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike (7.4/gill net) and Largemouth Bass (78.0/hour electrofishing) are two species offering a good opportunity to anglers.  Many of the Northern Pike were of decent size, with 27% measuring over 26\" and fish up to 38.2\" captured.  Average size of the Largemouth Bass was 11.7\" and 43% of the fish were over 12\".  Fish up to 19.7\" were caught.  A few Smallmouth Bass are also present in Crooked, with two being caught during spring electrofishing.  These fish were small at 7.0\" and 9.1\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked by the Lake Association since 2008, but they haven't shown up in the surveys much.  Only six were captured in the 2023 summer survey (0.7/gill net) and this is below average for this type of lake.  Most of these fish were large, with 83% measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are present as well and may offer decent angling opportunities.  Black Crappies were caught in high numbers for this type of lake (4.3/trap net).  Average size was 8.0\" and of all Crappies sampled in the survey, 52% were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were one of the lowest recorded for Crooked Lake at 13.1/trap net, but that was still average for this lake type.  Size of these fish was decent and could provide some harvest with an average length of 6.5\" and 42% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were sampled in high numbers at 13.0/gill net and had an average length of 13.1\".  Tullibee (Cisco) are an important forage fish for larger northern Pike and walleyes.  They can also provide a unique fishing opportunity.   Most fishing for Tullibee (Cisco) is done through the ice.  <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil is present in Crooked Lake.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells, and baitwells.  <br> \n</p>",

Above average lbs/net also existed for these species. Walleye net catches were below the first quartile of the regional median. Black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie were caught in average or below average numbers when compared to the regional median. These species populations are most represented by trapnet catches than gillnets, consequently no statement was made on abundance. Six gillnets were set in June of 1980, 1984, 1985 and 1986. Based on these net catches northern pike in 1986 (13.16/net) is significantly lower than 1980 but is comparative with other nettings. Also 6 gillnets were set in august of 1969 and 9 gillnets in august of 1950. Moderate to high northern pike populations existed. Yellow perch and walleye numbers were both low. The northern cisco population has remained high in all nettings except the 1950 netting when an average population existed. Size range in 1986 is excellent with a range from 7.5-016.9 inches. The median size was in the 12.0-12.9 group. Northern pike aged (44 of 79) showed age classes 2-8 present with age class 3 the most predominate. Growth rate was slow for age classes 2 and 3 and average for the other age classes when compared to the statewide growth rates. Northern pike were 14.1 inches at annuli 3 and 30.8 inches at annuli 7. The median length in 1986 was 15.9 inches and weighed 0.9 lbs. The median length in 1969, 1980, 1984 and 1985 ranged from 15.5 inches to 16 inches. The number of big fish over 24.9 inches in the respective netting years was one, six, nine, three and six in 1986. Only three walleyes were taken in 1986 and they ranged from 25.8-31.7 inches and all were nine years old or greater. The walleye population in all netting years has been very stable but low.</p>",

Although the sample sizes for rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and largemouth bass are small, net catch rates indicate below average population levels with catch rates below the first quartile to the median of class 25 lakes. The pumpkinseed, rock bass and largemouth bass indicate larger than average size fish. Black crappie net catches indicate average size net catches with smaller than average size fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked is a 443 acre lake located about six miles northwest of Garrison.  A public access is located on the southwest end of the lake.  About 53% of the lake is shallower than fifteen feet.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand, gravel and rubble-sized rock.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse.  It is important to protect beds of emergent plants, like bulrush, because they provide good spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent plants also provide important feeding ares, as well as protection, to a variety of fish species.The northern pike was the most abundant gamefish found in the 1994 netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, northern pike had \"high\" abundance, but the catch rate was typical for this lake.  Northern pike aged 2-7 years were caught.  Most were age 2-3 and had slow growth.  Older fish had good growth.  Average size was 1.6 lbs..  Excellent northern pike spawning habitat is found in Rice Lake, upstream from Crooked Lake.  Walleyes were found in \"average\" numbers in 1994. Nine walleyes were caught and aged.  Five were from the 1988 year class, the rest from 1987.  Fingerlings stocked in 1986, '88 and '90 may have contributed to the catch in 1994.  Walleyes had good growth and average size was 4.6 lbs..Largemouth bass numbers were \"average\" and growth was good.  Bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers in '94 but previous catch rates were in the \"high\" range.  Bluegills had slow growth.  Other panfish species caught included pumpkinseeds, rock bass and black crappies.Yellow perch were found in \"low\" numbers, typical for this lake.  Tullibees were caught in \"high\" numbers, also typical.  Both species are important food sources for gamefish.  Additional fish species caught in the '94 netting included bowfin (dogfish), black, brown and yellow bullheads. All were caught in \"average\" to \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

These species catch rates exceeded the third quartile of the Brainerd area median for similar lakes that range in size from 230 to 510 acres and are greater than 36 feet deep. Bowfin, northern cisco, rock bass, largemouth bass and black crappie exhibited average populations since net catches were between the first and third quartile of the area median. Black bullhead, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate a below average population with catch rates below the first quartile of the area median. Northern pike abundance continued to remain high. The four previous June surveys had net catches ranging from 13.16/gillnet to 25.0/gillnet. Northern pike ranged in size from 9.0 to 29.6 in. long at time of capture. The average size was 16.3 inches long and 1.0 lbs. Age classes 1 thru 7 were represented in the nets with growth rate on the low side of average in comparison to the statewide average. Yellow and brown bullhead populations apparently have remained fairly high with yellow bullheads mean weight being 0.55 lbs and brown bullhead weight being one pound. The bluegill population has remained high with age classes 5 thru 8 represented in the net catch and all classes indicated a slow growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. The yellow perch population, as in all past surveys, has remained extremely low.</p>",

Northern pike catch numbers were high (10.2/net), with 17% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Average length was small at only 18.2\", however, seven fish over 30\" were measured.  Largemouth bass numbers looked good while night electrofishing (78.0/hr run-time) and 58% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this type of lake, but the fish were on the small side.  The largest bluegill was only 7.8\" and 52% of the black crappies were 8\" or larger, with all but two measuring under 10\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have not been stocked by the DNR since 1990, though the lake association has been allowed to stock walleye fingerlings in even numbered years since 2008.  Numbers have remained low in every netting (<1.5/net), including 2012 (0.4/net).  All of the walleyes captured were over 21\".  Perch numbers remained low as well (0.6/net). <br> \n</p>",
