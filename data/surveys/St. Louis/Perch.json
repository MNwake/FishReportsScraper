                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 12, which consists of 90 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft and chemically unproductive water.  Perch Lake is somewhat smaller than most lakes in this lake class.The inlet from Whisper Lake and the outlet to Blueberry Lake are small, pass through beaver dams, and seep through large bog and marsh areas.  Fish migration is unlikely.  Most of the near-shore lake bottom is is ledgerock, rubble, and muck; only about ten percent of the bottom is sand and gravel.  Yellow waterlilies are common, and most aquatic vegetation is in the shallow southern and northern ends of the lake.Four previous gillnetting assessments have been done on Perch Lake, dating back to 1964.  The only previous trapnetting was in 1977.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1996 (all species combined) was lower than normal for this lake class and lower than in most previous assessments on this lake.  Fewer northern pike and perch were caught in 1996, perhaps due to the successful introduction of walleye in 1988.Fish populations in 1996 were dominated by walleye and bluegill sunfish.Walleye numbers in 1996 were higher than normal for this lake class, but lower than the extremely high catch in this lake in 1991.  Walleye sizes in 1996 averaged 1.0 lb in the gillnets, which is normal for this lake class and 2.4 lb in the trapnets, which is above average.  The largest walleye was 25 in (4.8 lb).  Walleye growth (15 in at age three) was faster than average for the area.  Walleye fry were introduced into Perch Lake in 1988 and fry were again stocked in 1993.  Nine of the 34 walleye caught in 1996 were from these two stocked years; the remainder were from 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995.  Bluegill numbers in 1996 were higher than normal for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes averaged 7.7 in, and 35 percent were 8 in or larger.  The largest bluegill was 10.6 in (1.0 lb).  Bluegill growth (6 in at age six) was normal.  Most of the bluegill were age six; none were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill were first observed in the initial 1964 survey, but catches have been low and hit-or-miss prior to 1996.  Bluegill were stocked in 1981.  A few \"hybrid\" sunfish were observed in 1996; these were crosses of bluegill and some other sunfish species.Northern pike numbers declined after walleye were introduced, and are now lower than normal for this lake class.  Pike sizes have been small, in 1996 pike averaged 20 in; the largest was 25 in.White sucker numbers in 1996 were lower than normal for this lake class, but were similar to previous catches in this lake.Yellow perch numbers had been normal for this lake class, but have been very low since the introduction of walleye in 1988.  This is no surprise, as perch are a preferred food for walleye.  Perch sizes have averaged 7 in; the only perch captured in 1996 was 6\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located approximately 3 miles NE of Babbitt in the Superior National Forest. There is a short (1/8 mi) portage from a parking area near the SW end of the lake for public access. This access can be found by taking CR 903 (off CSAH 21) then N on USFS 191 to the parking area. There are no official campsites located near the lake. <br> \n <br> \nPerch is shallow soft water (unmineralized) lake. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly silt, boulder, rubble, and sand. Aquatic plants were sparse and grow to a depth of 5 feet. The most common plants were sweetgale along the shoreline, yellow waterlily, ribbon leaf pondweed, and floating leaf burreed.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye dominated the catch during the 2016 survey of Perch Lake. Bluegill were sampled in above average numbers and northern pike were sampled in numbers slightly below average. Hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, white sucker and golden shiner were also sampled in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2016 (12.0/gill net) were above average (5.4/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area and below the historical average (14.0/gill net) on Perch Lake. The average walleye sampled was 12 inches long and about 3 years old. The largest walleye was sampled in a trap net and measured 25 inches. Walleye sampled from the trap nets in 2016 were also above average in numbers and the average length was 16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2016 (6.4/trap net) were above average (1.5/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes and below the historical average (10.9/trap net) for Perch Lake. The average bluegill sampled was 7 inches long and about 4 years old. Almost half of the bluegill sampled in 2016 were 8 inches or larger. Selective harvest of bluegill is recommended. Releasing large bluegill keeps those \"big fish\" genes in the population for future generations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2016 (2.7/gill net) were below average (4.0/gill net) compared to other similar area lakes and identical to the historical average on this lake. The average pike sampled was 20 inches which is slightly larger than the historical average length of 18.9 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2016 was 28 inches long. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Portage wheels are allowed at this access. Perch Lake is relatively small at just 100 acres and is relatively shallow at just 13 feet deep. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, ledge rock, and muck. <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake was surveyed in July 2023 to monitor the walleye, bluegill, and northern pike populations and to monitor lake quality and habitat. The survey crew sampled fish with gill nets and trap nets, and they measured water quality. Perch Lake was thermally stratified, with a surface temperature of 74 F and a temperature of 63 F at the bottom. Adequate oxygen levels for gamefish were present to a depth of about 7 feet. Perch Lake has brown, bog-stained water with low visibility at about 4 feet. Aquatic vegetation is limited in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 4.3 fish/gill net, which was below average for the lake. However, walleye were nice sized, averaging 14.7 inches in length, and over 60% of the fish were over 14 inches. Walleye were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 4.3 fish/net. These fish tended to be larger, averaging 16.8 inches and nearly 85% of the catch was 14 inches or larger. Walleye ages ranged from 2 to 14 and indicated consistent recruitment in this naturally reproducing population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 12.9 fish/trap net, which was higher than the historical average for the lake. Bluegill averaged 6.8 inches in length, and approximately 37% of the catch was 8 inches or larger. The largest bluegill sampled was 10.1 inches. Bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 7 and indicated exceptional growth rates for lakes in the Tower area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.0 fish/gill net and 2.1 fish/trap net, both of which were slightly higher than average for Perch Lake. The average length was 19.4 inches, which was close to the historical average for the lake. The largest pike  was 39.4 inches long and was caught in a trap net. This was the largest pike ever sampled from Perch Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Perch Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake was thermally stratified on 07/17/2006 with a surface temperature of 81 F and a bottom temperature of 72 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to within a foot of the bottom.  The small inlet and outlet had no flow during the 2006 survey.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly silt, boulder, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 feet. The most common plants were sweetgale along the shoreline, yellow waterlily, ribbon leaf pondweed, and floating leaf burreed. <br> \n <br> \nAll of the land surrounding Perch Lake is Federal forest land, except for a State owned forty acre parcel on the west shore.  There are no campsites on the lake.  Access is by a 1/8 mile portage from USFS Road 191, via County Road 903. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling during the 2006 fisheries lake survey consisted of two gillnets, nine standard trapnets, and three small mesh (1/4 inch bar mesh) trapnets.  Five previous investigations, dating back to 1964, used 2-6 gillnets.  Trapnets (4-9) were used during the 1977 and 1966 investigations.  Shoreline seining was done in the 1964 investigation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the dominant fish species in Perch Lake in 2006.  Walleye were introduced into Perch Lake in 1988 and were stocked again in 1993.   Northern pike and yellow perch populations have declined since the introduction of walleye.  Good numbers of bluegill are also present in Perch Lake, and some smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were reportedly caught by an angler in 2004.  Fish species observed only in the small mesh trapnets were bluntnose minnow, golden shiner, and tadpole madtom. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2006 (16.5/gillnet and 6.2/trapnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class.  Walleye numbers were also high in 1991 (16.0/gillnet) and in 1996 (9.5/gillnet).  Walleye sizes in 2006 averaged 13.8 inches (1.0 lb), which was somewhat smaller than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class. The largest walleye was 23.7 inches.  All of the walleye captured in 2006 were the result of natural reproduction, which has occurred regularly in recent years.  Walleye growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2006 (4.0/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the average catch of 9.8/gillnet in investigations prior to the stocking of walleye.  Pike sizes in 2006 averaged 18.9 inches (1.4 lb), which was somewhat smaller than normal (in the second quartile) for this lake class.  The largest pike (caught in a trapnet) was 21.7 inches.  All northern pike captured in 2006 were ages 4 and 5.  Pike growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in the gillnets in 2006 (1.0/net) were lower than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class.  Perch numbers prior to the stocking of walleye were higher, averaging 7.7/gillnet.  Perch sizes in 2006 averaged 6.1 inches. The largest (caught in a trapnet) was 7.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2006 (10.9/trapnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes averaged 6.6 inches; the largest bluegill was 10.4 inches.  Most of the bluegill captured in 2006 were ages 3 and 4.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nGame fish examined in 2006 were mostly free from diseases or parasites.  Only a few fish had neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",
