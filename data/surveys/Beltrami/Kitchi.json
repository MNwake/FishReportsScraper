                "narrative": "<p>Kitchi Lake is one of several connected lakes joined via the Mississippi and Turtle rivers that comprise the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  Kitchi supports a limited amount of residential development along its lakeshore, although there are several resorts.  The lake is located in southeastern Beltrami County approximately 18 miles east of Bemidji.  It is a 1,785 acre lake with a 50 foot maximum depth.  There is no developed public boat ramp on Kitchi Lake; however, boaters can access the lake by following the Turtle River upstream from the north side of Cass Lake.  A scenic northern Minnesota lake, Kitchi lies within the boundaries of both the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and the Chippewa National Forest. <br> \n <br> \nWater levels in this system are affected by dam operations on the Mississippi River.  Water level fluctuations can affect growth of emergent and submerged vegetation as well as availability of potential spawning habitat.  In addition, fish populations in these connected waters are frequently influenced by fish movement between lakes.  Walleye is the primary management species for Kitchi, and secondary management species include northern pike, black crappie, and muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nKitchi Lake is indirectly connected to Lake Andrusia which is a source of brood stock for the Big Lake Creek spawn taking station.  Under DNR policy, ten percent of the annual walleye egg take is returned to the source water as fry.  In the Cass Lake Chain, any stocking or natural reproduction should be looked at in the context of the entire connected system of lakes.  In Kitchi, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has been stocking walleye fry on alternate years since 1993. <br> \n <br> \nThe Kitchi Lake walleye fishery is best considered in the context of the numerous connected waters of the Cass Lake chain.  This includes lakes connected to the Turtle River, which flows through Kitchi and into Cass, as well as those connected to the Mississippi River, which also flows into (and out of) Cass Lake.  Kitchi has a reputation - along with several other lakes connected to Cass Lake - as being a good early season walleye fishing lake.  Throughout the Cass Lake system, many fish make significant runs each spring, following the Mississippi or Turtle rivers while on their spawning migrations.  Walleye tagging studies have demonstrated that fish from throughout the system become mixed during this process of searching out various spawning locations.  Since spawning is usually completed shortly before the season opener, walleyes are often found gradually working their way back toward the main lakes, feeding frequently along the way. <br> \n <br> \nIn Kitchi Lake, walleye abundance over the past three population assessments has been fairly consistent, and is considered typical for this type of lake.  In 2009, walleye ranged from 10 to 23 inches in length and were represented by seven different year classes.  The 2006 year class (age-3) dominated the gill net sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike is another important species in Kitchi Lake.  Like walleye, their tendency for spring spawning migrations results in considerable movement throughout the chain.  Even though spawning habitat is plentiful, northern pike density is not exceptionally high.  Throughout the system, desirable forage (cisco, whitefish, sucker species), low population density, and cool water refuge areas provide the necessary components for good growth of northern pike.  In 2009, northern pike abundance in Kitchi Lake was similar to that from 2004 and is considered low compared to most lakes.  Even with a low density population, size structure is not desirable.  The main reason for this is that 67% of the sample was composed of age-2 (2007 year class) fish.  An age structure skewed towards young fish may be related to the abundant emergent vegetation upstream of Kitchi in the Turtle River that is prime spawning habitat for northern pike.  These areas may serve as a major spawning and nursery areas for younger fish, while older (and larger) northern pike may be vacating these shallow basins seasonally for more desirable habitats elsewhere in the Cass Lake chain. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are also present in Kitchi, although none were sampled in the 2009 assessment (they are seldom sampled in standard population assessments).  However, an excellent natural muskellunge population thrives in the Cass Lake chain, and many are known to frequent the high-quality habitat available in Kitchi Lake.  Anglers should remember that muskellunge harvest restrictions on Kitchi fall under the statewide 48 inch minimum length regulation. <br> \n <br> \nFew bluegill were captured in this or any previous population assessment, and catch rates are lower than what is typical for this lake type; however, bluegill captured in 2009 displayed a quality size structure.  A few black crappie were also captured, ranging from 4 to 11 inches in length.  While none of the sunfish species were captured in great abundance, anglers do target bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass successfully on Kitchi Lake.  Yellow perch abundance in 2009 was typical of other lakes in this lake class.  Only 3% of perch in the sample were greater than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other lake users should be aware of their role in preventing the spread of invasive species.  Invasive species are plants and animals that have been introduced through human activities to a location where they do not naturally occur.  Non-native species are not necessarily harmful, but when they cause ecological or economic problems, they are categorized as \"invasive.\"  Minnesota's aquatic resources are threatened by a variety of aquatic invasive species. These species have a high risk of continued spread, as they are easily established and can be unknowingly transported from lake to lake by human activity. The movement of any type of equipment (boats, boat trailers, boat lifts, docks, personal watercraft, bait containers, etc.) between lakes risks potential invasive species transfer if precautions are not taken. To avoid being an accomplice to the spread of these unwanted species, people should make sure all equipment is thoroughly cleaned and dried before entering new waters. Items that are difficult to dry (livewells, baitwells, bilge areas, etc.) should be treated with scalding water or a small amount of iodine or chlorine bleach solution to kill any organisms that may be hiding there.

The size tends to be small with an average length of 14.5 inches.  The largest Walleye captured was about 24 inches.Northern Pike are numerous with most fish lengths between 19 and 22 inches. A few Northern Pike greater than 30 inches were captured. Muskellunge are present as documented in the previous survey as well as angler reported catches, though none were captured during this survey. Largemouth Bass are present and a few were captured at quality lengths. The bass population is likely more robust than the survey suggests. Panfish, primarily Bluegill are nice sized fish but the population seems to have declined. Black Crappie are present in good numbers but lengths have declined, averaging about 7.5 inches in length.Yellow Perch are abundant, though most lengths are between 5 and 7 inches. About half the perch have neascus and a few have yellow grub.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kitchi Lake is 1785-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet.  The lake is located one mile northwest of Pennington in southeast Beltrami County.  There is no public access on Kitchi Lake, however, boaters can utilize the three public accesses on Cass Lake and traverse through the channel between Cass and Kitchi Lakes.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Kitchi Lake is in lake class 27.  Other lakes in the same lake class include Big Turtle, Big Wolf, Grace, Andrusia, Big, Clearwater and Marquette Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are large, deep, hardwater lakes with regular shaped shorelines.  Kitchi Lake is within both the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and the Chippewa National Forest.  One of the primary species managed for and sought by anglers on Kitchi Lake is walleye.  The walleye fishery is best described in context of the numerous connected waters of the Cass Lake chain.  This includes lakes on Turtle River, which flow through Kitchi into Cass, and the Mississippi River, which connects a number of other water bodies.  Tagging studies conducted by MNDNR in the 1970s documented significant walleye movement between most of the connected waters in this system.  The excellent natural walleye population on the Cass Lake chain probably mixes seasonally between basins, with access to an excellent mix of both lake and stream spawning habitats.The Leech Lake Reservation Department of Resource Management stocks walleye fry into Kitchi Lake on alternate years, though contribution from stocking has not been evaluated.  Experimental gill net catch rates generally fluctuate around 4 - 6 per net with the exception of the 1988 assessment capturing 12 per net.  This higher catch rate does not correspond to any unusual increase in stocking frequency or density.Kitchi has a reputation, along with other smaller lakes connected to Cass Lake, as being good early season walleye fishery.  This generalization may have some credibility based on the tendency of walleye to move long distances upstream for spawning.  Since spawning is completed shortly before the walleye season opener, many fish may be gradually working their way back to the main lake through these smaller basins and feeding heavily along the way.Northern pike is another important species in Kitchi Lake.  Like walleye, their tendency for massive spring spawning migrations results in considerable movement throughout the chain.  Even though spawning habitat is plentiful, northern pike density is not exceptionally high.  This is a factor of a very large combined lake size resulting in relatively low density.  Suitable forage (cisco, whitefish, sucker species), lake size, low density and deep cool water refuge provide the necessary components for growth of large pike.  Though standard experimental gill nets are not particularly adept at sampling truly large pike, Kitchi usually produces some fish over 34 inches in the sample.Muskellunge are also present in Kitchi.  Though none were sampled in this assessment, they are also seldom sampled in gill nets.  Those same conditions that grow large pike are also beneficial to muskellunge.  An excellent natural muskellunge population thrives in the Cass Lake chain, and many are known to frequent the excellent habitat available in Kitchi.Bluegill, and other centrarchid species (black crappie, largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish) differ from the species previously mentioned in their habits.  These populations tend to have limited ranges, and there is likely very little movement between basins.  Habitats are somewhat isolated through the system but where suitable, in smaller shallow bays, can provide excellent quality.  Bluegill were sampled at relatively low density but excellent quality with 50% of the sample exceeding 8 inches.Yellow perch, also plentiful throughout the system, are valuable both as a source of forage and as a recreational fish for anglers.  In 2004 assessment, 7% of the sample was greater than 8 inches with some fish larger than 11 inches.Development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Kitchi is a 1,858-acre, lightly developed lake located in southeastern Beltrami County approximately 18 miles east of Bemidji.  Kitchi has a average water clarity of 4 feet and a maximum depth of 50 feet.  The lake is categorized as eutrophic and surrounded by conifer and hardwood forest.  Kitchi's main inlet and outlet is the Turtle River.  Kitchi is connected to the Cass Lake (Andrusia, Big Rice, Big Wolf, Cass, Little Rice, and Pike Bay) chain of lakes by the Mississippi and Turtle rivers, which influence the lake's water level.  Cass Lake is connected to Kitchi Lake by the Turtle River and Pug Hole Lake, which allows for boat and fish passage between the lakes.  There is no public boat access on Kitchi Lake, but boaters can access through Pug Hole Lake from the north shore of Cass Lake. <br> \n <br> \nStandard and targeted surveys were completed on Kitchi Lake in 2019 to assess the fish community.  Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Fish populations within the Cass Lake chain are influenced by fish movement between lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye ranged from 8 to 24 inches in length and averaged just over 15 inches.  Walleye abundance has decreased in recent surveys and was below the typical range for lakes with similar morphology and water chemistry.  However, Kitchi and other lakes connected to Cass Lake have a reputation of being good for Walleye early in the season.  Walleye are known to make significant migrations up the Mississippi and Turtle rivers to spawn.  Walleye tagging and marking studies have confirmed the fish become mixed throughout the Cass Lake chain of lakes while migrating to various spawning locations.  Depending on spring weather conditions, Walleye typically finish spawning before opener and are in the process of migrating back to the main lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance remained low in 2019 and was normal for Kitchi Lake.  Northern Pike ranged from 11 to 28 inches and averaged nearly 2 pounds.  Even with a low density population, cool water refuge, and desirable forage, size structure continues to be poor.  With 70% of Northern Pike captured in gill nets less than 22 inches, anglers should have the opportunity to catch harvestable size fish.  Like Walleye, Northern Pike migrate to spawn in the spring.  In addition, younger fish in the Cass Lake chain of lakes may use Kitchi as a nursey area to grow before moving to different areas. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Muskellunge were captured at sizes of 23 and 31 inches.  This number of muskies is similar to previous surveys.  Standard surveys rarely capture Muskellunge and are a poor indicator of actual Muskellunge abundance.  The Cass Lake chain of lakes are known for a natural reproducing population of Muskellunge that typically provides anglers with good fishing. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low and consistent with previous surveys for this lake.  The Bluegill population appears healthy with Bluegill averaging about 8 inches in length, with some Bluegill larger than 9 inches being fairly common. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches and averaged nearly 10 inches.  Black Crappie abundance was higher than normal and multiple year classes were captured indicating consistent reproduction and a healthy population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was above average for the lake and within the normal range when compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4 to 10 inches, averaged just over 6 inches, but only about 5% were larger than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nKitchi is infested with Zebra Mussel and Rusty Crayfish; caution should be used when you enter and leave the lake.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) can be transferred from infested to non-infested waterbodies by anglers, boats, and lake shore owners.  Please follow current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes, which could negatively impact the aquatic communities. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kitchi is a 1,858 acre lake, located 18 miles east of Bemidji, MN and part of the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  A targeted survey was completed on Kitchi Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during early August in 2019 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 18 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted.  Due to steep shoreline contours, dense vegetation, and soft bottom areas only four sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites.  A total of 18 species of fish were sampled, which included eight species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey completed in 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Kitchi Lake.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nAccording to the survey, Kitchi Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",
