Northern pike in this assessment averaged about 2.0 lb/fish with fish up to 3.8 lb sampled.  Shoepack Lake is typical of many other small lakes where northern pike are abundant but size is small and larger northern pike are uncommon.Yellow perch were sampled in this assessment but netting results indicate numbers are low and the size is small.</p>",
