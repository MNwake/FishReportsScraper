                "narrative": "<p>Bob is a 82 acre lake located three miles south of Sawyer, MN, off County #7.  Bob Lake, which has a public access on the southwest shore, has a maximum depth of 20 feet with 56 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Recently, walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1989, 1993 and 1996.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1956, 1974, 1991 and 1998.     Walleye abundance, indexed with assessment nets, was 1.3 per lift in 1998.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  All walleye aged from the 1998 assessment were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was typical compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was good with 64 percent of the sampled northern pike longer than 21 inches.  Growth rates for northern pike were also good, with fish reaching 26.5 inches in length at age IV.     Abundance of black crappie indexed with assessment nets was 4.2 per lift in 1998.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure of black crappie was good with 43% of sampled fish longer than 8 inches.  Growth rates were slow, and 46% of aged crappies were born in 1994.     Bluegill and pumpkinseed catch rates were both high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor for both species and growth rates were slow for bluegill.  Fifty eight percent of the 161 aged bluegill were born in 1994.     Largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing.  A total of 18 largemouth bass were captured with a mean length of 12.8 inches.  Growth rates were fast, with bass reaching 12.5 inches at the beginning of their fourth year.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bob is a 82 acre lake with 37.5 (51%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 29.5 feet.  Bob Lake is located two miles south of Sawyer, MN off Highway #7 and has a township administered, gravel back-in access.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1989, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2003.  The primary management species from the 2000 management plan is walleye and the secondary management species are largemouth bass and bluegill.     Walleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of the three sampled walleye was 20.5 inches.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2003.  Largemouth bass abundance was 49.2 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length was 13.0 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 11.9 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year-class and all year-classes from 1995 through 2002, except 1996, represented.     Bluegill abundance of 5.6 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 5.9 inches.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 4.1 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong recruitment from 1997, 1998 and 1999 and all year-classes from 1995 through 2000 represented.     Northern pike abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 20.4 inches.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 26.0 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 2000 and 2001 year-classes and poor recruitment from other years.     Other fish species sampled in Bob Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow perch and yellow bullhead.  Bob Lake has been actively managed with the stocking of walleye fingerlings since 1989.  The three fisheries investigations conducted since then indicate only limited recruitment of stocked walleye to assessment gear (gillnets).</p>",
