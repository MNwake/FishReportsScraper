Two are water access only on the south shore, and the other is located off an unmaintained trail along the west shore at the only sand beach area on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye abundance in Windy Lake was above average for the lake class with a catch of 8.9 fish per net and was similar to past investigations. The average length was 13.7 inches although only a few of the walleyes sampled were larger than 17 inches. Walleyes were maintained through natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were below average (2.2 per lift) for the lake class with an average length of 23.5 inches although 20% of the catch measured 30 inches or larger. Northern pike growth rates are about average, and then increase when they are large enough to take full advantage of the lakes ample whitefish population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, rock bass, white sucker and lake whitefish round out the fish species list in Windy Lake.  Although whitefish numbers were above lake class averages, mean length was less than 10 inches making them excellent forage for walleyes and northern pike.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Windy Lake is located approximately 15 miles northeast of Isabella Minnesota off of Lake County Road 7.  There is a concrete back-down access on the northwest end of the lake with a dock, latrine, and gravel parking area; there are also three remote water access campsites around the lake.  The lake has an area of 456 acres with a maximum depth of 39 feet.  There are three inlets that enter Windy Lake; Beany Creek enters from the north, Landa Creek enters from the west, and an unnamed stream enters from the south.  The only outlet is Windy Creek, which flows from the west end of the lake under Lake County Road 7 into T Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey using only trap nets was conducted during the spring of 2016 to assess whether or not Black Crappie were present in the lake.  There has been an established population of Black Crappie in T Lake since at least 1995 and Windy Creek between Windy Lake and T Lake is deep enough to allow fish movement.  However, prior to 2011, the two culverts under Lake County Road 7 were perched and prevented fish passage.  In 2011, these culverts were replaced with a culvert that took into consideration fish passage.  It was thought that Black Crappie would move from T Lake into Windy Lake and establish a population.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Black Crappie were sampled in 12 trap nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, well below average relative to similar lakes.  The average weight of the fish sampled was 0.4 pounds, near average for this type of lake.  The fish ranged from 8.7 to 9.1 inches in length.  All three fish were age-3 and growth was average relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBased on this survey it appears that Black Crappie are in Windy Lake and it is likely that they have started to establish a population there.  Anglers should be able to look forward to a Black Crappie fishery in Windy Lake on top of the other fisheries that the lake already provides. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Windy Lake is located 25 miles north and slightly east of Finland along Lake County Road 7 in the Superior National Forest.  The public access consists of a concrete boat ramp with parking available for 5 or 6 vehicles, and a latrine.  A standard survey using gill nets only was completed the week of July 28, 2020 to evaluate current management goals and provide data on which to base future management decisions.  Walleye are the primary managed species with Northern Pike listed as a secondary managed species.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch of 12.5 per net was above average compared to similar lakes.  The average weight and length of 0.6 pounds and 12.3 inches would be considered below average.  The largest Walleye sampled was 21.3 inches and weighed 2.7 pounds.  Consistent natural reproduction was documented with ten year classes identified and age-3 fish representing 39% of the catch. Results support previous surveys that indicate the lake supports a high density Walleye population with few fish exceeding 20 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch of 2.3 per gill net was below the normal range compared to similar lakes, but the average weight and length of 3.9 pounds and 24.3 inches is considered above average.  Three fish longer than 30 inches were sampled, with the largest measuring 36 inches and weighing 12.7 pounds.  Seven year classes were sampled with age-4 representing 39% of the catch indicating natural reproduction is sufficient to maintain the current population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie, another species popular with anglers, were first sampled in the lake during a targeted spring trap net survey in 2016. Although none were sampled in 2020 there may be opportunities for the species because there is a connection between neighboring lakes with existing populations. Future efforts are needed to document the population in Windy Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch of 2.1 per net with an average weight of 0.14 pounds and length of 6.8 inches would all be considered average for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 8.2 inches and 0.23 pounds.  Three year classes were sampled with age-4 representing 53% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish catch of 1.8 per net was below average, and the lowest catch recorded in ten previous surveys of the lake.  The largest fish sampled was just 12.3 inches long and weighed 0.66 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nWindy Lake is known locally as a good Walleye lake with an abundant population of fish that tend to be a bit on the small side.  With the forage base of small Lake Whitefish present Windy Lake has the potential to produce some big Northern Pike.  <br> \n</p>",

Yellow Perch catches remain low, as they have in all previous assessments. Lake Whitefish numbers remain high, but the fish are small and very slow growing after Age III. Northern Pike were not plentiful but are fast growing and were of good size (average length = 22.9\" and average weight 3.21 lbs) in the gillnet catch.</p>",

At the time of this survey, the TDO3 value was 18.2 degrees Celsius. This indicates that oxythermal habitat was poor for Lake Whitefish and failed to meet the water quality standard of a TDO3 of 17.2 degrees Celsius or less for lakes that support Lake Whitefish currently proposed by the MPCA.

Northern pike abundance is low compared to similar lakes in this lake class but large northern pike are occasionally caught by anglers. Northern pike sampled in the 1995 assessment ranged in size from 12 inches to 32 inches (7.0 pounds) with approximately one third of the fish sampled larger than 24 inches (3.5 pounds).</p>",

Although Walleye were not stocked in 2 of the last 8 years (1985 & 1988) those years accounted for 24% of the fish taken in this assessment. alleyeE growth from Age IV on is 33% slower than state averges. Walleye have traditionally been small in Windy Lake, however the 12.1\" average size sampled in 1991 is slightly larger thean the Walleye taken in the 4 previous assessments. Northern Pike have declined over the past 2 assessments and average size has decreased as well. With a gillnet catch of 0.2/lift densities are now considered low. Yellow Perch and White Sucker numbers have not changed appreciably, however Lake Whitefish densities appear to be increasing as the 1991 gillnet catch ws over 4 times higher than the two previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Windy Lake is 450 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet located in the USFS Superior National Forest.  Windy Lake is categorized as lake class 5.  Lakes in this class are typically moderate in size, deep, and have soft and very clear water.  The public access is a concrete ramp on the northwest end of the lake, with parking for approximately six vehicles and trailers.  Three U.S. Forest Service remote water access only campsites are present around the lake shore.  The lake is surrounded by mixed forest on moderately sloped terrain.  The entire shoreline is undeveloped with ledge rock, boulder shoals and shoreline dropping rapidly into the lake.  Care should be taken when boating on Windy Lake as boulders pose navigational hazards in many areas. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye populations are maintained through natural reproduction.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2003 when it was determined that fry stocking was not contributing to the Windy Lake fishery.  The walleye sample in 2012 was above average for the lake class and at the high end of the range recorded in previous investigations.  The average length of the walleye sample 12.1 inches (0.6 pound) with 26% of the catch greater than 14 inches, the largest walleye sampled was 22.6 inches (4.2 pounds).  Walleye growth was below average compared to aged walleye samples in the Finland area.  It takes 5 years for a Windy Lake walleye to reach 13.5 inches.  Windy Lake is known to provide good daylight angling, due to its dark water. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike populations are maintained through natural reproduction.  However, the limited spawning habitat available at normal lake levels and below normal lake levels may negatively affect reproductive success.  While northern pike numbers were below average for the lake class the growth in Windy Lake is above average for the Finland area.  The average length of the northern pike sampled was 23.3 inches and the largest fish measured 36.2 inches (12.5 pounds).  It takes 4 years for a northern pike in Windy Lake to reach 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch provide an important forage base for the predator fish populations in Windy Lake.  The yellow perch numbers were below average for the lake class.  The average length of yellow perch was 6.8 inches; the largest was 8.8 inches (0.3 pound). <br> \n <br> \nThe lake whitefish sample in 2012 was below average for Windy Lake.  The average length was 12.5 inches, 67% of the catch was in the 12 inch range the largest lake whitefish measured 15.8 inches (1.4 pounds).   Reproduction appears to be sufficient to sustain the whitefish in Windy Lake, providing an important forage source for large northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n</p>",
