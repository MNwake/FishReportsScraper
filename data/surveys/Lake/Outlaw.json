                "narrative": "<p>Outlaw Lake is 13.5 miles northeast of Isabella MN, in the headwaters of the Rainy River Watershed; with the outlet a tributary to Harriet Creek.  Measurements taken from a 2010 aerial photo found Outlaw Lake was 12.4 acres with a bog fringe back to a tamarack/black spruce shore.  Access from the Two Moose Trail Road was on an old logging trail across federal land that headed 0.7 mile directly north to the southwest corner of the lake, this trail was narrow but suitable for hiking or snowmobile travel. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 investigation found a maximum depth of 2 feet with a bottom of muck and decaying organic material.  The dissolved oxygen was marginal for fish life, even in early winter, and likely will become anoxic before the spring thaw.  Outlaw Lake may provide habitat for minnows but it is unlikely a game fish population exists here. <br> \n</p>",
