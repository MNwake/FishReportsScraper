                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake is 575-acre lake located in southeast Douglas County between the towns of Alexandria and Osakis.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources maintains a public access on the northeast corner of the lake.  Aquatic vegetation is relatively abundant and highly diverse, which provides essential habitat for bass, sunfish, and northern pike.  Summer dissolved oxygen levels indicated that this lake stratifies during summer, resulting in deeper regions of the lake being void of oxygen.  Anglers fishing during mid-summer should target areas with depths less than 15 feet.  Smith Lake is managed primarily for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike with walleye being a species of secondary management importance.Smith Lake offers diverse angling experiences.  Panfish anglers can target bluegill, black crappie, or yellow perch.  Bluegill and yellow perch are relatively abundant and should provide anglers with the opportunity to catch many fish although the size of fish caught may be less than optimal.  Bluegill averaged 5.0 inches in length with the largest fish being 7.2 inches.  Yellow perch ranged from 4.5 to 11.5 inches with the average fish being 6.2 inches.  Black crappie are also abundant and often provide great fishing, especially during the winter months.  This population exhibited a nice size structure with 43% of the fish captured in trap nets exceeding 8 inches and 3% exceeding 10 inches.  The average weight of these fish was 1.1 pounds.  Anglers that prefer to catch larger fish can target largemouth bass, northern pike, or walleye.  Anglers targeting northern pike will find an abundant population with mostly smaller individuals with the average length being 21.6 inches and the average weight being 2.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass and walleye are less abundant in Smith Lake but the size of fish caught should provide some quality angling.  Largemouth bass averaged 1.5 pounds and 40% of the fish sampled were larger than 15 inches.  Walleyes averaged 19.6 inches in length and 2.8 pounds in weight.  Fifty percent of all walleyes collected exceeded 20 inches and the largest fish collected was over 26 inches. </p>",

Relative abundance of Yellow Perch has increased over four times since the 1979 survey and should be providing an excellent forage base. Walleye sampled were few and large as they were in 1979. While relative abundance has decreased slightly since 1979 in spite of the rotational Walleye stocking program. No Walleyes were sampled from the 1981 fingerling stocking. Bluegills remain very abundant (70 fish/net) and are a quality size with 61% greater than 6 inches. Black Crappie numbers increased over 8 times and the average size is still small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nSmith Lake is a 575-acre basin located between Alexandria and Osakis.  Maximum depth is 30.0 ft.  Mean depth is 15.0 ft.  Water clarity is impaired during summer months due to periodic algal blooms stimulated by excessive total phosphorus concentrations and seasonal die-off of curly-leaf pondweed.  A public access is located on the east shoreline. <br> \n\t <br> \nIn spite of seasonal impairments, the fish community in Smith Lake is diverse and supports good fishing opportunities.  Habitat attributes are typical of a \"bass-panfish\" lake.  Primary gamefishes include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked every other year (odd numbered years) to sustain a viable fishery.  Catches during the 2010 assessment averaged 4.9 walleye/gill net.  Mean weight of walleye was 2.7 lbs.  Growth rate is excellent with age-4 fish averaging 17.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches averaged 5.7 fish/gill net.  Average weight was 1.6 lbs.  Only two northern pike out of 51 captures exceeded 24.0 inches. Age-4 northern pike averaged 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are very abundant.  Growth is correspondingly slow.  Older bluegill captured did not exceed 6.0 inches in length until age 7.  Eighty-nine percent of bluegill captures were between 5.5 and 7.5 inches.  Average length was 6.4 inches.  Anglers are encouraged  to harvest small sunfish to improve growth and size structure of the remaining population.  <br> \n <br> \nSmith Lake has long sustained an abundance of black crappie. Unfortunately, crappie don't grow very fast and most succumb to old age before growing to 10.0 inches.  Anglers can anticipate relatively high catch rates of medium-size crappie.  Eighty percent of trap net captures were less than 9.0 inches long.  Average length of crappie caught during the 2010 survey was 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used to sample the bass population. Results indicate that largemouth bass are moderately abundant. Length frequency distribution describes a good size structure. Mean length of largemouth bass was 13.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Natural reproduction and/or fingerling stockings would account for the presence of 1984 and 1986 year classes. No stockings occurred in 1986; however, age 1 fish from Lovers Lake comprised a portion of the 1987 stockings. Age 5 Walleye averaged 19.4 inches in total length Walleye PSD was calculated at 83.0 percent. Northern Pike relative abundance remained high. Rates exceeded 16.0 fish/gill net night. Although the abundance was high, size distribution and weight are good. Northern Pike PSD exceeded 60.0 percent and mean weight averaged 2.55 lbs. Despite an abundance of Northern Pike, Yellow Perch catch rate is high at 68.6 fish/gill net. PSD was estimated at 4.0 percent. Bluegill abundance is also high. Bluegill PSD plummeted from 61.0 percent in the 1984 survey to 3.0 percent in 1989. Mean weight decreased accordingly from 0.21 lb to 0.08 lb/fish. Ninety-one percent of the Bluegills captured were under 5.0 in. Long. Black Crappie trap net catch rate increased to 49.7 fish/net night. This increase was due to a very strong 1986 year class which accounted for 93% of the Black Crappie netted. Growth rates of 1986 year class which accounted for 93% of the Black Crappie netted. Growth rates of the 1986 year class appear relatively slow. Bluegill abundance is also high. Bluegill PSD plummeted from 61.0 percent in the 1984 survey to 3.0 percent in 1989. Mean weight decreased accordingly from 0.21 lb to 0.08 lb/fish. Ninety- one percent of the Bluegills captured were under 5.0 inches long. Black Crappie trap net catch rate increased to 49.7 fish/net night. This increase was due to a very strong 1986 year class which accounted for 93% of the Black Crappie netted. Growth rates of the 1986 year class appear relatively slow. This slower growth may be due to intraspecific competition within the 86 year class. Black, Brown and Yellow Bullheads are all of a quality size and could provide angling opportunity. Bowfin (Dogfish) are numerous and a large fish.</p>",

The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes with similar chemical and physicalcharacteristics is 3.5 - 10.8 fish/gillnet.  Average weight of fish captured in gillnets was 2.5pounds.  The recent decline in northern pike abundance is likely the result poor reproductive successduring drought conditions in the late 1980's and 1990.   Many lakes in the Glenwood Area haveexperienced a similar decline.  Walleye catches averaged 4.2 fish/gillnet which is within the normalrange of mean catch rates for similar type lakes (1.3 - 5.7 fish/net).  Gillnet catches ranged from 1.2- 2.8 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Size structure of the walleye population isexceptional and should provide quality angling opportunities.  Forty five percent of the fish capturedwere 21.0 inches in length or greater.  Average weight was 2.5 pounds.  Not all stocked year classeswere well represented, but it does appear that alternate year fingerling stockings appear to bemaintaining walleye abundance at the desired management goal.  Fry stockings have proven to beineffective and natural reproduction is thought to be limited and erratic.  Bluegill catches averaged30.3 fish/trapnet in 1993.  Catch rates have ranged from 48.7 - 70.6 fish/net in surveys dating backto 1979.  Despite the decrease in trapnet catches, it is likely that bluegill are still quite abundant. Gillnet catches averaged 26.0 fish/net in 1993 compared to 6.8 fish/net in 1989.   One-half of the fishcaptured were 6 inches in length or greater, however none of the fish captured exceeded 8 inches inlength.  Black crappie catches averaged 3.2 fish/trapnet.  This catch rate is significantly less thancatches of 49.7 fish/net in 1989 and 26.4 fish/net in 1984.  Highly variable catch rates demonstratethe boom or bust nature of many crappie populations.  Periodic strong year classes can greatlyinfluence catch rates.  Poor sampling efficiency may also explain the variability in trapnet catchrates.  The normal range of mean catch rates for this lake type is only 0.6 - 2.5 fish/trapnet.  Yellowperch remain abundant.   Gillnet catches averaged 79.5 fish/net.  Catch rates have ranged from 31.6 -126.6 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1979.  Most of the fish captured were 5 - 8 inches in length. Largemouth bass were not sampled with electrofishing during this population assessment.  Electrofishingyielded 16.4 fish per hour during a special assessment in 1991 and 8.0 fish per hour in 1989.  Catchesmay have been lower than expected because of bright daylight conditions and calm water in bothassessments.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake is a 575-acre basin located between Alexandria and Osakis.  Maximum depth is 30.0 ft.  Mean depth is 15.0 ft.  Average water transparency during the summer is 5.2 ft.  Water clarity is periodically impaired during summer months due to periodic algal blooms stimulated by excessive total phosphorus concentrations and seasonal die-off of curly-leaf pondweed.   Aquatic recreational use suitability is classified as \"non-supporting\".  In spite of seasonal impairments, the fish community in Smith Lake is diverse and the lake supports a reasonably good fishing.   Habitat attributes are typical of a \"bass-panfish\" lake.  Primary gamefishes include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nSmith Lake supports a low-density population of large walleye.  Consumptive anglers might be disappointed with a fairly low harvest rate, but anglers seeking larger walleye should not dismiss Smith Lake.  Walleye grow fast.  Fifty-six percent of the walleye captured in gillnets during the 2006 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  Seven percent of those walleye exceeded 25.0 inches.  Average weight of walleye netted was 2.9 lbs.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates in seven of the previous eight fish surveys were near or exceeded the range of catches considered normal for similar lakes.   Catches during the 2006 survey were below the range of expected catches.  A net decrease in pike abundance would be desirable, but the scale of population decline introduces uncertainty in accuracy of 2006 catch statistics.  In contrast to expectations of reduced population abundance, average pike growth was slower and size distribution of captures was consistent with previous survey findings.  This species was probably under-represented in the total catch due to high water temperatures and reduced vulnerability to capture during the mid-July survey.  Fishing experiences should be good.  Twenty-eight inch pike are fairly common in the 2006 survey.  Average weight was 2.5 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nPopulations of largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie can be qualified as \"moderately\" abundant.  Average size of largemouth bass captured in 2006 was 13.0 inches in length.  Fishing quality is reasonably good.  Thirty-nine percent of electrofishing captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill and black crappie are abundant, but fishing potential is limited by slow growth and relatively short life span.  Eight-year-old bluegill captured in 2006 averaged only 7.0 inches in length.  Few bluegill live long enough to grow to 8.0-inches.  Likewise, few black crappie grow to 10.0 inches before succumbing to harvest or natural mortality.    <br> \n <br> \nSmith Lake is a good choice for young or beginning anglers.  They can expect high catch rates of medium-size panfishes.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest those small- and medium-size panfishes, particularly bluegill.  Excessive abundance of 4.5 - 7.0-inch bluegill constitutes an energy sink.  Most are too small to stimulate adequate harvest, but too big to be consumed by most resident predators.  Harvest of hammer-handle northern pike may increase survival and abundance of walleye.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Smith Lake was conducted on July 30-31, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and one sampling station had conditions that prevented the use of seines. Nearshore sampling captured 18 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) as well as three tolerant species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Smith Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community that provides ample habitat forsunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 17 feet and isabundant throughout the littoral zone.  Emergent vegetation is common in shoreline areas.  Waterclarity was notably improved in 1997.  Secchi disk measurement was 10.1 feet, compared to 2.0 feet in1993.Walleye abundance has increased.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.8 fish/net which exceeds the normal rangeof mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (1.3 - 5.0fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating backto 1979.  Size structure of the walleye population should enhance angling quality. Mean weight of fishcaptured was 2.4 pounds.   The effectiveness of alternate year walleye fingerling stocking is unclear. Age class distributions from previous surveys have suggested that natural reproduction was limited. However, the age class distribution of fish captured in 1997 indicates that relative strength of yearclasses in years of no stocking are similar to years with fingerling stocking.  Northern pike abundance has rebounded from low levels recorded in 1993, following low water levelsduring the late 1980's and 1990.  Gillnet catches increased from 5.7 fish/net in 1993 to 18.6 fish/netin 1997.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.4 fish/net in both 1989 and 1984.  The normal range of mean catchrates from similar lakes is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.4 pounds. Electrofishing yielded 35.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Over one-half of the fish capturedwere 15 inches in length or greater.  This unusual size distribution is a function of the age classstructure of the population.  Only two fish between the ages of four and seven were captured.  Unusualcool weather during the summers of 1992 and 1993 may explain the lack of age-4 and age-5 fish. Bluegill trapnet catches increased from 30.3 fish/net in 1993 to 71.2 fish/net in 1997.  However,gillnet catches decreased from 26.0 fish/net to 0.1 fish/net.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 30.0to 70.6 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  A shift in size structure of the populationmay be responsible for the discrepancy in trapnet and gillnet catch trends.  Most of the fish capturedwere between 3.5 and 6.o inches in length. Smaller fish are more likely to be captured in trapnets thangillnets.  Poor reproductive success during the cool summers of 1992 and 1993 may be responsible forthe present size structure.  Cohorts from these year classes would have been between 6.0 and 7.0 inchesin total length at time of capture.  Yellow perch catches averaged 73.1 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catcheshave been consistent in recent surveys, averaging 79.5 fish/net in 1993 and 68.6 fish/net in 1989. Approximately 20% of the fish captured were 8 inches in length or greater.  Two black crappie werecaptured in survey nets.  Trapnet catch rates have been highly variable in past surveys; averaging 3.2fish/net in 1993, 49.7 fish/net in 1989, and 26.4 fish/net in 1984.  Highly variable catch ratesdemonstrate the boom and bust nature of many black crappie populations.  Poor sampling efficiencyduring summer months may also explain the variability in trapnet catch rates.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith Lake is a 666-acre natural lake located between Alexandria and Osakis.  Maximum and mean depths are 30 and 15 feet, respectively.  Aquatic recreation is seasonally impaired due to excessive nutrient loading and algal blooms.  The annual die off of curly-leaf pondweed and release of nutrients back in the water can also stimulate algae blooms in late June and early July.  Water transparency during summer months has averaged approximately 6.0 feet.  Even though the lake has water quality impairment, it supports a productive fishery.  Aquatic vegetation is relatively abundant and provides essential habitat for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Black Crappie can be abundant.  Walleye are stocked to diversify fishing opportunities.   A concrete access is located on the northeast side of the lake, off of Smith Lake Road SE. <br> \n  <br> \nA standard lake survey was completed in 2018 to gain updated information on fish community structure, abundance and size distribution of gamefishes, and assess contributions of Walleye stocking.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey to best sample the Largemouth Bass population and a netting survey completed July 23-26, to gain the greatest possible catches of other fishes.  A water temperature and dissolved oxygen profile completed at the onset of the netting survey confirmed that Smith Lake becomes thermally stratified during the summer.  The upper boundary of the thermocline was relatively shallow at 9.0 feet in depth.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 18.0 feet were too low to support fish for any extended period. <br> \n  <br> \nSpring electrofishing efforts yielded modest catches of Largemouth Bass.  Lengths of bass captures ranged from 10.0 to 16.8 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.   Catches of younger bass less than 12.0 inches in length were limited suggesting annual recruitment has been low in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nNetting catches described a moderate population density for Northern Pike.  Pike catches ranged from 15.7 to 31.2 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  The Walleye catch rate of 3.9 fish/gill net was lower than desired but above average for similar lakes assigned to Lake Class 31.  The Walleye catch was largely comprised of large, older individuals.  Average size was large at 20.5 inches.  The population sample was comprised of eight age groups.  Age distribution of Walleye catches extended to age 12.  Growth of older Walleyes appears slow.  The largest capture measured 24.9 inches.   <br> \n   <br> \nPanfishes, namely Black Crappies and Bluegills, proved to be abundant.  Population densities appear to be too great to maximize growth potential.  Crappie catches in trap nets averaged 8.5 inches.  Only a few captures were 10.0 inches or larger.  Average length of Bluegill captures was 6.0 inches.  Only two Bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largest measured 8.2 inches.  The rich diversity and coverage of submergent vegetation offers small panfish escape cover for predators.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller Bluegills to reduce density and increase growth potential.  Smith Lake also supports a moderate-density population of Pumpkinseed.  Size structure was similar to that of Bluegills.  Yellow Perch are also abundant, but few if any captured among survey were large enough to stimulate harvest.  Perch have adapted to periods of elevated predator densities to attain sexual maturity at a young age and small size.  This population is important to the diet of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during the 2018 survey included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads, Bowfin (Dogfish), and Common Carp.  Black and Yellow Bullhead catch rates describe these populations as abundant.  Anglers have opportunity to catch some large bullheads.  Many bullheads exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  The largest Black Bullhead was nearly 15.0 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nSmith Lake has not yet been added to the DNR's infested waters list.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lakeshore owners.  The addition of undesirable aquatic invasive plants and animals can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding AIS see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> \n</p>",
