                "narrative": "<p>Deep Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 small lakes in northeast Minnesota.  Deep Lake is deeper than many of the lakes in this lake class and has clearer and harder (more highly mineralized) water.  Deep Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-oligotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Deep Lake was thermally stratified on 07/19/2004 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 21 ft, where the temperature was 51 F.  There was no water flowing in the inlet (which drains local swamps) and very low flow in the outlet (to Ely Lake) on 7/21/2004.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand, silt, and muck.  There is a dense fringe of aquatic vegetation around the entire lake, with concentrations in the shallows and growing to a depth of 15 ft.  The most common plants are muskgrass, yellow waterlilies, various pondweeds, and cattails.The water level of Deep Lake increased about 20 ft between 1943 and 1979.  Fish populations and other biota in the lake are probably still adjusting to this change in water volume, especially in the newly flooded riparian areas.The southeast shore of Deep Lake is owned by the City of Gilbert.  The southwest shore is owned by two private parties, and there is one home.  The DMIR Railroad passes very close to the northwest shore.  There is a public access owned by the City of Gilbert that has a dirt ramp and is in poor condition, with ruts and rocks.Fish sampling in the 2004 fisheries lake survey consisted of three standard gillnet sets, nine standard trapnet sets and four small mesh (1/4\") trapnet sets for sampling young-of-year fish.  Three previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1984, used three gillnet sets and 4-6 trapnet sets.  Two ?\" trapnets were used during the 1984 investigation.Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by bluegill and hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and white sucker.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.  Northern pike and yellow perch numbers were lower than in previous investigations.  Bluegill numbers in 2004 (10.0/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were near the median catch of 7.1/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill were also the most abundant species captured in the small mesh trapnets in 2004.  Bluegill sizes in the trapnets in 2004 averaged  4.7\" (0.08 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest bluegill in 2004 was 7.2\".  Most bluegill were ages two, three, and five.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2004 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Hybrid sunfish, a cross between bluegill and green or pumpkinseed sunfish, were also fairly abundant in 2004 (6.8/trapnet).  Hybrid sunfish numbers appear to have increased over time, but some problems with identification of these fish may have occurred in the past.Largemouth bass were first observed in the 1998 investigation, and their numbers in the gillnets in 2004 (2.3/net) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Largemouth bass are known to be \"net shy\" and are probably more abundant than indicated by their numbers in the gillnets and trapnets.  Largemouth were also the most common young-of-year fish species caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2004, although only seven were caught.  Largemouth sizes averaged 12.8\" and the largest was 14.7\".  Seven year classes of largemouth were captured in 2004, indicating good natural reproduction of this species.  Growth of largemouth captured in 2004 was faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age).Northern pike and yellow perch numbers in Deep Lake have usually been lower than normal for this lake class, but were especially low in 2004.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in Deep Lake in 2000 and 2003, and all seven of the walleye captured in the standard gillnets and trapnets were from these two year classes.  Two walleye captured in the small mesh trapnets were not aged.Many of the game fish examined in 2004 were infected with neascus, and yellow perch were infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.   They cannon infect humans, are often removed by filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deep Lake is a 73-acre lake located two miles south of Gilbert. There is a public access with an earthen boat ramp located near the south end of the lake off CR 97. The access is relatively small, with limited space for parking or turning around. Deep Lake has relatively steep drop-offs, especially along the north shoreline. Nearshore areas tend to have soft bottom substrates, and a dense fringe of vegetation grows to within a couple feet of the surface out to depths of 10-15 feet around the entire lake. <br> \n <br> \nDeep Lake was thermally stratified on July 24, 2023, with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F. Adequate oxygen for most fish was retained to a depth of at least 18 feet where the temperature was 54 F. Deep Lake is exceptionally clear, with 20 feet of visibility during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 5.1 fish/trap net, which was slightly lower than the historical average for the lake. Bluegill also tended to be small, with an average length of just 5.2 inches. The largest bluegill sampled was 7.6 inches in length. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also sampled in this survey and tended to be slightly larger, with several individuals over 8.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 1.8 fish/trap net, which was identical to the historical average for the lake. Black crappie averaged 8.7 inches in length in trap nets. However, the largest crappie was 11.6 inches long and was sampled in a gill net. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.3 fish/gill net, which was relatively high compared to previous surveys on Deep Lake and other similar lakes in the Tower area. The average length of pike sampled in 2023 was 21.4 inches, which was lower than the historical average of 25.7 inches for Deep Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTwo largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets with an average length of 13.2 inches. This was a similar catch rate and average size to the historical average of all bass sampled from Deep Lake. Targeted sampling of the bass population using electrofishing was conducted during the last survey in 2018. Results from that sampling indicated good natural reproduction in Deep Lake, and bass up to 18.0 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one walleye was sampled in this survey despite regular fingerling stockings since 2000. The walleye was 23.6 inches in length. Additional species sampled in 2023 included white sucker, yellow perch, golden shiner, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deep Lake is located approximately 2 miles S of Gilbert in central St. Louis County. This lake is stocked with walleye, however, a healthy population of largemouth bass currently exists. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an earthen boat ramp located near the S end of Deep Lake off CR 97 for public access. Access parking is limited in size and space. <br> \n <br> \nTen species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey of Deep Lake. Gill nets, trap nets and night electrofishing were all utilized as sampling methods. Northern pike and bluegill dominated the gill net and trap net catches, respectively. Good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled during electrofishing efforts. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (6.0/gill net) were above the historical average for Deep Lake (1.8/gill net) and above average (3.0/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. Pike average length was 22.1 inches which is smaller than the historical average length of 26.5 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2018 measured 37.6 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2018 (7.8/trap net) were below the historical average for this lake (8.9/trap net) and above average (5.0/trap net) compared to other lakes in the area which are similar. Bluegill average length was only 4.6 inches which is slightly smaller than the historical average length of 4.9 inches. The largest bluegill sampled was 7.1 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 104 largemouth bass (73.4/hr on-time) were sampled by electrofishing in 2018. Largemouth average length was 13.6 inches. Approximately 84% of the largemouth in the sample were 12 inches or larger with a maximum length of 18.0 inches recorded. Nine year classes were identified from the sample by aging, indicating good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of black crappie were observed from the 2018 sample. Crappie sizes averaged 8.5 inches long. Despite stocking walleye fingerlings every third year, only one walleye was sampled from Deep Lake during the 2018 survey. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deep Lake is a 61-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located two miles southeast of Gilbert in central St. Louis County.  There is a city-owned public access on the south end of the lake off of county road 97.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Deep is in lake class 11.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Colby, Frying Pan, Range, and Silver Lakes.  Lakes in this lake class are small in size (mean:  161 acres), and have soft, clear water.  Deep is stocked every third year with walleye fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand, silt, and muck. There is a dense fringe of aquatic vegetation around the entire lake, with concentrations in the shallows and growing to a depth of 15 ft. The most common plants are muskgrass, yellow waterlilies, various pondweeds, and cattails.  <br> \n <br> \nThe water level of Deep Lake increased about 20 ft between 1943 and 1979.  <br> \nThe southeast shore of Deep Lake is owned by the City of Gilbert. The southwest shore is owned by two private parties, and there is one home. The DMIR Railroad passes very close to the northwest shore. There is a public access owned by the City of Gilbert that has a dirt ramp and is in poor condition, with ruts and rocks.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye ranged in length from  11.1 inches to 24.1 inches with a mean length and weight of 15.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Most of the walleye sampled were from stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nFew northern pike were captured, but they were above average in size.  Pike ranged in length from 24.2 inches to 36.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 28.4 inches and 6.0 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, seven different species from the sunfish family were captured with bluegill being the most abundant species with an abundance rating that was typical of other lake class 11 lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 inches to 8.1 inches with only five percent of the sample greater than or equal to 7 inches.  Growth was slow.  Deep Lake bluegill were 4.1 inches long after four years.  Other members of the sunfish family captured include pumpkinseed, rock bass, green sunfish, largemouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deep Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 small lakes in northeast Minnesota.  In comparison to most of the lakes in this lake class, Deep Lake is smaller (61 acres), deeper (50 ft maximum), has harder water (total alkalinity = 162 ppm), is clearer (Secchi water clarity = 14 ft), and has a basin shape which is more round.Deep Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) below 20 ft, where the water temperature is about 50 F.  The 7/20/98 temperature-oxygen profile indicated oxygen supersaturation from about 13' to 17', probably caused by a midwater algae bloom.  The lake inlet drains local swamps.  The outlet, to Ely Lake, has no barriers to fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand and muck.  Aquatic plants grow along the entire shoreline to a depth of 15 ft; cattails, sedges, arrowhead, water milfoil, and water smartweed are the most common plants.A lake survey (1984) and a fish population assessment (1988) each consisted of three gillnet sets and four trapnet sets.  The 1998 population assessment consisted of three gillnet sets and six trapnet sets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 23 fish/net (25 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was about twice as high as in the two previous gillnettings, due mostly to an increase in the catch of suckers in 1998.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1998 of 53 fish/net (6 lb/net) was higher than in previous trapnettings, due to an increase in the catch of sunfish, crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch in 1998.Fish populations in 1998 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, white sucker, and northern pike, followed by yellow perch and black crappie.  Other species were present in low numbers.Bluegill numbers in 1998 (26/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were much higher than the numbers in previous trapnettings in 1984 and 1988.  Bluegill sizes in 1998 averaged 5\", similar to previous trapnet catches.  The largest bluegill captured in 1998 was 9\".  Bluegill growth (4\" at age three, 5\" at age four) was normal for this lake class.White sucker numbers in 1998 (9/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than sucker numbers in 1984 and 1988.  Sucker sizes were small, averaging 11\".Northern pike numbers in 1998 (2/gillnet) were lower than previous numbers in 1984 and 1988.  Pike sizes in 1998 were large, averaging 32\"; the largest pike caught in 1998 was 37\".  Pike growth (24\" at age three, 31\" at age six) was faster than normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1998 (8/gillnet, 7/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, and were higher than previous numbers in 1984 and 1988.  Perch sizes averaged 7\" in the gillnets and 8\" in the trapnets; the largest perch (caught in a trapnet) was 10\".  Perch growth (6\" at age four) was normal for the area.Black crappie numbers in 1998 (6/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than numbers in 1984 and 1988.  Crappie sizes averaged 8\"; the largest (caught in a gillnet) was 11\".  Crappie growth (7\" at age three) was normal for the area.</p>",
