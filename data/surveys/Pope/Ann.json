                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a shallow lake prone to summerkill and winterkill events.  The last partial summerkill occurred in 2004.  The gamefish community has since rebounded and should provide good fishing opportunities in absence of another die off. <br> \n <br> \nAlternate year fry stockings have been used to restore and maintain a walleye population.  Stockings have provided excellent, but short-term fishing opportunities in previous years.  Survey results indicated that walleye fry stocking success was good in 2009.  Gillnet catches averaged 15.0 fish/net.  The majority of sampled fish were from this single stocked year class. These young fish should reach a harvestable size in 2012.  Average length at time of the survey was 11.5 inches.    Largemouth bass numbers have increased substantially in recent years.  Average size of sampled fish was small, but this young population will provide quality angling opportunities in the near future.   Mean length of sampled fish was 11.4 inches.  The largest bass measured was 14.1 inches in length.  A record-high black crappie catch rate was recorded in 2010.  Mean length of sampled fish was 8.0 inches.  Six percent of sampled fish exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  Bluegill numbers have also increased.  Trapnet catches averaged 4.4 fish/net, which is a record-high catch rate for Ann Lake.  Mean length was 5.6 inches.  Growth is rapid.  Age-2 fish averaged 5.7 inches at time of capture.  A re-introductory stocking of yellow perch was completed in 2007 following their absence from the fishery during the previous two surveys.  Gillnet catches averaging 34.7 fish/net in 2010 indicates a successful re-introductory stocking and reproducing population.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.7 inches.  The largest perch capture measured 11.7 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers are low following a record high catch in 2005.  Average size is small.  White suckers and young carp are extremely abundant. <br> \n</p>",

Survey results will be used to inform stocking decisions and update the public on current and future fishing opportunities. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye abundance (4.0/gill net) has declined significantly since the 2018 standard survey (29.2/gill net). Most Walleye were older (age 7) and therefore large, ranging from 19 to 23 inches. Average length was almost 22 inches. Yellow Perch are currently extremely abundant (180.3/gill net). Most fish were young but are growing very fast. Perch ranged in length from 6 to 12 inches, with a mean of 8 inches. If Ann Lake does not winterkill for a few years it may provide a jumbo perch fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are abundant (36.0/gill net) but most were small (ranged in length from 5 to 8 inches). Bluegill were also abundant (30.7/gill net) and ranged from 3 to 8 inches, with a mean of only 4 inches. After sustained lower abundance the previous two surveys, the Black Bullhead population has significantly increased (101.3/gill net). Most individuals are small (less than 8 inches) but the largest bullhead sampled was 16 inches and 3 pounds. Additional species sampled include Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a shallow, hyper-eutrophic lake that is prone to occasional partial winterkill events.  Thelatest partial winterkill occurred in the winter of 1988-89.  Walleye fry were stocked in the springof 1989 and in three of the six following years.  Adult black crappie and bluegill were also stockedfollowing the partial winterkill in 1989.Walleye gillnet catches averaged 4.2 fish/gillnet in 1995.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.1pounds.  Approximately 90% of the fish captured were 15 inches in length or greater and 17% exceeded20 inches.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 257.7 fish/net.  The normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 2.7 - 25.0 fish/net.  Mean weight offish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Yellow perch were not present during special assessments in 1990 and1991.  Bluegill catches averaged only 0.2 fish/trapnet.  However, gillnet catches averaged 5.5fish/net.   This may suggest that bluegill were not inhabiting the shoreline areas during late July andare more abundant than trapnet catches indicate.  Fish captured in both gears were small.  Mean weightwas 0.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass abundance is extremely limited or they are not present at all in AnnLake.  Daytime, DC electrofishing failed to capture any largemouth bass in 1.0 hours of samplingeffort.  Black bullhead abundance has decreased since the partial winterkill in 1989.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 38.2 fish/net in 1995.  In comparison, the gillnet catch rate was 667 fish/net in 1991.  Meanweight of fish captured was 0.6 pounds in 1995.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a shallow, hypereutrphic lake located four miles north of Glenwood near State Hwy 55.  Maximum depth is only 14 feet which makes it prone to occasional winterkill.  The last winterkill event occurred during the winter of 1997-98.  Water quality and clarity are considered poor.  Dense algal blooms occur throughout the summer months.  Ann Lake receives excessive nutrients from its agricultural watershed.  Cultivated row crops and animal feedlots are the primary sources.  Ann Lake has produced little recreational fishing over the past decade.  Degraded aquatic habitat and occasional winter mortality have resulted in unbalanced fish communities.  These fish communities are dominated by undesirable fish species which are tolerant to the adverse environmental conditions present in Ann Lake.  Walleye fry have been stocked frequently to provide some recreational fishing.  At present, small age-2 walleye are somewhat abundant.  These fish averaged about 8 inches in 2000.  They may provide some angling opportunities in the near future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 370-acre basin located four miles northwest of Glenwood.  Mean and max depths are 12 and 14 feet, respectively.  There is a gravel access on the northwest side of the lake off County Road 15.\n\nThis shallow, fertile lake is prone to occasional winterkill events and summer algal blooms.  The last winterkill took place in the winter of 2013-2014.  Restorative stockings of Walleyes, Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Yellow Perch occurred in early 2014.  A standard lake survey was completed in 2018 to gain estimates of fish abundance and determine size structure of gamefish populations.  Survey findings confirmed the fish community has rebounded and Ann Lake can offer good fishing opportunities between winterkill events.\n\nBlack Crappie catches were high following successful reproduction of stocked adults.  Average length of these young crappies was approximately 7.5 inches.  The largest capture measured 11.6 inches.  Bluegill catches were surprisingly high.  Growth of young Bluegills has been fast.  Average length of Bluegills captured measured 7.9 inches.  Fifteen percent of Bluegills captured in gill nets measured 8.0 inches and larger.  An electrofishing survey was completed in June targeting Largemouth Bass.  Bass proved to be moderately abundant, but the electrofishing catch was dominated by small fish.  Mean length was 10.5 inches.  The largest bass captured measured 14.5 inches. \n\nWalleye catches were very high, averaging 29.2 fish/gill net.  Most of the population sample was made up of harvestable-size fish.  Average length of Walleyes was 16.3 inches.  The largest measured 23.3 inches.  A few of these larger fish apparently survived the last winterkill event or moved back into the lake from connected waters.  Gill net catches also included modest numbers of Northern Pike.  These fish were not stocked.  Most pike were small fish, averaging 21.2 inches.\n   \nAnn Lake supports a promising Yellow Perch fishery.  Gill net catches averaged 50.0 perch/net.  Most of the catch was made up of two-year-old fish.  Even though they proved to be young fish, average length of those two-year-old captures was 9.5 inches.  The oldest perch captures were five-year-olds that averaged 11.8 inches.  The largest Yellow Perch captured measured 12.2 inches.\n\nOther fishes sampled in this survey included Black Bullheads, Common Carp, and White Suckers.  Populations of these tolerant fishes often make up most of the total weight of fishes captured in lakes similar to Ann Lake.  Catches were low in 2018 compared to past surveys in probable response to a more diverse fish community and healthy predator density.\n\nTypical of winterkill lakes, Ann Lake is a \"boom and bust\" fishery where fish growth is fast but fishing opportunity is intermittent between winterkill events. Ann Lake is currently on a boom cycle with some excellent numbers and sizes of gamefish.   Hopefully, this promising fishery can be sustained through the harsh winter of 2018-19.\n\nAnn Lake is an impaired water due excess nutrient loading.  As a result, frequent and severe algal blooms are common during summer months, including prevalent blue-green algae.  Ann Lake is not listed as \"Infested Water\" but the lake does contain curly-leaf pondweed and Common Carp.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively affect lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html \n</p>",

Northern pike are low in numbers and generally small in size. Bluegills are very low in numbers (1.33/trapnet) but the mean size is 0.75 pounds. It appears there has been some natural reproduction of walleyes in Ann Lake, but it seems to be limited as to year class success. Although walleye gillnet indices are fair (5.0/gillnet), the shining star for Ann Lake is the mean size of walleye sampled (3.65 pounds).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a shallow lake prone to partial winterkill and summerkill events.  The last partial summerkill occurred during 2004.  The 2005 fish community assessment reflected this.  Very few adult gamefishes were present.  The majority of the capture sample was comprised of roughfishes and juvenile gamefishes.Fishing success on shallow basins subject to winterkill and summerkill events is typically \"boom\" or \"bust\".  Because of recent partial summerkill, fishing success on Ann Lake will likely be poor for at least a couple of years.  Alternate year fry stockings maintain the walleye population and this stocking regime has provided excellent fishing opportunities in previous years.  Survey results indicated that walleye fry stocking success was relatively good in 2005.  This year class should recruit to the fishery by 2008.  Summer anglers might find it difficult to fish for walleyes because of extremely high submergent vegetation abundance.  Curly-leaf pondweed dominates the aquatic vegetation community.  This deleterious exotic has expanded greatly in recent years to a point where many anglers consider it to be at nuisance levels.  The increase in submergent vegetation abundance has led to an increase in northern pike and largemouth bass numbers because of improved spawning and nursery habitat for these two species.  A record-high northern pike catch was recorded in 2005 but most fish were smaller individuals.  Largemouth bass numbers have also increased in recent years.  An introductory stocking of 40 pair of adult bass was completed in 2004 and survey results indicated that those fish successfully reproduced in 2005.  Very few adult bass are currently present but this population will likely increase in both numbers and size structure in future years.  Sunfish are also present in Ann Lake but abundance is extremely low.  Black bullhead abundance has decreased since the summerkill event of 2004, but the catch rate of this species is still extremely high.Curly-leaf pondweed is present in this basin.  To reduce the spread of this deleterious exotic, all boaters should make a concentrated effort to remove all aquatic vegetation from their boat and trailer before leaving the public access.
