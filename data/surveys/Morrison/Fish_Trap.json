                "narrative": "<p>WALLEYE population was up in this survey from 4.50 in 1980 to 8.50 in 1985. Average size in 1980 was 2.0 lb./fish, in 1985 it was 2.1 lbs.  Average annual stocking between 1981 and 1985 was 8,179 fingerlings that were 13.8/pound.  Stocking should continue at the present rate through the 1990 survey.  Naturally reproduced walleye were found in substantial numbers only on the west shore of Big Island.  Reports of increased angler catches began in 1984.  The LARGEMOUTH BASS population appears to be in very good condition, catch rates were good. We plan to establish a new posted spawning area in the spring of 1986 on the south central shoreline of the lake.  NORTHERN PIKE catch was very similar to the in 1970.  The catch was 7.17/gillnet lift with an average size of 2.0 pounds compared to 5.08/gillnet lift and an average size of 1.5 pounds in 1980.  The cool weather could have contributed to the bigger and better northern pike catches.  Population levels hopefully will not get any higher than the present levels so a quality fishery will remain.  BOWFIN population is the highest recorded for the lake.  CARP have not been caught in the lake, but are often seen below the dam at the outlet.  WHITE SUCKER numbers are above average and size large.  A SHORTHEAD REDHORSE was caught for the first time.  YELLOW BULLHEAD catch was high in the gillnets, but lower than the 1980 catch.  BROWN and BLACK BULLHEADS are present at much lower levels.  BLUEGILL levels were similar to 1970 levels.  Size is just under average with a few big ones.  Population is over 4 times the state average.  ROCK BASS, PUMPKINSEEDS and HYBRID SUNFISH are present in above numbers.  GREEN SUNFISH are present in below average numbers.  YELLOW PERCH are present in fair numbers in the larger sizes (12.83/gillnet), but were abundant in the smaller sizes sampled with our large seine in the N.R.C.BLACK CRAPPIES are large in size and heavily sought after in late winter by anglers.  The 1985 catches were among the highest recorded for the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey using 12 gill nets was completed the week of August 16, 2021. Typically this survey is replicated every four years although this schedule has been shortened to every three years due to the inclusion of Fish Trap Lake in a research study analyzing the effects of zebra mussels on Walleye recruitment. This discussion summarizes data collected for Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrently the Walleye population is meeting management goals which is three or more Walleyes per gill net. This catch rate (fish/gill net) is a measure of relative abundance and considered average for a lake like Fish Trap (lakes with similar physical/chemical attributes). About 70% of the population measured over 15 inches. The fishery has remained stable for the past 20 years and continues to support modest fishing pressure.  <br> \n   <br> \nA special pike regulation is currently in place on Fish Trap Lake (2003-present). It protects fish 24-36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed. The possession limit is three. Pre and post-regulation size structure data indicate large increases in sample percentages of fish >24 and 30 inches using summer gill net and ice-out trap nets. For example, the average percentage of pike >24 and >30 inches sampled by pre-regulation gill nets (7 surveys) was 8% and 1%. Post regulation data (5 surveys) saw the average for the same size categories increase to 25% and 4%. These data represent an approximate 200 and 300% increase in pike >24 inches and >30 inches, respectively. Ice-out trap netting show even greater increases, especially for pike >30 inches (as much as 900%). For both gear types, the largest increases were seen for pike over 30 inches. Anglers can help continue this shift to larger pike in Fish Trap Lake by complying with the special regulation. Research has shown that it doesn't take much removal of large pike to have a negative impact on the population. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow Perch numbers fluctuate widely in Fish Trap Lake. Right now there's good numbers of perch which will provide ample forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike. Average size is less than 8 inches though, so from an angling standpoint there isn't much fishing value. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake is a popular recreational lake in northwest Morrison County.  The many bays and islands offer scenic variety, some seclusion, and fishing hot spots.  The lake supports several resorts and one campground.  While shoreline development has increased on the lake, some of the natural beauty of the shoreline has been preserved.  Rock and sand substrates are common along shorelines and shallow bars near some of the islands.  Summer water clarity showed some improvment since the last survey in 1998, increasing from 7 feet in early August of `98 to 14 feet at the same time this summer.  When comparing water clariy data from the MPCA's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program, summer secchi disk averages have ranged from 7.1 feet in 1974 and 1988 to 14.9 feet in 2001.      Fish Trap supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills.  Walleye numbers have declined since 1994 and were below management goals for the lake.  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 9 to 29 inches were seen in the survey.  Walleye stocking was resumed in 1998 after it appeared natural reproduction could not sustain the fishery at the desired level.  Fish are currently stocked in even years and occurence of natural reproduction continues to be monitored.      Northern pike numbers appear to be at their lowest level since 1957.  While most of the fish seen in the survey were less than 24 inches in length, pike over 30 inches have been documented.  A protected slot from 24 - 36 inches for northern pike will go into effect on the opening day of fishing May, 2003.  The goal of the protected slot is to increase the number of pike exceeding 24 in the population and produce trophy size fish over 36 inches.  Lower pike numbers should decrease competition with and predation on the walleye and largemouth bass.    Fish Trap Lake has a good largemouth bass population in both size and abundance.  The multitude of weedy shallow bays and irregular shoreline provides excellent habitat for the species.  Both the survey and spring electrofishing turned up good numbers of medium size fish as well as documenting the presence of trophy size fish up to 20 inches.  Yellow perch numbers were at their lowest to date which could have a negative impact on pike and walleye growth as perch can be an important prey species for the gamefish.  The lower pike and walleye populations may, however, allow the perch population to recover.    Panfish species in the lake include bluegill, pumpkinseeds, black crappie, and rock bass.  Bluegills over 6 inches were common in both the spring assessment for panfish and the summer survey conducted in 2002.  Black crappies provide a popular ice fishing opportunity in the area.  Summer nets can be ineffective at catching crappies, however, the 2002 net results suggested an abundant population in the lake.  A wide range of sizes was seen in the survey with a good number of the fish over ten inches.  Rock bass continue to be abundant and a nuisance to most anglers.    Roughfish species in the fish community include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, tullibee or cisco, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the bullhead species with all three species having individuals over 11 inches.  One brown bullhead measured more than 15 inches in length.  The bowfin and tullibee populations appear to be low, but anglers are likely to see big fish.    Best shoreline and watershed management practices such as limiting emergent vegetation removal are encouraged to protect the water quality and fish habitat in the lake.  Emergent vegetation will also provide wildlife habitat and reduce shoreline erosion from high water and boat wakes. \t    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Fish Trap Lake in early June of 2014 to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.   Panfish, especially Black Crappie, provide an important fishery in the area.  A summer lake survey using only gill nets was later conducted in August which targeted the game fish.  Summer trap nets tend to sample the small to medium panfish and rarely provide an accurate picture of the larger fish in a population.  Eight lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice in the 2014 panfish assessment for a total of 16 lifts. <br> \n       The 2014 panfish assessment was effective at capturing Bluegill with 928 caught.  The fish measured from 2.9 to 8.7 inches in length with a mean length of 5.6 inches.   Modal length for the sample was 5 - 5.5 inches and 26% (n=244) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 4% (n=33) more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n       Ages 2 through 9 were represented in the 2014 Bluegill sample.   Two year classes from 2011 and 2010 together accounted for 63% of the catch, 32% from 2011 and 31% from 2010.  All age groups exhibited fast growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       The 2010 panfish assessment was dominated by smaller fish.  A total of 476 Bluegill were caught that ranged from 2.8 to 8.6 inches in length.  Mean length was slightly shorter than in 2014 at 5.4 inches but modal length was the same, 5 - 5.5 inches.  Bluegill more than seven inches in length comprised only 4% (n=17) of the sample with 0.8% (n=4) that exceeded eight inches. <br> \n       Timing was good for Bluegill in the 2002 spring panfish assessment with 1,119 fish sampled.  With the large sample size, a subsample (36%) of the fish was measured.  Despite the high catch, the sample displayed a more desirable size structure than in the two more recent panfish assessments.   Bluegill in the 2002 panfish assessment measured from 3.9 \u0013 9.3 inches in length with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 6.5 - 7 inches and 35% (n=388) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 3% (n=31) more than eight inches. <br> \n       Spring ice-out assessments have also provided some additional data on the Bluegill population, but fewer fish have been caught than in the panfish assessments.  The 2011 ice-out assessment netted only 74 Bluegill with 124 caught in 2005 and 324 in 1998.  The 2005 ice-out assessment provided the most desirable sample size structure of the three ice-out assessments.  Bluegill up to 8.5 inches were measured and mean length for the sample was seven inches.  Modal length was 7 - 7.5 inches and 59% (n=73) of the Bluegill were more than seven inches in length with 9% (n=11) that exceeded eight inches in length.   <br> \n        The lake management goal for Bluegill is to have a spring panfish trap net catch where at least 20% of the fish exceed seven inches in length.  That goal was met in both the 2014 and 2002 panfish assessments. <br> \n       Black Crappie catches have been rather disappointing in the spring panfish assessments.  The highest catch was 39 fish in 2014, while in 2010, only two crappie were caught.  The 2002 panfish assessment sampled nine crappie.   Although the biggest crappie caught in the 2014 panfish assessment was 10.8 inches, 90% (n=35) of the fish were more than nine inches in length with 69% (n=27) that exceeded ten inches.   <br> \n       Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the 2014 Black Crappie catch.  Two year classes from 2010 and 2009 accounted for most of the sample; 51% from 2010 and 36% from 2009.      <br> \n       Ice-out assessments have proven to be more effective at capturing Black Crappie.  Sixty-nine crappie were caught in the 2011 ice-out assessment while 585 were caught in 2005* and 135 in 1998. (*The assessment period in 2005 ran for seven days and used both standard lake survey trap nets and large-frame trap nets).  All three ice-out assessments captured Black Crappie that exceeded 12 inches with the longest being 13 inches in 2005.  Crappie more than nine inches comprised significant portions of the ice-out samples, 67% in 2011, 64% in 2005, but only 15% in 1998.  Fish more than 10 inches in length accounted for 46% of the 2011 catch, 25% of the 2005 catch, and only 4% of the 1998 catch. <br> \n       The Black Crappie lake management goal is based on results from spring ice-out assessments rather than spring panfish assessments.  The goal for Fish Trap Lake is to have an ice-out assessment crappie catch where at least 20% of the fish exceed 10 inches.  This goal was met in both the 2011 ice-out assessment where 46% of the crappie were more than 10 inches and in 2005 where 25% of the fish were.  In 1998, only 4% of the fish exceeded 10 inches in length.   <br> \n       The 2014 summer gill nets provided an additional catch of 22 Black Crappie and 114 Bluegill.  The 1.8/GN crappie catch fell within the normal range for lake class 25 and the sample was comprised mostly of fish over nine inches.  Crappie up to 11.9 inches were sampled with the mean length being 9.2 inches and modal lengths of 10 - 10.5 inches and 11 - 11.5 inches.  Fish that exceeded nine inches accounted for 68% (n=15) of the sample with 64% (n=14) more than 10 inches and 32% (n=7) over 11 inches in length.   <br> \n       The gill net Bluegill sample was not as impressive as the crappie catch.  Fish between 4 and 8.6 inches were caught but mean length was 5.9 inches and modal length 5.5 - 6 inches.  Sixteen percent (n=18) of the fish were more than seven inches in length with 4% (n=5) greater than eight inches.  <br> \n       Game fish species sampled in the 2014 spring panfish assessment included two Walleye, 18.6 and 26.5 inches in length, four Northern Pike between 12 and 29 inches, and two Largemouth Bass, nine and 17.4 inches in length.  Additional fish species caught included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake (DOW# 49-0137; Lake Class 25) is a 1,164-acre lake located near Lincoln, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest shore. Fish Trap Lake has 13.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet. Fish Trap Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, have hard water, clear, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance and size structure was down compared to previous years, but the size structure of the population was good with fish up to 19 inches captured. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Zebra Mussels and Curly Leaf Pondweed have been identified in Fish Trap Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on selective net catch data and ecological lake classification, the fish population of Fishtrap Lake can be characterized as follows:The WALLEYE population has shown no \"real\" change since the precious survey in 1985.  The population remains high while mean size and growth rates are normal.  The median length group is the same as in 1985 (17.0 - 17.9 inches).  Fingerlings stocking has been conducted annually since 1981 and all of the corresponding year classes (I-IX) are present.  Current and past reproduction checks indicate successful natural reproduction, however, the extent of the natural contribution to the fishery has been difficult to assess due to annual fingerling stocking.NORTHERN PIKE numbers remain very similar to 1985 and the population is considered average.  Mean fish size is normal and has changed little since 1985.  Age groups I through VI were represented in the sample.  Growth rates were fast for age groups I and II and normal for the other groups.The YELLOW PERCH population is average in number and mean size.  There has been no significant change in numbers since 1985.  Average size of fish has not changed appreciably nor has the size range (5.0 - 9.9 inches).  Age groups II through VII were sampled.The LARGEMOUTH BASS population is high with a net catch of 4.20/set which is above the third quartile of 2.50/set.  The 1990 net catch is nearly four times the catch in 1985.  Average size is quite small (0.12 pound), as was the case in 1985 (0.09 pounds).  The selection gear for this species (trapnet) may not adequately sample all sizes thus resulting in small average sizes as seen here.  Alterative methods such as electrofishing are often necessary to thoroughly assess the entire population.  Normal growth rates were displayed by all age groups present (I-V).The BLACK CRAPPIE population is average in number and mean size.  The net catch is very similar to 1985, however, average weight declined from 0.47 pounds in 1985 to 0.28 pounds currently.  This decline is likely due to a strong year class of age II fish.  Growth rates are fast for age groups III and IV, and normal for the other groups present (I,II,VI). BLUEGILL were present in normal numbers and small average size (0.08 pound).  The median length was 4.0-4.4 inches.  Size and number have not changed substantially since 1985.  All age groups I through IX were represented and showed normal growth rates.Other centrarchid species sampled include: PUMPKINSEED, GREEN SUNFISH, HYBRID SUNFISH, and ROCK BASS.  All were found in average numbers and mean sizes.  No considerable changes in these populations were evident.YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, and BOWFIN net catches showed low numbers.  Since 1988, commercial fishing has removed 12,200 pounds of bullheads from the lake under Class \"B\" Permit.The WHITE SUCKER net catch was down 81% since 1985.  However, the population is considered average.  Mean size is in the normal range at 2.2 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 20.0 inches.During late November, two gillnets were set in the lake to assess the TULLIBEE population.  Two fish in the 18 inch class were caught.  No tullibee were caught during the Summer Lake Survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Fish Trap Lake has remained fairly stable from 1970through the present.  The only significant change in that time has been a gradualbut consistent decline in yellow perch abundance.  In order to reduce predation onyellow perch, a northern pike spawning run was blocked in 1993 and 1994.  Inaddition, walleye stocking has been reduced due to the observance of adequatenatural reproduction.  This should further reduce predation on the yellow perchprey base.     The walleye population in Fish Trap Lake is high when compared to similarlakes.  The majority of walleyes sampled were 15 to 20 inches in length andaveraged nearly 2 pounds.  Anglers reported good angling success during the 1994fishing season.  In addition, anglers released many walleye under 14 inchessuggesting fishing should remain good into the future.  The summer surveyidentified a strong 1991 year class and fall electrofishing captured many young-of-the-year suggesting a possible strong 1994 year class.  Trophy individuals over 8pounds are present in the lake.     Northern pike were about average in abundance when compared to lakes similarto Fish Trap.  The majority of northerns captured during the assessment were lessthan 24 inches in length reflecting a somewhat stressed population.  A slightdecline in pike abundance may result in faster growth rates if yellow perchabundance increases.  Northern pike are generally easy to catch on Fish Trapalthough size is typically small.     Largemouth bass are abundant in Fish Trap Lake and provide challenging anglingopportunities.  The highly irregular shoreline creates a multitude of shallow weedybays and provides ideal habitat for this species.  Abundant bulrush stands provideexcellent spawning cover.  Individuals to 19 inches were captured during spring andsummer assessments indicating that trophy fish are present.  Spring electrofishingturned up good numbers of fish over 12 inches in length.     Yellow perch numbers remained unchanged from the 1990 survey and are stillbelow management goals.  Yellow perch are the primary prey for the majority ofpredatory species in Fish Trap Lake.  An increase in yellow perch could also havea positive effect on bluegill quality.  Perch prey heavily on young bluegills thusreducing competition.     The Bluegill population in Fish Trap Lake was high when compared to similarlakes.  Sunfish tend to be small with the survey showing few exceeding 7 inches.     Black crappies provide excellent angling opportunities on Fish Trap withlarge, fast growing individuals present.  Surveys sampled crappies over 12 inchesin length.  Abundant bulrush stands provide good spawning habitat and protectivecover.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Fish Trap Lake is a popular recreational lake in northwest  Morrison County.  The many bays and islands offer scenic variety, some seclusion, and fishing hot spots.  The lake supports two resorts and one campground.  Sand was the most common shoal water substrate, with rock being common along shorelines and shallow water bars near some of the islands.  Aquatic vegetation grew out to the 19 foot depth with flat-stem pondweed, wild celery, water star grass, and coontail being the most common species found.  Fish Trap Lake had fair water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 9.6 feet in early August.  The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers with the management focus on walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  An experimental northern pike regulation was implemented on the lake in 2003 which put a protected slot on fish between 24 and 36 inches with a possession limit of three of which one could be over 36 inches. <br> \n    No noticable change was seen in the fish community since the last survey in 2002.  While walleye abundance appears to be at a level considered normal for this type of lake, it was lower than the management goal for the lake.   Anglers do have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 10 to 27 inches were seen in the survey.  Walleye stocking was resumed in 1998 after it appeared that natural reproduction could not sustain the fishery at the desired level.  Walleye stocking consists of fry and fingerling stocking in alternating years.  An ice-out assessment targetting walleye and northern pike was conducted in 2005.  That assessment indicated that there was a healthy population of adult walleye in the lake with over half of the walleye caught exceeding 20 inches in length. <br> \n    Northern pike abundance also appeared to be within the normal range for this type of lake.  Average size of the pike seen in the survey and ice-out assessment was about 20 inches or 1.8 pounds.  The intent of the experimental regulation was to increase the number of pike exceeding 24 inches in the population and produce trophy size fish over 36 inches.  A few fish close to 36 inches in length have been documented but it is too early yet in the regulation to see any numbers.  Keeping pike numbers lower should decrease competition with and predation on the walleye and largemouth bass. <br> \n    Fish Trap Lake has good largemouth bass population in both size and abundance.  The multitude of weedy shallow bays and irregular shoreline provides excellent habitat for the species.  Bass was not a species of concern during the survey so little effort was spent on evaluating them.  Previous spring night electrofishing has turned up good numbers of medium size fish as well as documented the presence of trophy size fish up to 20 inches.    <br> \n    Panfish species in the lake include bluegill, black crappie, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, and rock bass.  Bluegills over 6 inches were common in the summer survey with some fish measuring up to almost 8 inches.  Crappies provide a popular ice fishing opportunity in the area.  While crappies can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, results from the 2006 survey suggest normal abundance for this type of lake.  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them with a good number of the fish being over 10 inches in length.   A panfish assessment in 2005 also suggested good availabliliy of bluegills over 7 inches and crappies over 9 inches.  With the presence of the smaller crappies between 4 and 5.5 inches fishing should be good in couple of years.  While hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, and rock bass are typically not as desirable to fishermen as bluegills and crappies, some nicer size fish were seen.   <br> \n    Yellow perch numbers were within the normal range but a more abundant population is desirable.  Perch can be an important food species for the gamefish which promotes good growth rates in those species.  They have also been found to be instrumental in maintaining a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Fish Trap Lake also has tullibee or cisco although the population appears to be low.  Two species of bullheads, brown and yellow, were caught with the yellow bullhead being the most abundant.  Quality size fish over 12 inches were measured in both species.  White suckers are also in the lake which should provide an additional food source for the larger northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n     Two gamefish species that were not caught in the summer survey but are known to be in the lake are smallmouth bass and muskellunge.  Both species likely migrated to the lake from Alexander Lake via Thoroughfare Creek.  One 43-inch muskie was caught in the 2005 ice-out assesment.   <br> \n     Best shoreline and watershed management practices such as limiting emergent vegetation removal are encouraged to protect the water quality and fish habitat in the lake.  Emergent vegetation will also provide wildlife habitat and reduce shoreline erosion from high water and boat wakes.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water thus slowing algae growth and excess weed growth.

                "narrative": "<p>     An early spring assessment was performed on Fish Trap Lake in 2019 using 10 large frame (5'x6') trap nets.  This assessment was conducted to provide fish samples for the following purposes:  1) evaluate the adult Walleye population, 2) assess Northern Pike population size characteristics in relation to the existing special regulation - 24 to 36 inch protected slot,  3) determine the extent of the adult Muskellunge population, and, 4) assess size structure/general abundance of the Black Crappie population.  Large frame trap nets have been employed in the past on Fish Trap Lake but in conjunction with standard frame trap nets.  The 2019 effort was the first attempt to sample exclusively with large frame nets.  Walleye are a primary management species on Fish Trap Lake and have been regularly sampled in the past with a combination of trap nets and night electrofishing often providing the desired large sample sizes.  Early spring trap netting in the past has also produced Northern Pike samples sizes useful for evaluation of the 24 to 36 inch protected slot which has been in place since 2003.  Muskellunge have been observed on several occasions in other gear types while sampling Fish Trap Lake and deployment of large frame trap nets designed for Muskellunge was expected to provide an accurate assessment of their true abundance.  Muskellunge in Fish Trap originated via immigration from Lake Alexander which has been managed with Muskellunge stocking since 1988.  Naturally reproduced juvenile Muskie have been sampled in Fish Trap in recent years.   All fish of each species were identified and counted.  All gamefish were measured and measurements were also taken on a large subsample of Black Crappie and Bluegill.  No aging structures were collected. <br> \n <br> \n     A total of 295 Walleye were caught in the trap nets and ranged in length from 14.2 to 29.3 inches.   The length frequency distribution showed a fairly uniform representation among many length groups.     Mean length was 21.2 inches and median length was also just over 21 inches.  As expected the sample was almost completely comprised of sexually mature adults.   The 2019 sample size was similar to the 316 fish observed in 2011 when standard trap nets, large frame trap nets and night electrofishing were combined, but lower than the 623 fish captured in similar combined gears in 2005.  The number of Walleye captured in spring trap nets may not reflect actual changes in abundance due to the variability inherent in spring sampling. <br> \n <br> \n     Trap nets captured 312 Northern Pike in 2019 ranging in length from 9.6 to 36 inches.  The size structure continues to show characteristics that are more desirable than pre-regulation conditions. (see Table 1.)  While the proportion greater than 24 inches in 2019 was similar to pre-regulation results, mean length, maximum observed length and the proportion exceeding 30 inches have shown sustained improvement.   Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest pike under 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTable 1.  Fish Trap Lake Northern Pike-Early Spring Trap Nets <br> \nDate      Number      Mean Length\"     Max.

The low catch suggests a very low abundance of Muskies in Fish Trap Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \n     Black Crappie catches often display significant variability in early spring trap net assessments and Fish Trap Lake has shown this tendency.  Spring catches have ranged from 84 to 584 fish with the 2019 effort providing a large sample of 527 crappies.  In 2019, the crappies ranged from 5.4 to 13.9 inches long with an impressive 58% exceeding 10 inches and 29% over 12 inches.  Although no crappie were aged there appears to be two strong year classes represented by the length frequency distribution with one centered around the 8-8.5 inch range and the other in the 12 inch range. <br> \n <br> \n     A substantial sample of Bluegill (502 fish) was captured in 2019.  Mean length of Bluegill was 6.1 inches and maximum length was 8.7 inches.  Over 1/3 of the Bluegills exceeded 7 inches long which is about the size anglers begin to find acceptable to harvest.  The Largemouth Bass sample consisted of 78 fish from 5.8 to 19.9 inches in length with nearly 80% of the fish exceeding 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \n     Other species that were observed in substantial numbers during the 2019 assessment include: Bowfin (378 fish), Pumpkinseed (155 fish), and Rock Bass (243 fish).   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    An ice-out assessment was conducted on Fish Trap Lake to  <br> \nevaluate the size structure of the northern pike and walleye  <br> \npopulation.  A special northern pike regulation was implemented  <br> \nin 2003 which protected fish from 24 inch to 36 inch with a  <br> \npossession limit of three, of which one could be over 36 inches.   <br> \nWalleye are also a primary management species for the lake and a  <br> \nmore accurate assessment of the population age and size structure  <br> \nwas needed.  Fall electrofishing is conducted annually to assess  <br> \nnatural reproduction and fry stocking that occurs in even  <br> \nnumbered years. <br> \n    Standard lake survey trapnets and 3 large-frame trapnets were  <br> \nset around the lake in habitat targetting the pike and walleye.   <br> \nNorthern pike sets were the primary focus for the earlier days of  <br> \nthe assessment after ice-out with the later days targetting  <br> \nwalleye spawning habitat.  Scales were taken from the pike and  <br> \nwalleye for age and growth data.  A spine was also taken from  <br> \neach walleye for aging and as a marking method to identify  <br> \nrecaptures.  The length frequency distributions for each gear  <br> \ntype do contain lengths from recaptured walleye. <br> \n    A total of 435 northern pike were captured in the lake survey  <br> \nnets and 69 pike in the large-frame trapnets.  All of the fish  <br> \nmeasured between 3 and 36 inches with a modal length of 19 - 20  <br> \ninches in the small nets and 21 - 22 inches in the large nets.   <br> \nNorthern pike exceeding 24 inches comprised 11% (n=49) of the  <br> \nsmall net catch and 17% (n=12) of the large net catch.  Similar  <br> \nice-out assessments were conducted in 1998 and 1994 using lake  <br> \nsurvey trapnets.  Two hundred thirty-two (232) pike from 8 to 31  <br> \ninches were caught in the 98' assessment and 253 pike from 11 to  <br> \n34 inches in the 94'.  Modal length was 20 - 21 inches in 1998  <br> \nwith 7% (n=17) exceeding 24 inches in length compared to a modal  <br> \nlength of 19 - 20 inches and 11% (n=27) exceeding 24 inches in  <br> \n1994.  Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the male pike sample and  <br> \nages 2 thru 7, 9, and 11 in the female pike sample.  The male  <br> \nnorthern pike displayed normal growth thru age 4 after which the  <br> \ngrowth was slow.  Female northern pike showed normal growth thru  <br> \nage 6 with the age 7 fish showing fast growth when compared to an  <br> \narea mean back-calculated length table.  The female pike also  <br> \naveraged 1.5 inches longer than males at age one to as much as 9  <br> \ninches longer by age 7.  Year class strengths show fairly  <br> \nconsistent recruitment with the 2001 year class being the most  <br> \ncommon. <br> \n    Both gear types were effective at catching walleye although  <br> \nthe large nets caught more of the bigger fish.   The small  <br> \ntrapnets sampled 288 walleye while 214 walleye were captured in  <br> \nthe large nets.  The fish measured between 11 and 30 inches in  <br> \nlength with a modal length of 19 - 20 inches in the small nets  <br> \nand 23 - 24 inches in the large nets.  Walleye more than 20  <br> \ninches in length comprised 47% (n=135) of the small net total and  <br> \nup to 62% (n=132) of the large net catch.  The small nets  <br> \nrecaptured 53 marked fish and the large nets 48 marked fish.  The  <br> \nlake survey trapnets caught only 34 walleye in 1998 and 134  <br> \nwalleye in 1994.  The fish ranged from 16 to 27 inches with a  <br> \nmodal length of 18 - 19 inches in the 98'and 13 - 29 inches with  <br> \na modal length of 17 - 18 inches in 1994.  The fish exceeding 20  <br> \ninches accounted for 50% (n=17) of the catch in 1998 and 40%  <br> \n(n=54) in 1994.  Night electrofishing was also conducted during  <br> \nthe 2005 assessment to further evaluate the walleye population.   <br> \nA total of 122 walleye between 14 and 26 inches were netted with  <br> \n25 of the fish being marked fish from the trapnets.  Modal length  <br> \nfor the sample was 19 - 20 inches with 31% (n=38) more than 20  <br> \ninches in length.  Ages 3 thru 8 and older were represented in  <br> \nboth the male and female walleye samples.  The 1998 year class  <br> \nwas the strongest year class, accounting for 22% of the combined  <br> \naged sample.  Those fish 8 years of age and older comprised 61%  <br> \nof the male walleye sample and only 29% of the female sample.   <br> \nNatural reproduction and stocking both appear to contribute to  <br> \nthe population as 40% of the fish (age 8 and over) were from  <br> \npre-stocking years, 18% from low or no stocking years, and 42%  <br> \nfrom fingerling stocking years. <br> \n    Also captured during the ice-out assessment were a total of  <br> \n584 black crappies, 226 bluegill, and 36 largemouth bass along  <br> \nwith one 43.5-inch muskellunge.  The crappies measured between 4  <br> \nand 13 inches in length, the bluegills between 4 and 9 inches,  <br> \nbass from 4 and 19 inches.  Over 60% of the crappies exceeded 9  <br> \ninches in length while over 60% of the bluegill exceeded 7 inches  <br> \nin length.   <br> \n    Other fish species sampled included black bullhead, bowfin,  <br> \nbrown bullhead, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock  <br> \nbass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     An ice-out assessment was conducted on Fish Trap Lake to evaluate the northern pike and walleye populations.  A special northern pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which protects fish from 24 to 36 inches with a possession limit of three, of which one could be over 36 inches.   Walleye are also a primary management species for the lake.    Ten standard lake survey trap nets and three large-frame trap nets along with night electrofishing were used to sample the two target species.   Ice was late in leaving the lake which may have reduced catches of northern pike and walleye.  Some of the nets were moved to other locations when few target species were caught.  Scales were taken from northern pike, walleye, and black crappie as well as anal fin rays from the pike and dorsal spines from the walleye for age growth data.   <br> \n     The standard trap nets netted 69 northern pike, the large-frame trap nets 23, and the electrofishing effort 24 for a combined catch of 116 fish.   The fish ranged from 9.4 to 34.5 inches in length with 34% (n=40) of the total catch exceeding 24 inches which was near the lake management goal of at least 35% more than 24 inches.  The netting results fell short of the second goal of at least 2% of the spring trap net catch more than 36 inches in length.  Spring assessments were also conducted in 2005, 1998, and 1994.  A total of 505 northern pike were caught in 2005, 232 in 1998, and 253 in 1994.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 12% (n=62) of the 2005 catch, 7% (n=17) in 1998, and 11% (n=54) in 1994.  The longest northern pike was 35.7 inches in 2005, whereas, before the regulation, the longest pike caught in spring assessments was 33.5 inches in 1994.  Mean length for the trap net pike samples was 22.8 inches and the combined gears 22.3 inches.  Mean weight for the trap net pike was 2.83 pounds. <br> \n     Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the 2011 ice-out assessment.  Mean age for the northern pike males was 4.4 years and the females 5.3 years.  Age groups in the male portion of the catch were 2 through 7 and 10 and ages 2 through 10 in the female portion.  All of the female age groups displayed normal growth while males, ages 2, 3, and 5 showed normal growth and ages 4, 6, and 7 slow growth.  Female pike grew from 0.8 to 7.2 inches longer than males of the same age.  The northern pike sex ratio was 1 male to 2.1 females. <br> \n     The spring electrofishing proved to be a more efficient method of sampling walleye although the catch was dominated by smaller fish which were mostly males.   The trap nets caught a total of 136 walleye between 12.3 and 30.4 inches with 48% (n=66) of the fish more than 20 inches in length.   A sample of 180 walleye ranging from 12 to 27.2 inches was netted in the night electrofishing effort.  Fish exceeding 20 inches accounted for 21% (n=38) of the catch.  In the 2005 ice-out assessment, the trap nets caught more walleye compared to the electrofishing effort which was done with an older, less efficient electrofishing boat.  The two trap net gear types caught a total of 501 walleye measuring from 11.2 to 29.1 inches while the electrofishing effort sampled 122 walleye between 13.4 and 26.3 inches in length.  Fish exceeding 20 inches comprised 53% (n=266) of the trap net sample and 31% (n=38) of the electrofishing catch.  Only 34 walleye were sampled in 1998 while 134 walleye were caught in 1994.  Fifty percent (n=17) of the walleye were more than 20 in 1999 and 40% (n=54) in 1994. <br> \n     Ages 3 through 10+ were represented in both the 2011 trap net and electrofishing walleye catches.  Ages 3 through 5 and 10 of the male portion grew normal while ages 6 through 9 displayed slow growth.   Females age 3, 7, 9, and 10 exhibited fast growth and ages 4 through 6 and 8 showed normal growth.   Five of the males and thirteen of the females were more than 10 years of age.   Female walleye grew from one to 5.6 inches longer than males of the same age.  The males outnumbered the females 3.3 to one in the assessment and 16.9 to one in the electrofishing catch.  The presence of some of the year classes, especially 2005, suggests that some natural reproduction contributes to the population.   2005 was a non-stocked year, but the year class accounted for 19% of the combined catches.   <br> \n     The spring ice-out assessments have been known to sample large numbers of black crappie.   In 2005, 584 black crappie between 4 and 13 inches were netted, but in 1994, only three crappie were caught.  The 2011 ice- out assessment caught 84 crappie ranging from 3 to 12 inches while 135 crappie between 3 and 12.6 inches were sampled in 1998.  The management goal of having  a spring ice-out catch with 20% or more of the crappie exceeding 10 inches was met in the 2011 (43%; n=36), 2005 (23%; n=137), and 1994 (100%; n=3) ice-out assessments.  Black crappie exceeding 10 inches comprised only 4% (n=5) of the 1999 sample.    <br> \n     Ages 1 through 6 were represented in the 2011 ice-out assessment crappie catch.  A strong year class from 2008 accounted for 30% of the crappie catch.  Age 1 and 4 through 6 displayed fast growth and ages 2 and 3 normal growth. <br> \n     Also captured during the 2011 spring assessment were 100 bluegill between 3.2 and 8.4 inches in length and 18 largemouth bass ranging from 8.8 to 18.5 inches in length.  Few of the bluegill caught were over seven inches in length, 11% or 11 fish.  The PSD for the largemouth bass catch was 83.  One 21.6 inch muskellunge was netted during the 2011 spring night electrofishing effort.  \t <br> \n     Fish species that were counted but not measured included black bullhead, bowfin, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   Although the bowfin catch was a record high (n=164), it was only slightly higher than the 148 caught in 2005.  Most of the bowfin were caught in the standard lake trap nets which were targeted more toward catching northern pike.  The yellow perch catch was also a record high (n=1328) for an ice out assessment in Fish Trap Lake which may be attributed to the late ice-off date and perch spawning period.  The smaller trap nets also caught most of the yellow perch.  <br> \n      The northern pike regulation appears to have increased the number of pike over 24 inches in the lake and the 2011 results were close to the regulation goal.  While the goal for pike more than 36 inches has not been attained yet, there has been an increase in the number of fish over 30 inches.   Before the regulation was implemented less than 1% of the spring assessment catches in 1994 and 1998 were over 30 inches.  In the 2005 ice-out assessment, 2% of the northern pike exceeded 30 inches and in 2011, 9% of the pike were more than 30 inches in length.   <br> \n      The lake survey gill net results have also displayed an improvement in the northern pike size structure.  Before the regulation implementation in 2003, pike exceeding 24 inches comprised 15% (n=7 of 47) of the 2002 catch and 14% (n=10 of 71) of the 1998 catch.  The 2010 lake survey, however, which had a record northern pike catch of 145 fish (12.1/GN), had 21% (n=31) of the fish more than 24 inches in length.  The 2010 gill net catch also had the greatest number of pike exceeding 30 inches (n=10; 7%) of the eight gill net catches dating back to 1980. <br> \n      The northern pike special regulation was due up for review in 2013, but due to Legislative action, the regulation will not be reviewed for another  ten years. <br> \n      An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Fish Trap Lake is a popular recreational lake in northwest Morrison County.  The many bays and islands offer scenic variety, some seclusion, and fishing hot spots.   Water clarity was excellent with a secchi disk reading of 17 feet in mid-August.   The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers with the management focus on walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  An experimental northern pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which put a protected slot on fish between 24 and 36 inches.  The possession limit is still three, one of which can be over 36 inches.  The objective of the regulation was to increase the quality of the northern pike population size structure. <br> \n       Walleye abundance showed little change from the last survey.  While the net catch rate was normal when compared to similar type lakes it was below the lake management goal.  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from seven to 26 inches were recorded in the survey.  Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length.   Although there has been some natural reproduction documented, fry and fingerling stockings have helped to sustain the population and fishery.   <br> \n       Northern pike were the only species to show a significant change in abundance since the last survey.  Pike have increased, however, despite the increased abundance, there was an apparent improvement in population size structure.  Average size was almost 2.5 pounds and there were more fish over both 24 and 30 inches observed.  The largest northern pike caught was just over 35 inches indicating the lake has the potential to produce trophy size fish.   <br> \n       Fish Trap Lake has a good largemouth bass population in both size and abundance.  The multitude of weedy shallow bays and irregular shoreline provides excellent habitat for the species.  The 2010 spring electrofishing effort had one of the higher catches of the year for the area and sampled fish up to almost nineteen inches.  While most of the bass were in the 12 to 14 inch range, there were fair numbers between 14 to 17 inches. <br> \n        Muskellunge are one species that more anglers are seeing in Fish Trap Lake.  These fish likely migrated in from Lake Alexander.  Although no muskellunge were caught in the summer survey, two over 40 inches were netted in the spring electrofishing and more were observed.  <br> \n        Panfish species in the lake include bluegill, black crappie, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  The bluegill average size in the summer survey was under six inches, but there were fish up to nine inches measured.  Crappie provide a popular ice fishing opportunity in the area.  While crappie can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, results from the 2010 survey suggest normal abundance for this type of lake.  Most of the crappie caught in the summer survey would be considered keepers by most anglers.   While hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and rock bass are typically not as desirable to fishermen as bluegill and crappie, some nicer pumpkinseed and rock bass were observed. <br> \n       Yellow perch numbers were better in the 2010 survey which may benefit the gamefish populations.  Perch can be an important food species for gamefish which promotes good growth rates in those species.  Fish Trap Lake also has tullibee or cisco although the population appears to be low.  Two species of bullhead, brown and yellow, were caught with the yellow being the most abundant.  Quality size fish over 13 inches were measured in both species.  White sucker are also in the lake which should provide an additional food source for the larger northern pike, walleye, and muskellunge. <br> \n        Smallmouth bass are another species that likely migrated in from Lake Alexander.  Although none were sampled in any of the 2010 assessments on Fish Trap Lake, they have been sampled in previous assessments. <br> \n        Protecting and preserving the shoreline as well as the near shore habitats should be a high priority of lakeshore owners and the county.  Doing so will help protect the water quality and provide fish and wildlife habitat in and around the lake.  Best shoreline and watershed management practices such as limiting vegetation removal are encouraged.  Emergent vegetation provides wildlife and fish habitat as well as reduces shoreline erosion from high water and boat wakes.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded to diligently clean their boats and trailers before moving betweens lakes to prevent the spread of exotics. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Fish Trap Lake in early June to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations.  A summer population assessment using only gill nets was also conducted in August which targeted the gamefish.  Summer trap nets tend to sample the small to medium panfish and rarely provide a good assessment of the larger fish in a population.  Eight lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice in the 2010 panfish assessment for a total of 16 lifts.   <br> \n      The 2010 spring trap nets caught 476 bluegill (29.8/set) between 2.8 and 8.6 inches in length.  Mean length was 5.4 inches and modal length 5 - 5.5 inches.  Bluegill that exceeded seven inches accounted for only 4% (n=17) of the sample.  Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the sample with a strong 2005 year class accounting for 57% of the catch.  Ages 3 through 5, 8, and 10 showed normal growth while ages 6, 7, and 9 displayed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      A similar assessment was conducted in 2002 with 18 net lifts.  That assessment captured 1,119 bluegill that ranged from 3.9 to 9.3 inches in length.  Despite the larger sample size, the population size structure was more desirable than that displayed in 2010.  Mean length in the 2002 catch was 6.5 inches and modal length 6.5 - 7 inches.  Fish larger than seven inches accounted for 35% (n=388) of the sample.  Results from the 2010 panfish assessment were well below the desired outcome of 20% of the panfish catch in the spring assessment exceeding seven inches in length while the 2002 results exceeded the goal. <br> \n       The 2010 summer gill nets sampled 183 bluegill which measured from 3.6 to 9 inches in length.  The mean length of 5.8 inches was slightly better than that from the spring trap net catch and the proportion of fish that exceeded seven inches was higher, 17% (n=31).   The modal length, however, was the same as that from the spring trap net sample.   Ice out assessments in 2005 and 1998 also provided bluegill catches although not as high as the panfish assessments.  The population size structure of the 2005 ice out was the most desirable when compared to the other assessments.   A total of 226 bluegill were netted in the 2005 assessment which used both lake survey trap nets and large-frame trap nets.   The fish measured from 3.7 and 8.5 inches in length with mean length of seven inches.  Modal length for the samples was 7 - 7.5 inches and 62% (n=136) of the fish exceeded seven inches in length.  The 1998 ice out used only lake survey nets and netted 323 bluegill between 3 and 8.2 inches in length with a mean length of six inches.  Modal length was 6 - 6.5 inches and 21% (n=67) were more than seven inches in length. <br> \n      The panfish assessments have produced rather disappointing catches of black crappie.  Only two crappie were caught in 2010 and nine in the 2002 panfish assessment.  The 2010 crappie were between 9 and 10 inches and the 2002 crappie between 7.6 and 10.8 inches.  Gill nets in 2010 caught 13 black crappie or 1.1/GN which was within the interquartile range of 0.5 - 2.7 for lake class 25.  The fish measured from 8.6 to 11.3 inches in length with a mean length of 10.3 inches.   There were three modal length groups in the sample.  Twelve of the 13 (92%) crappie were more than nine inches in length.   The 2006 gill nets sampled 32 black crappie (2.7/GN) between 4.4 to 13.4 inches in length.  Mean length for that catch was only 8.4 inches, however, 53% (n=17) of the fish exceeded nine inches.  There were also three modal length groups in the 2006 sample.  Both the 2010 and 2006 crappie catch rates met the management goal of having gill net catches within the interquartile range for the lake class. <br> \n      Ice out assessments appear to provide the most efficient catches of black crappie.  The 2005 ice out assessment netted 585 crappie in the two trap net types used.  The crappie ranged from 4 to 13 inches in length with a mean length of nine inches.  Modal length for the two gear types was 9 - 9.5 inches and 62% (n=364) of the fish in the combined catch were more than nine inches in length.  Crappie more than ten inches comprised 22% (n=127) of the combined catch.  The 1998 ice out assessment captured 135 black crappie between 3 and 12.6 inches in length.  The population size structure was unexpected considering the time of year.  Mean length for the sample was 6.1 inches with a modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches.   Crappie that exceeded nine inches accounted for only 7% (n=10) of the sample and 4% (n=5) were more than ten inches in length.  The lake management goal includes the desire to have at least 20% of the crappie in the ice out assessment exceed ten inches in length. <br> \n      Other panfish species that were caught in the 2010 panfish assessment included 75 pumpkinseed sunfish, 68 hybrid sunfish, and 63 rock bass.  The pumpkinseed measured from 3 to 8.7 inches in length with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Fish larger than seven inches accounted for 27% (n=20) of the catch.  The hybrid sunfish ranged from four to nine inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches.  Fifty percent (n=34) of the fish were more than seven inches in length.  The rock bass were between 5.6 and 9.2 inches with a mean length of 5.9 inches.   <br> \n      Gamefish sampled included one 5.5 - inch largemouth bass, five northern pike between 15 and 29 inches, and six walleye measuring from 7 to 29 inches in length.   Additional species netted included bowfin, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n       Panfish assessments appear to be the most effective method for evaluating the bluegill population in Fish Trap Lake while ice out assessments appear to work better to evaluate the black crappie population.   Panfish assessments may be eliminated if sufficient numbers of bluegill can be caught in ice-outs or other collection methods.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Fish Trap Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to a new regulation proposal.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring while offering increased protection to spawning bass.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually would be used to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on eight bass lakes (four experiment, four control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice.  Since completion of this assessment DNR Fisheries has decided not to pursue extending the catch and release bass season or the corresponding experiment. <br> \n       Fish Trap Lake was one of the lakes under consideration as an experimental lake.  The lake has data from five previous electrofishing efforts, one daytime and four nighttime with two different boats.  The 2013 electrofishing effort sampled 117 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 117/hour.  The fish ranged from 3.5 to 18 inches in length with a mean length of 12.4 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 15 - 16 inches with 10% (n=12) of the fish exceeding sixteen inches.  PSD for the sample was 62.   <br> \n       Daytime electrofishing was also conducted in 2010 where the catch rate was even higher, 145.7 bass per hour (n=196).   The length range was from 5.4 to 18.7 inches with a mean length of 12.6 inches.  Eleven percent of the fish exceeded sixteen inches and PSD was 71.  Results from both 2013 and 2010 electrofishing efforts far exceeded the lake management plan goal of a catch rate of 50 - 70 bass per hour as well as a PSD from 35 - 55.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was purchased in 2007 which increased catches in most lakes in the area even when used during the day.  Two netters have also commonly been used compared to one netter with the older boat. <br> \n       Scales were taken from bass less than fifteen inches in length caught in the 2013 electrofishing assessment, as it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately age older bass.  Ages two through nine were represented in the aged portion of the 2013 electrofishing sample.   A strong year class from 2010 produced the dominant age group in the sample.  Ages two through ten were represented in the 2010 electrofishing sample.  The dominant year class in the 2010 catch was from 2005.  Age two bass displayed fast growth while the older bass showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n      Electrofishing was conducted at night in 2002, 1998, 1994, and 1992 with an older, less efficient boat.  Catch rates varied from 44 bass per hour in 1998 to 65.8/hour in 2002 which were all within the lake management goals but lower than the daytime results.  The PSDs from the night time electrofishing efforts were also within the management goals but again below the daytime results.  The lowest PSD was 37 in 1994 and the highest 52 in 2002.   <br> \n      Spring electrofishing in 2013 also provided an opportunity to further evaluate the Black Crappie population in Fish Trap Lake.  The electrofishing effort coincided with the crappie spawning period and there was an abundance of crappie observed in the shallow, shoal waters.  A subsample of fish (n=88) were netted and measured.  The crappie ranged from 6.9 to 13 inches in length with a mean length of 9.1 inches.  There were two modal length groups, 8.5 - 9 inches and 9 - 9.5 inches.  Fish exceeding nine inches accounted for 47% (n=41) of the sample with 14% (n=12) more than ten inches in length. <br> \n       Some Black Crappie were also netted in the 2002 night electrofishing effort for Largemouth Bass.  A total of twenty-two crappie were sampled that measured from 8.4 to 11.1 inches in length.  Larger fish comprised a larger portion of the catch as 95% (n=21) of the fish were more than nine inches in length with 68% (n=15) exceeding ten inches.  Mean length for the sample was 10.2 inches and modal length group, 10 - 10.5 inches. <br> \n        Also netted during the 2013 electrofishing effort was an unclipped yearling Muskellunge and a 15.8 inch Walleye.  The presence of the unclipped yearling Muskellunge indicated the occurrence of natural reproduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake is a 1,300-acre lake located near the village of Cushing in northwest Morrison County. It's a popular fishing and recreational-boating lake with excellent water clarity. Fish Trap is very scenic, with heavily-wooded shorelands of aspen, birch, oak and white pine and a rolling topography with high elevations that are readily visible in the distance. The lake is physically characterized by numerous points, bays, sunken bars and steep drop-offs which offer a variety of angling experiences. Maximum depth is 42 feet. Residential development is moderately heavy however the shoreline retains a natural feel for the most part. A DNR-owned public access with two concrete boat ramps is located on the west side of the lake. A Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) is located on the eastern shore of the lake. Special habitat protections are in place and no development is allowed.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary species of management. Fry are stocked annually in order to provide a fishery that can withstand moderate fishing pressure. Netting surveys indicate a stable population with the majority of fish measuring 14 to 24 inches, however individual Walleyes approaching 30 inches are present. There is a non-navigable stream connecting Fish Trap to up-stream Lake Alexander, a Muskellunge lake located immediately to the east. Muskellunge occasionally migrate downstream to Fish Trap Lake and take up residency. The current population is very low in density but may provide some angling excitement for anglers casting for bass or pike.  <br> \n <br> \nFish Trap Lake historically has produced Northern Pike exceeding 30 inches in length. With a good forage base of Yellow Perch and Ciscoes, the potential for development of a trophy-pike fishery seemed feasible. For this reason, a special pike regulation requiring the immediate release of all pike measuring 24-36 inches in length went into effect in 2003. The possession limit is three (not ten), and one fish over 36 inches is allowed. Early ice-out and summer surveys have assessed the pike population as stable, possibly increasing in numbers and individual average size. As such, the regulation will be allowed to continue in the hopes that pike average size continues to increase. Monitoring will continue as part of the management strategy so that anglers are aware of population changes should they occur.  <br> \n  <br> \nBass and panfish angling can be good on Fish Trap. Bluegills approaching nine inches have been sampled with spring trap netting, however the majority of the population is comprised of fish measuring seven inches or less. Black Crappie are less abundant than Bluegill however good fishing can be found especially in the spring.  Individual crappies over 13 inches are sampled during spring surveys.   Largemouth Bass are moderately abundant during spring electrofishing. Length frequency distributions regularly show individual fish measuring 17 to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Ciscoes are important forage species present in Fish Trap Lake. Both populations are stable at this time, however, predator abundance and climate change can impact each in ways that can have negative consequences to the overall fishery. Because pike are voracious predators, Yellow Perch abundance can decrease rapidly if pike abundance increases to unhealthy levels. Ciscoes have become vulnerable as their habitat is squeezed due to climate change and nutrient runoff. Strict adherence to the pike regulation and improvements in land stewardship can help in maintaining the future health of Fish Trap Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

These efforts were performed to evaluate success of annual alternate rate (1,500 fry/littoral area and 3,000 fry/littoral area) stocking. The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 7 fish per hour. The length range was 5.47 to 6.06 inches and mean length of YOY Walleye was 5.83 inches.  The 2017 and 2018 catch rates of YOY Walleye were zero.  The average catch rate over the last 10 years was 41 fish per hour.   These results suggest relatively poor survival of stocked Walleye fry in 2019 when the higher rate was used.  This higher rate was also stocked in 2014 and 2017 with substandard catch rates of 8/hour and 0/hour, respectively.  The 2018 catch rate was also low at 0/hour when the lower stocking rate of 1,500 per littoral acre was practiced.   The lower stocking rate produced moderate catch rates of 51/hour in 2015 and 43/hour in 2016.  There appears to be no apparent pattern developing in terms of the relationship between stocking rate and the strength of Walleye year classes generated.

No stocking occurred in 2020 due to Covid 19 curtailing Walleye egg-taking operations. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, fall night electrofishing has been conducted at three electrofishing stations around Fish Trap Lake totaling one hour of on-time.  Three new stations totaling an additional hour were added in 2020 in order to increase effort and to include the lake in a research study aimed at evaluating the impact of Zebra Mussel infestation on Walleye recruitment.  Two young of year Walleye (YWAE) were captured in two hours of on-time for a catch rate of 1.0 fish/hour. YWAE captured were 6.97 and 7.40 inches.  It seems since Wild Celery growth in shallow waters has become abundant on Fish Trap Lake, YWAE fall assessments have become ineffective.  Recent fall YWAE catches have been low regardless of fry stocking rate or if no stocking occurs at all.  There appears to be no apparent pattern developing in terms of the relationship between stocking rate and the strength of Walleye year classes generated.  Future summer gillnet surveys may be a more effective way of evaluating the success of juvenile Walleye survival to adult size.  As a result of low fall YWAE evaluations, the lake management plan was amended in early 2020 to allow for the stocking of 3,000 fry per littoral acre on an annual basis.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to the lower than desired rate of return from fry stocking since 2017 an unplanned stocking of fingerlings took place in the fall of 2019.

Walleye fingerling stockings may be considered in the future if fry stocking continues to produce unfavorable results and sufficient supplies of fingerlings are available.  As part of the Zebra Mussel research, gillnetting frequency on Fish Trap Lake will change to every three years with the next survey in 2021. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Fish Trap Lake to gather information on the Largemouth Bass population prior to a new regulation proposal.  The proposal would allow for an early catch and release season from March 1st until the last weekend in May (current bass opener) for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Thereafter, regular harvest, length and bag limits would apply.  The intent of the regulation would be to increase recreational opportunity for bass angling during spring.  Routine day electrofishing conducted annually would be used to learn more about size structure, relative recruitment, growth and abundance on eight bass lakes (four experimental, four control) within Morrison and Todd Counties.  Results would be used to effectively educate both internal and external stakeholders of the biological consequences, if any, associated with the practice.   <br> \n       Fish Trap Lake was one of the lakes under consideration as an experimental lake.  The lake has data from seven previous electrofishing efforts, three daytime and four nighttime with two different boats along with results from the 2015 electrofishing effort.   A total of 76 Largemouth Bass were netted in 1.2 hours of on-time for a catch rate of 65/hour.  The bass measured from 4.2 to 18.5 inches in length with a mean length of 11.0 inches and modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches.  PSD for the sample was 55 with 13% (n=10) of the fish exceeding sixteen inches in length.   <br> \n       Although there was a higher catch in 2014 (111/hour) the over-all size structure was more desirable than in 2015.   The 111 Largemouth Bass netted ranged from 2.6 to 18.1 inches in length with a mean length of 12.7 inches and modal length of 13 \u0013 14 inches.  PSD for the sample was 72 and 13% (n=15) of the bass exceeded sixteen inches in length.  <br> \n        The 2013 electrofishing effort sampled 117 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 117/hour.  The fish ranged from 3.5 to 18 inches in length with a mean length of 12.4 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 15 - 16 inches with 10% (n=12) of the fish exceeding sixteen inches.  PSD for the sample was 62.   <br> \n      Daytime electrofishing was also conducted in 2010 where the catch rate was even higher, 145.7 bass per hour (n=196).   The length range was from 5.4 to 18.7 inches with a mean length of 12.6 inches.  Eleven percent of the fish exceeded sixteen inches and PSD was 71.  Results from all the daytime electrofishing efforts have met or exceeded the lake management plan goal of a catch rate of 50 - 70 bass per hour as well as a PSD from 35 - 55.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was purchased in 2007 which increased catches in most lakes in the area even when used during the day.  Two netters have also commonly been used compared to one netter with the older boat. <br> \n       Electrofishing was conducted at night in 2002, 1998, 1994, and 1992 with an older, less efficient boat.  Catch rates varied from 44 bass per hour in 1998 to 65.8/hour in 2002 which were all within the lake management goals but lower than all but the 2015 daytime results.  The PSDs from the night time electrofishing efforts were also within the management goals but again below the daytime results.  The lowest PSD was 37 in 1994 and the highest 52 in 2002.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake is a popular recreational lake in northwest Morrison County.  The many bays and islands offer scenic variety, some seclusion, and fishing hot spots.  The lake supports two resorts and one campground.  Sand and gravel were the most abundant shallow water substrates, although rock was common along shorelines and shallow bars near some of the islands.  Aquatic vegetation grew out to 15 feet with muskgrass, coontail, wild celery, and mud plantain being the common species found.  Fish Trap has moderate water clarity with secchi disk of 7 feet during the first part of August.     Fish Trap Lake supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills.  Walleye numbers have declined since 1994 and were below management goals for the lake.  The majority of walleye sampled were from 13 to 22 inches in length and averaged 2 pounds.  Natural reproduction has been sustaining the population since 1991.  The decline in walleye abundance may be the results of several poor reproduction years.  A stocking schedule will be implemented based on fall naturalreproduction checks.     Northern pike abundance was normal when compared to lakes similar to Fish Trap.  While the majority of the pike in the survey were less than 24 inches in length, some larger pike are present.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller northern pike to help maintain a healthy fish community.  Lower pike numbers will decrease competition with and predation on the walleye and largemouth bass.     Fish Trap Lake has a good largemouth bass population in both size and abundance.  The multitude of weedy shallow bays and irregular shoreline provides excellent habitat for the species.  Spring electrofishing turned up good numbers of fish over 12 inches in length.  Bass up to nineteen inches have been capturedduring assessments indicating that trophy fish are present.           Yellow perch numbers have shown an improvement since the 1994 survey, which may be a response to the lower walleye population.  Perch are a primary prey species for walleye and northern pike and also been shown to have a positive effecton bluegill quality.     Panfish species in the lake include bluegill, pumpkinseeds, black crappies, and rock bass.  Bluegills over six inches were common in both the spring ice-out and summer survey conducted on the lake in 1998.  Angling for crappies has been good the last two years due to recent strong year classes.  Surveys have sampled crappies up to almost 13 inches in length.  Rock bass continue to be abundant and a nuisance to most anglers.     Roughfish species in the fish community include white suckers, yellow bullheads, brown bullheads, and bowfin or dogfish.  Large bullheads over eleven inches were common.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake is a 1,164-acre lake located near Lincoln, Minnesota. The lake has 13.12 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 42 feet, and a littoral area of 404 acres. Primary management species include Walleye and Northern Pike.  Secondary management species are Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management on Fish Trap Lake involves spring fry stocking of 3,000/littoral acre or 1,200,000 fry on an annual basis. Flexibility within the management plan allows fall fingerling stocking if fry stocking fails to create a population within management goals as defined by summer gillnet catches. Summer surveys are completed every three years with the next survey scheduled in 2024. A decision to stock fingerling Walleyes may also be made due to consecutive poor fall electrofishing (EF) catches. <br> \n <br> \nFall nighttime EF targeting young of year Walleye to document natural reproduction or survival from fry stocking was initiated in 2004 and is done annually on Fish Trap Lake.  In 2022, sampling was conducted on 13 September to document survival from spring fry stocking.  Six stations totaling 120 minutes of on time were sampled.  A total of 17 young of the year Walleye were encountered during sampling for a catch rate of 8.5/hour.  Catch rates in prior fall EF assessments ranged from 0/hour to 177/hour of on time. Young of the year Walleye captured averaged 6.8 inches in total length and ranged from 6.3 to 7.1 inches. The median catch rate observed in previous assessments was 5.0/hour with an interquartile range of 1.1/hour to 14.1/hour. Recent fall EF surveys have been ineffective in sampling juvenile Walleye, with catch rates since 2017 ranging from 0/hour (N=3) to 7/hour.  Fall catch rates have correlated poorly with age distributions identified in future gillnet surveys.  In other words, significant year classes were identified even in years with zero or low fall EF catch rates.  The Walleye catch in 2022 suggests a year class is present and will provide angling opportunities in the future. In addition, young of the year Walleye were documented in 2020 when stocking did not occur indicating natural reproduction is still occurring on the lake. Future Walleye stocking may be adjusted to better assess natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLow catch rates in Fish Trap Lake appear to be associated with the introduction of Zebra Mussels or the recent increased abundance of Wild Celery in shallow water areas throughout the lake. In local lakes that are fry stocked or have natural reproduction, young of the year Walleye are typically found on bare sand or gravel substrates.  In recent years Fish Trap Lake has had very little shallow habitat with bare hard substrates since Wild Celery has become abundant. However, the sampling crew in 2022 noted that Wild Celery abundance was less dense and some barren substrate was present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake is a 1,164-acre lake located near Lincoln, Minnesota. The lake has 13.12 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 42 feet, and a littoral area of 404 acres. A state owned public access is on the northwest portion of the lake. Primary management species include Northern Pike and Walleye. Secondary management species are Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. The lake was initially surveyed in 1957 and a total of 47 various surveys or assessments have been conducted on the lake with the most recent being a Targeted Survey assessing fall young of the year Walleye utilizing electrofishing in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye management on Fish Trap Lake involves spring fry stocking of 3,000/littoral acre or 1,200,000 fry on an annual basis. Flexibility within the management plan allows fall fingerling stocking if fry stocking fails to create a population within management goals as defined by summer gill net catches. Summer surveys are completed every three years with the next survey scheduled in 2024. A decision to stock fingerling Walleyes may also be made due to consecutive poor fall electrofishing catches. <br> \n <br> \nFall nighttime electrofishing targeting young of year Walleye to document natural reproduction or survival from fry stocking was initiated in 2004 and is done annually on Fish Trap Lake. Fall sampling was conducted on September 18, 2023, to document survival from a spring Walleye stocking of 1,200,000 fry. Six stations scattered throughout the lake were sampled totaling 1.42 hours of on time. A total of 13 young of the year Walleye were captured during sampling for a catch rate of 9.1/hour. Catch rates in prior fall EF assessments ranged from 0/hour to 177/hour of on time. Young of the year Walleye captured averaged 7.0 inches in total length and ranged from 6.2 to 7.8 inches. The median catch rate observed in previous assessments was 5.0/hour with an interquartile range of 1.1/hour to 14.1/hour. Recent fall EF surveys have been ineffective in sampling young of the year Walleye, with catch rates since 2017 ranging from 0/hour (N=3) to 9.13/hour (2023). Two yearling Walleye averaging 11.5 inches were also captured in 2023 for a catch rate of 1.4/hour. <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing catch rates show a fairly strong positive relationship with future year class strength identified in future gill net surveys. However, while fall electrofishing catch rates above 40/hour predict a good year class, significant year classes in gill net surveys were also identified in years with zero or low fall electrofishing catch rates. Overall, the presence of both young of the year and yearling Walleyes in the 2023 catch suggests successive year classes are present and should provide angling opportunities in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLow catch rates in Fish Trap Lake appear to be associated with the introduction of Zebra Mussels or the recent increased abundance of Wild Celery in shallow water areas throughout the lake. In local lakes that are fry stocked or have natural reproduction, young of the year Walleye are typically found on bare sand or gravel substrates. In recent years Fish Trap Lake has had very little shallow habitat with bare hard substrates since Wild Celery has become abundant. However, the sampling crews in 2022 and 2023 noted that Wild Celery abundance was less dense, and some barren substrate was present. <br> \n <br> \nOther species commonly observed during the survey included Bluegill, Bowfin, Common Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. Other shiner species were also present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fish Trap Lake is a popular recreational lake in northwest Morrison County.  The numerous bays and islands offer scenic variety, some seclusion, and fishing hot spots.   Water clarity is excellent with a secchi disk reading of 18 feet in mid-August.   The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers with the management focus on Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  An experimental Northern Pike regulation was implemented in 2003 which put a protected slot on fish between 24 and 36 inches.  The possession limit is still three, one of which can be over 36 inches.  The objective of the regulation is to increase the quality of the Northern Pike population size structure. <br> \n       Walleye abundance showed little change from the last survey.  While the net catch rate was high when compared to similar type lakes it was slightly below the lake management goal.  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 10 to 26 inches were recorded in the survey.  Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length.   Although there has been some natural reproduction documented, spring fry stocking is the most recent method used to sustain the population and fishery.   <br> \n       Northern Pike numbers showed a decrease since the last survey.  Average size was about 2.4 pounds or 22 inches in length.  There were a fair number of fish exceeding 24 inches and larger fish over 36 inches have been observed in other surveys indicating the lake has the potential to produce trophy size fish.   <br> \n       Fish Trap Lake has a good Largemouth Bass population in both size and abundance.  The multitude of weedy shallow bays and irregular shoreline provides excellent habitat for the species.   While most of the bass were in the 12 to 14 inch range, there were fair numbers between 14 to 17 inches. <br> \n        One fish species which likely migrated in from Lake Alexander is Muskellunge.  Although not common yet, more anglers report seeing them in Fish Trap Lake each year.    Muskellunge natural reproduction has also been documented. <br> \n        Panfish species in the lake include Bluegill, Black Crappie, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Rock Bass.   While the Bluegill average size in the summer survey was about six inches, there were fish up to nearly nine inches measured.  Crappie provide a popular ice fishing opportunity in the area.  While crappie can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, results from the 2014 survey suggest normal abundance for this type of lake.  Most of the crappie caught in the summer survey exceeded 10 inches in length.   While hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass are typically not as desirable to fishermen as Bluegill and crappie, some nicer Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass were observed. <br> \n       Yellow Perch numbers showed an increase since the 2010 survey and are considered abundant when compared to similar type lakes. Although many anglers view them as pests, perch can be an important food species, promoting good growth rates in gamefish.  Fish Trap Lake also has Tullibee or Cisco although the population appears to be low.  Two species of bullhead, Brown and Yellow, were caught with the Yellow Bullhead being the most abundant.  Quality size fish over 13 inches were measured in both species.  White Sucker are also in the lake which should provide an additional food source for the larger Northern Pike, Walleye, and Muskellunge. <br> \n        Protecting and preserving the shoreline as well as the near shore habitats should be a high priority of lakeshore owners and the county.  Doing so will help protect the water quality and provide fish and wildlife habitat in and around the lake.  Best shoreline and watershed management practices such as limiting vegetation removal are encouraged.  Emergent vegetation provides wildlife and fish habitat as well as reduces shoreline erosion from high water and boat wakes.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded to diligently clean their boats and trailers before moving between lakes to prevent the spread of exotic species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Trap Lake (DOW# 49-0137; Lake Class 25) is a 1,164-acre lake located near Lincoln, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest shore. Fish Trap Lake has 13.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet. Fish Trap Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, have hard water, clear, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance and size structure was up comparted to previous years, with fish up to 20 inches captured. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Zebra Mussels and Curly Leaf Pondweed have been identified in Fish Trap Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
