Black Crappie (3/trap net) is the most abundant panfish. Only two age classes were sampled and growth is above average. Bluegill are scarce (0.5/trap net), as are White Crappie (0.3/trap net). Walleye abundance is also low (0.5/gill net). Rough fish dominate the lake's fish population. Black Bullheads (8.5/trap net) are abundant but generally small. Common Carp (1.3/trap net) are present in average numbers. Both show significantly lower abundance than in 1960. White Sucker (0.5/gill net) and Bigmouth Buffalo (0.5/trap net) are present in low numbers. Yellow and Brown Bullheads and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in 1960 but not in 1985.</p>",
