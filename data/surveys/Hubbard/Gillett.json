                "narrative": "<p>Gillett Lake is located in central Hubbard County, four miles southeast of the town of Lake George. Gillett is a small, deep lake with a surface area of 44 acres and a maximum depth of 49 feet. A state owned gravel access is located off the Halverson Forest Road, on the north shore of the lake. The lake provides angling opportunities for black crappie, northern pike, sunfish, yellow perch and largemouth bass. <br> \nBlack crappies have been sampled in good numbers during all surveys, but numbers were lower in 2012. They are slow growing and have not exceeded 10 inches in any surveys. Lengths ranged from 4.5-10 inches in 2012. <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was the highest ever recorded on Gillett Lake. Northern pike had an average length of 20 inches and weight of 2 pounds, with pike sampled up to 30 inches in length. <br> \nBluegills were sampled in low numbers, while pumpkinseeds were sampled in slightly higher numbers. Both were sampled up to 9 inches in length. Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, and up to 9 inches in length.   <br> \nLargemouth bass were present in the highest numbers recorded for Gillett Lake, and generally had good size. Fish were sampled from 10 to 18 inches, with an average size of 13.5 inches and 1.5 pounds. <br> \nThe only other species sampled were moderate numbers of brown bullhead. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Gillett Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.</p>",

The lake has no development with a trail leading to an earth access on Minnesota tax forfeit land.  Walleye fingerling stocking has not developed a fishable walleye population and they haven't been stocked since 1988.  Northern pike abundance has been stable over the years the average northern pike sampled during 1993 was 3.5 pounds and 23.7 inches.  Largemouth bass are present in good numbers.  Their size is generally small with an occasional larger fish.  Black crappies have been sampled in good numbers during all surveys.  They are slow growing and have not exceeded 10.0 inches for any samples.  The yellow perch numbers have increased six fold since previous surveys and provide an excellent forage for the predator species.  Their size is small, however.</p>",
