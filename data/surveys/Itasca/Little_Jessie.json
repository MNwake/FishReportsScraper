The lake is 637 acres and has a maximum depth of 50 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area fisheries staff beginning on 3 July, 2019.  Fourteen sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 12 sites: 9 with the 15-ft seine and 3 with the 50-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 10 different species: 8 species by seining and 9 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 29 July, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jessie is managed for Walleye through a biennial fingerling stocking schedule in odd years.  Walleye are a primary management species with a goal of maintaining catches at the high end of similar lakes capability.  Northern Pike are a primary management species as well but with a more attainable goal of catches near the lake type average.  Smallmouth Bass and Bluegill are secondary management species.  The management plan had a goal of a Yellow Perch catch at the middle of the expected range.  This was one of nine surveys conducted to assess the fish population and Walleye stocking. <br> \n <br> \nIt appears Walleye stocking has contributed to a catch within the expected range for lakes in the same class as Little Jessie and similar to the previous survey.  The ambitious management goal was not attained and likely reflects the difficulty in regularly attaining above average catches.  Size structure was favorable and similar to previous surveys.  The distribution of ages suggests a strong relationship with stocking.  It looks as if good angling opportunities exist. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was the lowest observed though catches have typically been at the low end of the range.  Low density usually corresponds to favorable size structure; however, this was not the case.  About a third of the fish caught were within the north central protected slot length (22\" to 26\") and none exceeded 30 inches, comparable to previous surveys.  Quality angling opportunities appear limited and anglers are encouraged to release larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nA few Smallmouth Bass have been caught in most surveys, including a notable size structure as well.  The five gill net sampled fish averaged 17 inches.  Anglers willing to put in time would likely be rewarded with quality size fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate just below the expected range and considerably lower than the previous survey.  Size structure was poor and comparable to previous surveys, though a few fish over eight inches have been sampled.  Moderate angling opportunities exist but prospects for larger individuals is likely limited. <br> \n <br> \nCatches for Yellow Perch have typically been near average, except 2019, which was well below the expected range.  The low density of predators suggests other factors limiting perch numbers.  Fish over nine inches have occasionally been caught which suggests a slight fishery exists. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee/Cisco, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye gill-net CPUE in 1990 was within the normal range at 3.7/net.  Ages 1-8 were represented, with the 1986 year class (age 4) dominant.  Walleye in the sample ranged from 11.5 to 24 inches in length, with a PSD of 76.  Walleye growth rates were similar to the statewide average.  Some natural reproduction is evident with fish present from un-stocked years.  Walleye gill- net CPUE has varied from a low of 0.6 in 1975 to a high of 8.2 in 1984. It appeared that the high catch rate in 1984 was largely due to fingerling stocking in 1982; most of the fish in the 1984 assessment were age 2.  Earlier fry stocking efforts in the 1970's appeared to be ineffective.The northern pike gill-net CPUE was 4.5 in 1990, equaling the lake class median.  Fish in the sample ranged from 14 to 29 inches in length, with a PSD of 54. Northern pike growth rates were above the statewide average for ages 1-4, and similar to the statewide average after that.  Historically, northern pike gill- net CPUE has remained stable at around 5/net.Smallmouth and largemouth bass were both sampled; one smallmouth was captured in the gill nets, and laregmouth were sampled in low numbers in the gill nets, trap nets, and seine.Yellow perch CPUE was fairly high at 16/gill net, above the lake class third quartile.  Yellow perch CPUE has historically been stable between 10 and 20 per net, except for a high catch of 86/net in 1958.Tullibee gill-net CPUE in 1990 was 17.4/net, above the lake class third quartile of 13.9 and up considerably from the 1984 catch of 2.6/net.  Catches in most other assessments have generally been near 10/net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jessie Lake has historically been managed as a walleye lake.  The walleye gill net catch rate is in the upper 25% for this type of lake suggesting that walleye abundance is very high.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 9.9 to 24.0 inches in length and had a mean of 16.4 inches.  Growth appears to be normal.     Northern pike were sampled at a rate lower than in the past, but still within the expected range.  Northern pike that were captured had a mean length of 22.0 inches and a mean weight of 2.9 pounds.     Yellow perch were sampled at the highest rate since 1958.  This rate exceeds the expected range.  Yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 10.8 inches in length.     The tullibee catch rate is within the expected range and within the range of past nettings.  Less than half of the tullibee that were examnined were infested with worms (Triaenophorus).     Black crappie, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were also sampled at low rates.  However, because these species are difficult to sample, it is impossible to say if their abundance is actually low.      Other species sampled in the test nets include;  white sucker, rock bass, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, common shiner, bowfin and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jessie Lake has historically been managed as a walleye fishery.  The 2004 walleye gill-net catch was down slightly from the previous assessment, but still at the high end of the expected range at 8.8/net.  The walleye population appears to be largely supported by biennial fingerling stocking.  Ages 2-14 were represented in the 2004 sample, with most of the fish attributed to stocked years.  Size structure was good; fish in the gill-net sample varied in length from 11.3 to 26.2 inches with an average length of 18.9 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.The northern pike gill-net catch rate was within the normal range and similar to previous assessments at 5.5/net.  Gill-net sampled pike varied in length from 16.8 to 32.5 inches with an average length of 21.8 inches.  Ages 2-6 were represented and growth was more than 15% above the statewide average. The gill-net catch rate for yellow perch (15.3/net) was near the lake class average (18.2), but down substantially from the 1996 catch of 48.2/net.  The drop in perch numbers may be due in part to the high walleye abundance observed in the last two assessments.  Yellow perch in the 2004 assessment varied in length from 4.7 to 11.6 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Size structure was poor, with very few perch over 8 inches in the sample.  Yellow perch in Little Jessie are more important as a prey species for larger gamefish than as a target for anglers.Smallmouth and largemouth bass are both present in Little Jessie and have been sampled in low numbers in most assessments.  Gill-net catches for both species were within the normal range in 2004.  These species typically are not sampled well with traditional test netting.  A night electrofishing assessment would likely provide better information on the populations.The gill-net catch rate for tullibee (2.4/net) was the lowest on record for Little Jessie Lake, though still slightly above the median for similar lakes.  Due to the pelagic and schooling nature of this species, gill-net catches of tullibee are often not a reliable indicator of relative abundance.  Tullibee in the sample varied in length from 7.7 to 16.1 inches, with an average length of 14.5 inches.  The trap-net catch rate for bluegill (21.2/net) was within the normal range for this lake class, but substantially higher than previous surveys.  Bluegill catch rates have been below the lake class normal range in all prior assessments.  Reasons for the apparent increase in bluegill abundance are unclear.  Size structure was poor in 2004; fish in the sample varied from 3.2 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 4.7 inches.    Other species sampled in test nets included: black crappie, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead. As lakes like Little Jessie become increasingly more developed, lakeshore owners will have a larger impact on their future.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  Although the effect of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, the cumulative impact of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Jessie Lake is a 637-acre lake located 5 miles southwest of Talmoon, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 50 ft and is moderately developed.  Primary fish species include walleye, northern pike and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate was 5.7/net and was similar to the long-term average of 5.3/net for Little Jessie Lake.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.6 to 10.8/gill net.  The catch rate in 2010 declined from the previous two assessments which had especially high catch rates of 8.8 and 10.8/net.  Although the current catch rate has declined, it is still within the normal range of values for Little Jessie Lake.  Walleye growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 17.7 inches at age 5.  Size structure was moderate with several year classes present including one fish which was 19 years old.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked at twice the normal rate in even years.  The results of this assessment indicate that stocked year classes were more abundant than nonstocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate was 2.3/net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes and lower than the long-term average of 5.1/net for Little Jessie Lake.  Lower catch rates for northern pike are good because higher catch rates generally lead to poor size structure.  However, size structure was poor with few fish larger than 24 inches sampled.  It is unclear why size structure declined because Little Jessie has a history of larger northern pike.  Trap nets did sample one fish that was 40 inches indicating the lake is still capable of producing large fish.  Six year classes were determined from scale analysis and year classes were roughly similar indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was slightly faster than the statewide average with fish averaging 24.9 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was 49.0/trap net and was towards the upper end of the expected range.  Catch rates were historically low, not exceeding 2.0/trap net in the first 4 assessments.  Catch rates have since increased from 2.7/net in 1996 to the all-time high of 49.0/net in 2010.  High catch rates are a concern, because size structure generally declines as catch rates increase.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish averaging 6.0 inches at age 6.  The combination of high catch rates and slow growth rates result in poor size structure. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catch was 17.3/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable from 12.0 to 86.1/gill net.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 9 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 8.2 inches at age 7.  Yellow perch are more important as prey than a species of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Jessie still supports an abundant tullibee population with a catch rate of 6.0/gill net, towards the upper end of the expected range.  Tullibee were generally small, around 8 to 9 inches, however a few larger fish up to 15 inches were sampled.  Tullibee are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike.      <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass, largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Smallmouth bass varied in length from 5 to 16 inches.  Largemouth bass were more abundant with similar size structure.  Few black crappie were sampled with fish up to 12 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in gill nets and trap nets include black and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting fewer smaller fish and releasing medium and larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
