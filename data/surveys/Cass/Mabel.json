                "narrative": "<p>Mabel Lake (DOW 11-0121-00 Lake Class 39) is a 165-acre lake located near Remer, Minnesota.  Mabel Lake has 2.0 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 14 feet.  Fifty-one percent of the shoreline is residential, 23 % marsh, 17 % grassland, and 9 % forested.  A U. S. Forest Service campground with a public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Mabel Lake is in Lake Class 39.  Lakes in this class are small (average of 239 acres), shallow, weedy, and moderately clear.  <br> \n <br> \nMabel Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species.  This is also a good lake for young anglers and campers.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant with the gill net catch rate near the third quartile for Lake 39 lakes.  The average size of northern pike sampled in the 2006 survey was 25.5 inches, with the largest pike sampled measuring 30.1 inches.  The size structure consisted of larger percentage of bigger fish when compared to the previous survey.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are present with an average size of 10.2 inches with fish up to 20.3 inches in length sampled in the 2006 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are generally small but the numbers were consistent with the previous survey.  The average size of black crappie was 7.2 inches, with fish up to 13.9 inches sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of bluegills, which the trap net catch rate was near the third quartile for Lake Class 39 lakes, will surely keep young anglers busy.  Bluegills in Mabel Lake are generally small, with few fish available greater than 7 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in low numbers in Mabel Lake.  However, large fish are present.  Walleyes sampled during the 2006 survey averaged 20.8 inches in length, and ranged in length from 7.8 to 27.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present include pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Mabel Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mabel Lake (ID# 11-0121) is a 165-acre lake about eight miles west of Remer, MN just north of State Highway 200.   Mabel Lake has 2.0 miles of shoreline with a maximum depth of 14 feet.  A U.S. Forest Service campground with a public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Mabel Lake is in Lake Class 39; lakes in this class are generally shallow with a high percentage of the basin less than 15 feet deep, and have a regular-shaped shoreline with few bays or points. The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to other lakes in Lake Class 39, and size structure of the population was good.  Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 17 to 34 inches.  Largemouth Bass were relatively abundant and fish approaching 19 inches were sampled.  Black Crappie abundance was consistent with observations from similar lakes and fish up to 10 inches were sampled.   Mabel Lake had a good population of Bluegill Sunfish both in terms of numbers and size.  Pumpkinseed were also abundant, with a good number of fish 6 inches or larger.  The catch rate of Yellow Perch in MNDNR test nets compared favorably with other Lake Class 39 perch populations.  Yellow Perch up to 11.7 inches were found, and the average size of Yellow Perch in the 2013 sampling was 8.7 inches.  Walleye abundance was similar to other lakes of this type, and fish from 10 to 28 inches were sampled.   Other species sampled in Mabel Lake were Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass and White Sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Mabel Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resources office.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mabel Lake is a 184-acre lake with 2.15 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 14 feet located west of Remer, MN in the Chippewa National Forest. A US Forest Service owned public access is located on the east shore, as well as a federal campground with a picnic area and swimming beach. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Mabel Lake is in Lake Class 39; lakes in this class are shallow and often support robust populations of sunfish and Northern Pike. Other area lakes in this class include Lomish and Town Line Lake. Mabel Lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nMabel Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity dominated by Largemouth Bass, Sunfish, and Northern Pike. Largemouth Bass abundance exceeded management goals with fish up to 16 inches sampled. Northern Pike abundance was above the maximum management goal and pike ranged in length from 13 to 34 inches. Bluegill abundance was within the management goal range and roughly half of sampled Bluegill measured 6 inches or longer, ranging in length from 2 to 9 inches. Walleye measured between 17 and 19 inches and abundance was low. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter in Mabel Lake include Hybrid Sunfish and Rock Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Mabel Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mable Lake is 165 acres, has a maximum depth of 14 ft, and is located near Remer, MN.  Secchi depth was 12.0 ft indicating good water clarity, and alkalinity was 32 in 1991 indicating low to moderate productivity.  Due to good water clarity and shallow depths, aquatic vegetation is abundant.  Previously, Mable Lake has been reclaimed with rotenone in 1969 after a winter kill and restocked with walleye and other species.  Today, the fishery community is dominated by centrarchids and northern pike, but walleye are also present.   A U.S. Forest Service campground is located on the southeast shore.  Bluegill trap net catch was 314.7/set which is much higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill size structure was poor with no fish larger than 6.5 inches sampled.  Bluegill growth is very slow and eight year old fish are only 5.5 inches in length.  Black crappie gill net catch was 6.0/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 9 inches sampled.  Black crappie growth was also very slow and was less than 85% of the statewide average.  Northern pike gill net catch was 13.0/set which is above the expected range.  Mean weight was 2.7 pounds and length varied from 12  to 34 inches.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 28 inches sampled.  Walleye gill net catch was 0.7/set which is slightly below the expected range.  Mean weight was 2.6 pounds and length varied from 15 to 22 inches.  Based on aging data, all the fish sampled in this assessment were from stocked year classes, indicating little or no natural reproduction.  Currently, walleye fingerlings are stocked every third year.  Nighttime electrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted for the first time on Mable Lake to supplement information from standard survey gear.  Only 9 largemouth bass were sampled, which corresponds to a catch rate of 7.4 fish/hour.  It is difficult to make conclusions regarding the largemouth bass population with only one sample, however, the electrofishing data will become more useful as more data are collected.  Since the quality of a lake largely depends on how the lands surrounding the lake are developed, it is important that lakeshore owners develop their lakeshore responsibly.  Some items which lakeshore owners should consider include leaving a 30 ft buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and debris from washing into the lake, inspecting septic systems to ensure that they are functioning properly and are up to present standards, and eliminate fertilizer usage.  If fertilizers must be used, choosing a low or no phosphorous brand will lessen the impacts of fertilizer usage.</p>",
