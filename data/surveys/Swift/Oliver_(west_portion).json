                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into east and west basins by Swift County Highway 5.  Connectivity is limited to one 36-inch culvert that is completely submersed under the highway.  Walleye natural reproduction has generally been poor in both basins and stocking has been necessary to maintain the populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye stocking plan for West Oliver is 100,000 fry three of four years.  Walleye fry stocked in 2021 and 2022 were from the Southern Minnesota Strain.  This strain is showing some potential to provide self-sustaining populations in many southern Minnesota lakes.  No walleyes were stocked in 2023.    <br> \n <br> \nThis night electrofishing targeted survey was conducted on 8/29 to evaluate the abundance of young-of-year walleyes (YWAE) in the west basin.  In three stations  12 YWAE/hour were caught, which is the highest recorded catch rate from a non-stocked year in West Oliver.  The mean rate for non-stocked years is only 2 YWAE/hour. The 2023 walleyes averaged 6.1 inches and were in good condition.  Yearling walleyes were abundant and they measured approximately 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is located in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into East Oliver and West Oliver Lakes by Swift County Highway 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.  This 2019 survey was conducted on West Oliver Lake to collect routine fish data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from West Oliver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWest Oliver Lake has been a good Walleye fishery for many years.  Walleyes were moderately abundant in 2019 from a wide range of sizes, including trophy-sized fish.  The Walleye population has primarily been maintained by fry stocking, with lesser contributions by stocked fingerlings and yearlings. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been abundant in East Oliver lake for several years where a likely unauthorized stocking occurred around 2010.  During recent years, Smallmouth Bass have migrated downstream into West Oliver Lake and they are expected to become abundant there also. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were present in moderate numbers with fish measuring up to 11 inches.  Bluegill numbers have typically been low, but they grow fast and can exceed seven inches after three summers.  Black Crappie populations tend to fluctuate widely in prairie lakes, and West Oliver Lake is no exception.  Although Black Crappies have been abundant at times historically, very few were caught in 2019.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oliver Lake is in western Swift County, approximately nine miles north of Appleton.  The lake is split into East Oliver and West Oliver Lakes by County Highway 5.  Although a culvert exists under the highway, the basins typically have substantially different fish populations.  This survey was conducted on West Oliver Lake to collect routine fish data using gill nets, trap nets and electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from West Oliver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWest Oliver Lake has been a good Walleye fishery for many years.  Walleyes were moderately abundant in 2022 from a wide range of sizes, including many trophy-sized fish.  The average length of Walleyes caught was 19 inches, with many fish over 20 inches.  The Walleye population has primarily been maintained by fry stocking, with smaller contributions by stocked fingerlings and yearlings. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been abundant in East Oliver Lake for several years due to an unauthorized stocking that occurred around 2010.  During recent years, a substantial population has become established in West Oliver Lake as well, with fish up to 19 inches.      <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were lower than in recent years, but perch up to 11 inches were present.  High numbers of smaller Bluegills were present, but some over 9 inches were also sampled.  Black Crappie populations tend to fluctuate widely in prairie lakes, and West Oliver Lake is no exception.  Although Black Crappies have been abundant at times historically, very few were caught in 2022.   <br> \n</p>",
