                "narrative": "<p>Rudy Lake is managed for northern pike and yellow perch, and resorts in the area have been known to direct clientele there for northern pike fishing.  Its current lake management plan (1991) did not schedule any surveys or assessments due to the lake's low management priority.  The 2014 assessment was done because we had gotten an occasional question about fish and fishing in Rudy Lake, and we had little information on the fish community there.  The lake had been surveyed in 1979 and assessed in 1990, but no new information had been collected since 1990.  The 1990 assessment collected northern pike, white sucker, yellow perch, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  Northern pike gill net catches in 1979 and 1990 were 7.0 and 1.0 fish/set, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were apparently abundant in Rudy Lake in 2014.  Although there appeared to have been little potential for trophy fish, northern pike as large as 28 inches were taken.   Three year classes, all naturally produced, were represented in the 2014 catch, which appeared to have been dominated by a strong 2011 year class.  Growth of young northern pike was apparently fast; fish reached an average length of 19.7 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 17.8 inches.  Good growth was supported by forage provided by yellow perch and small white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were fairly abundant in 2014, but most were too small to have been of much interest to anglers.  The lake has been know to produce larger perch in some years; fish up to 10 inches were seen in 1979 and 1990.    The white sucker gill net catch was roughly similar to catches seen in 1979 and 1990, and fell within the normal range for lakes of this type.  Many of the white sucker sampled in 2014 were under 12 inches in length, and would have been small enough to provide forage for larger northern pike.  No pumpkinseed or green sunfish were taken in 2014, but its likely small numbers of both species were still present. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
