Lake levels at the time of the assessment were approximately 1.5 feet below average and the shoreline was defined by woody debris with exposed boulders and muck. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by a 180 rod portage from North Hegman Lake. There are 3 designated USFS campsites on the lake. Campsite use appears to be low compared to other lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling during the 2014 population assessment consisted of 6 gill nets. The catch was comprised of northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (3.2/gill net) were slightly below average when compared to other similar area lakes. Pike were 21 inches long on average but the largest pike was nearly 27 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers in 2014 (1.3/gill net) were below average when compared to similar  lakes. Smallmouth averaged about 10 inches long and 6 years old. The largest smallmouth sampled was nearly 16 inches long and 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2014 (1.0/gill net) were slightly above average when compared to other similar area lakes. The average largemouth was 12 inches long and about 4 years old. The largest largemouth was 15 inches long and about 14 years old.</p>",
