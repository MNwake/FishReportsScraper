Crappie Lake is one of three lakes in the Park Rapids Fisheries Management Area that is designated as a stream trout lake and stocked each fall with Rainbow Trout fingerlings.  The other two lakes are Blacksmith and Newman Lakes.     <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of Rainbow Trout in Crappie Lake in 2017 was similar to 2015 and 2016 finding, but was lower compared to the two other trout lakes in the Park Rapids management area.  Rainbow Trout from the 2016 stockings ranged from 9.5 to 11.5 inches and Rainbow Trout from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 stockings ranged from 13 to 19 inches.  All of the Rainbow Trout captured in 2017 were Kamloops strain.  Based on results of higher survival of Kamloops than Arlee strain, all Rainbow Trout stocking in Crappie Lake will be Kamloops strain starting in 2017</p>",

Crappie Lake is managed for rainbow trout and is stocked annually with 2,000 rainbow trout fingerlings (5-7 inches).Rainbow trout were sampled in moderate numbers during the 2004 survey (3.5 trout/gillnet).  Sampled rainbow trout had an average length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.6 lbs, with fish measured up to 16.3 inches.  Rainbow trout abundance was high in the 1989 survey and low in the 1994 and 1999 surveys.</p>",
