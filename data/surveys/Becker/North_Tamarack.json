                "narrative": "<p>The fishery in Tamarack Lake is now well into recovery from a fairly severe winterkill that occurred in 1997.  After that winterkill, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, and bullhead were the only species found in the post-winterkill assessment.  Walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie were subsequently reintroduced. <br> \n <br> \nAs in most winterkill lakes, bullheads were the first to recover.  Black bullheads, in particular, are able to survive episodes of low dissolved oxygen so they have a head start over other fish species after a winterkill.  Test net catches of black and brown bullhead were very high in 1998.  Ten years later, they have now declined to numbers much more typical of a permanent fish lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were stocked as fry in spring of 1997, following the winterkill, and again in each even-numbered year since then.  The population is not at the long range goal of ten walleyes per experimental gill net, but still provides periodically good angling for fish that average about a pound and a half each and the potential to catch larger walleyes, as well.  The walleye fry stocking rate was recently increased and, barring a heavy winterkill,  the next study should indicate if the doubled stocking rate is helping to meet long range goals. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills, stocked as broodstock in 1997, have successfully reared several year classes since then.  In fact, nine different year classes of bluegill were found in the 2008 sample.  Bluegills over nine inches in length can be found, but are not as abundant as smaller fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and black crappie populations are also present in Tamarack Lake.  Crappie catches were at their historical highs in 2008, though they were not exceptionally high compared to other similar lakes.  Most of the sampled crappies were too small for anglers to keep, but should provide angling opportunities within a couple of years if winterkill does not occur.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tamarack Lake is an occasional winterkill lake that has recently gone at least 13 years without severe oxygendepletion.  Consequently, for the past 10 years the lake has been a very good fishing lake for bluegill, blackcrappie, largemouth bass, walleye, and northern pike.  Because the lake periodically winterkills, competition isreduced and fish generally grow faster than in other area lakes.  Additionally, since there is no shorelinedevelopment because the lake is within the Tamarack National Wildlife Refuge, vegetation stands and otherimportant fish habitat types are not disturbed and provide excellent spawning, feeding, and cover areas.     Black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and walleye were all nonexistent in the 1960 survey followingseveral years of moderate to severe winterkill.  All of those species had reached normal to high abundance by theeighties.     As of summer 1993, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike were all considered more abundant than normalcompared to similar lakes.  Bluegill lengths averaged over seven inches and some fish caught in test nets werenearly eleven inches long.  Northern pike averaged over 22 inches long and weighed about 2.5 lbs.  Black crappiewere present in \"normal\" numbers but were large.  Mean length of crappie was nearly 10 inches and some up to 14inches long were caught.  Walleye were also considered average in abundance compared to similar lakes and wereof good size with an average weight of 1.7 pounds.  Yellow perch and yellow bullhead were high in abundance in'93.  Perch were the most important prey fish for northern pike and walleye in Tamarack Lake.  Yellow bullheadaveraged nearly 12\" long and have replaced the black bullhead as the most abundant bottom feeder.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fishery in Tamarack Lake is now well into recovery from a fairly severe winterkill that occurred in 1997.  After that winterkill, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, and bullhead were the only species found in the post-winterkill assessment.  Walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie were subsequently reintroduced.As in most winterkill lakes, bullheads were the first to recover.  Black bullheads, in particular, are able to survive episodes of low dissolved oxygen so they have a head start over other fish species after a winterkill.  Test net catches of black and brown bullhead remained high in 2003, although catch rates decreased since 1998.Walleyes were stocked as fry in spring of 1997, following the winterkill, and again in 1998, 2000, and 2002.  Those first two year classes are doing very well and still make up a substantial portion of the walleye population in Tamarack Lake.  These walleyes have been providing angling opportunities for about three years and are currently about 20 inches long.  The average size of all sampled walleyes in 2003 was 1.6 pounds and 16.1 inches.Bluegills, stocked as broodstock in 1997, have successfully reared several year classes since then.  The 2001 year class is especially strong.  Barring another winterkill, this year class should provide very good fishing in a couple of years.  Bluegills hatched in 1997 provide fishing opportunities for fish over eight inches at this time, but are not as abundant as smaller fish.Largemouth bass and black crappie populations are also recovering.  Like the bluegills, largemouth bass also brought off a very successful hatch in 2001.  Black crappies are present but not abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fishery in Tamarack Lake has now recovered from a fairly severe winterkill that occurred in 1997.  After that winterkill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and bullhead were the only species found in the post-winterkill assessment.  Walleye, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie were subsequently reintroduced. <br> \n <br> \nAs in most winterkill lakes, bullheads were the first to recover.  Black Bullheads, in particular, are able to survive episodes of low dissolved oxygen so they have a head start over other fish species after a winterkill.  Test net catches of Black and Brown bullhead were very high in 1998.  Fifteen years later, they have now declined to numbers much more typical of a permanent fish lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were stocked as fry in spring of 1997, following the winterkill, and again in each even-numbered year since then.  The catch rate reached the long range goal of 10 Walleyes per experimental gill net in 2013.  Sampled Walleyes averaged 1.1 pounds and 14.7 inches and lengths ranged from 8.5 to 23.6 inches.  The biennial Walleye fry stocking rate was increased in 2008 and this study indicates that the new stocking rate has helped to meet the long range goal. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills, stocked as broodstock in 1997, have successfully reared several year classes since then.  In fact, nine different year classes of Bluegill were found in the 2013 sample.  Bluegills over nine inches in length can be found, but are not as abundant as smaller, younger fish.  One, two and three-year old Bluegills were most abundant and even through the growth rate is relatively fast in Tamarack Lake, it still takes about six years to grow an eight-inch fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappie populations are also present in Tamarack Lake.  Crappie catches were a little higher than the historical average in Tamarack and fish were larger than they were during the past two studies in 2003 and 2008.  Trap net sampled crappies ranged from 6.5 to 12.1 inches in length with an average of 9.5 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tamarack Lake recently experienced three episodes of severe winterkill, in 1994, 1996, and 1997.  Consequently, the fish community in 1998 was in the initial stages of recovery.  Following the most recent winterkill, the lake was restocked with adult bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie broodstock.  In addition, walleye fry were stocked in each of the past two years.  As is often the case, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, and bullhead survived the low oxygen in relatively large numbers.Walleyes were growing and surviving well in spite of abundant bullheads.  Largemouth bass and bluegill brought off good year classes in 1997 and 1998.  Northern pike and black crappie remained part of the catch and should contribute to the future fishery.  Other than northern pike, with a few fish over 20 inches long, most species were not yet acceptable to anglers.  Without another winterkill, northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass should be large enough to be considered \"keepers\" in another two years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The north basin of Tamarack Lake is a 1,442-acre lake located approximately 12 miles northeast of Detroit Lakes.  It lies entirely within the boundaries of the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge and is considered the headwaters of the Buffalo River.  Tamarack Lake is productive and subject to occasional winterkill.  The last severe winterkill occurred in 1997.  Oxygen levels dropped critically low during the late winter 2017/2018, but results from this survey made it clear that little to no winterkill occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Tamarack Lake appears to be quite resilient in light of the severe and partial winterkills that have occurred over the past three decades.  The average Walleye catch rate in 2018 was 7.8 fish per gill net, near the historical average of 9.3 fish per gill net.  Sampled Walleyes had an average length of 18.1 inches, but fish up to 23 inches were also observed.  Walleye grew fast, with fish averaging 16.3 inches in length in four years.  <br> \n <br> \nFor the first time since 1993, Northern Pike abundance was higher than average.  Gill nets captured 10.8 pike per net in 2018, compared to the lake's historical average of 8.1 pike per net.  Pike ranged from 9.8 to 25.0 inches in length, and averaged 18.5 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for Bluegills reached a new historical high of 21.6 fish per net.  The previous benchmark was 12.4 fish per net, set in 1989.  In 2018, Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.6 to 10.1 inches with an average length of 6.85 inches.   Bluegill in Tamarack Lake grew fast, with fish exceeding 8.0 inches on average by five years of age.   <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to Bluegill, Black Crappie catch rates reached a new historical high of 4.3 fish per trap net in 2018.  Crappies were 4.4 to 12.7 inches in length with an average of of 9.7 inches.  Black Crappie averaged 9.9 inches in length at four years of age. <br> \n <br> \nNight time electrofishing found Largemouth Bass abundance to be moderately low at 19.0 fish per hour of shocking time.  Bass had an average length of 13 inches, but fish up to 17 inches were found. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads.  Anglers can maintain the quality fishery in Tamarack Lake by practicing selective harvest of medium-sized Bluegills and Black Crappies, while releasing the larger individuals. </p>",

It lies entirely within the boundaries of the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge and is considered the headwaters of the Buffalo River.  It is subject to occasional winterkill.  The last severe winterkill occurred in 1997.  Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and bullheads survived the low dissolved oxygen levels that year.  In the spring of 2023, dead fish were reported following ice out, which prompted a fisheries survey to be conducted in May 2023 to assess the severity of the winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nDead fish of all species were observed while surveying.  Trap nets captured Northern Pike, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Yellow Perch were the most numerous.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were caught in good numbers with average lengths of 19 inches and nine inches, respectively.  Unfortunately, North Tamarack Lake appears to have experienced a significant winterkill for Bluegill, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass during the 2022-2023 winter.  As a result, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie were stocked during 2023.  While angling opportunities for Northern Pike and Black Crappie are still available, it will take a few years to have quality fishing for other species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 20, 2017. Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lakeshore. Three sites were not accessible due to vast beds of wild rice and could not be relocated without overlapping or being in very close proximity to other sites. Therefore 15 sites were sampled and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 15 sites with seven sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 5 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at 3 sites, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at an additional seven sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey will be combined with trap net and gill net data from a 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",
