                "narrative": "<p>  In July 1989 a lake survey was conducted on McCormick Lake.  Two gillnets and four trapnets were set to assess the present fish population.  Shoreline seining efforts took place in early September to evaluate natural reproduction of the fish species present.\n  Based on respective local medians from test net indices, the present fish population is as follows:  the northern pike (8.50/set) net catch was up from the previous survey catch in 1958 (2.33/set).  This net catch had a value higher than the local median catch (3.50/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 13.0 to 23.9 inches with a median length group of 17.0-17.9 inches.  The mean weight was 1.57 pounds.  A total of nineteen (19) northern pike were sampled from all test nets to evaluate age and growth rates.  The age groups present between I and VII years exhibited normal growth when compared to statewide average growth rates.\n  The bluegill sunfish (10.00/set) net catch was up considerably from the previous survey net catch (1.50/set), however, remains below the local median net catch (20.00/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 7.9 inches with median length group of 4.0 - 4.4 inches.  Age groups II - VI were represented by the catches.\n  The black crappie (4.75/set) net catch was well below the previous survey net catch (33.00/set) and also below the local median catch (5.75/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0 - 6.4 inches.  Age groups I - VI were represented by the net catches.  One 9.5 inch white crappie was caught during the survey.\n  The pumpkinseed sunfish (6.50/set) net catch was above the previous survey catch (0.50/set) and local median catch (3.00/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 5.9 inches with a median length group of 3.5 - 3.9 inches.  Age groups I-V were represented by the net catches.\n  The yellow perch (3.50/set) net catch was above the previous survey catch (1.67/set) but below the local median net catch (8.58/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 4.5 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 6.0 - 6.4 inches.  Age groups III-V were represented by the net catches.\n  Three (3) bullhead species (black, yellow, and brown) were taken by test net gear and were not significantly above or below their respective local medians net catches.  The largemouth bass was not sampled in the gillnets or trapnets.\n  Shoreline seining efforts recorded young-of-year fish species from northern pike, bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McCormick Lake, also known as Third Lake, is a small lake located in northern Pine County just east of the town of Willow River.  Despite the lakes abundance of shallow water acreage, a fish winterkill has never been documented.  The entire shoreline and immediate watershed surrounding McCormick Lake is characterized by undeveloped forest or woodland and marshland.  Currently, the property around most of the shoreline is state-owned.  State forest land makes up most of the surrounding acreage while a general use Aquatic Management Area (AMA) makes up a buffer strip around the lakes shoreline.  Activities allowed on general use AMA's includes angling, wildlife observation, hunting, trapping, and collection of edible seeds, fruits or mushrooms for personal use.  Dogs are allowed to enter these areas, but operation of motorized vehicles is not allowed.  Entrance to the north/northwest side of the lake off Walters Road is the most accessible.  The fish population in McCormick Lake is managed for northern pike primarily with bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and largemouth bass as the secondary management species.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 21, 1999 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, two gill nets, six trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instuctions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.Numbers of northern pike for this lake type were found to be below normal; however, the average weight, at 4.4 pounds, was above normal.  Fish lengths extended from 10.0 to 29.4 inches.  McCormick Lake northern pike growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.  Spring night electrofishing sampled 19 largemouth bass with lengths that ranged from 7.2 to 18.3 inches.  Largemouth displayed normal growth at all ages.  All panfish species sampled during this survey, bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and pumpkinseed sunfish, were found at normal abundance levels.  Their lengths extended from 3.3 to 8.2, 6.1 to 10.0, and 3.4 to 7.3 inches, respectively.  According to historical records, the 1999 catch for bluegill sunfish was the highest ever recorded while the black crappie catch was the lowest ever recorded.  When compared to statewide averages, bluegill growth was typical of normal while black crappie growth was slow.  Yellow perch were found in below normal numbers.  Previous surveys indicated that perch numbers were always low in abundance.  Reproductive success for bluegill sunfish was excellent while largemouth bass and yellow perch showed some success.  Other fish species found during the 1999 survey included black bullhead, brown bullhead, central mudminnow, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.An angler seeking a peaceful relaxing fishing experience supplemented by a chance at catching a nice sized northern pike, largemouth bass or bluegill sunfish may want to include McCormick Lake on their list of lakes to visit.  Release of larger northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish is encouraged to maintain and enhance their quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McCormick Lake, also known as Third Lake, is a small lake located in northern Pine County just east of Willow River, MN.  Despite the lakes abundance of shallow water acreage, a fish winterkill has never been documented.  The entire shoreline and immediate watershed surrounding McCormick Lake is characterized by undeveloped forest or woodland and marshland.  Currently, the property around most of the shoreline is state owned.  State forest land makes up most of the surrounding acreage while a general use Aquatic Management Area (AMA) makes up a buffer strip around the lakes shoreline.  Activities allowed on general use AMA's includes angling, wildlife observation, hunting, trapping, and collection of edible seeds, fruits or mushrooms for personal use.  Dogs are allowed to enter these areas, but operation of motorized vehicles is not allowed.  A public boat launch is located on the northwest end of the lake.  The fish population in McCormick Lake is managed for northern pike primarily with bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and largemouth bass as the secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nA standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 06, 2009 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, two gill nets, and nine trap nets.  Northern pike were normal in both numbers and size for this lake type.  Pike lengths extended from 14.3 to 27.4 inches.  Spring night electrofishing sampled only one largemouth bass, down from 19 in 1999.  Both bluegill sunfish and black crappie were found at normal abundance levels.  Lengths extended from 3.7 to 6.6 and 4.4 to 10.4 inches respectively. Average size was below normal levels for both fish species.  Yellow perch abundance has historically been low in McCormack Lake.  The 2009 assessment was no exception.  Perch ranged from 6.0 to 7.1 inches in length.  Other fish species present during the 2009 survey included brown bullhead, white sucker, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
