Smallmouth bass abundance has been fairly stable with good size fish averaging 2.6 pounds, which is over 2.4 times the median weights for bass in this lake classification.  The pumpkinseed population has always been very low and made up of small fish.  Abundance has increased to more acceptable levels of yellow perch with an average weight of 0.45 pounds/fish.  All populations are sustained by natural reproduction including walleye, which are more abundant than ever, with a population above the third quartile for this lake class and an average weight of 1.9 pounds.  Growth rates for all species analysed fall within a normal range.</p>",

The 2007 lake management plan indicates smallmouth bass and walleye as the primary species of management with northern pike as secondary species.  The fish community is vulnerable to angling overharvest because the lake is only 69 acres and has low productivity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most commonly caught species in the nets.  The gill-net catch of 10.0 fish/net was similar to the last two assessments.  The catch exceeded the third quartile value of 8.9 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.3 to 33.2 inches and had a mean length of 16.5 inches.  Six year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 1 to age 7.  Age-2 through 4 fish represented 80 percent of the sample.  Northern pike averaged 17.9 inches by age 4 which was below the statewide average of 20.5. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have ranged from 1.3 to 3.0 since 1971.  In 2011, the catch of 1.3 fish/gill net was similar to the catch in 1982 and the lake class median.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.4 to 19.1 inches and had a mean length of 14.2 inches.  Four year classes from age 1 to 4 were identified from scales and opercles.  Growth was good with lengths-at-age being slightly above the statewide averages for all ages.  Walleye averaged 16.8 inches at age 4.  Natural reproduction has maintained a modest walleye population with catches at or above the lake class median. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have been above the lake class median of 3.0/net in the last four assessments.  In 2011, the catch was the second highest on record at 7.8 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.5 to 12.9 inches and had a mean length of 9.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included five pumpkinseed sunfish and one white sucker.

Because it lies within a State Park, Lake of Isles has had no private development along its shorelines.  <br> \n <br> \nThis special assessment was conducted to address concerns about a lack of smallmouth bass in the last population assessment.  On June 5, GPS locations of smallmouth bass nest sites were obtained by motoring slowly along the shoreline with a person in the bow of the boat looking for nests.  The crew located 5 smallmouth bass nests (see photo) as well as several smaller nests attributed to bluegill.  Additionally, there may have been some deeper nests off the east end on the islands in the northern portion of the lake, but this was not confirmed. <br> \n <br> \nOn June 7, angling was used to sample smallmouth bass.  Two people fished while a third person positioned the boat.  Angling effort was 5.0 hours x 2 anglers = 10.0 angler-hours.  A total of 7 smallmouth bass were caught and released and 11 others were observed.  Sampled bass ranged from 11.1 to 18.5 inches with an average length of 15.6 inches.  Average weight was 2.1 pounds and the angling catch rate was 0.7 fish/hour.  Age analysis from the small number of scale samples collected indicated growth was similar to the statewide average.  Smallmouth bass averaged 15.9 inches in length at 7 years. <br> \n <br> \nThis assessment seemed to indicate a low density smallmouth bass population with a good average size.  Woody debris was fairly common along the shorelines, therefore no special habitat improvement projects were recommended; except for promoting old growth trees along the shoreline to provide large woody cover in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Isles is a 69-acre lake in northern Itasca County located within Scenic State Park.  The water is bog stained with a secchi disk transparency of 5.5 ft and phosphorous readings indicate low productivity.  Maximum depth is 48 ft and 75% of lake is less than 15 ft deep.  The walleye gill-net catch was 1.8/net which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye abundance in the 2001 survey is similar to previous surveys which have varied from 1.3 to 3.0/gill net.  Walleye varied in length from 12 to 20 inches.  Walleye growth was faster than statewide averages for ages 1 to 3, and similar to statewide averages for ages 4 to 6.  The small size of Lake of the Isles, low lake productivity, abundant northern pike, and low yellow perch abundance limits the extent of the walleye population.  The lake is not stocked and natural reproduction is sustaining a walleye population within the expected range.    Northern pike gill-net catch was 9.5/net which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance is similar to previous surveys which have varied from 4.7 to 10.3/net.  The 1971 survey only used one gill net, thus it is not included here.  Northern pike size structure was poor with only one fish exceeding 24 inches.  Growth was slow and similar to 85% of the statewide average with fish reaching 24 inches at age seven.  When northern pike populations are abundant, prey populations can be reduced causing increased competition for food, which often results in poor size structure.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 8.5/set which is within the expected range.  Abundance in previous assessments has also been low varying from 2.0 to 5.3/net.  Size structure was generally good with fish reaching 10.5 inches.  Growth was good and exceeded statewide averages for ages 1 to 6.Trap nets sampled northern pike, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Bluegill have never been sampled in Lake of the Isles.  Other fish sampled include white sucker.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in previous surveys, however largemouth bass have never been sampled.  Because bass avoid gill nets and trap nets, this survey does not represent the abundance of largemouth or smallmouth bass.   Anglers can help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.  Releasing northern pike greater than 24 inches and walleye greater than 19 inches today, allows these fish to grow into the trophy fish of tomorrow.  </p>",
