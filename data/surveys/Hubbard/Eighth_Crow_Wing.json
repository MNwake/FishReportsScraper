                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Eighth Crow Wing has a surface area of 492 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake and boating access is also available from the channel (Crow Wing River) connecting to Ninth Crow Wing then Tenth Crow Wing Lake.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing, which restricts boating to Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake provides a diverse fishery to the angler and is well known for abundant walleye and panfish populations as well as large northern pike.  A special 40-inch minimum length limit on northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eighth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nEighth Crow Wing has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  Northern pike abundance (5.8 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys and within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past survey has shown northern pike abundance to be lower, below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike were large-sized with an average length and weight of 30.0 inches and 6.3 pounds.  Northern pike up to 37.1 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were very fast when compared to other area lakes.  An abundant forage base of tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow perch contribute to the production of large northern pike in Eighth Crow Wing Lake.  Future surveys are planned to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the 40-inch minimum size length limit on northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (7.3 walleye/gillnet) was at the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Surveys since 1988 have had similar walleye abundance, at or above the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average size of 19.6 inches and 2.8 pounds, with fish measured up to 28.6 inches.  Walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR is maintaining the abundant walleye numbers in Eighth Crow Wing.  Eighth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years. <br> \n <br> \nEighth Crow Wing supports an abundant largemouth bass and panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers (138 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance (3.5 crappie/gillnet) was up, and at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown Eighth Crow Wing to have a low to moderate black crappie population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Eighth Crow Wing and largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers (116 bass/hour) when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 14-16 inch size range.  Eighth Crow Wing has good habitat of aquatic vegetation cover that will insure a healthy panfish and bass population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include high numbers of rock bass, and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Eighth Crow Wing has a surface area of 492 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake and boating access is also available from the channel (Crow Wing River) connecting to Ninth Crow Wing Lake.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing which restricts boating to Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, and Lower Twin.  Eighth Crow Wing provides a diverse fishery to the angler, and is well known for its abundant walleye population and large northern pike.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (8.6/gillnet), above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The 1988 and 1993 surveys had similar walleye abundance.  Average size of walleye was 17.3 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker are abundant in Eighth Crow Wing and provide an excellent forage base for walleye and northern pike.  Eighth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years.  Stocking appears to be maintaining the abundant walleye levels in Eighth Crow Wing, but sporadic natural reproduction also contributes to the population.  Walleye corresponding to stocked years accounted for 87% of the 1998 sample.Eighth Crow Wing  has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 1998 gillnet catch rate of 3.5/net is at the low end of the \"normal range\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Northern pike were large-sized with an average length and weight of 28.9 inches and 6.3 pounds.  Northern pike up to 42.5 inches were sampled.  An abundant forage base contributed to the fast growth rates observed in the northern pike. Eighth Crow Wing provides a diverse panfish fishery to the angler.  An abundant bluegill population is present (60.0/trapnet), however, size tends to run small with an average length of 5.9 inches.  A few larger bluegill are present, with fish measured up to 8.5 inches.  Pumpkinseed were also abundant, but average size was small (5.6 inches).  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers,  similar to past surveys.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers with standard survey gear (gillnet & trapnets).  Anglers report fair largemouth bass fishing, with moderate numbers and sizes of bass.  No special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been conducted on Eighth Crow Wing to adequately assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  Eighth Crow Wing has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy panfish population. Other species sampled included yellow bullhead, golden shiner, rock bass, bowfin (dogfish), and hybrid sunfish.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Eighth Crow Wing and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleyes are substantially well populated and of large size in 8th Crow Wing Lake.  Our catch of walleyes per gill net was 5.33 compared to the state median of 3.66.  The average weight of each fish was high (4.5 lbs.).  The number of northern pike caught, was close to the state wide average, however the average weight per set was above the state median.  According to our test net averages there seems to be a large population of yellow bullheads.  Sunfish were abundant throughout the lake, but they were rather small.  The average sunfish was 6\"-7\" in length.Management Recommendations:8th Crow Wing Lake should be managed as a L.M. Bass, Northern Pike, Panfish Lake.  Northern Pike could be stocked in alternate years to bolster the predator fish population.  The spawning facilities for Northern is rated as fair.  Walleye fingerlings may be stocked lightly to provide a additional specie for the angler, but not in large numbers as to interfer with the present fish population.  This lake recieves heavy fishing pressure during the summer season.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 17 - 18, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, two sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and nine sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 14 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on June 18, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Eighth Crow Wing Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing is located two miles east of Nevis in southeastern Hubbard County.  Eighth Crow Wing is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing has a surface area of 503 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A public access is located on the northeast end of the lake off Far North Drive.  Boating access is also available from the channel connecting Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing Lake which restricts boating downstream into Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing provides a diverse fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eighth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Shingobee, Tripp, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from past surveys but still within the range for similar type lakes.  Sampled Walleye had an average length of 19.9 inches with fish measured up to 29.5 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in high numbers.  Yellow Perch were generally small in size with an average length of 7.6 inches and fish measured up to 9.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA special 24-36 inch protected slot length limit for Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2020 on Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  The objective of this regulation was to maintain or increase Northern Pike sizes.  From 2003 to 2019 these lakes had a 40 inch minimum size limit on Northern Pike.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 26.5 inches and weight of 4.5 pounds with fish measured up to 36.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nEighth Crow Wing Lake supports healthy Largemouth Bass and panfish populations and can provide good fishing for these species.  Spring electrofishing sampled good numbers of Largemouth Bass with an average size of 11.8 inches with fish measured up to 19.2 inches.  Present and past surveys have shown abundant Bluegill and Pumpkinseed populations with fish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie populations have fluctuated from low to moderate numbers with fish in the 9-11 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eighth Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located 2 miles east of Nevis in south-eastern Hubbard County. Eighth Crow Wing Lake is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing has a surface area of 503 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the north east end of the lake off Far North Drive.  Boating access is also available from the channel connecting to Ninth Crow Wing then Tenth Crow Wing Lake. There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing, which restricts boating to Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Eighth Crow Wing is in Lake Class 31. Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and have regularly shaped shorelines. Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crow Wing, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Trip and Lower Twin.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was higher than similar lakes but below the current management goal.  Walleyes had an average length of 18 inches, with fish sampled up to 27 inches. Eighth Crow Wing has been stocked with mostly walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years. Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye were sampled in high numbers. Yellow perch were generally small in size, but there are some at an acceptable size for angling.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Eighth Crow Wing. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 29.6 inches and 5.9 pounds, with pike measured up to 41 inches in 2013.  A special 40-inch minimum length limit on northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 and was still in place.  Eighth Crow Wing has a healthy population of largemouth bass.  Spring sampling showed healthy numbers, with an average length of 11 inches and fish sampled up to 18.5 inches.  Eighth Crow Wing supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for black crappie and bluegill. Black crappie abundance was up, but still moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  The size was excellent for anglers, with an average size of 10 inches. Bluegills were sampled in high numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eighth Crow Wing. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

The average weight of the walleyes sampled was 2.3 pounds with 72% in the 15.0 to 25.0 inch range and 7% in the 25.0 to 27 inch range.  Natural reproduction contributed to walleye numbers as 22% of the walleyes sampled were from non stocked years.  Northern pike are present in low numbers as they have been historically.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 1993 was 29.3 inches and 6.0 pounds.  The largemouth bass and black crappies were sampled in low overall numbers and need to be evaluated by electrofishing in the future.  The bluegill trapnet catch numbers are high with a high percentage (88%) of the fish over 6.0 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant in 8th Crow Wing Lake and provide an excellent forage base for walleyes and northern pike and a fishery of its own with 38% of the fish sampled over 8.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Eighth Crow Wing has a surface area of 492 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake and boating access is also available from the channel (Crow Wing River) connecting to Ninth Crow Wing Lake.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing which restricts boating to Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake provides a diverse fishery to the angler and is well known for abundant walleye and panfish populations as well as large northern pike.  A special 40-inch minimum length limit on northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Eighth Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, and Lower Twin.Eighth Crow Wing has a history of having a low to moderate northern pike population composed of quality-sized fish.  The 2003 gillnet catch rate of 3.3 pike/net is at the low end of the \"normal range\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike were large-sized with an average length and weight of 28.8 inches and 6.0 pounds.  Northern pike up to 38.8 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were very fast when compared to other area lakes.  An abundant forage base of tullibee (cisco), yellow perch, and white sucker contribute to the production of large northern pike in Eighth Crow Wing.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (10.3/gillnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  The 1988, 1993, and 1998 surveys had similar walleye abundance.  Sampled walleye had an average size of 17.8 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Walleye exhibited fast growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  Yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker are abundant in Eighth Crow Wing and provide excellent forage for walleye and northern pike.  Walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR is maintaining the abundant walleye numbers in Eighth Crow Wing.  Age analysis showed 82% of the walleye sample corresponding to stocked years.  Eighth Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.Eighth Crow Wing has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Bluegill were sampled in high numbers (117.3/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Size of bluegill tends to run small as average size was only 5.8 inches, however, enough larger fish are present that you can sort through the small ones and still get enough \"eaters\".  Bluegill up to 8.7 inches were sampled.  Anglers will find good numbers of pumpkinseed in the 6-inch range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers in 2003.  Past surveys have shown Eighth Crow Wing to have a low to moderate black crappie population.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers with standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets).  Anglers report fair largemouth bass fishing, with moderate numbers and sizes of bass.  Spring electrofishing has not been conducted on Eighth Crow Wing to adequately assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  Eighth Crow Wing has good habitat of aquatic vegetation cover that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass and panfish population.Other species sampled include high numbers of hybrid sunfish, and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, and rock bass.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eighth Crow Wing Lake is located two miles east of Nevis in southeastern Hubbard County.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 503 acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the north east end of the lake off of Far North Drive.  Boating access is also available from the channel connecting Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  There is a small dam at the outlet of Eighth Crow Wing Lake, which restricts boating to Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crow Wings, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nA special 40-inch minimum length limit on Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 on Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes and is still in place.  The objective of this regulations was to maintain or increase pike sizes in these lakes.  Anglers can expect to find large Northern Pike in Eighth Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 32 inches and 7.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 42 inches in 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were in line with similar lakes, but below the current management goal.  Walleyes had an average length of 18 inches, with fish sampled up to 28 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in high numbers.  Anglers will find quite a few perch over 8 inches, with some up to 10.5 inches sampled. <br> \n <br> \nEighth Crow Wing Lake has Largemouth Bass, and spring sampling showed good numbers. They had an average length of 12 inches, with fish sampled up to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nEighth Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Black Crappie abundance was up, but still moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  They had an average size of 8 inches, with crappies sampled up to 11 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. Anglers will find the larger Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eighth Crow Wing Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Shoal water soils are mainly sand with a small amount of silt and muck also present.Fish taken in numbers which exceeded the statewide median catch per gillnet were northern cisco (tullibee), white sucker, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye.  Trapnets took yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, rock bass, and black crappie all in numbers greater than the statewide median catch per set.  Although northern pike and walleye were taken in good numbers, their lengths indicate a lack of natural reproduction.  The bluegill are very abundant and the catch rate was over 46 times the statewide catch per set.There are five resorts with 32 cabins and 51 boats, and 56 private homes and cottages with 69 boats on this lake.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were 11 fish houses located here.Fish Stocking:Although there are good numbers of northern pike and walleye in the lake at this time, the lengths of the fish taken indicate a lack of reproduction.  To maintain a fisherey for these species it will be necessary for them to be stocked.</p>",
