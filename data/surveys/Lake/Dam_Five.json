Assessment netting will be carried out to determine the success or failure of these fry plants. Partial scale reading traces the one strong Walleye year class present to the 1972 fry plant. If the Walleye management should fail the lake will be considered for reclamation as it does have good trout potential. At the present time there is a strong year class of Walleye in the lake.     Sucker removal should be undertaken to reduce the high population. The lake is difficult to trapnet due to the sharply dropping shorelines.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Five Lake is in Lake County approximately fourteen miles east of Isabella. The public access is a short carry-in trail down a few steps and is located off Lake County 7. There is a camp site at the access and space for parking a couple vehicles. The primary fishery is for Walleye and the population is currently maintained by stocking fry in even numbered years, except that fry were stocked in 2021 because they could not be stocked in 2020 due to pandemic restrictions.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey was completed to monitor the fish community and was the second survey used to evaluate the success of Walleye stocking since switching from fingerling to fry. Above average numbers of Walleye were caught, but most of the fish were from the stocked 2021 year class. These fish ranged from 9 to 10.5\" long, which contributed to the overall poor average size of 11.8\" long and 0.79 pounds. Age analysis determined only 6% of the Walleye caught were produced in non-stocked years and fish from each of the last four stocking events since 2014 were sampled. Results indicate fry stocking has been able to produce large enough year classes to maintain a fishable Walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Northern Pike are other game fish species present but have never been captured in high enough numbers to be of much interest to anglers. Because the lake has limited submerged aquatic plants, habitat likely limits the abundance of both species as well as other species that require vegetation as part of their life history. Abundance of forage species is also likely influenced by available habitat with White Suckers historically captured in high numbers and Yellow Perch captured in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nA single Bluegill was captured in 2023, which was the first time the species was caught during a fisheries survey. It is unclear how the fish got in the lake since the DNR has never stocked the species and they do not occur in any connected waterbodies. It is not likely that the species will proliferate in the lake given the available habitat, but future surveys will be used to document any changes to the fish community. </p>",

Average size of the Walleye were smaller than in the 1987 assessment (12.5\" vs 15.0\"), a fact probably influenced by successful stocking of fingerlings in 1987 and 1989. That enhanced the Age I and III year classes. Walleye natural reproduction appears to be marginal as the stronger year classes correspond with fingerling stocking.     No Northern Pike were sampled in gillnets in 1990, and this was unexpected as their numbers had increased in each of the last 2 assessments.      Yellow Perch have never been abundant, however the gillnet catch of 11.0/lift is over 5 times that of any catch in the last 10 years.     The trapnet catch of Largemouth Bass (0.2/lift) is consistant with previous catches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Dam Five Lake in the summer of 2003.  Species sampled during this assessment were walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, largemouth bass and white sucker.  Largemouth bass young-of-the-year were collected in 1/4 inch mesh trap nets, no adult fish were captured in any gear.Walleye were sampled in fairly low numbers, and abundance was much lower than it was several years ago.  The size of walleye in the sample was respectable, averaging 2.7 pounds, with fish up to 4.7 pounds taken.  There appears to have been a scarcity of smaller size walleye in Dam Five Lake in 2003, indicating that it could be a number of years before we could expect to see significantly higher walleye numbers return.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers and averaged about 2.5 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled during this assessment was 3.3 pounds.  Northern pike numbers are usually low in this lake and fish over 5 pounds have been uncommon in the past.Yellow perch were present in average numbers; however, they were too small to interest anglers.  The largest yellow perch in the sample was 6.9 inches.In the spring of 2001 the old logging dam on the outlet of the lake washed out and as a result the water level in the lake dropped approximately 2.5 feet to 3.0 feet.  This has increased the difficulty in launching a boat at the carry-down access and made motor travel to the main lake basin more hazardous.</p>",

A small campsite and carry-down access, administered by the U.S. Forest Service is at the south end of the lake.  The low lake level makes navigation to the main lake basin suitable only for canoe and small boats. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Dam Five Lake is comprised of walleye, largemouth bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed and white sucker. The walleye population sampled in 2007 was slightly above average for the lake class, with an average weight of 1.5 pounds.  A strong 2005 walleye year-class appears to be the result of an increase in the walleye stocking although natural reproduction appears to supplement the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, present since being stocked in the 1940s, were not sampled in the 2007 population assessment.   Low lake levels since the earthen dam washed out in 2001 has limited the northern pike spawning habitat and affected the population. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch in 2007 was within the normal range for the lake class.  The catch has fluctuated widely in previous assessments, with a few strong year-classes providing the bulk of the catch.  The majority (94%) of yellow perch sampled in 2007 were less than 8 inches in length.  White suckers were abundant as they have been in the last few investigations.  Two small largemouth bass were also sampled this year. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dam Five Lake is a 95 acre body of water located approximately 12 miles east-northeast of Isabella, MN.  There is a carry-down access to the south end of the lake from a short road off of Lake County Road # 7.  There is a camping site established in the general area of the public access, the open space has limited parking (4 vehicles).  Depending on the lake level, motoring up the narrow portion of the south end of the lake can be a problem with stumps and boulders.  The dam on the outlet washed out in 2001, dropping the lake level approximately 1.5 feet from the 2000 lake level, the lake level had dropped another 0.5 foot by 2003, held that level when measured in 2007 and was back to the 2001 level in this investigation (2010), when beaver activity re-established the lake level. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has a maximum depth of 38 feet, 64 acres littoral, with a secchi disk reading of 12 feet in the brown, bog stained water.  Water quality indicated the lake was a moderately hard-water lake with low fertility.  Dissolved oxygen is lacking at depths greater than 16 feet, by early August.  The predominant substrate was muck (\"common\") with rubble, boulder, detritus, gravel and sand in order of abundance and rated \"rare\" over-all.  Spawning habitat was considered \"poor\" for walleye and northern pike, \"fair\" for largemouth bass and rated \"good\" for yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish sample in 2010 consisted of largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in above average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size of the walleye sample was 0.8 pound (12.9 inches); the largest walleye was 19.3 inches.  Strong representation of the 2007 year-class (70% of the catch) brought the average walleye size down in 2010, although this year-class should produce good walleye fishing in the near future.  All walleye aged in 2010 were correlated to stocked year-classes 2009, 2007 and 2001; natural reproduction in Dam Five Lake appears to be minimal. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class.    The northern pike average size was 1.3 pounds (17.5 inches); the largest northern pike was 27 inches.  Northern pike assessments on Dam Five Lake have been spotty, with a low number or sometimes no northern pike collected in standard sampling gear.  The lake level fluctuations since 2001, due to the outlet dam washout, has made spawning habitat for this species very limited. <br> \n <br> \nA low number of small yellow perch were collected in 2010.  Dam Five Lake has a history of producing low numbers of yellow perch, rarely have quality size fish been sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAdult largemouth bass were not collected in standard sampling gear in 2010; however, there were many young-of-the-year largemouth bass caught in small mesh trap nets indicating a reproducing largemouth bass population exists in Dam Five Lake.  Previous investigation sampled low numbers of adult largemouth bass, with most of them measuring  less than 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBeaver activity on the outlet of Dam Five Lake has returned the lake to a level closer to the long-term norm.  Natural reproduction for all species will benefit having access to spawning areas/habitat that were not accessible for nearly ten years, this could produce more stable fish populations.  Walleye fingerlings will be stocked every-odd-year to supplement the limited natural reproduction. <br> \n</p>",

Averge size of the walleye sampled was 15.0 inches with over 40% of the fish sampled in the 16.0 inch to 18.0 inch range.     Dam Five Lake historically has maintained a good population of northern pike, with fish averaging 1.5 to 2.0 pounds. Recently northern pike abundance has declined, with current population levels low compared to similar lakes in the the Finland Area.     Largemouth bass are present, however most angling pressure is directed at walleye. Occasionally reports surface of a few quality size largemouth bass being taken. Largemouth bass are difficult to sample using nets thereby preventing an accurate evaluation of the population.</p>",

There is a carry-in access on the south end of from a short road off of Lake County Road #7.  There is a camping site at the access and parking for a couple vehicles.  Depending on lake water levels, using an outboard to navigate the narrow portion of the south end of the lake can be a problem with many boulders and stumps in the water.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Dam Five Lake and continue to evaluate the Walleye fry stocking regime for the lake.  Walleye catch was above average relative to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size was 15.7 inches and 1.4 pounds, with 45% of the catch over 15.0 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 23.4 inches and weighed 4.4 pounds.  Scale analysis indicated Walleye fry stocking is helping maintain a population with 86% of the sample coming from stocked years.  Walleye growth was average compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was below average compared to similar lakes in the area but within the historical catch for the lake.  A single Northern Pike measuring 23.46 inches and 3.22 pounds was caught in a gill net.  Trap nets sampled a Northern Pike which measured 16.14 inches and weighed 0.80 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in below average numbers relative to similar lakes in the area.  This is similar to past investigations on the lake.  Small mesh trap nets also sampled young of the year Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nOne Largemouth Bass was caught in the gill nets.  It measured 15 inches and weighed 1.7 pounds.  Young of the year Largemouth Bass were also sampled in the survey gear.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in above average numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged 14.9 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pumpkinseed, Blacknose Shiner, and Central Mudminnow were also sampled with the survey gear.  <br> \n</p>",

Fish were widely scattered within this range with no sizes being very abundant.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly, on an every-other-year rotation.Largemouth bass are present but the type of sampling gear that is feasible to use in this lake is not very effective at capturing these fish.  Very few largemouth bass were collected in this survey but occasionally anglers report catching some respectable size bass.  Fishing pressure for this species is light in Dam Five Lake.Northern pike were not collected in this survey although they have been taken in most of the previous surveys, usually in low numbers.  The northern pike taken in other surveys were generally on the small side and fish over 24 inches were uncommon.Yellow perch were collected in average numbers in this survey; however, the average size of 6.3 inches was too small to interest anglers.  No yellow perch over 9 inches were taken.</p>",
