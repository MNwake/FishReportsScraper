                "narrative": "<p>Hungryman Lake is located in eastern Becker County, two miles northeast of the town of Two Inlets.  Hungryman has a surface area of 91 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  Hungryman is a shallow lake, with 96% of the lake area less than 15 feet in depth.  Hungryman Lake lies entirely within the Two Inlets State Forest.  There is a State Forest campground and public access located on the south shore.  Due to the shallow depth, Hungryman Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill\" events.  Winterkill usually happens during long winters with heavy snowfall.  Oxygen production through photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating the water column.  At the same time decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are black bullhead and northern pike.  Fish species composition and abundance in Hungryman has fluctuated with these winterkill events.  The initial fisheries survey in 1991 sampled only black and brown bullhead, while the 1999 survey shows a diverse fishery for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Following the winterkill in the late 1980's, Hungryman was stocked with northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  There was a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked during the summer of 2002. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hungryman is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include; Paine, Peysenski, and Portage. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (5.0 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find that northern pike tend to run small as average length and weight was only 21.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Hungryman has an abundant panfish population of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 8-9 inch size range with a few crappies over 10 inches.  Black crappie growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range were sampled.  Hungryman can support a \"boom and bust\" largemouth bass population depending on the frequency and severity of winterkills.  While not known for producing big bass, Hungryman can provide good action for 12-15 inch bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungryman Lake is located in eastern Becker County, two miles northeast of the town of Two Inlets.  Hungryman has a surface area of 91 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  Most of the lake is shallow with 96% of the lake area less than 15 feet in depth.  Hungryman Lake lies entirely within the Two Inlets State Forest.  There is a State Forest campground and public access located on the south shore.  Due to the shallow depth, Hungryman Lake is subject to periodic  \"winterkill\" events.  Winterkill usually happens during long winters with  heavy snowfall.  Oxygen production through photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating  the water column.  At the same time decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are black bullheads and northern pike.  Fish species composition and abundance in Hungryman Lake has fluctuated with these winterkill events.  Hungryman Lake has only been surveyed in 1991 and 1999.  In 1991 only black and brown bullheads were caught in the nets, while the 1999 survey showed a diverse fishery for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and a bonus walleye population.   Following the winterkills in the late 1980s, Hungryman was stocked with northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hungryman lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Paine Lake (southwest of Lake George), Peysenski (five miles east of Park Rapids), and Portage (three miles northwest of Park Rapids).Northern pike were abundant, with the catch rate of 20.0 northern pike/gillnet double the range \"typical\" for lake class 39.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.6 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northern pike up to 26.5 inches were sampled. Largemouth bass and black crappie are abundant in Hungryman.  Catch rates from spring electrofishing and the survey nets were above the range \"typical\" for similar type lakes.  Most of the black crappie sampled were from 6 to 9 inches.  Largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.   Largemouth bass up to 15.0 inches were sampled. The walleye catch rate (3.5 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for lake class 39 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 14.1 to 23.2 inches.  The walleye population in Hungryman is maintained by stocking of surplus walleye from area rearing ponds.Bluegill and pumpkinseed are abundant in Hungryman, but size of fish ran small.  Average length was near 6.0 inches for both species.  Yellow perch are present, but do not provide a fishery as average size was small (6.1 inches).Both black and brown bullhead are present in Hungryman, with black bullhead being the more abundant species.  Black bullhead abundance was much higher in the 1991 survey following the winterkill of the late 1980's.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hungryman Lake is located in eastern Becker County, two miles northeast of the town of Two Inlets.  Hungryman has a surface area of 139 acres and is a very shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 21 feet.  Hungryman Lake lies entirely within the Two Inlets State Forest.  There is a State Forest campground and public access located on the south shore.  Due to the shallow depth, Hungryman Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill\" events.  Several partial winterkills have occurred over the years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hungryman is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include; Paine, Peysenski, and Portage.  Class 39 lakes are characterized as shallow lakes with a high percentage of the lake area less than 15 feet in depth (littoral area). <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Hungryman to have an abundant northern pike population.  Anglers will find that northern pike tend to run small as average length and weight was only 20.9 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike up to 28.3 inches were sampled.  Hungryman has an abundant panfish population composed of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 8-10 inch with a few larger sized fish.  Black crappie growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Hungryman can support a \"boom and bust\" largemouth bass population depending on the frequency and severity of winterkills.  While not known for producing big bass, Hungryman can provide good action for 12-15 inch bass. <br> \n</p>",

The Black Bullhead density is well above third quartile for lakes of this classification and sizes are generally small. Brown Bullhead catch rates were within the normal ranges.

                "narrative": "<p>Hungryman Lake is located in eastern Becker County, two miles northeast of the town of Two Inlets.  Hungryman has a surface area of 91 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  Most of the lakes is shallow, with 96% of the lake area less than 15 feet in depth.  Hungryman Lake lies entirely within the Two Inlets State Forest.  There is a State Forest campground and public access located on the south shore.  Due to the shallow depth, Hungryman Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill\" events.  Winterkill usually happens during long winters with heavy snowfall.  Oxygen production through photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating the water column.  At the same time decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are black bullhead and northern pike.  Fish species composition and abundance in Hungryman has fluctuated with these winterkill events.  The initial fisheries survey in 1991 sampled only black and brown bullheads, while the 1999 survey showed a diverse fishery for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and a bonus walleye population.  Following the winterkills in the late 1980's, Hungryman was stocked with northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye.  There was a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000 and 2001.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked during the summer of 2002.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hungryman is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Paine, Peysenski, and Portage.Northern pike abundance (8.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find that northern pike tend to run small as average length and weight was only 19.9 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern pike up to 27.7 inches were sampled.  Hungryman has an abundant panfish population of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  While numbers are high, size of panfish tends to run small.  Anglers will find lots of black crappie in the 6-8 inch range with few crappies over 10 inches.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 5-6 inch range are common, with few fish over 7 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill growth rates were slow when compared to other class 39 lakes.  Hungryman can support a \"boom and bust\" largemouth bass population depending on the frequency and severity of winterkills.  While not known for producing big bass, Hungryman can provide good action for 12-15 inch bass.  Hungryman supports an abundant black and brown bullhead population, typical for winterkill lakes.</p>",
