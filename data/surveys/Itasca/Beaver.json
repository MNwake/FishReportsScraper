                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is 50 acre lake located 12 miles east of Marcell in the Mississippi River watershed.  Beaver is in ecological lake class 33.  Class 33 lakes are small lakes with moderate depth and clarity and relatively hard water.  Other area lakes in class 33 include Forest, Spring and Little North Star.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 assessment was conducted in conjunction with a population assessment on adjacent Antler Lake.  The two lakes are connected by a shallow channel which is navigable by small boats.  This is the only designated access to Beaver Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe only previous test-netting on Beaver Lake was conducted in 1983.  Due to the small number of nets set, reported catches are a relatively crude measure of population abundance and size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike appeared to be relatively abundant with a catch rate of 8.5/gill net.  Sampled pike ranged from 12.6 to 31.9 inches with a mean length of 22.0 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 22.6 inches at five years.  Recruitment appeared relatively consistent with ages 1 and 3-8 represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at the lake class average of 2.0/gill net.  Sampled fish ranged from 4.9 to 8.9 inches.  The 1983 survey reported much higher catches of black crappie at 19.3/gill net.  Erratic recruitment commonly results in variable year class strength and boom and bust population cycles for black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled above the expected range at 2.5/gill net.  Sampled fish ranged from 10.4 to 14.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled near the lake class median at 11.0/trap net.  Size structure was poor with a mean length of 5.2 inches, and no fish over 7 inches in the sample.  The 1983 survey reported a similar catch rate and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
