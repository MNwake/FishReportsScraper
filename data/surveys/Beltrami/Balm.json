                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a 512-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet located 15 miles north of Solway in western Beltrami County.  There is a public water access located on the north shore of the lake off of CSAH 32 with parking for ten trucks/trailers.  Most of the lakeshore is in private ownership with the exception of the public access site and a 153-acre State Aquatic Management Area.   Water quality measurements taken in July of 2013 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to a depth of 21 feet, with a Secchi disc reading of 11.6 feet (clear water).  Balm Lake is managed primarily for bluegill, with walleye and largemouth bass managed as secondary species.  A special regulation is in effect for largemouth bass (12 to 20-inch protected slot with 1 over 20 inches allowed in possession).  Balm Lake contains abundant aquatic vegetation and diverse fish habitat.  The 2013 bluegill catch rate of 43.44 fish per trap net (43.44/TN) was just above the range typically found in Lake Class 25 (5.6/TN to 42.3/TN).  The catch rate for bluegill in gill nets was also high (62.7 fish per gill net [62.7/GN]).  Gill nets sampled a higher proportion of quality-size fish than trap nets, with 13% of the catch exceeding eight inches in length.  Bluegill up to 9.6 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 5.9 inches.  Balm Lake is intensively stocked with walleye fingerlings on alternate years.  The 2013 walleye catch rate of 23.2/GN far exceeds the typical Lake Class 25 range (1.25/GN to 5.5/GN).  Walleye up to 26.4 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 14.2 inches and 1.04 pounds, which translates to an abundance of \"eater\" size walleye in the population.  Age-2 walleye from the 2011 stocking comprised 46% of the sample; these fish should reach 14 inches in length by the summer of 2015 and provide good angling opportunity in the near future.  Catch rates for largemouth bass far exceeded the Lake Class 25 range for both gear types indicating an abundant bass population.  Largemouth bass up to 17.2 inches in length were captured during the 2013 fish population assessment.  Twenty-one percent of largemouth bass captured were greater than fourteen inches in length.  The 2013 northern pike catch rate of 3.33/GN is within the typical range for Lake Class 25 (3.13/GN to 8.5/GN).  Northern pike up to 33.6 inches in length were captured during the assessment, with an average size of 25.6 inches and 3.94 lbs.  Black crappie were present in good numbers with fish up to 11.6 inches in length captured.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a small bass-panfish lake in west-central Beltrami County with primary management for walleye and northern pike.  Similar lakes in the area include Big Moose, Pimushe, Turtle River, Itasca, and several others.  At least two resorts are found on the lake.  Light shoreline development, well-established plant communities, and an out-of-the-way location add to the balance of this lake's fish community.    The walleye population in Balm Lake is in generally good shape.  Walleye abundance and size are above average for this lake type.  Most of the walleye sampled were between 16 and 22 inches.  The population is maintained through walleye fingerling stocking.  Northern pike in Balm Lake are common and nice sized.  Most pike sampled were between 22 and 30 inches, but fish larger than 30 inches are available.  Observations suggest that largemouth bass are common in Balm Lake although this assessment did not target this species.  Black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch populations are above average in abundance compared to other similar lakes.  Size is generally smaller than average, but acceptable to most anglers.  Hybrid sunfish and rock bass also add to the panfish community.  Although walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass are plentiful, catching them may be difficult due to the abundant panfish populations.  These panfish populations not only compete for angler's baits, but also supply an ample food source for the larger predators, making them harder to catch.  Balm Lake's diverse fish community provides plenty of panfish action with the added chance to catch a large walleye or northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a 512-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet.  The lake is located 15 miles north of Solway in western Beltrami County.  There is a public access on the north end of the lake off of state aid hwy. 32.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Balm Lake is in lake class 25.  Typically lakes in this class are      deep and clear with hard water.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Beltrami, Big Buzzle, Gilstad, Big Moose, Movil, and Pimushe Lakes.  The lake is managed for  bluegill, walleye and largemouth bass. Walleye abundance in the 2001 assessment was above what you would typically find in a class 25 lake but similar to what was found in past assessments.  Walleye sampled were mostly older fish with 95% aged at five years or older.  This tendency for older fish has been common in earlier assessments as well.  Although this might indicate poor reproduction, ten different year classes were sampled.  Walleye from both stocked and nonstocked years were sampled indicating that natural reproduction and stocking are both contributing to the fishery. As expected with a population dominated by older fish, there are some quality sized fish available to anglers.  Fish ranged in length from 15.2 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 3.3 pounds.Northern pike abundance was normal for this lake type, but size is better than average.  Pike ranged in length from 20 to 37 inches with an average length and weight of 27 inches and 4.6 pounds.          Yellow perch abundance is well above what you would normally find in a class 25 lake.  Their presence and abundance as a forage species probably contributes to the quality size structure of the walleye and northern pike populations.  In addition to providing an excellent forage supply for the larger predators, perch in Balm Lake grow large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Fish ranged in length from 5 to 11 inches and had an average length of 7 inches.  Yellow perch up until nine years old were averaging an inch a year in growth.  As perch became older, they averaged      less than one inch a year.  The oldest yellow perch aged was 14 years and was 11.3 inches long. White sucker, also present in Balm Lake, is another fish that is used as food for predator fish.  It is important for the larger predator species to have access to larger prey species to maintain good growth rates.Anglers can expect to have much success angling for bluegill.  Abundance is well above averages for this lake class.  The average size is small but fish over seven inches do exist.   Pumpkinseed sunfish are also very abundant and their size is very similar to the bluegill.  If you are not particular about size, it should be relatively easy to catch a meal from this lake.Black crappie are also abundant and can furnish anglers recreational opportunity.  Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 10.5 inches.  Most crappie are small with most fish between 7 to 8 inches.  These fish were four years old when sampled and should provide some good fishing over the next few years.Riparian development in the form of new lake homes continues to occur on Balm Lake.  Shoreline development can negatively affect water quality and can impact aquatic habitat necessary for fish at various life stages.  Undeveloped shoreline is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  Shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Balm Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be a demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Balm Lake since most of the lakeshore is privately owned.  While future shoreline development may be inevitable, there are ways to minimize disturbances to sensitive aquatic habitats.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a 537-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet located 20 miles west of the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  A public water access with concrete ramp and parking for 10 trucks/trailers is located on the north shore of the lake off County Highway 32.  A special regulation for Largemouth Bass consisting of a protected slot limit from 14 to 20 inches with 1 fish allowed over 20 inches is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.  Balm Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill, Walleye, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population in Balm Lake is doing very well.  The 2018 survey captured a total of 691 bass, most of which were captured during night electrofishing.  Overall lengths ranged from 2.3 to 19.3 inches with an average of 9.7 inches which is similar to previous assessments.  Reproduction appears to be consistently successful due to the number of strong year classes present in the survey. Exceptionally high bass abundance was cause for concern, possibly impacting growth rate under the previous special regulation. This regulation was modified in 2018 to the current 14-20 inch protected slot limit to allow additional harvest of younger fish under 14 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Bluegill trap net catch rate of 23 fish per net was above the average catch rate from similar Minnesota lakes (17.25 fish per net).  Bluegill up to 8.5 inches in length were captured in trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nBalm Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year.  Walleye gill net catch rates have been very good in the past several assessments.  The 2018 Walleye catch rate of 15.67 fish per net was nearly 3 times higher than the upper-quartile value of catch rates from similar lakes (5.5 fish per net).  Walleye had a good average size of 15.87 inches in length and 1.35 lbs/fish.  The largest Walleye captured measured 26.77 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are not overly abundant in Balm Lake.  The 2018 gill net catch rate of 2.33 fish per net was below the range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.13 to 8.50 fish per net).    Northern Pike captured had a good average size of 26.91 inches with fish up to 38.58 inches in length captured in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Black Crappie catch rate (0.67 fish per trap net) was lower than average for Balm Lake and below the range of catch rates found in similar lakes (0.75 to 3.18 fish per net).  Gill nets captured a more representative sample of the Black Crappie population.  The gill net length frequency distribution shows that a good proportion of the catch consisted of younger fish in the 5 to 6-inch length group that will grow to acceptable sizes in a few years as well as a good proportion of fish in the 9 to 11.5-inch length groups that currently support the Black Crappie fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2018 survey were Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a 537-acre lake, located 25 miles east of Clearbrook in Clearwater County. A targeted survey was completed on Balm Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2023 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. All 14 sites were sampled with seine and backpack electrofishing. A total of 11 species were sampled, which included 4 species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter and Rock Bass) captured that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2023 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Balm Lake. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nIn coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Upper/Lower Red Lake Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balm Lake is a 537-acre lake with a maximum depth of 33 feet located 25 miles northwest of the city of Bemidji. A public water access with concrete ramp and parking for 10 trucks with trailers is located on the northeast corner of the lake off County Highway 32. Currently there is a special regulation for Largemouth Bass consisting of a protected slot limit from 14 to 20 inches with 1 fish allowed over 20 inches. Statewide regulations apply to all other species. Balm Lake is managed primarily for Bluegill, Walleye, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. This report outlines findings in the most recent standard survey in the summer of 2023. <br> \n <br> \nOverall lengths of Largemouth Bass ranged from over 5 to just short of 18 inches. The gill-net catch in particular had a rate of 8 bass/net which is substantially higher than most lakes in the area. Reproduction appears to be consistently successful due to the number of year classes represented in the survey. Exceptionally high bass abundance has been cause for concern and was possibly impacting growth rates so the protected slot was relaxed from 12-20 to 14-20 inches in 2018 to allow for more harvest opportunity of small to medium sized bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Bluegill trap-net catch rate of 17 fish is average compared to similar Minnesota lakes. Bluegill over 9 inches in length were captured in the survey with a very good portion of the catch achieving lengths over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBalm Lake is planned for walleye fingerling stocking every other year, but recently has had older fish stocked as well.The Walleye gill-net catch rate was just over 6 fish/net in 2023 which placed it in the upper range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Walleye had a good average size of 14.7 inches in length and 1.1 lbs./fish. The largest Walleye captured was over 25 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are not overly abundant in Balm Lake but many achieve quality sizes. The 2023 gill-net catch rate of just under 3 fish per net was below the normal range of catch rates for similar lakes. Northern Pike had a good average size of 24.5 inches and fish over 33 inches in length were captured in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates are rarely high in mid-summer surveys but a decent number were captured in deeper net sets with lengths recorded up to nearly 11 inches. The catch rate of almost 6 fish/gill net in those sets was much higher than similar area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2023 survey were Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
