Three age classes were sampled with ages 2 and 3 making up most of the catch. Black crappie abundance is also high (29.8/trap net). Age 3 fish dominated the three age classes sampled. Growth is good for both bluegills and crappies. The pumpkinseed (5.5/trap net), hybrid sunfish (4.3/trap net) and green sunfish (0.5/trap net) catches was about average for area lakes. Yellow perch numbers (2/gillnet) were below average for this area. Bowfin (0.8/trap net) and yellow bullheads (5.3/ trap net) have average abundance, while brown bullheads (0.3/trap net) have low abundance compared to their local median.</p>",
