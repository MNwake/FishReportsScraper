Bluegill were abundant with one-fifth of the fish of acceptable size to anglers.  Black crappie numbers were moderate, higher than in previous nettings.   Fish were small, less than 9 inches in length.  Yellow perch were moderate in number with fish under 8 inches.  Previous nettings found low numbers of perch.  Northern pike were fair in number with several fish over 24 inches.  Largemouth bass numbers appear to be moderate with numbers of young fish captured.  Electrofishing was not done to assess the adult population.  Yellow bullhead numbers were fair with a tenth of the fish over 12 inches.  One carp was captured.</p>",

Shore access is limited to the boat access area. The most abundant species of fish present in the lake are bluegills. Although they are plentiful they are small. The average size is only 5.3 inches in length. Only 5% of the bluegills sampled were over 7 inches. Northern pike were found in average abundance and averaged 22.8 inches in length. Black crappies were sampled in low numbers and small size. Only one black crappie exceeding 10 inches in length was sampled. Largemouth bass arenot sampled effectively in trap nets or gill nets. This is reflected in the low numbers captured in this survey. Lake Wabasso has had a history of good largemouth bass fishing.       </p>",

Black crappie are low in numbers.  Black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish all appear present in expected numbers for lakes in this area.  Yellow perch, taken in low numbers in 1975 were not taken in 1980.  Northern pike numbers are significantly higher in 1980 than in 1975.  The II annulus fish were most abundant which corresponds to the 1978 stocking.  Their growth rate was fast.  Both black crappie and bluegill numbers appear to be lower than in 1975.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As compared with the statewide figures, the net catches are as follows: (1) There were above average catches of northern pike and bluegills; (2) Near average catches of pumpkinseeds and green sunfish; and (3) Below average catches of common suckers, brown bullheads, yellow bullheads, and black crappies.  The growth rate of the northern pike was above average, the growth rate of the pumpkinseeds was about average, and the growth rate of the bluegills was below average when compared with the statewide figures.Wabasso Lake covers a total area of 46.4 acres, has a maximum depth of 66 feet, and a median depth of 9 feet.  About 60% of the lake area is shallower than 15 feet.  There are no inlet or outlet streams present.  The bottom soil along 75% of the shoreline is composed of muck, and sand overlaid with silt is common along the remaining shoreline.The Secchi disc reading of 18 feet indicated that the water in Wabasso Lake is quite clear and colorless.  Chemical analysis of the lake water indicated that Wabasso Lake is a hard-water lake, and dissolved oxygen testing indicated that during the summer months the dissolved oxygen content below the thermocline is too low to support warm-water fish.  Submerged aquatic plants were very abundant to a depth of about 10 feet, and emergent aquatic plants were moderately abundant along the shoreline at the time of the survey.About 78% of the total number of fish taken in the test nets were bluegills.  Northern pike were also taken in good numbers in the test nets.  The growth rate of the northern pike was above average, and the growth rate of the bluegills was below average when compared with the statewide figures.  The shoreline seining indicated good natural reproduction in 1959 for largemouth bass.  Local residents reported that summer angling for panfish and winter darkhouse spearing for northern pike has been good during the past years.  There is a county-owned public access to the lake and a picnic area along the south shoreline of the lake.</p>",

Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled in Lake Wabasso, although catches were significantly lower than in previous surveys.  Bluegills were sampled at 9.63 fish/net in the trap nets, down from 54.33 fish/net in 2005 and 77.22 fish/net in 2000.  The avergae numer of Bluegill in the trapnets was between the 1st and 2nd quartiles for class 30 lakes.  The average size Bluegill sampled in 2015 was 6.29 inches with individuals up to 8.15 inches.  Black Crappies were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.5 fish/net, and averaged 7.86 inches with individuals up to 10.5 inches.  33% of sampled Black Crappies were 9 inches or larger.  Anglers fishing Lake Wabasso should find fewer but larger Bluegills than in 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nNight time electrofishing sampled 13 Largemouth Bass at a rate of 18.57 fish/hr of on-time.  This was the first time that night time electrofishing has been conducted on Lake Wabasso.  Mean length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2015 was 11.75 inches with bass up to 15 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at 8.5 fish/gillnet, which is above the 3rd quartile for class 30 lakes.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in gillnets in 2015 was 18.8 inches and the largest Northern Pike was 22.48 inches.  Northern Pike in Lake Wabasso appear to be more abundant but of smaller size than in 2005 and 2000. <br> \n </p>",
