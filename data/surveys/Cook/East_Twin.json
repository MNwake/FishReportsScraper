Although walleye as large as 25.5 inches were taken, most were smaller than 14 inches.  All of the walleye collected in 2005 had been produced naturally, but growth rates had been slow by area standards.  Slow growth was the result of limited forage.  No yellow perch were present, and walleye had to compete with a dense white sucker population for the invertebrate forage base.As has usually been the case in this lake, only walleye and white sucker were taken in standard sampling gear.  Creek chub were also present, with fair numbers taken in 1/4-in-mesh trap nets.</p>",

The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, and several year classes were represented in the 1999 catch.  Although the 1999 walleye catch was very high for a lake of this class, it was still the lowest ever observed in this lake, historically.  Older walleye exhibited relatively slow growth, probably due to their invertebrate diet, and competition for invertebrates from white sucker.</p>",
