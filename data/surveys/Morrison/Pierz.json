                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch was high and the fish are of average size and growth rate when compared to the lake class medians.  No year class was dominant but ages did correspond to stocking records.  Northern pike numbers are average for this type of lake with normal growth rates and above average size fish.  The largemouth bass catches were above the third quartile in numbers, but netted size was small.  One and two year old bass were predominant and had normal growth.  Electrofishing is needed to document the largemouth bass population size structure.  Black crappie were caught in gillnets and seine hauls.  The gillnet catch was average for this lake class.  They were of average size and growth rate.  The 1989 year class is largest.  Yellow perch numbers showed a high population of average sized fish made up of mostly 2 year olds.  The bluegill catch was 10 times higher than the last survey.  Compared to lake class medians the population is high and fish small.  Two and five year olds make up the largest share of the fish caught.  Pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass are also present.  Medians show average size populations of small fish for this lake class.  All three species of bullhead are present.  One black bullhead was caught in a gillnet, the trapnet catch for yellow bullhead indicate an average size population and brown bullhead a low population.  Carp were only sampled in gillnets.  The average size was large and the numbers average for this lake class.  White suckers are average sized in an average population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierz Fish Lake supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers including largemouth bass, bluegill, walleye, northern pike, and black crappies.  The primary fish management for the lake is focused on largemouth bass.  A special regulation imposing a 12-inch maximum size limit for bass began in 1997.  Intent of the regulation was to improve growth rates while increasing the number of large bass by encouraging harvest of the slow-growing small bass.  Submergent vegetation beds consisting primarily of coontail, northern water milfoil, and wild celery were most abundant in the shallow water bays at each end of the lake.  Filamentous algae was also common in the bays clinging to plants.  Purple loosestrife as well as curled pondweed are two exotic plants that are abundant on both the east and west side of the lake.  Weevils have been introduced to help control the spread of the purple loosestrife.    While species diversity was still good during the survey, net catches seemed to be lower than ususal.  Lake survey gear typically is not efficient at sampling bass with better estimates of the population obtained through electrofishing or ice-out trapnetting.  The bass that were seen in the lake survey, however, displayed a wide range of sizes from 8 inches up to 19 inches.  Panfish such as bluegills and black crappies probably draw most of the anglers to the lake.  Pierz Fish has a reputation of good crappie and bluegill fishing early in the spring in the bays.  Most of the crappies seen in the survey were less than 9 inches in length, however one ten-inch crappie was measured indicating the lake can produce bigger crappies.  Some nice size bluegills over 7 inches were also observed, but most anglers catch smaller bluegills.      Northern pike abundance was down from the last survey which is desirable for most lakes.  Since walleye stocking sustains the fishery for Pierz Fish, it is desirable to have lower pike numbers to increase walleye fingerling survival.  Several year classes of walleye were seen in the survey which indicates that stocking has contributed to the walleye population.  Average size of the walleye caught was 1.3 pounds, while the northern pike averaged almost 3 pounds apiece.  Yellow perch numbers showed a decrease from the last survey which could effect gamefish growth and survival of the walleye fingerlings.  Most of the perch were small by fishermens standards being under 7 inches in length.    Other species in the fish community included bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, brown bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullheads.  Carp are commonly seen in the shallow west bay in early spring and are popular with bow hunters.  Quality yellow bullheads up to 14 inches were observed along with fish up to 11 inches in the other bullhead species.  Smallmouth bass, white crappies, and channel catfish are some other fish species that have been documented in past surveys.    With the close proxity to Pierz and Genola and the amount of shoreline development, Pierz Fish Lake has heavy recreational use.  Swimming, jet skiing, recreational boating, and fishing are common.  Best shoreline and watershed management practices are encouraged to protect water quality and fish habitat.         </p>",

Compared to other lakes in the area northern pike numbers remain fairly low at 4.33 per gillnet lift.  Carp are present but are not at problem levels.  White suckers are present at the same level as 1980 and just over statewide averages.  Yellow bullheads dominate, blacks are present but no browns were recorded on the last two surveys.  Bluegill catches were about 1/2 the 1980 catches but a seine haul (NRC using 400' x 12'x 1/4\" seine) captured very large numbers of bluegills of all sizes.  Largemouth bass are present in very good numbers as shown in both the 1983 and 1985 NRC's.  One adult smallmouth bass was caught in the year's NRC.  Black crappies are present in average numbers and size.  They showed up very well in the NRC.  The yellow perch catch was down from 1980, but still was almost 5 times the state average.  Good catches were also recorded in the NRC.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Panfish, especially bluegill, are much sought after on Pierz Fish Lake.   A panfish assessment was conducted in June to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  Summer surveys typically do not sample many of the larger fish.   Six standard lake survey nets were set with two nets reset in the same location the following day, two moved to new locations, and two removed for a total of ten lifts.  Scales were taken from black crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.  Bluegill were the only species to be subsampled in the assessment.  All bluegill over seven inches were measured, so the length frequency distribution reflects the exact number caught over seven inches. <br> \n     The 2011 panfish assessment sampled 85 black crappies ranging from 4.6 to 9.8 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 9 - 9.5 inches and 40% (n=34) were more than nine inches in length.   The previous panfish assessment for Pierz Fish Lake was in 2005.  Sixty-five  crappie between 5.1 and 10.6 inches in length were netted.  Mean length (8.1 inches) was slightly better than results from 2011, but modal length was shorter, 7 - 7.5 inches, and only 23% (n=15) of the fish exceeded nine inches in length.   <br> \n     Ages 2 through 4 were represented in the 2011 black crappie catch.  Age 2 fish showed normal growth and the two older age groups fast growth.  The absence of crappie over Age 4 suggests high mortality once the fish reach nine inches, a length acceptable to most anglers and/or poor reproduction before 2007. <br> \n     Summer lake survey gill nets in three surveys have caught between 13 and 17 crappie and the summer trap nets from 20 to 30 crappie.  The gill nets have produced the largest individuals caught with crappie up to 12 inches measured (1996).  Fish exceeding nine inches have comprised up to 18% (n=3 of 17) of the sample.  The biggest crappie caught in the summer trap nets was 9.6 inches and only one fish in both 2008 and 1996 exceeded nine inches.  None of the crappie in the 2002 trap net catch were over nine inches.  All of summer survey catch rates were within their respective interquartile ranges. <br> \n     Ice-out assessments conducted on Pierz Fish Lake, which would be an earlier timeframe than this assessment, have produced some highly variable catches of black crappie, ranging from 67 in 1999 to 1,834 in 1997.  The longest crappie caught in the four ice-out assessment was 10.4 inches and few of the fish have been over nine inches.   The highest proportion of fish over nine inches in an ice-out assessment was 5% in 2004. <br> \n     The 2011 panfish assessment netted 934 bluegill between 3 and 8.1 inches in length with a mean length of 5.7 inches.  Modal length of the fish was 5.5 - 6 inches and 10% (n=93) were more than seven inches in length.  The size structure of the 2005 bluegill catch was more desirable.  The 562 bluegill caught ranged from 2.8 to 8.9 inches in length with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Modal length was 6 - 6.5 inches with 31% (n=175) of the fish more than seven inches in length.   <br> \n     Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the 2011 bluegill sample.  All of the age groups exhibited fast growth.  Year class strengths suggest consistent reproduction and angler harvest once the fish reach seven inches, a length acceptable to most anglers.    <br> \n     Summer trap nets have produced few bluegill over seven inches in Pierz Fish Lake except in 2002 when 11% of the trap net catch (n=23/205) exceeded seven inches.  The other two surveys, 2008 and 1996, had catches where only 2 to 4 percent of the trap net fish were over seven inches in length.   Summer gill nets, however, have had up to 50% of the catch over seven inches (16 of 32 bluegill in 2002).  Forty-one percent (n=9) of the 2008 gill net catch (n=22) and 19% (n=4) of the 1996 gill net catch (n=21) were more than seven inches in length. <br> \n     Ice-out assessments on Pierz Fish have produced some high catches of bluegill, 1,063 in 1999 and 1,832 in 1997 and some larger individuals up to 8.6 inches have been measured as well.  However, the portion of the catch exceeding seven inches has been much lower than that from the panfish assessments.  Portions of the catches measuring over seven inches have ranged from 3% in 1999 to 11% in 1997 ice-out assessments.   <br> \n     Gamefish caught in the 2011 panfish assessment included three largemouth bass between 5.6 and 16.3 inches, three northern pike between 21.8 and 31.5 inches and four walleye between 7.7 inches and 26.2 inches.  Other panfish species caught were hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Additional species included bowfin, common carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n     The different gear types and time of year all show different aspects of the panfish populations in Pierz Fish Lake.  Panfish assessments can capture good numbers of both black crappie and bluegill and have a significant portion of the catches exceed lengths acceptable to most anglers.  Ice-out assessments also can produce large catches, but the panfish samples tend to be dominated by smaller fish.  Although summer gill nets tend to have smaller sample sizes, the fish caught have been some of the largest individuals documented for the species and larger fish comprise more of the catch for that species.  Summer trap nets have occasionally caught some larger bluegill, but for the most part, the catches are dominated by smaller bluegill and crappie.   <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierz Lake (DOW# 49-0024-00; Lake Class 31) is a 189 acre lake located near Genola, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southwest Shore. Pierz Lake has 3.25 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 34 feet. Pierz Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class generally have very hard water, and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance was up compared to previous years and met management goals. Size structure was down with fish only up to 17 inches sampled. Anglers are encouraged to harvest Largemouth Bass less than 14 inches in length as small bass are overabundant in Pierz Fish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Pierz Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierz Lake was surveyed August 10-12, 2020 using six gill nets, mainly to evaluate the status of Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch fisheries. At this time, Walleyes are being sustained through successful stocking operations, pike have maintained low abundance (beneficial) and perch abundance has remained below desired levels.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Management Plan for Pierz Lake is to maintain a Walleye population supported by a gill net catch rate of three or more Walleyes per net. Currently, the catch rate is 4.5 fish/net, higher than the 2002-2014 average of 2.5 fish/gill net. Most of the Walleyes captured in 2020 were 20-inches or larger and about five years of age and older. These data suggest that fingerling stockings in 2013 and 2015 were successful. Good numbers of 10-12 inch Walleye were also observed indicating survival from fryling stocking in 2019. The future stocking strategy will be to continue stocking fingerlings on an every-other-year basis.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is consistently low compared to other Area lakes, however this is good news for other predator species such as Walleye and bass. All three prey on Yellow Perch however, pike are the most voracious. Typically, lakes with fewer numbers of small pike have more desirable populations of other gamefish. Pike size structure in Pierz is also better than most other lakes in the area. Gill nets in 2020 captured two 32-inch pike. As a small lake, there may only be a handful of pike over 30 inches at any one time so it's important to release the largest pike if caught. This will help to ensure future quality fishing experiences and potentially provide benefits to the entire fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nNetting and electrofishing efforts continue to indicate that bass are abundant including a few Smallmouth. Currently Pierz Lake has a special Largemouth Bass regulation requiring the release of all bass measuring 14-20 inches, with on over 20 inches allowed.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance is low but they appear to holding their own mainly because pike and Walleye abundance are being maintained at sustainable levels. Because perch are so important in our lakes, we'd like to see an increase in their numbers however, stocking them to augment their abundance is expensive and is not effective based on our literature.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Pierz Fish Lake is a multi-recreational lake near the cities of Pierz and Genola.  In the summer time, the lake is a popular destination for water skiers, jet skiers, swimmers, boaters, and anglers.  The public access on the west side of the lake is also used for swimming, shore and dock fishing, as well as boat launching.  The winter fishery is primarily for bluegill and black crappie, while bowfishing for carp has gained popularity in late spring.  Shore fishing is common along the road on the west side of the lake in early spring for black crappie when the ice leaves the shallow, dark, west bay.  Purple loosestrife as well as curled pondweed are exotic plants that are abundant on both the east and west side of the lake.  Weevils were introduced to help control the spread of the purple loosestrife.  The City of Pierz also treats the lake every summer with copper sulfate to help control swimmer's itch. <br> \n     The lake also supports additional fish species that attract anglers to the lake such as largemouth bass, walleye, and northern pike.  The primary fish management species for Pierz Fish Lake is largemouth bass.  The lake has a regulation requiring all bass 12 inches and larger must be immediately released, with one over 20 inches allowed in possession.  Survey results suggest that Pierz Fish Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population with some of the highest survey catches in the area.  While anglers have the opportunity to catch trophy size bass, most of the bass caught in the survey catches were less than 12 inches in length.   Smallmouth bass were also documented in the lake, but numbers appear low.   <br> \n      Some nice black crappie and bluegill were observed in the summer survey but the majority of the fish would be considered small by most anglers.  While some 11-inch crappie were caught, most of the fish were less than 8 inches in length.  Most of the bluegill in the 2008 survey were less than 5 inches in length, however, there were some measured up to 8 inches in length.  A spring panfish assessment in 2005 also noted quality size bluegill up to almost 9 inches in length.  Other panfish species caught included pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and rock bass.   <br> \n      Northern pike abundance showed an increase since the 2002 survey but numbers remained within the normal range for this type of lake.  Average size of the pike measured in the survey was about 22 inches or just over 2 pounds.  Lower pike numbers are desirable in lakes because of their effect on the fish community.  Northern pike can have a negative effect on walleye fingerlings especially if yellow perch numbers are down.  Walleye fingerling stocking sustains the fishery for Pierz Fish Lake and is typically conducted in odd numbered years.  There was a wide range of walleye sizes noted in the summer survey with fish caught between 8 and 27 inches in length.  Abundance appeared to be within the normal range for the lake type and has remained about the same since 1996.  Yellow perch numbers have been low in the last two surveys. <br> \n      Other species in the fish community include black bullhead, bowfin or dogfish, common carp, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullhead were the most numerous of the two bullhead species but were within the normal abundance range.  Average size of both bullhead species was about 12 inches, and individuals over 13 inches were measured in both species.  Channel catfish, white crappies, and bigmouth buffalo have also been documented in past surveys. <br> \n       Pierz Fish Lake has heavy shoreline development and is a very popular lake on weekends during the summer.  Best shoreline and watershed management practices are encouraged to protect water quality and fish habitat, as well are reduce shoreline erosion. <br> \n        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Pierz Fish Lake in June to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Panfish, especially Bluegill, are much sought after on Pierz Fish Lake and summer trap nets typically do not reveal the quality that can be present.   A lake survey with gill nets was conducted later in August to evaluate the game fish populations.   Earlier spring panfish assessments were conducted in 2011 and 2005.  Ice-out assessments were done in 2004, 1999, 1997, and 1995, but the focus was on Largemouth Bass. <br> \n       Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice in June of 2014.  Some Bluegill were observed on nests during the assessment.   A total of 446 Bluegill were netted with most of the fish being measured and scales collected for age and growth evaluation.   The length distribution ranged from 3.6 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 7 - 7.5 inches and 36% (n=163) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 4% (n=19) more than eight inches in length.  <br> \n       Ages 2 through 9 were represented in the 2014 panfish assessment Bluegill sample.  Two year classes, 2008 and 2009, accounted for 53% and 28% of the catch, respectively.  All age classes displayed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Relative abundance and age data suggest high mortality after six years of age.  <br> \n       The 2011 spring panfish assessment netted 934 Bluegill.  Due to the larger sample size, the measured fish were a subsampled.  However, all Bluegill over seven inches were measured so the length frequency distribution reflected the exact number of fish larger than seven inches.   Bluegill between 2.9 and 8.1 inches in length were measured.  Smaller fish dominated the catch as mean length was only 5.7 inches and modal length 5.5 - 6 inches.  Ten percent (n=93) of the fish were more than seven inches in length and only one fish exceeded eight inches. <br> \n       Fewer Bluegill were caught in the 2005 spring panfish assessment.   The 2005 catch had a more desirable sample size structure than that shown in the 2011 assessment but not as good as in 2014, other than the proportion of fish over eight inches.   A total of 562 Bluegill were netted that ranged from 2.8 to 8.9 inches in length.  Mean length was 6.4 inches and modal length 6 - 6.5 inches.  Fish that exceeded seven inches accounted for 31% (n=175) of the sample with 7% (n=41) more than eight inches.   <br> \n       Some of the spring ice-out assessments also produced high catches of Bluegill but only a small subsample was measured and catches were dominated by small fish.  An 8.6-inch Bluegill was measured one year but mean size overall averaged about five inches for the ice-out assessments.  Modal length for most of the assessment concentrated around five inches also.  The highest portion of Bluegill to exceed seven inches was 11% in 2004 when 423 Bluegill were sampled. <br> \n       The 2014 spring panfish assessment was not as effective at sampling Black Crappie as previous spring assessments have been.   Twenty-seven crappie were netted in the 2014 spring assessment compared to 85 in 2011 and 65 in 2005.    Ice-out assessments appear to be more effective at catching higher numbers of Black Crappie.  In 2004, 173 crappie were caught with 67 fish in 1999.  The highest crappie catch was 1,834 in 1997 while 322 fish caught in 1995.   <br> \n       More desirable crappie sample size structures have been displayed in the spring panfish assessments compared to the spring ice-out assessments.   Mean size has averaged about eight inches in the panfish assessments compared to six inches in the ice-out assessments.  Crappie that exceeded nine inches have comprised a higher percent of the panfish assessments when compared to ice-out assessments.  In panfish assessments between 23 to 40% of the crappie exceeded nine inches in length compared to 4 to 9% in ice-out assessments. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2014 crappie panfish assessment catch suggesting consistent recruitment.  Most of the fish appeared to come from the 2011 (36%) and 2012 (28%) year classes.    Growth rates for most of the age groups appeared to be normal to fast when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Game fish sampled in the 2014 spring panfish assessment on Pierz Fish Lake included three Walleye between 14 and 24 inches, three Northern Pike between 14 and 24 inches, and eight Largemouth Bass from 7 to 18 inches in length.  Additional fish species caught included Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n       The different gear types and time of year all show different aspects of the panfish populations in Pierz Fish Lake.  Panfish assessments can capture respectable numbers of both Black Crappie and Bluegill and have a significant portion of the catches exceed lengths acceptable to most anglers.  Ice-out assessments also can produce large catches, but the panfish samples tend to be dominated by smaller fish.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Pierz Fish Lake is a multi-recreational lake near the cities of Pierz and Genola.  In summer time, the lake is a popular destination for water skiers, jet skiers, swimmers, boaters, and anglers.  The public access on the west side of the lake is also used for swimming, shore and dock fishing, as well as boat launching.  The winter fishery is primarily for Bluegill and Black Crappie, while bowfishing for carp has gained popularity in late spring.  Shore fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill is common along the road on the west side of the lake in early spring when the ice leaves the shallow, dark bay.  Purple loosestrife as well as curled pondweed are exotic plants that are abundant on both the east and west side of the lake.  The City of Pierz treats the lake every summer with copper sulfate to help control swimmer's itch. <br> \n     The lake supports additional fish species that attract anglers to the lake such as Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pike.  The primary fish management species for Pierz Fish Lake is Largemouth Bass.  The lake has a regulation requiring all bass 12 inches and larger must be immediately released, with one over 20 inches allowed in possession.  Survey results suggest that Pierz Fish Lake has an abundant Largemouth Bass population with some of the highest survey catches in the Little Falls Area.  While anglers have the opportunity to catch trophy size bass, most of the bass caught in the survey were less than 12 inches in length.   Smallmouth Bass were also documented in the lake, but numbers appear low.  Consideration is being given to changing the bass regulation to a protected slot between 14 and 20 inches with one over 20 inches.   <br> \n      While few Black Crappie and Bluegill were caught in the summer survey, a spring assessment conducted in early June produced a better sample although the majority of fish caught would be considered small by most anglers.  Crappie under nine inches in length were common, but there were fish up to 11 inches caught.  Medium size Bluegill, six to eight inches, were common in the spring assessment with a few fish over eight inches observed.  Other panfish species in Pierz Fish Lake include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Rock Bass.   <br> \n      Northern Pike abundance appears to have gone down since the last survey in 2008 and is considered low for this type of lake.  Average size of the pike measured in the survey was about 24 inches or around three pounds.  Lower pike numbers are desirable in most lakes due to their effects on the fish community.  Northern Pike can have a negative effect on Walleye fingerlings through predation especially if Yellow Perch numbers are down.  Walleye fingerling stocking sustains the fishery for Pierz Fish Lake and is typically conducted in odd-numbered years.  Average size for the Walleye in the summer survey was 15 - 16 inches which is considered a good \"eater\" by many anglers.  Abundance appeared to be within the normal range for the lake type and has remained about the same since 1996.  Yellow Perch numbers continue to be low and have been in the last three surveys. <br> \n      Other species in the fish community include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin or Dogfish, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   While Bigmouth Buffalo may look similar to Common Carp, they are native to Minnesota.  Channel Catfish and White Crappies have also been documented in past surveys.  One new fish species that was sampled in Pierz Fish Lake while conducting nearshore sampling was Burbot or Eelpout.  All Burbot observed were young of the year indicating the presence of adult fish.  <br> \n       Pierz Fish Lake has dense shoreline development and is a very popular lake on weekends during the summer.  Best shoreline and watershed management practices are encouraged to protect water quality and fish habitat, as well are reduce shoreline erosion. <br> \n        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pierz Fish Lake supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers includingwalleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappies, and largemouth bass.  The primaryfish management for the lake is focused on largemouth bass.  A special regulationimposing a 12-inch maximum size limit will begin on May 31, 1997.  The high basspopulation and the slow growth of small bass suggest harvest of these fish mayallow for increased growth rates.  Angler reports indicate that some bass reachtrophy size (up to 6 lbs.) showing the lake's potential to produce large bass. Increasing protection of all bass over 12 inches should result in more fishattaining preferred or trophy size.  Walleye numbers appear normal for the laketype and size ranged from 15 to 25 inches.  The northern pike population hasremained relatively stable since 1985.  The sampled fish grew fast and averaged 3.2pounds.  Many of the anglers using the lake are seeking the panfish present there. The lake's black crappies and bluegills on the average are small, however, crappiesover 12 inches and bluegills exceeding 6 inches may be found.  Yellow perch numbersindicate low abundance.  Neascus, a small black grub in the skin, was observed onhalf the sampled walleye and perch.  The non-game fish community includes bowfin,carp, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Carp are seen inthe shallow west bay during spring spawning and harvested by archery methods. Yellow bullhead numbers appear normal for the lake type and the fish averaged abouttwelve inches.  Pierz Fish Lake is used by locals for swimming and recreational boating.  Awarenessof special regulation needs to be promoted and stressed to encourage compliance. Best lakeshore management and watershed use practices are encouraged to protectwater quality and fish habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed June 8-14 to assess size structure of Bluegill and Black Crappie. Previous spring trap netting occurred in 2005, 2011 and 2014. In 2020, sampling was canceled due to Covid 19 restrictions. General observations suggest Bluegill and crappie size structure may be increasing as proportions of larger fish sampled have trended upward since 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 265 Bluegills were caught, average size was 6.5 inches and maximum length was 8.9 inches. Thirty percent of the catch exceeded 7 inches and seven percent exceeded 8 inches. There were no Bluegill over 9 inches caught. Percentages of fish over 7 and 8 inches in 2014 were similar, however, since 2005 spring trap net samples have trended toward higher percentages of larger fish.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 63 crappies were caught, average length was 9.8 inches and maximum length was 11.9 inches. Sixty-two percent of the sample exceeded 10 inches. This compares to 2014 data in which 22 percent of the sample exceeded 10 inches. Spring trap netting has never sampled any crappies measuring 12 inches or greater. Similar to Bluegills, crappie size structure 2005-2022 is trending upward. <br> \n <br> \nGrowth analysis of Bluegills and crappies find that both species grow better in Pierz-Fish Lake compared to recent averages documented from other lakes in the Little Falls Management Area. The presence of larger panfish, particularly Black Crappie coupled with impressive growth characteristics suggest Pierz-Fish Lake has the potential to produce high-quality angling opportunities. Future management planning will consider these data in developing strategies to maintain and/or improve populations toward higher numbers of larger fish.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during this survey included Pumpkinseed (5.5-inch average size) and several large, Bigmouth Buffalo which are plankton feeders and native to Minnesota.   <br> \n</p>",
