One possible reason is undetected winterkill conditions.  Largemouth bass and bluegill young of the year were found in shoreline seining.</p>",

Recent management efforts on Holland Lake have focused on attempting to establish a 2 \u0013story fishery that supports the periodic stocking of stream trout species. Two adult Brown Trout (BNT) averaging 21.32\" TL and 4.08 pounds were captured during this survey. These fish were surplus brood stock that had been culled from the state hatchery system and stocked the previous Fall to provide a put-and-take fishery. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled below the median levels for abundance and above the median level for mean weight in 2007. The average size NOP captured was approximately 22.6 inches and 2.8 pounds. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled in the highest abundance of any species during this survey. The trap net catch rate for BLG was the highest ever recorded for this lake, but no individuals larger than 5.7 inches in length were captured. The average size for sampled BLG is 4.5 inches and 0.05 pounds (19.5 fish/lb). Growth rates for NOP and BLG were found to be below average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population of this lake primarily consists of Northern Pike, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass. Recent management efforts on Holland Lake have focused on attempting to establish a 2 story fishery that supports the periodic stocking of stream trout species. Brown Trout have been observed in previous surveys but none were captured during this survey. When present these fish are surplus brood stock culled from the state hatchery system and stocked in the  fall to provide a put-and-take winter fishery. Northern Pike were sampled well above the median levels for abundance and at the median level for mean weight in 2013. The average size NOP captured was approximately 20.78 inches and 2.78 pounds. Bluegills were sampled in the highest abundance of any species during this survey. The trap net catch rate for Bluegill was the highest ever recorded for this lake, but the average size is small with only 23 individuals out of total of 397 (6%) larger than 6.0 inches in length being captured. Growth rates for Northern Pike and Bluegill were found to be below average when compared to statewide averages. Other panfish seen during this survey were Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, each of which was also sampled in their highest abundance ever. These other panfish were found to be small in size and have poor to slow growth for lakes similar to Holland Lake. Six Largemouth Bass were observed in the sampling gear, these fish had an average length of 12.36 inches and an average weight of 1.42 lbs. Some other fish seen in during this survey were Black Crappie which were observed in low numbers and were of small size and Green Sunfish which were also not very numerous and small in size.</p>",

Three largemouth were sampled, one of acceptable size to anglers.  One black bullhead was captured, down from previous nettings.</p>",

This may be a result of lower water levels as a result of recent drought conditions.  Growth of pike was average for the area.  Golden shiners were abundant.  Bluegill were sampled in average numbers, but were of small average size.  Bluegill abundance has remained stable for several investigations.  Hybrid sunfish were sampled at higher than state and local median levels.  Black bullheads were sampled at above local median levels and were small in size.  Higher numbers of small largemouth bass were sampled in gillnets.  Three largemouth bass year classes were sampled which exhibited average growth for the region.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population of Holland Lake has primarily consisted of northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass. Northern pike were sampled above median levels for abundance in gill nets and at the highest catch rate ever observed. The average northern pike sampled was 22.24 inches in length and 2.95 pounds. Thirty-one percent of the gill net sample of northern pike was 26.0 inches or larger. Overall growth rates were near average for this species. Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled above median levels for abundance in trap nets and at the highest catch rates ever observed. The average size of sampled bluegill was 4.9 inches in length and 0.08 pounds. Only 8.1% of all bluegill captured were 6.0 inches or longer. Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged only 4.22 inches in length. Two small largemouth bass yearlings and no adults were sampled during this assessment. Recent management efforts for this lake have attempted to develop a two-story fish population by stocking brown and rainbow trout. Adult brown trout broodstock culls have been stocked here since 1998. Yearling rainbow and brown trout have also been stocked since 2000. No trout were captured during the 2001 netting assessment.   </p>",
