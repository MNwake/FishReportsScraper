Present fish population is made up predominantly of walleye (10.2/gillnet) about 6\" to 7\" in length, northern pike (6.2/gillnet) from 9\" to 26\", and perch (46.83/gillnet) between 5\" and 10\" in length.  No carp were sampled at this assessment.  Black bullheads were netted at 36/gillnet.\n</p>",

Large numbers of walleye fry have been stocked and have shown good growth.  There is a good population of 1/2 pound to 1 pound walleye.  Spawning is very limited for walleye.  There is a small bluegill population being below the state and local averages for number of fish present.  There is a large number of carp in Peterson as compared to other lakes in the area.  The carp average about 15 inches.  There are fair numbers of black bullheads though they are below the local average.   <br> \n</p>",
