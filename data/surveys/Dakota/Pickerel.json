                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 90-acre, class 37 lake located in the Mississippi River floodplain in Lilydale. The lake lies entirely within the Lilydale/Harriet Island Regional Park.  During flood events the Mississippi River inundates this shallow, heavily-vegetated basin. Flooding has occurred as recently as the summer of 2010.  Maximum depth is 11 feet, but most of the lake is five to six feet deep. The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped and The City of St. Paul has operated a winter aeration system (since 2005) near the carry-in boat access. Shore fishing is available along the northwest side of the lake and at some locations along the railroad tracks to north and east sides of the lake, the carry-in access is also available (electric motor only). Summertime vegetation often becomes very thick and may interfere with angling. <br> \nThe most abundant fish seen in 2015 were Gizzard Shad these fish are most likely the result of river flooding events that allowed Gizzard Shad to colonize Pickerel Lake. Panfish such as Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Green and Hybrid Sunfish were not found in great abundance during this survey. All these species were observed in below average numbers for lakes similar to Pickerel. Northern Pike were also seen in below average numbers. One bright spot for Pickerel Lake was the above average occurrence of Yellow Perch which was the most ever recorded for Pickerel Lake. One 19.7 inch long Channel Catfish was caught in the gill net.  Other fish sampled in low abundance in 2015 were, Golden Shiner (N=6), Bowfin (N=3), Common Carp (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=1), Freshwater Drum (N=1), and Silver Redhorse (N=1).  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

During flood events the Mississippi River inundates this shallow, heavily-vegetated basin.  Flooding occurred in summer of 2010.  The City of St. Paul operates a winter aeration system near the carry-in boat access.  A fish contaminant analysis was scheduled but dropped due to completion of fish contaminant sampling in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to time and staff constraints, only electrofishing, in conjunction with state fair fish collection, was conducted to assess the fish community in 2010.  Largemouth bass lengths and weights were taken and a species observed list was created while electrofishing.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at low to moderate densities (21.0 bass/hr).  Five of the seven fish sampled were immature and between 4.5 and 6.0 inches.  Two adult bass measured approximately 14.0 inches and 1.6 pounds.     <br> \n <br> \nNumerous bluegill, common carp, two northern pike, three bowfin, and one black crappie measuring nearly 11 inches were also observed.  <br> \n</p>",
