                "narrative": "<p>Reaching depths over 40 feet, Powers Lake is a deep, 54-acre lake located within the city of Woodbury. Powers Lake is sharply thermally stratified during the summer months with little or no oxygen below 17 feet in most summers and has abundant aquatic vegetation, the vast majority of which is the invasive species Eurasian watermilfoil. The presence of Eurasian watermilfoil helps form a distinct weed line that provides cover for all fishes. Other plants occasionally observed were curly leaf pondweed, coontail and Canada waterweed (elodea). Aquatic vegetation grows out past the 15 foot contour line due to the clear water conditions observed in Powers Lake. The MN DNR's Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program is actively involved in managing the diverse sport fish populations of Powers Lake.  Powers Lake Park provides an open-air shelter with restrooms, grills, and 8 picnic tables plus access to a walking trail, canoe access, and fishing pier.  Electric motors are also permitted.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye and yellow perch.  Woodbury Rotary Club purchased and stocked 2,000 yearling walleyes in April 2007.  <br> \n      <br> \nOriginating from the 2007 private stocking, one age-5 walleye measuring 20.28 inches and weighing 3.2 lbs. was sampled in the gill net.  Walleyes were sampled in low numbers (1 to 3 per survey) in 1984, 1992, 1997 and 2007 and also in 2012. Northern pike and largemouth bass inhabit Powers Lake in varying numbers.  Northern pike averaged 2.86 lbs and 21.37 inches, are abundant and of small size.  Very few sampled pike exceeded 24.0 inches, with only three fish measuring greater than that.  In order to properly sample the largemouth bass population, daytime electrofishing was conducted and thirty-six largemouth bass averaging 8.23 inches and 0.7 lb were sampled at high abundance (CPUE = 167 bass/hr on-time).   Of the 36 largemouth bass sampled via electrofishing 8 were young of the year. Consistent with an abundant bass population, the Powers Lake largemouth bass population consists of smaller but more numerous individuals.  Although Powers Lake young bass population primarily consists of two to three year old bass, several bass longer than18.0 inches were sampled.       <br> \n <br> \nPowers Lake offers a diverse panfish community consisting of bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Of the 185 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 48% were greater than 6.0 inches with a few fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  In 2012 all of the crappies sampled were less than 8.0 inches, and 7 crappies were less than 6.0 inches.  Black crappie average length was 4.02 inches with the largest crappie measuring 7.8 inches. Yellow perch numbers (13.0/gill net) were well above catches from the 1997 and 2007 population assessment (0.5/gill net) and (5.5/gillnet) respectively.  Perch over 7.0 inches were sampled using both gill and trap nets and had an average size approximately 7.96 inches.  Hybrid sunfish (N=6) and pumpkinseeds (N=3) were sampled in very low numbers.  Prior to 2007, bullheads were frequently observed net catches, none were sampled during this survey.  Other fish species found in 2007 and not observed in 2012 were white suckers which were sampled in gill nets. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Angling on Powers Lake is primarily done from shore.  The City of Woodbury owns the entire shoreline and is building a walking path around the lake, which should provide additional shore angling opportunity.  Boat access for small craft is also possible at the northwest corner of the lake.  This access point is to be blocked as the walking path is constructed, but carry in access will still be available, with parking.  There is an electric motor only restriction.Bluegill are the most abundant game species in Powers Lake, but are small, with an average length of 5 inches.  Northern pike are present in low to moderate numbers, with an average length of 25 inches.  Neascus (black spot) was found in about one third of the northern pike.  Black crappie, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish are all present in low to moderate numbers, but small size.  Black crappies averaged 7 inches with none over 8 inches.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers in 1997 and past surveys.  Walleye size was from 17 to 28 inches.  Largemouth bass are also present.  They were sampled in low numbers, but their population is probably higher than sampling suggests because the gear used does not adequately sample them.  Anglers have reported successful largemouth bass fishing.  Black bullhead were found in low numbers, but size was large - average length of 14 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reaching depths over 40 feet, Powers Lake is a deep, 54-acre lake located within the city of Woodbury. Powers Lake sharply thermally stratifies during the summer months with little or no oxygen below 17 feet in most summers, while having abundant aquatic vegetation, the vast majority of which is the invasive species Eurasian watermilfoil. The presence of Eurasian watermilfoil helps form a distinct weed line that provides cover for all fishes. Other plants occasionally observed were curly leaf pondweed, coontail and Canada waterweed (elodea). Aquatic vegetation grows out past the 15 foot contour line due to the clear water conditions observed in Powers Lake. The MN DNR's Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program is actively involved in managing the diverse sport fish populations of Powers Lake.  Powers Lake Park provides an open-air shelter with restrooms, grills, and 8 picnic tables plus access to a walking trail, canoe access, and a fishing pier.  Electric motors are also permitted. The Woodbury Rotary Club purchased and stocked 2,000 yearling walleyes in April 2007. The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Walleye and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nMost likely originating from a 2007 private stocking, two Walleye measuring 21.6 and 22.0 inches were sampled in the trap nets.  Walleyes have been sampled in low numbers (1 to 3 per survey) in 1984, 1992, 1997 and 2007.  According to the 1997 survey, Walleyes observed in past surveys are likely individuals of stocking or migration from nearby walleye rearing pond Markgrafs Lake.  Northern Pike averaging 29 inches, were relatively abundant and of good size.  In order to properly sample the Largemouth Bass population, nighttime electrofishing was conducted, and 193 Largemouth Bass were sampled with a catch rate of 176.79/hr on-time with a mean length of 10.9 inches and a range of 4.7 to 19.4 inches.  Consistent with an abundant Largemouth Bass population, the Powers Lake population consists of average but numerous sized individuals with some better than average fish present. Powers Lake offers a diverse panfish community consisting of Bluegills, Black Crappies, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish.  Of the 211 Bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 35% were greater than 6.0 inches with a few fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  In 2022 all of the Black Crappies sampled were less than 10.0 inches, and had an average length of 7.0 inches.  Yellow perch numbers, (6.0/gill net) were average for lakes similar to Powers with an average length of 6.0 inches. Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were sampled in low numbers. Prior to 2007, bullheads were frequently observed net catches, with none being sampled during this survey.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reaching depths over 40 feet, Powers Lake is a deep, 54-acre lake located within the city of Woodbury.  Eurasian Watermilfoil is present and helps form a distinct weed line that provides cover for all fishes.  The MnDNR's Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program is actively involved in managing the diverse sport fish populations of Powers Lake.  Powers Lake Park provides an open-air shelter with restrooms, grills, and 8 picnic tables plus access to a walking trail, canoe access, and fishing pier.  Electric motors are also permitted.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye and yellow perch.  Woodbury Rotary Club purchased and stocked 2,000 yearling walleyes in April 2007.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, walleye and largemouth bass inhabit Powers Lake in varying numbers.  Originating from the 2007 private stocking, three age-1 walleyes, averaging 6.9 inches, were sampled in both gill and trap nets.  Northern pike, averaging an impressive 5.8 lb and 29.3 inches, are abundant and of good size.  All sampled pike exceeded 24.0 inches, with four fish measuring approximately 33 inches.  Fifty-five largemouth bass averaging 9.2 inches and 0.7 lb were sampled.  Although Power\u0019s young bass population primarily consisted of one to three year old bass, bass nearly 18.0 inches were sampled.       <br> \n <br> \nPowers Lake offers a diverse panfish community consisting of bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Of the 533 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 67% were below 6.0 inches with no fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  Only 20% of crappies sampled were above 8.0 inches with no fish exceeding 9.0 inches.  Although yellow perch numbers (5.5/gill net) were well above catches from the 1997 population assessment (0.5/gill net), no perch over 7.5 inches were sampled using both gill and trap nets.  Averaging approximately 5.4 inches, hybrid sunfish (N=56) and pumpkinseeds (N=13) were sampled in relatively low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditionally, three white suckers averaging 18.9 inches and 3.0 pounds were sampled in gill nets.   <br> \n</p>",
