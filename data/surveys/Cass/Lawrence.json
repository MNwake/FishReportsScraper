Lawrence Lake is 224 acres, has 4.4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  Shoreline development is intensive with homes and/or cottages scattered around the lake.  Shoal water soils are 40% sand, 20% gravel, 20% marl, 10% rubble and 10% muck.  Secchi reading was 8 ft.  Total alkalinity was 130.0 ppm.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were found with a majority of the plants having a density rating of moderate to rank.Test netting indicated a good fish population of yellow perch, walleye, pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie.  A fair nothern pike population was also present.  Spawning habitat is good for northern pike, largemouth bass and other centrarchids; spawning habitat is fair for walleyes.  Crooked Brook between Leavitt, Lawrence and Roosevelt Lake is large enough so there is fish migration between the three lakes.  Black grub (Neascus spp.) and yellow grub (Clinostomum marginatum) were the only parasites found.  Northern pike, yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill and rock bass had a heavy infection of Neascus.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 19, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 4 stations.  Sixteen species were sampled, including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Iowa Darter, Blackchin Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of August 1st, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",

And although not stocked directly into Lawrence, a walleye catch of 1.8/gill net suggests they may be migrating in from connected Roosevelt and could provide the occasional opportunity to catch one.  Average size of these Walleyes was 18.8\" and all the fish were over 15\". <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was average for this type of lake (3.8/gill net), with a good average length of 26.3\".  Lakes in this area of the state have a 22-26\" protected slot, however, 43% of the fish captured were longer than 26\".  Largemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing at the rate of 72.0/hour and 53% of these were over 12\" with the largest being 18\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were typical for this type of lake.  Bluegill were caught at the rate of 14.0/trap net and Black Crappie at 1.9/trap net.  However, only 8% of the Bluegill were over 7\" and 22% of the Black Crappie were over 8\". <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike gillnet catch of 5.2/ gillnet was average when compared to similar lakes, but the highest catch to date on Lawrence.  Average size was 25.0 inches and 3.6 lbs, with fish up to 36.5 inches captured.   Growth was normal compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch of 0.8/gillnet was below average, and the lowest catch to date.  Previous catches have ranged from 1.0/gillnet (1989) to 4.3/gillnet (1979).  Average size was 22.6 inches and 4.9 lbs.  Walleyes up to 28.3 inches were captured.  Walleyes have not been stocked in Lawrence since 1991, but are stocked in odd number years into connected Roosevelt Lake.  Fish can freely move between the two lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch was above average at 5.0/gillnet.  As in past surveys the average size was small at only 5.9 inches.  Only 3% of the crappies caught were over 8 inches.  Growth was normal compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were caught in this survey. Previous survey catches have ranged from 0.3/gillnet (2006) to 27.7/gillnet (1979).  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleyes and northern pike.  Other fish species sampled included black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bluegill largemouth bass, and rock bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lawrence Lake was conducted on June 13-15, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due soft sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 12 species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill and Pumpkinseed sunfish comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bluegill and Bowfin comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from August 2022 to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Lawrence Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes.  These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lawrence Lake is located on the east edge of Outing in Cass County.  Lawrence Lake is 230 acres with a maximum depth of 71 ft.  The lake is comprised of two basins with the western basin slightly larger and deeper.  About 38% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A boat launch and small park are located on the west end of the lake about 0.2 miles east of Highway 6 on County Road 58.  Smaller boats may also reach Lawrence Lake from Roosevelt Lake via the outlet channel.   <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey of Lawrence Lake was done in August 2006 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  This was the first survey done in 17 years since a fishery population assessment in August 1989.   <br> \n <br> \nThe aquatic vegetation in Lawrence Lake was diverse with 30 species or genera found.  Waterlilies were common along most of the shore in shallow water.  Several pondweeds (Potamogeton sp.), bushy pondweed, coontail, northern milfoil, and wild celery were common and formed a dense, but generally narrow band of vegetation due to the steep drop-off along most of the lakeshore.  The predominate substrate in shallow waters was sand with a muck bottom common in shallow vegetation rich bays, particularly on the east end and the south bays of the west basin. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was 12.5 ft. in August and the water had a slight bog stain color. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common species in the gill nets with a catch of nearly 29 per net.  The top predator species best sampled with gill nets, walleye and northern pike, were both caught in moderate numbers compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Walleyes ranged from 10.2 to 25.6 inches long with a mean length of 19.4 inches.  Most walleyes were around 17 to 22 inches long.  Northern pike captured in the gill nets were relatively large compared to other similar lakes with a mean weight of 4.8 pounds.  Northern pike ranged from 19.9 to 37.5 inches with many fish around 25 inches in length.  Black crappie gill net catch was also high compared to other similar lakes, however, the black crappie were fairly small with a mean length of 7.3 inches with the largest at 8.5 inches long.  Other species captured in the gill nets were caught in low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill comprised the majority of the fish captured in the trap nets and were caught in moderate numbers compared to other similar lakes.  Trap net captured bluegills were relatively small with a size range from 3.4 to 7.4 inches with most fish around 4 inches long.  Larger bluegills were actually caught in the gill nets with a mean length of 6.3 inches and a maximum length of 8.3 inches.  Other species captured in the trap nets were caught a moderate to low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile the shoreline of Lawrence Lake is fairly well developed with about 117 houses present, most the lakeshore owners have not yet undertaken extensive removal of the riparian terrestrial or aquatic vegetation.  Natural vegetation along lakeshores is critical habitat for most aquatic species for at least a portion of their life.   <br> \n</p>",
