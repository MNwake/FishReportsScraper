                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a small, 34 acre impoundment located in the city of Rochester.  To provide angling opportunities for city residents and visitors, a variety of gamefish have been stocked including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass and channel catfish.  Assessment netting sampled a total of 14 different fish species, the majority of which were non-gamefish (common river species) such as golden redhorse, silver redhorse, and white sucker (112/net).  When compared to other Minnesota lakes in the same classification (similar character), white sucker abundance in Silver Lake is more than 17 times above average.  This is partly because the lake is actually an impoundment on the South Fork Zumbro River formed by a dam at the outlet.  Gamefish sampled included black crappie (9.8/net), white crappie (.2/net), channel catfish (1.5/net) and northern pike (.2/net). Largemouth bass were collected using an electrofishing boat at a rate of 59/hour, with individual sizes ranging from 7 to 15 inches.  Over 10,000 bluegill have been stocked in Silver Lake since 1994.  Only one adult bluegill was collected during this fish assessment.  White crappie abundance has also decreased over the years.  There may be a number of reasons for these occurences, and .   low catch, and we will be looking into this so as to better plan future stocking.   The best way to fish the lake may be by small boat, or off one of the fishing piers.  Using a bobber and an ordinary hook tipped with a night crawler or minnow is a good way to catch fish in Silver Lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a 34-acre impoundment of the South Fork Zumbro River located within the city of Rochester, MN.  The impoundment is created by a dam, owned and operated by Rochester Public Utilities (RPU).  Water quality in the reservoir is affected by sediment deposition from upstream sources and urban runoff.  Water quality is also likely affected by use of a large Canada goose flock that winters on the lake.  Much of the shoreline of Silver Lake is within a publicly owned park and offers easily accessible angling opportunity in an urban environment.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish population was sampled in 2007 using gill nets, trap nets, shoreline seining and electro-fishing.  Bluegill, black crappie and white sucker were the most common species sampled.  Other gamefish sampled included white crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of black crappie and bluegill were 15/net and 21/net, respectively and within the normal range for lakes of this class.  Black crappie up to 10 inches long, were sampled and average length was 7.8 inches.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7 inches long and average length was 5.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were collected by electro-fishing at a rate of 32 fish/hour.  Bass from 8 to 11.8 inches were sampled and average length was 9.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers and golden redhorse are also abundant and could provide good angling opportunities.  <br> \n</p>",

The Silver Lake Dam creates the impoundment that is famous for the thousands of canada geese that reside there.  Warmwater discharge to the lake from Rochester Public Utilities creates open water conditions during much of the winter, making it an even more attractive site to local waterfowl.The most abundant gamefish present are white and black crappie.  Trapnetting during this assessment collected 51 and 38/net, respectively.  Both species are present in higher numbers than we'd expect to see in lakes of similar character.  Average length is only about 7.5 inches, but there are enough of them to make summer or winter fishing worth while.An electrofishing boat was used to collect largemouth bass in the fall of the year.  A total of 30 largemouth bass ranging from 5 to 17 inches were sampled at a rate of 32/hour.  The Silver lake dam is one of several dams on the Zumbro River.  Despite the \"flat water\" fishing opportunities they can provide, dams for the most part are bad for river fisheries.  They block the natural migration of fishes, slowly collect nutrients and sediment, and eventually become shallow, soft-bottomed pools of highly fertile water.  Plants and fish such as algae and carp thrive in such environments.         </p>",

Black and white crappies are abundant, but are generally of a size not acceptable to anglers. Forage levels of white sucker, common shiner, and golden redhorse continue to be abundant. Carp and black bullheads are common with the bullheads being of acceptable size. Local fishing reports indicate moderate numbers of small channel catfish are regularly caught in the lower power plant discharge. These small catfish (10-12 inches) are probably from the 1982 and 1984 stockings.  We will recommend to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency that in 1986 they sample fish from the lake for contaminants.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a 34-acre impoundment on the South Fork Zumbro River located in the city of Rochester, MN.  The reservoir pool is maintained by a dam owned and operated by Rochester Public Utilities (RPU).  Like most reservoirs in southern Minnesota, Silver Lake collects sediment and nutrients that would normally be transported and deposited downstream as part of a natural hydrologic process.  Because of the dam however, long-term deposition of sediment and nutrients has occurred within the impoundment, resulting in a significant degradation of water quality and fish habitat.     <br> \n <br> \nThe fish population was sampled using 2 gillnets, 7 trapnets and 5 seine hauls.  Five electrofishing stations were also completed.  White suckers were the most common species collected, followed by black and white crappie.  Other gamefish species sampled were bluegill, largemouth bass and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhen compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota, Silver Lake had a higher abundance of both black and white crappie than what we would typically expect to see (73/trapnet and 39/trapnet, respectively).  The average size however is small (6-7 inches).  Habitat for crappies in Silver Lake is limited to areas of undeveloped shoreline where partially submerged woody debris is common.    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were collected by electrofishing at a rate of 51/hour.  Individual lengths ranged from 5-16 inches.  Fish that were 11-12 inches in length were about 5 years of age. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (12/trapnet) was about what we would expect to see in a lake like Silver.  Average size is small (5.3 inches) and similar to crappies, were more abundant near undeveloped shoreline areas. <br> \n <br> \nSilver lake is dominated by non-gamefish, however, crappies and bluegill are fairly abundant and provide easily accessible angling opportunities within an urban environment.  </p>",

Crappies and bluegills are present in good numbers but are of a size not acceptable to anglers. Largemouth bass are present in fair numbers. Smallmouth bass are also present but low in density. The lake has an extremely dense forage base made up of common shiner, silver redhorse, white sucker, golden shiner and black bullheads. One thousand channel catfish yearlings were introduced in October of 1981 in an attempt to utilize the existing forage and provide a fishery. Repairs to the outlet dam required a drawdown of the lake on two occasions in October of 1981. At this writing the status of the fish population, due to the drawdowns, is not known. However, follow-up assessment on the catfish introduction will continue in 1982.Only two adult channel catfish were taken in test netting the lake and no record of the species occurring in the system above the lake outlet barrier was noted prior to this survey. These fish probably gained access to the lake during the record flood of 1978. No further stockings of any species should be considered until this catfish evaulation is completed.</p>",
