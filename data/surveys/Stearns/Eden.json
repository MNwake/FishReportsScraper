The Northern Pike catch indices was comparable to the state median and their growth rates were good. The growth rate for Largemouth Bass was fast and the catch indices was five times greater than the state median. The Black Crappie catch indices was thirteen times greater than the state median. Their growth rate was good through the first three years then slowed to 20% below average. The Bluegill growth was good. The catch indices was 1.5 times greater than the state median. Black and Brown Bullhead catch indices was three times greater than the state median. Yellow Perch catch indices was more than twenty times greater than the state median.\n\nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  All of these species with the exception of Bowfin and Yellow Bullhead were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes. \n</p>",

The catch rate of Walleye (6.8/gill net) increased from the 1985 survey and exceeded the expected range of values for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch were sampled above the expected range for similar lakes and were similar to the previous surveys. Bluegill were sampled in numbers and weight above the average and increased from the 1985 survey. The Black Crappie population decreased from the previous survey catch but remained within the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.

                "narrative": "<p>Eden Lake is located in south-central Stearns County, north of Eden Valley.  It is the second in a series of lakes that outlet north to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  A large, mostly agricultural watershed (over 24,000 acres) drains into Eden Lake.  The resulting nutrient load has resulted in impaired water quality, nuisance algal blooms, and occasional winterkills.  Submersed plants grew as deep as ten feet, but the plant community was not very diverse.  Coontail and sago pondweed were most common, although curly-leaf pondweed was also very abundant in early June. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day-time electrofishing in mid-May.  The population appeared to be higher than average for this area of the state.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.0 to 18.2 inches and averaged 10.4 inches and 0.7 pounds. Growth of Largemouth was fast as fish grew to a length of 11.8 inches in three years.   <br> \n <br> \nEden Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye.  The catch of Northern Pike in 2013 increased from 2003 and exceeded the range expected for lakes similar to Eden Lake.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 9.3 to 34.4 inches and averaged 23.2 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Northern Pike grew similar to the statewide average and forty-two percent of Northern Pike were greater than 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is supported by regular stocking.  Since 2001, Walleye fry stocking has been the preferred strategy, but Walleye fingerlings have also been stocked when fry stocking failed to produce viable year classes as was the case in 2011 and 2013.  In cases where fry stocking is successful, this strategy still can produce higher populations at a lower cost. The Walleye catch in 2013 increased significantly from 2003, and was near the upper range of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 8.3 to 25.0 inches and averaged 15.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Walleye growth was fast compared to statewide averages and grew to 18.5 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nEden Lake has consistently supported a high population of Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch rates declined significantly from the previous survey however, they remain above the range of expected values for lakes like Eden.  Perch don't appear to reach a size favored by most anglers, but they provide an abundant source of forage for Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Black Crappie in 2013 decreased from 2003, but remained within the expected range for lakes similar to Eden. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5.6 to 11.4 inches with an average length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.32 pounds.  Black Crappie growth was average and fish grew to a length of 9.0 inches in four years. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate increased from the previous survey and was in the expected range. Bluegill ranged in length from 4.4 to 8.5 inches with an average length and weight of 6.4 inches and 0.22 pounds.  Growth of Bluegill was average and fish grew to a length of 6.7 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included: Channel Catfish, Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Eden Lake was conducted on August 6-7, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Eden Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eden Lake has historically supported an excellent fishery for northern pike and panfish.  Occasionally good angling for walleye and largemouth bass exists.During the current survey the most important species caught in gill nets were northern pike, yellow perch and walleye.  The catch of northern pike was 11.7    to that found in 1990 (5.3/lift).  Northern pike ranged in size from 16.7 - 33.9   inches.  The average length and weight of gill net caught northerns was 22.3 inches and 2.6 pounds.Yellow perch were abundant (148.8/gill net) and the population is very important to the ecological balance of the fishery.  Yellow perch are the preferred food item for predators such as northern pike and walleye.Walleye were present and captured at 3.3/lift.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year since 1987 and the age classes corresponded closely to years in which stocking took place.  Walleye ranged in size from 11.0 - 26.0 inches.  The average length and weight was 18.2 inches and 2.4 pounds.Important species captured in trap nets were bluegill and black crappie and black bullhead.  All three species have been abundant historically and the catches were within the  range of expected values for lake class 34.Bluegill were captured at a rate of 13.3/trap net.   The fish ranged in size from 2.8 - 9.5 inches.  About 25% of the sample was eight inches or greater, outstanding for this area.  The average length and weight of bluegill was 7.1 inches and 0.3   pounds.Black crappie were taken at a rate of 4.7/trap net.  The fish ranged in size from 5.3 - 11.4 inches.  The average length and weight of black crappie was 8.0 inches 0.3 pounds.Black bullheads have apparently declined in Eden Lake.  The catch was 2.8/trap net well below the 1990 catch of 141.2/lift.  The commercial fisherman assigned to Eden Lake has noted decreasing catches in recent years.</p>",

It is the second in a series of lakes that outlet north to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  The lake has a maximum depth of 77 feet and submerged aquatic plants grow out to depth of ten feet dominated by coontail and sago pondweed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Eden Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and fingerlings had been stocked every other year from 1987 2000.  After the only recorded partial winterkill in 2001, Walleye fry were stocked in the lake for the first time since 1985.  Because Walleye fry have been successfully stocked in other nearby lakes in the Sauk River Chain and the fact that fry have the potential to provide a more cost effective Walleye fisheries, the DNR has continued to stock 124,000   200,000 fry every two years since 2001 with mixed success.  In addition to the DNR fry stockings, the Eden Lake Association has also stocked Walleye fingerlings in 2013 (2,430), 2014 (1,650), and 2015 (2,540). <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye for Eden Lake from 2001 2015 was 11.9/hour (on time).  This compares to a rate of 17.8/ hour observed over the same time period in nearby North Brown's Lake, 108/hour on Cedar Island, and 143.8/hour on Horseshoe Lakes.  In addition, no fingerlings have been sampled by fall electrofishing in either of the last two stocking events and only two were sampled in 2011..  Walleye fingerlings were stocked by the DNR in the fall of 2011 (2,600) and 2013 (1,080) after electrofishing revealed poor fry survival. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch in the 2013 survey (5.0/gill net) was significantly higher than in 2003 (2.1 /gill net).  It had been thought that these results were encouraging considering that fry stocking had only been successful 50% of the time, however the continued lack of fry survival has convinced the DNR that Walleye fingerlings are the more practical option at this time. <br> \n <br> \nThe next stocking in Eden Lake is scheduled for 2016.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eden Lake is located in south central Stearns County, north of Eden Valley.  It is the second in a series of lakes that outlet north to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  A large, mostly agricultural watershed (over 24,000 acres) drains into Eden Lake.  The resulting nutrient load has resulted in impaired water quality, nuisance algal blooms, and occasional winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nEden Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye.  The catch of Northern Pike in 2018 increased from 2013 and exceeded the range of expected values for lakes similar to Eden Lake.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 19.8 to 38.3 inches and averaged 26.5 inches and 4.5 pounds. Seventy seven percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population has been supported by fry stocking since 2001 as well as annual fingerling stocking by the Eden Valley Sportsmen's Club (2013 - present). The Walleye catch in 2018 decreased from 2013, but was within the expected range for lakes similar to Eden. Walleye ranged in length from 12.8 to 26.2 inches and averaged 19.6 inches and 2.3 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day time electrofishing in mid May.  The population appeared to be higher than average for this area of the state.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.6 to 19.6 inches and averaged 12.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nEden Lake has consistently supported a high population of Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch catch rates were similar to previous surveys and remain above the range of expected values for lakes like Eden.  Perch don't appear to reach a size favored by most anglers, but they provide an abundant source of forage for Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of Black Crappie decreased from 2013 and was below the expected range for lakes similar to Eden; however the gill net catch increased significantly from 2013. Black Crappie ranged in length from 6.3 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches.  The catch rate of Bluegill was similar to 2013 and within the range of expected values.  Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3.1 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were sampled in low abundance (1.8/gill net), but above average in size. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 26.1 to 33.9 inches with an average length of 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eden Lake is located in south central Stearns County, north of Eden Valley.  It is the second in a series of lakes that outlet north to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  A large, mostly agricultural watershed (over 24,000 acres) drains either directly to Eden Lake, or to nearby Mud Lake and then to Eden.  The resulting load of nutrients has resulted in impaired water quality, nuisance algal blooms, and occasional winterkills.  The fishery of Eden Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was within the range expected for lakes similar to Eden, and average size of northern pike was favorable (3.2 pounds).  The largest fish sampled was over 37 inches.  Eden Lake's walleye population is supported by regular stocking.  In 2001 and 2003, fry were stocked rather than fingerlings, which had previously been used.  In cases where fry stocking is successful, this strategy can produce higher populations at a lower cost. Nearly all of the walleye sampled in 2003 were from the 2001 year class, and appeared to grow quickly.  Evidence of success from the 2003 stocking was also observed during fall electrofishing.Eden Lake has consistently supported a high population of yellow perch.  Perch don't appear to reach a size favored by most anglers, but they provide an abundant source of forage for northern pike and walleye.Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in mid-May.  The population appeared to be lower than average for this area of the state, and most of the fish were less than ten inches.  It is typical for lakes like Eden to have lower bass populations than clearer lakes.  Also, most of the bass sampled in 2003 were 2 or 3 years old, and the population and average size may increase in coming years.The catch rate of black crappie in 2003 was relatively high, while average size (0.22 pounds) was in the range expected for lakes like Eden.  As with the largemouth bass, most of the fish were age 2 or 3, so larger fish will likely be available in the next few years.  The catch rate of bluegill was in the expected range, as was the average size (0.21 pounds).Several \"rough fish\" species were sampled in high numbers, which is typical for hypereutrophic lakes.  These included black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin and white sucker .  Carp numbers appeared to be in the normal range, but average weight (8.3 pounds) was high.</p>",

It is the second in a series of lakes that outlet north to join the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  The lake has a maximum depth of 77 feet and submerged aquatic plants grow out to depth of ten feet dominated by coontail and sago pondweed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Eden Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and fingerlings had been stocked every other year from 1987 2000.  After the only recorded partial winterkill in 2001, Walleye fry were stocked in the lake for the first time since 1985.  Because Walleye fry have been successfully stocked in other nearby lakes in the Sauk River Chain and the fact that fry have the potential to provide a more cost effective Walleye fishery, the DNR has continued to stock 124,000 to 200,000 fry every two years since 2001 with mixed success.  In addition to the DNR fry stockings, the Eden Lake Association has also stocked Walleye fingerlings from 2013 - 2017 (1,650 - 2,660 fish). <br> \n <br> \nTo assess the success of the walleye fry stocking, fall electrofishing surveys for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye are conducted.  Electrofishing catch rates of walleye (on-time) is based on the number of fish sampled relative to the amount of time the electrofishing unit is actively operating. The average catch of young of the year (YOY) Walleye for Eden Lake from 2001 to 2017 was 10.9/hour (on time).  This compares to a rate of 13.9/ hour observed over the same time period in nearby North Brown's Lake, 108/hour on Cedar Island, and 127/hour on Horseshoe Lakes.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked by the DNR in the fall of 2011 (2,600 fish) and 2013 (1,080 fish) after electrofishing revealed poor fry survival. <br> \n <br> \nGiven that the Walleye catch in the 2013 survey (5.0/gill net) was significantly higher than in 2003 (2.1 /gill net) and that the lake association has been consistently stocking fingerlings since 2013, the DNR will continue to stock fry on a biennial basis (next in 2019) and consider contingency fingerling stocking when available. <br> \n</p>",
