                "narrative": "<p>A special regulation for northern pike was implemented in this lake in 2003, as part of a statewide effort to protect and improve high-quality northern pike populations.  The regulation established a 24 to 36-in protected slot length limit.  Northern pike 24 to 36 inches in length must be immediately released.The northern pike gill net catch and the mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets in this assessment were both above average for a lake of this type.  Most of the northern pike collected had come from a strong 2001 year class, but fish up to seven years of age were included in the catch.  Northern pike growth rates had been fast, with three-year-old fish reaching an average of 23.9 inches at the end of their third year.Forage for northern pike was provided by small white sucker and yellow perch.  Both species were present in average numbers.  No other fish species were found in 2003.A population estimate was done as part of this assessment.  It was estimated that the lake supported a total of 265 age-1 or older northern pike in May 2003, of which 109 were 24 to 36 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special regulation for Northern Pike (a 24 to 36-in protected slot) was implemented on Little Cascade Lake in 2003, and remained in force in 2017.  The objective for the regulation was to produce a significant  increase in the proportion of Northern Pike falling within the protected size range.  An acceptable outcome would have been to have that proportion remain stable in Little Cascade Lake, if it had been seen to decline (presumably as a result of increased fishing pressure) in the control lake (Pickerel Lake, Cook County).   <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first of two population assessments scheduled in the 2013 lake management plan to complete an extended evaluation of the Northern Pike special regulation.  The second is scheduled for the spring of 2019.  A change in statewide Northern Pike regulations, effective in March 2018, means that Pickerel Lake's value as a control in this evaluation will be diminished after that date, since the 2018 change (bag limit reduced to two fish, with a 30-40-inch protected slot limit) will affect Pickerel Lake.  The change will not affect Little Cascade Lake, where the current special regulation will remain in effect. <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in this lake, Northern Pike numbers were high in Little Cascade Lake in 2017, as was the average size of those fish.  The gill net catch was above the normal range for the lake class, but was similar to catches seen in the past in this lake.  Mean weight for Northern Pike taken in gill nets in 2017 was also above the normal range, and was similar to values consistently seen in this lake since 1988.  Many year classes contributed to the 2017 catch, including relatively strong year classes produced in 2014, 2012, and 2011.  Fish as old as 11 years were collected.  Northern Pike growth appeared to have been slow; fish reached a mean length of 23.0 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 24.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBased on recaptures of fish tagged in April of 2017, the lake supported an estimated 558 Northern Pike over 14 inches in length in April 2017.  About 28% of those fish would have fallen within the protected slot.  No fish over 36 inches in length were sampled in 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nAs has been the case in past assessments, the only other fish species taken in 2017 were White Sucker and Yellow Perch.  The White Sucker gill net catch was relatively low for a lake of this class, but was similar to catches observed in this lake historically.  The Yellow Perch catch was was within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1988.  All of the Yellow Perch taken in gill nets and trap nets in 2017 were too small to have been of much interest to anglers; however, perch provided an essential forage base for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

One fish was larger than that size range - the first indication that this lake would be able to produce some fish over 36 inches in length.  Northern pike growth rates had been relatively fast, compared to other lakes in this area.One of the purposes of this assessment was to produce an estimate for the number of northern pike in this lake.  Northern pike were collected and marked in April 2005, and fish taken in gill nets and trap nets in June for checked for marks.  Marked fish were recaptured, resulting in an estimate of 208 northern pike present in late April (63 to 353 fish at a 95% level of confidence).  A similar estimate for the population size was obtained in 2003.Forage for northern pike was provided by small yellow perch in 2005.  Normally the lake also supports fairly high numbers of white sucker; however, none were taken in the 2005 assessment.  No other fish species were found in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special regulation for northern pike in Little Cascade Lake was implemented in March 2003.  The regulation established a 24-to-36-inch protected-slot size limit, with the intent of increasing the number of preferred-size (24-in and larger) northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBy 2010, the northern pike regulation had been in effect for seven years.  Results of the June 2010 assessment suggested no improvement in northern pike size, compared to the pre-regulation baseline.  The gill net catch, while well above the normal range for the lake class, was not unusually high for this lake, historically.  The mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets was within the normal range for the lake class, and for this lake.  Six year classes (fish one to six years old) contributed to the 2010 assessment catch, with a strong 2007 year class acounting for about 65% of the gill net catch.  Growth had been fast; three-year-old fish averaged 21.5 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 17.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch was within the normal range for the lake class, and for this lake historically, as was the mean weight for yellow perch taken in gill nets.  A few larger yellow perch were present, but most would have been too small to have generated much angling interest.  Yellow perch and what appeared to have been a large population of blacknose shiner were probably the main forage species for northern pike in this lake.  Although some white sucker were present, most would have been too large for any but the largest northern pike to take. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional ice-out trap netting is scheduled for 2011 and 2012, and a summer assessment will be completed in 2012.  Results of those assessments will be used, with data collected in 2010, to determine whether the northern pike regulation has been effective in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010 Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Little Cascade Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, backpack electrofishing gear, and quarter-inch-mesh wire minnow traps.  Prior to sampling done in 2010, Little Cascade Lake was only known to support yellow perch, northern pike, and white sucker, because no attempt had been made to sample smaller fishes.   Nearshore sampling  in 2010 added blacknose shiner, central mudminnow, and Iowa darter to the list of fish species known to be present in this lake.  No exotic, invasive, or otherwise undesirable fish species were found.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The intent was to capture and mark Northern Pike for a population estimate, one of several done since the regulation was implemented.  The size distribution of the spring Northern Pike catch was also of interest, for comparison with baseline (\"pre-regulation\") distributions seen in similar sampling in this lake.  Recapture sampling for the population estimate was done in June 2017 as part of a standard survey, and that report should be consulted for the final estimate. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for Northern Pike in Little Cascade Lake was implemented in March 2003.  The regulation established a 24-to-36-in protected-slot size limit, with the intent of increasing the number of 24-inch and larger Northern Pike.  Spring trap net data from 2003-2005 and gill net data from 1988, 1993, 2003, and 2005 were to be used to establish a \"pre-regulation\" baseline.  Data from 2003-2005 were included on the assumption that in those early post-implementation years there would not have been time for significant effects of the regulation to develop.  The pre-regulation baseline established after 2005 was that among fish larger than 14 inches, 55% should be larger than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBy the spring of 2017, the Northern Pike regulation had been in effect for 14 full seasons (2003-2016).  Results of 2017 ice-out trap netting suggested no improvement in Northern Pike size, compared to the pre-regulation baseline.  Among Northern Pike larger than 14 inches in 2017, about 49% were over 24 inches in length.  On average among all three post-regulation surveys (2010, 2012, and 2017), only about 45% of fish taken in the spring were over 24 inches in length.  As has been the case in all ice-out surveys of this lake done since 2003, no Northern Pike larger than 36 inches were taken in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nFailure of Northern Pike in this lake to respond to the 24-36-inch protected slot limit may indicate that pre-regulation Northern Pike harvest was not high enough to have had much influence on the Northern Pike population.  We lack creel survey data for this lake, or for any other lake in this area supporting only a Northern Pike fishery, but poor accessibility (no boat launch) and a general lack of interest in Northern Pike harvest among local anglers probably kept fishing pressure in this lake low, compared to other area waters. <br> \n <br> \nBecause this survey targeted Northern Pike exclusively, no attempt was made to record the catch of other species. Many Yellow Perch (mostly small) and a few White Sucker (three fish) were also caught.  No other fish species was taken.  More information on other fish species in this lake can be found in the report for the June 2017 standard survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special regulation for northern pike (a 24 to 36-in protected slot) was implemented on Little Cascade Lake in 2003, and remains in force.  The objective for the regulation was to produce a significant increase in the number of northern pike 24 inches or more in length taken in ice-out trap netting or standard gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThis was the third of three population assessments scheduled in the 2005 lake management plan to evaluate the northern pike special regulation.  The first, done in 2005, was intended as the final baseline assessment, while assessments in 2010 and 2012 were intended to provide post-regulation data.   The lake management plan was to be reviewed and revised in March 2013.  Legislative action in 2012 extended the northern pike regulation for another ten years, regardless of the results of the current evaluation. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Cascade Lake supported a fairly high quality northern pike population in 2012; northern pike were abundant, and larger than average for a lake of this type.  The gill net catch was above the normal range for the lake class, although it was similar to catches seen in the past in this lake.  Mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets in 2012 was also above the normal range, and was one of the highest seen in this lake historically.  Most of the northern pike collected in 2012 were two- or three-year-old fish, with no fish older than four years found.  Growth had been relatively fast; fish reached an average length of 22.2 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an average of 17.2 inches for similar lakes in Cook County.   <br> \n <br> \nData available to date do not allow us to conclude that the regulation on Little Cascade Lake has resulted in an increase in the size of northern pike taken in ice-out netting, or in standard gill nets.  Although results of the 2012 assessment were very good, fish taken in 2010 had been smaller.  Taken together, sizes of fish from the post-regulation assessments (2010 and 2012) were not significantly higher than sizes observed in pre-regulation (baseline) assessments.  It can take many years for length restrictions to take full effect.  Since the regulation has been extended for another ten years by legislative action, we may see more positive effects as the evaluation continues. <br> \n <br> \nAs has been the case in past assessments, the only other fish species taken in 2012 were white sucker and yellow perch.  The white sucker gill net catch was relatively low for a lake of this class, but was similar to catches observed in this lake historically.  The yellow perch catch was was within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1988.  Most of the yellow perch taken were too small to have been of much interest to anglers; however, perch provided an excellent forage base for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
