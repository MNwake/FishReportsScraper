Bluegills and black bullheads are the two most abundant species in the pond. The bluegills average 4.0 inches and black bullheads average 5.5 inches. Black crappies are also present, but in low numbers. Other species present include: carp, golden shiners, hybrid sunfish, white suckers, yellow bullheads, and yellow perch. The pond is stocked in the fall with adult bluegills and black crappies when they are available. Adult northern pike were stocked in December.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gervais Mill Pond was created in 1994 when a stream bed and surrounding wetland was excavated to provide better water quality to Gervais Lake. The pond is 7 acres in surface area and has a maximum depth of 12 feet. Located in Edgewater Park, City of Little Canada, the pond provides the public with not only a place to go fishing but also walking trails with interpretive signage about the native plantings surrounding the pond. The pond has been stocked with panfish annually since 1995 and gamefish such as Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Walleye have been stocked sporadically. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 survey found a very low abundance of fish in Gervais Mill Pond, with only 23 fish being sampled. Twenty of these fish were Black Bullheads, two hybrid sunfish and one Bluegill. This low catch is attributable to a winterkill event that occurred in the 2012-13 winter season. Numerous dead Common Carp were observed in the spring of 2013 around the pond following a high water event at ice-out when water backed up in the pond raising the levels four to six feet above normal. Winterkill is somewhat common in this basin with documented kills occurring in 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. The sampling of only three sunfish is curious based on the stocking of 588 sunfish in the spring of 2013. Past surveys in 2002 and 1997 sampled 42 Bluegill and 181 respectively. Annual spring stocking numbers will be increased in response to this low catch rate. <br> \n</p>",
