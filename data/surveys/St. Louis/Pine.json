                "narrative": "<p>One Pine Lake is typical of lakes in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, shallow, and have soft (unmineralized) and bog stained water.  One Pine Lake differs from lakes in this lake class in that it is smaller (363 acres) than the lake class average of 1,242 acres. One Pine Lake does not stratify thermally in midsummer and retains good oxygen to the bottom.  Johnson Creek and the Bear Island River are the major inlets, and the Bear Island River is the outlet.  Lakeshore bottom substrates are dominated by rubble, boulder, and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft; wild rice is the most common plant.  There were 38 homes and cabins on the lake in 1997.  The water quality of One Pine Lake shows it is a mesotrophic lake.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 18 fish/net (16 lb/net) was below normal for this lake class, but was similar to the long term average catch of 22 fish/net (18 lb/net) for all ten gillnettings in this lake dating back to 1965.  Lake Class 16 is one of the most productive in northeast Minnesota, in terms of the abundance and weight of fish.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 1997 of 16 fish/net (14 lb/net) was similar to the long term average catch of 16 fish/net (17 lb/net) for all five trapnettings in this lake dating back to 1965.Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by northern pike, walleye, white sucker, and black crappie.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (2.7/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were near the long term average of 3.5/gillnet for this lake.  Pike sizes in 1997 were small, averaging 19\"; the largest was 36\".  Pike growth (19\" at age four) was slow. Walleye numbers in 1997 (5.7/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the long term average of 4.4/gillnet for this lake.  Walleye sizes were small, averaging 11\"; the largest was 21\".  Most walleye captured in 1997 were from the 1994 and 1995 year classes.  Growth of young walleye (11\" at age three) was average, but growth of older walleye (15\" at age six) was slow. White sucker numbers in 1997 (3.2/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the long term average of 4.6/gillnet for this lake.  Sucker sizes averaged 19\".Black crappie numbers in 1997 (4.8/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, but were near the long term average of 4.9/trapnet for this lake.  Crappie sizes in 1997 averaged 10\"; the largest was 12\".  Most crappie were age six or older.  Crappie growth (10\" at age six) was average. Other fish species present in the trapnets and gillnets in 1997, generally in low numbers, were bluegill sunfish, burbot, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.  Some of the bluegill were large (9\").  Additional species captured in the shoreline seine in 1997 were Johnny darter, largemouth bass, logperch, shiners, and spottail shiner.Fish species examined in 1997 were remarkably free of diseases or parasites.  Northern pike were the only species with appreciable infection: 58 percent had Neascus.  Neascus, also known as \"black spot\", is a small parasite found in or just under the skin.  It cannot infect humans, is usually removed by filleting, and is killed by cooking. </p>",

There is a gravel boat ramp for public access located off the E side of CSAH 21. <br> \n <br> \nOne Pine Lake is shallow and has bog-stained and soft (unmineralized) water. Johnson Creek and the Bear Island River are the major inlets to One Pine Lake, and the Bear Island River is the outlet. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are dominated by rubble, boulder, and sand. Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft with wild rice the most common plant.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2016 (6.7/gill net) were slightly higher than the historic average for One Pine Lake. Walleye averaged 11 inches long and were about 4 years old. Eighty-seven percent of the walleye aged were between the ages of 1 and 4. The largest walleye sampled was in a trap net and measured 17 inches long. Only one walleye sampled from the gill nets was over 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2016 (3.3/gill net) were identical to the historic average on this lake. The average pike was 17 inches which is smaller than the historic average length of almost 19 inches. The largest pike sampled was 33.5 inches long. Only two pike over 23 inches in length were sampled from the gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2016 (9.9/trap net) were higher than the historic average (3.4/trap net) on this lake. Bluegill averaged 7.4 inches which is slightly larger than the historic average. Forty-two percent of the bluegill sampled in the trap nets were 8 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2016 (2.3/trap net) were slightly lower than the historic average for this lake. The average crappie sampled was almost 10 inches long. Sixty-two percent of the crappie sampled in the trap nets were 10 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled in 2016 from One Pine Lake. Smallmouth bass sampled by electrofishing (n=8) averaged 16 inches and the largest smallmouth was just over 19 inches long. Three largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing between 4.4 and 16 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>One Pine Lake is a 354-acre lake located seven miles south of Ely. There is a public access with a gravel boat ramp located on the west side of the lake off CSAH 21. One Pine Lake is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of just 13 feet. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, boulder, and sand. <br> \n <br> \nOne Pine Lake does not typically stratify due to its shallow depth. On July 10, 2023, the water temperature was 71 F throughout the entire water column. Adequate oxygen levels for warmwater fish species were also retained throughout the water column. One Pine Lake has brown, bog-stained water with visibility around 4 feet. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 5.3 fish/gill net, which was slightly below the historical average for the lake. Walleye sampled in gill nets averaged just 11.9 inches in length, and 35% of the fish sampled were over 14.0 inches. Eight additional walleye were also sampled in trap nets. All trap-netted walleye were longer than 14.5 inches, and the largest walleye was 25.7 inches long. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 10 and indicated consistent recruitment in this naturally reproducing population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 1.8 fish/trap net, which was higher than the historical average for the lake. Bluegill also tended to be large, with an average length of 8.1 inches. The largest bluegill sampled was 10.1 inches in length, and bluegill ages ranged from 3 to 11.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 1.8 fish/trap net, which was slightly lower than the historical average for the lake. Black crappie averaged 9.4 inches in length in trap nets. However, the largest crappie was 11.7 inches long and was sampled in a gill net. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 2.6 fish/gill net, which was slightly lower than previous surveys on One Pine Lake. The average length of northern pike sampled in 2023 was 20.7 inches, which was close to the historical average for the lake. Additional northern pike were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.1 fish/trap net. These fish tended to be larger, averaging 23.3 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2023 was 38.8 inches long and was sampled in a trap net. <br> \n <br> \nOne smallmouth bass was sampled in a gill net and it was 16.0 inches long. No largemouth bass were sampled in 2023. Historically, bass have been rare in netting surveys of One Pine Lake. Targeted sampling of the bass population using electrofishing was conducted during the last survey in 2016. Results from that sampling indicated a relatively low-density bass population with quality-sized individuals present, including largemouth bass that were up to 16 inches long and smallmouth bass that were over 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>One Pine Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 16, which consists of 38 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, shallow, and have bog-stained and soft (unmineralized) water.  One Pine Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class.  One Pine Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nOne Pine Lake was slightly stratified thermally on 07/31/2007 with a surface temperature of 79 F and a bottom temperature of 73 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to within a foot of the bottom.  Johnson Creek and the Bear Island River are the major inlets to One Pine Lake, and the Bear Island River is the outlet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are dominated by rubble, boulder, and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 4 ft; wild rice is the most common plant.  There were 38 homes and cabins on the lake in 1997. <br> \n   <br> \nThree fisheries lake surveys and eight fish population assessments have been conducted on One Pine Lake, dating back to 1965.  Fish sampling consisted of gillnets (2-9 nets).  Trapnets (3-11 nets) were also used during six of these investigations, and shoreline seines were used in the three lake surveys.  All netting was done in late summer, except that trapnetting in 1994 and 1997 was done in mid-June in an attempt to better sample panfish populations.  Higher numbers of panfish were not caught and trapnetting in 2007 was moved later in the summer to coincide with gillnetting. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2007 of 31 fish/net (27 lb/net) was in the second quartile for this lake class, and was higher than the median catch of 21 fish/net (18 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More walleye and northern pike were caught in 2007 than is typical for this lake.  Lake Class 16 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2007 of 38 fish/net (13 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 16 fish/net (13 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish were captured in 2007 than is typical for this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, white sucker, and bluegill sunfish.  Smallmouth bass were likely more abundant than indicated by the sampling, as bass are \"net-shy\" and difficult to catch in standard sampling nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2007 (10.0/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 5.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 11.8\" (0.7 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 12.2\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye caught in 2007 was 24.8\".  Ages 1-5 walleye were all well represented in the 2007 catch.  Walleye growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (5.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class, and were higher than the median catch of 3.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 18.8\" (1.6 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was at the median size for all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike caught in 2007 was 34.3\".  Most of the pike captured in 2007 were age 3 and 4.  Pike growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish numbers in 2007 (19.2/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class, and were higher than the median catch of 3.1/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 5.4\" (0.15 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 6.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2007 (caught in a gillnet) was 10.5\".  Most of the bluegill captured in 2007 were age two.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and black crappie numbers in 2007 were in the normal range for this lake class and were similar to catches in previous investigations on this lake.  Crappie up to 13\" were caught in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Many of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Some of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera.  All of these parasites are common and are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",
