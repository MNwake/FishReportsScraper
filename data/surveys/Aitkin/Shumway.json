                "narrative": "<p>Green or Shumway Lake is located within Savanna Portage State Park in northeastern Aitkin County and allows electric motors only. The park's main campground is located on the southwest corner of the lake with a nature trail that follows the shoreline. Access to the lake can be gained just north of the campground on the west side of the lake. A majority of the lake's shoreline is forested, which provides anglers with more solitude. Anglers will find opportunities to catch northern pike, black crappie, pumpkinseed and the occasional largemouth bass or bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is in favorable condition for lakes of this type and has remained relatively stable over theyears. The 2015 catch (8.3/gill net) was higher than the previous survey and is within the normal range for this type of lake. The largest northern pike sampled was 32.8\"; they averaged 21.1 inches and 2.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates increased substantially since the previous survey in 2006. The average crappie is about six inches long with occasional individuals reaching 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nShumway Lake has a long history of northern pike and walleye stocking dating back to the 1960s; however, no fish of any species have been stocked since 1996. Stocking is used only periodically to augment the current fish population after winterkills. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The park's main campground is located on the southwest corner of the lake.  The lake's fish community is affected by low fertility and periodic winterkills. Shumway is a shallow body of water that has a relatively simple fish community dominated by black crappie and northern pike.  Other species such as white sucker, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch exist in low numbers. Fish populations in Shumway Lake tend to fluctuate, sometimes greatly, because of periodic winterkills and fish stocking.  Both northern pike and black crappie catch rates decreased substantially since the previous survey in 1996.  The average crappie is about eight inches long with occasional individuals reaching 11 inches.  The average northern pike is approaching 22 inches long, and approximately 1/3 of the pike were larger than 24 inches.  Shumway Lake has a long history of northern pike and walleye stocking dating back to the 1960s; however, no fish of any species have been stocked since 1996.  Stocking is used only periodically to augment the current fish population after winterkils.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green, or Shumway, Lake is located within Savanna Portage State Park in northeastern Aitkin County. The lake's fish community is affected both by low fertility and by historic winterkills, or die-offs of part of the fish community. The choices of species to catch is relatively limited.  The two primary targets for anglers in the lake are black crappies and northern pike. Both of these fishes are more abundant than normal for this type of lake and should provide plenty of action for anglers in the next few years. The sizes of these two fishes tend to be about normal compared to other Aitkin County Lakes, averaging 8.3 inches for black crappies and 18.7 inches for northern pike. Forage for larger northern pike, such as yellow perch and white suckers, is too limited to maintain good growth for bigger pike. This survey did, however, produce several pike over 28 inches long. Pike have been stocked almost annually since 1988. The black crappie population consists of mostly older fish which are slow growing. About a quarter of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches long, yet the maximum length was only 10.1 inches. Crappie abundance will probably decrease in a few years due to an decrease in crappie reproduction over the last several years. Very few sunfishes were caught in this survey, and few probably survived the effects of past winterkills.  Bullhead abundance is also low, yet the few caught in this survey were larger than average. Walleyes have been stocked at various times over the years, yet only one walleye has been caught in any of the fisheries surveys. Walleye die-offs, or winterkills, have been documented and likely explain why most of the surveys have sampled so few walleyes. A natural reproduction check done in August of 1976 produced a catch rate of 10.5 walleyes per gill net set. The next survey in 1980, which followed a winterkill in the winter of 1976-1977, caught no walleyes. Yellow perch, which were caught at a rate of over 20 fish per unit effort in the previous two surveys, were caught at only 1.8 fish per unit effort in this survey. Northern pike growth has slowed considerably from the previous two surveys. Lack of yellow perch will restrict northern pike growth to below normal levels in the future, unless northern pike abundance is reduced.</p>",
