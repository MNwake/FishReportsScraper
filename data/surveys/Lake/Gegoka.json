This may be part of the reason for the low numbers of Walleye. Average size of the Northern Pike was about 1.25 pounds which is substantially smaller than the previous assessment, but more in line with other assessments.     Yellow Perch have decreased in the last two assessments which may also be related to the increased Northern Pike densities.     White Sucker continue to be present in very high numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gegoka Lake is a 145 acre, 100% littoral lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet.  There is a back-in gravel ramp at the public access, with parking, off of State Highway 1 at the small bay in the middle of the south shore.  There are no facilities available at this location. <br> \n  <br> \nGegoka Lake is a soft-water lake with a clean gravel band near shore around the southern half of the lake and muck substrate over much of the lake.  Aquatic vegetation is common, with wild rice beds in the northern half of the lake that at times are suitable for recreational harvest.  Vegetation was growing to a depth of 8 feet in the brown bog-stained water.  There are two small inlets entering Gegoka Lake, the outlet flows from the north end into Flathorn Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye numbers were well above average in the 2011 for this lake class.  The average size of the walleye sampled was also above average for the lake class at 1.6 pound (16.1 inches); the largest walleye was 26.6 inches (6.6 pounds).  Forty-six percent of the walleye sampled were greater than 17 inches.  Walleye reproduction appears to be sporadic with only two year-classes identified in the aged walleye sample.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1999 when multiple investigations showed no correlation between stocking and strong walleye year-classes. <br> \n   <br> \nThe northern pike sample was above average for the lake class in 2011.  The average weight of northern pike in the 2011 sample was 2.6 pounds the largest 35.5 inches (12.3 pounds) with five northern pike over 30 inches sampled.  Northern pike reproduction was fairly consistent indicating good numbers of northern pike should be available to the angler in the future.  A minor portion of the northern pike sampled had Neascus (black spot) parasites. <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class in 2011 which has historically been the case in Gegoka Lake.  The mean weight in 2011 was 0.2 pound (7.4 inches), the largest yellow perch sampled in any gear in 2011 measured 11.8 inches with thirty-one percent of the total catch greater than eight inches.  Yellow perch natural reproduction appears to be sufficient to provide a forage base for the predator populations and a quality yellow perch fishery to the angler.  Many of the yellow perch had Neascus (black spot) and a lesser number had yellow grub parasites, or both. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were stocked in Gegoka Lake in 2000 in an attempt to establish a self-sustaining panfish population in the Isabella area.  The early results were impressive with fast growing bluegill attaining nearly 8 inch in four years, with fish over 10 inches sampled.  Natural reproduction appeared to be lacking in early assessments with gaps between weak year-classes in the small bluegill population.  Three bluegills were sampled in Gegoka Lake in 2011, representing two different year-classes. The average weight of bluegill sampled was 1.0 pound (9.7 inches) the largest bluegill was 10.4 inches (1.3 pounds).  Natural reproduction again appeared to be the limiting factor in developing a quality bluegill fishery.  A larger population of pumpkinseed sunfish exists in Gegoka Lake; however, the average size is much smaller than the bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are also present in Gegoka Lake, with low numbers of small fish often collected in investigations.  The standard gear used in lake surveys does not sample the largemouth bass adults well.  Anglers previously reported that largemouth bass over 4 pounds were caught in Gegoka Lake, but the catches were incidental, while fishing for other species. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were sampled in about average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  They ranged in size from 9.9 inches to 20.1 inches and averaged 15.8 inches (1.5 pounds).  Walleye have been stocked on a regular basis for many years and tend to be difficult to catch in Gegoka Lake.     Northern pike numbers are above average and usually provided lots of action.  test nets in 1999 collected northern pike from 8.9 inches to nearly 32 inches (7.6 pounds), but the average size was about 2.0 pounds.       Gegoka Lake has a higher than average number of yellow perch with enough fish in the 9 inch to 12 inch range to make angling for them worthwhile.  A few perch over 12 inches were sampled.     Largemouth bass are also in the lake but none were taken in test nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of the 2002 survey indicated that walleye are not very abundant in Gegoka Lake, however, there are some quality size fish present.  The average size of walleye collected in gill nets was 17.3 inches (1.9 pounds) and fish ranged in size from 14.8 inches to 22.9 inches.  The largest walleye observed during the survey was 25.0 inches (5.5 pounds).  Walleye had been stocked in Gegoka Lake on a regular basis until 1999, however, because of the low return to anglers stocking was discontinued.  This lake does see some natural reproduction of walleye, so it is probable that a small natural population will be maintained.  Northern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class, and in lower numbers than in previous surveys.  Although the survey observed a few fish over 29 inches, including a 36.8 inch (13.5 pound) individual, most of the northern pike were quite small.  Approximately 67% of the northern pike were smaller than 17 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers, and the catch  included a number of quality size fish.  Yellow perch up to 11.8 inches were sampled, with approximately 21% of the fish larger than 9 inches.Bluegill were introduced into Gegoka Lake in 2000.  It appears that survival of these bluegill was good, as a fair number of these fish were sampled in nets in 2002, showing good growth since the introduction.  The bluegill that were sampled ranged from 8.3 inches to 9.4 inches.  Although the initial stocking of bluegill has not had enough time to expand the fishable population, expectations are high that over time the lake may support a quality bluegill fishery.</p>",

The lake is accessible thru two private roads to the south part of the lake.  Annual water level fluctuations are usually less than one foot.  Most of the lake's immediate watershed consists of moderately sloping sand and gravel forest land.  The shoal water soils are mostly sand, gravel, rubble, and boulders with lesser amounts of muck and sandy muck.     At the time of the survey , there were 17 cottages, 10 boats, and 5 canoes at the lake.  Most of the boats and cabins were a part of Camp Gee Go Kau, a private boys camp on the spouth end of the lake.     Dissolved oxygen was found to be plentiful at all depths tested on July 6,1961, and aquatic plants were moderately abundant in depths to four feet.  Wild rice was plentiful in the north bay.     In the test netting, Walleye were caught in numbers greater than state-wide and watershed medians, and Northern Pike were taken in numbers slightly below the watershed median.  Large catches of White Sucker were taken, and Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, and Pumpkinseed sunfish were taken occasionally.  A high proportion of the gamefish captured were of sizes desirable to anglers.  Young-of-the-year Walleye and Northern Pike were taken in shoreline seining, together with young-of-the-year Yellow Perch.     Spawning conditions were rated \"fair\" for both Walleye and Northern Pike, and \"poor to fair\" for other gamefish.     recent angling success was reported \"fair\" for Walleye and \"good\" for Northern Pike.  Most of the fishing pressure originates from the boys' camp on the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gegoka Lake is 145 acres, has a maximum depth of 10 feet, and is located approximately 5 miles northwest of Isabella, MN.  There is a gravel back-in access on the south shore of the lake with parking for several vehicles off of State Highway 1.  There are no facilities available at the access location.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Gegoka Lake.  Walleye catch was near average relative to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size was 18.9 inches and 2.5 pounds, with 69% of the catch over 18.0 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 24.4 inches long and weighed 5.2 pounds.  Natural reproduction success may be sporadic with noticeable gaps in year classes but growth was average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2018 was average compared to similar lakes in the area and within the historical catch for the lake.  The size of Northern Pike in gill nets was small with the average length of 15.7 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Northern Pike caught in trap nets were larger with two individuals over 30 inches, the largest being 37.6 inches.  Growth of Northern Pike was average and five year classes were present in the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie lakes in the Finland Area tend to have small populations of fast growing fish that occasionally produce a strong year class.  Spawning habitat in Gegoka Lake is fair and the cool climate of northeastern Minnesota may limit their successful natural reproduction.  Bluegill were captured within the normal range for similar lakes and exhibited above average growth for the area.  Bluegill had an average size of 6.9 inches, but none of the catch was over 8 inches.  The 2018 survey was the first to sample Black Crappie in Gegoka Lake.  Eight young of the year Black Crappie averaging 1.8 inches were sampled.  It is not known how Black Crappie got to Gegoka Lake, but it is possible they may have migrated upstream from Flat Horn Lake via Weiss Creek.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at average numbers relative to similar lakes in the area, but were the lowest in the last five surveys.  Yellow Perch had an average length of 7.50 inches and 45% of the catch was over 9 inches.  Natural reproduction is successful in maintaining the population and growth of perch was average compared to the Finland area.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are also present in Gegoka Lake.  Standard sampling gear does not sample adult Largemouth Bass well; and the 2018 survey only caught 17 small bass, the largest being 3.7 inches. There have been angler reports of 14 inch Largemouth Bass being caught on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in above average numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged 16.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pumpkinseed and Golden Shiner were also sampled with the survey gear.   <br> \n <br> \nGegoka Lake has a decent Walleye population and a Northern Pike population that can produce some fish over 30 inches.  There is a small Bluegill population that can produce some nice fish.  A Black Crappie population is still establishing in the lake and may be of interest to anglers in coming years.  Gegoka Lake offers a scenic setting for visitors to the lake and there are only a few cabins along the shoreline.  There are miles of hiking/cross country ski trails near the lake that provide additional recreational opportunities. <br> \n</p>",

In 2000 bluegill were introduced in this lake in order to meet the growing demand for more angling opportunities for this species in the Finland area.Bluegill were sampled in average numbers in the 2005 assessment and their size was above average (0.84 lb/fish), with a number of fish between 9.7-10.7 inches collected.  The larger bluegill were from the 2000 introduction and had exhibited good growth.  This is a relatively recent introduction so it is too soon to know how this species will perform over the long term; however, if the population grows it may be accompanied by a decline in the average size.Walleye were sampled in average numbers in this assessment as they had been in most of the other assessments.  The population is being maintained through natural reproduction.  Although there does not appear to be an abundance of walleye in the lake, the quality is good with fish up to 23 inches collected and 60% of the walleye in the sample between 15-18 inches.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers which is normal for this lake.  Northern pike up to 30 inches (6.1 lb) were collected but the overall size was small averaging only about 1.0 lb/fish.Yellow perch were fairly abundant in test nets in 2005 and the catch included some quality fish.  Yellow perch up to 12 inches were collected and although fish this size were not common in the catch there were a fair number of fish between 9.0-11.0 inches collected.  The average size was 7.7 inches.</p>",
