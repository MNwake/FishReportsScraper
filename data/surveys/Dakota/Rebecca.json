One gizzard shad, 3 black bullheads, and 97 black crappies were captured this year.  The black crappie catch rate is four times the local median.  (Length 4.5-9.0\").  Walleye and channel catfish are known to be present but none were sampled.  A total of 227 bluegills were captured at a rate of 56.75 fish per set vs. 41.6 in 1986.  This number per set is more than double the local median of 20.42.  The PSD value has increased to 68.8% from 50.5% in 1986.  The greatest number of bluegills captured fell in the 6.0-6.4 inch group.  Largemouth bass were sampled by trapnets and electrofishing.  Legal size (16\" minimum) fish are present.  The LMB catch rate is equivalent to the state median and two times the local median.</p>",

Bluegill PSD was 41.4.  Gizzard shad, black crappie, and yellow perch were sampled at above median levels.  Largemouth bass were sampled in all gear types, and natural reproduction verified by 1/4\" trapnets.  Four year-classes of bass showed good growth rates.  A hybrid muskie and smallmouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The hybrid muskie from the 1989 stocking showed good growth.  Gizzard shad, smallmouth bass, sauger, yellow perch, and carp were likely introduced to Rebecca Lake by a temporary failure of the fish barrier.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Rebecca, a remnant of an abandoned channel of the adjacent Mississippi river, is entirely encompassed by Lake Rebecca Park, owned by the City of Hastings and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Rebecca Lake is aerated in the winter.  Water quality of the lake is poor as a result of nutrient loading from storm sewers, street runoff and influxes from the Mississippi River and nearby agricultural activities. Surface water zoning prohibits all but electric motors on the lake. Facilities in the park include a boat landing, fishing pier and wharf, walking trails along with Porta Potties and a picnic area. Extensive shore fishing areas can also be found at Rebecca Lake. The lake is frequently inundated by flood waters of the Mississippi and the fish population reflects the influence that flooding events can have on adjacent waters. <br> \nBluegill and Crappie species made up most of the catch in 2018.  Bluegill were common and relatively abundant for lakes similar to Rebecca.  Average size of Bluegill sampled was good, with an average size measuring more than 6 inches in length.  Crappie sampled in 2018 were generally small, with all Crappie sampled being smaller than 10 inches.  Northern Pike were sampled in above average numbers in 2018, and were of good size, averaging 27 inches.  Common Carp were sampled in low numbers in 2018, and ranged from 23.4 to 28.2 inches.  Other fish observed in low abundance were seven Bowfin and six Yellow Bullhead. Bowfin had a mean length of 25.1 inches and were of good size while Yellow Bullhead mean length was 12.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Crappie sampled in 2012 were generally small, with only one crappie larger than 9\" observed.  Northern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2012, and were large.  The average size northern pike observed was 30\" long and weighed 6.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers, with some larger fish present in the catch.  One bass in 5 sampled exceeded 16\" in length.  Walleye, sauger and channel catfish were sampled in very low numbers in 2012.</p>",

Eleven  17-20\" carp were netted.  Black bullhead and black crappie numbers were well above the medians and yellow perch were slightly below median levels.  Small mesh trapnet catches also showed the presence of gizzard shad and white suckers.

                "narrative": "<p>Rebecca Lake's largemouth bass population remains stable; with fair numbers of fish, as well as good size fish.  Thirty largemouth bass were captured by electrofishing on August 15, 1996.  This is up from 1995, but a little below the lake's long term average.  These fish ranged from just under eight to twenty-two inches long.  Average length was just under thirteen inches. Over half of the fish were greater than twelve inches long and one third were greater than sixteen inches long.  The lake's bluegill population remains low, but with good size fish.  One angler commented to DNR crew on difficulty in catching bluegill.  Three quarter of the bluegill captured during the assessment were greater than six inches long, and just over one quarter were greater than seven inches long.  Black crappie were the most abundant fish, but were small - no fish greater than seven and a half inches long and over 90% were between five and a half and seven inches long.  Northern pike catch was up from previous assessments.  Fish were between twenty-one and thirty-three inches long, with two over thirty inches.  Northern pike growth rate is very good.  Yellow perch catch was also up, but fish were small - no fish over six and a half inches long, and 75% between five and six inches long.  Walleye remain uncommon - only three were captured.  These ranged from seventeen to twenty-two inches long.  Other fish captured were: one smallmouth bass; two yellow bullhead; one black bullhead; eight common carp; and six white sucker.  No tiger muskie were captured.   </p>",

The average bluegill captured was 6.45 inches and 0.19 pounds (5.26 fish/pound). Approximately 30% of all bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or larger. Black crappie were sampled above median levels for abundance and averaged 7.8 inches and 0.29 pounds (3/4 fish/pound). A few white crappies averaging 10.5 inches were also captured. White bass are also present in good numbers with the average fish captured being 11.5 inches and 0.76 pounds. Northern pike were sampled in good numbers for combined gear types. The average size of northern pike sampled was 25.8 inches and 4.1 pounds. Of all northern pike captured, 20% were 30.0 inches or larger. Largemouth bass were sampled near median levels for abundance. The average largemouth bass collected was 11.3 inches and 0.8 pounds. Smallmouth bass are also present in the lake. Walleye and sauger are present even though neither species has been stocked here since the lake was reclaimed in Fall 1997. The average walleye sampled was 17.8 inches and 1.8 pounds. The average sauger was 13.8 inches and 0.78 pounds. These species migrated into the lake when the Mississippi River reached flood stage in Spring 2001. Channel catfish have been stocked since 1998 and are doing well. The average channel catfish collected was 17.1 inches and 1.8 pounds. </p>",

Growth of largemouth bass was also good.  The single sauger captured is believed to be a migrant from the Mississippi - its growth was average.  Four walleye were sampled - none younger than V+.  The walleye sampled exhibited fast growth.  One gizzard shad was sampled - probably a migrant from the Mississippi.  Carp were sampled in low numbers, but small fish sampled indicate recruitment is occurring.  Small numbers of yellow perch were sampled - their origin is unknown.</p>",

Black crappies were sampled above median levels for abundance in the trap nets and within the median levels for the gill nets. White crappies up to 14.65 inches were also sampled. Due to the 2001 flood a number of riverine species, bowfin, carp, gizzard shad, silver redhorse, shortnose gar, and white bass  are present in the lake. Walleye and sauger were sampled in low numbers.  Northern pike, largemouth bass and channel catfish were sampled in good numbers.       </p>",
