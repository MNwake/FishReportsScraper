                "narrative": "<p>North Browns Lake is located in south central Stearns County, north of Eden Valley.  It is the third in a series of lakes that outlet to the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  A survey was conducted in 2003 to assess fish populations, and included spring netting (just after ice-out), spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of North Browns.  Results were also compared to past surveys of North Browns (most recently in 1995) to track changes over time.  In addition, an estimate was made of the northern pike population.  While catch rates allow us to compare relative abundance among lakes, or over time, population estimates give us actual abundance, and suggest how many fish the lake can produce for anglers.  The survey also included shoreline seining, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.The immediate watershed of North Browns Lake is 4,000 acres, although the lake also receives inputs from Eden and Mud Lakes, which have a watershed of 24,000 acres.  Water clarity is typically greater than ten feet in spring, but declines later in summer.  Curled pondweed was found growing to the surface in most of the littoral area in early June.  The decay of this plant and its release of nutrients often lead to algal blooms.  The fishery of North Browns is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  In 2003, catch rates for northern pike were higher than normal for lakes similar to North Browns, but still similar to the catch rate in the 1995 survey.  Northern pike up to 34 inches (11 pounds) were sampled during the ice-out netting, while most of the fish were 14-28 inches.  Considering only individuals 16-34 inches, the population of northern pike was estimated to be 5,166 (15.9 fish/acre).  Fish outside this size range were not sampled well in the spring, so the estimate does not include small or very large fish.  By comparison, in Sugar Lake (Wright County), which has a very high population of northern pike, density was estimated to be 26 fish/acre.  In another Wright County lake with a  low population, density was estimated to be only 1.3 fish/acre.The walleye population of North Browns Lake is managed by routine stocking.  Fingerlings were used in the 1980's and 1990's, and catch rates have been below the median for lakes similar to North Browns.  However, average size of walleye sampled has generally been high, as it was in 2003 (3.0 pounds).  In an attempt to increase the population, walleye fry (as well as fingerlings) were stocked in 2003.  Some evidence of survival of the fry was seen in a fall electrofishing survey, and fry stocking will likely be used again in the future.  In cases where it has good success, fry stocking can result in a higher population of walleye, at a lower cost.Largemouth bass were sampled in spring by night electrofishing.  The catch rate was similar to 1990, and approximately half the average rate for lakes in the Montrose management area.  Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), half were greater than 12 inches.  The largest bass sampled in 2003 was 20.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers appeared to be above the range expected for lakes like North Browns, and similar to catch rates from the past two surveys.  Average size (0.28 pounds) was within the expected range, and most of the individuals were age 2 or age 3.  The average size of crappies may increase as these two year classes grow in the next few years.  The catch rate of bluegill in 2003 was near the average for this type of lake, but up from the 1995 survey.  Mean weight (0.23 pounds) was favorable, and unchanged from the 1995 survey.  A much higher catch rate of bluegill was reported in 1990, but average size was low (0.09 pounds).  Three bullhead species (yellow black, and brown) are present in North Browns Lake.   White sucker, common carp, and bowfin were all within normal ranges.  A few channel catfish were sampled during the survey, suggesting limited migration from nearby Long Lake, where catfish are more abundant. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Browns is a 324 acre lake located five miles north of Eden Valley in southern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 41 feet and a large watershed dominated by agriculture (64%) and pasture (20%). A public access is located on the northeast end of the lake. North Browns is primarily managed for Walleye. The last survey was in 2013. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Walleye, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nVery little emergent vegetation was found in 2013 or 2018. Submergent vegetation was not surveyed in 2018, but coontail and Canada waterweed were abundant in 2013. Water clarity was poor; Secchi depth was 3.5 feet in June. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 15 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is managed through stocking. Walleye numbers were not high, but within the expected range of values for lakes like North Browns and similar to the long term average. Walleye fry are stocked every other year, but some fingerlings and larger Walleye have been stocked when fry survival has been poor. Walleye ranged in length from 10.2 to 27.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.5 pounds. Thirty-nine percent of Walleye sampled were longer than 20 inches. Walleye ages ranged from two to 13 years old and growth was fast, reaching 20 inches in five years. High Northern Pike numbers likely limit Walleye survival. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have increased in recent surveys, but size remains acceptable. Lengths ranged from 14.6 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 3.1 pounds. Twenty-seven percent of pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and eight percent exceeded 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by day time electrofishing on May 29. The catch rate (18/hour) was lower than 2013 (33/hour) and well below the Sauk Rapids average of 43/hour. Lengths ranged from 5.8 to 18.5 inches with an average length of 12.1 inches. Fifty-seven percent of Largemouth Bass sampled were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were similar to 2013 and within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.4 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches. Five percent of Bluegill sampled were longer than eight inches. Black Crappie numbers were higher than in 2013 and above the expected range of values, but similar to the long term average. Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 11.7 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches. Twenty-six percent of Black Crappie sampled were longer than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was similar to 2013 and within the expected range of values for lakes similar to North Browns. However, catches were much higher in the 1980s and 1990s. As Northern Pike abundance has increased, Yellow Perch abundance has decreased. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish are abundant in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes and have colonized connected waters such as North Browns Lake. The catch in 2018 decreased from 2013. Channel Catfish were first found in the 2003 survey (2 fish). Lengths in 2018 ranged from 17.1 inches to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 5.0 pounds. Channel Catfish were more numerous in 2013, but smaller. In 2018 95% were 20 inches or longer and 52% were 24 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

It is the third in a series of lakes that outlet to the Sauk River Chain of Lakes. North Brown's has a maximum depth of 39 feet, moderate aquatic plant diversity, and supports a variety of angling opportunities.  The fishery of North Browns is managed for Walleye and prior to 2003 was sustained exclusively by fingerling stocking. Given the historically low gill net catches on North Brown's and the fact that Walleye fry have the potential to produce larger year classes at lower cost, a new stocking strategy using Walleye fry was implemented in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2003, the DNR has stocked between 120,000   310,000 fry every other year. The North Brown's Lake Association has also stocked fingerlings from 2002 to 2008. Fifty pounds or approximately 1,000 fingerlings were stocked each time. <br> \nBased on fall electrofishing results, success of the fry stocking over the past 14 years has been mixed. Catch rates of fingerlings have varied from zero to a high of 53.0/hour with an average return of 13.9 fingerlings per hour. This is less than the results observed on Horseshoe and Cedar Island lakes where fry have been used exclusively since 2001 and catches have averaged over 100 fingerlings per hour. In 2017, no Walleye fingerlings were sampled and only two larger Walleye that measured 17.3 and 19.1 inches in length were sampled. <br> \n  <br> \nIt was hoped that successful fry stocking would increase the Walleye catch rates in North Browns Lake which historically have been below the expected range (0.3 to 1.6/gill net). In the 2013 re survey, the Walleye catch rate was still low (0.8/gill net). Regardless of the stocking strategy, it is likely that high Northern Pike numbers are limiting the success of Walleye stocking. Since significant survival of fry has been found in some years, fry stocking will continue to be the preferred stocking strategy; however, fingerlings will be used on a contingency basis when fry survival is poor (<25/hour) as was done in 2017 when 898 fingerlings and 107 adults were stocked. Walleye fry will again be stocked in 2020. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in North Brown's Lake was conducted on August 14-15, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter) as well as one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for North Brown's Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling captured 16 species of fish, including one species that is intolerant of poor water quality or habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter). The near shore fish survey data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. An FIBI uses fish community data as a measurement of lake health. The FIBI score for North Browns Lake was 36.9 which was above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 24) using Tool 5. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Becker Lake is located in the Sauk River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The Northern Pike catch rate increased from the 1980 survey and was greater than the statewide median. Northern Pike growth rate was fast until age three, then slows to a normal rate. Black Crappie and Bluegill catch rates were greater than the state median and growth rates are good. The greatest number of panfish sampled were between three and five years old. One third of the Black Crappies sampled were 8.5 inches or longer. A normal amount of Largemouth Bass were sampled by trap nets.\n\nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  All of these species were sampled either within or below their expected ranges for similar lakes. \n</p>",

The average weight of pike (2.9 pounds) decreased from the previous survey but remained above average.  The catch rate of Walleye (0.3/gill net) decreased from the 1985 survey (1.0/gill net) and remained below the expected range of values.  Yellow Perch were sampled above the expected range for similar lakes however catches declined from previous surveys. Bluegill were sampled in high numbers above the average and increased from the 1985 survey. Although Black Crappie decreased from the previous survey catch rates remained above the expected range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.

                "narrative": "<p>North Browns Lake is a 324 acre lake located three miles north of the City of Eden Valley.  The maximum depth of the lake is 39 feet and during mid-August adequate oxygen is present down to 18 feet.  A public access is located on North Browns Lake in the northeast corner of the lake.         North Browns Lake is close to the City of St Cloud and within 70 miles of the Twin City Metro Area, and therefore gets a moderate amount of fishing pressure.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, and northern pike are the most common gamefish species taken in the lake.  In the summer of 1995, a population assessment was conducted on North Browns Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.        The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (19.2/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey (10.7/gill net) and remained above expected levels for lakes that are similar to North Browns.  The average size northern caught in gill nets was 2.2 pounds and 21.1 inches.  The largest northern pike caught was over 30 inches in length.  One to seven year old fish were sampled in gill nets with age four fish being most abundant.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The catch rate of walleye in gill nets (1.5/gill net) significantly increased from the 1990 survey (0.3/gill net) and rose to within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size walleye caught during our assessment was quite nice (2.4 pounds) and remained within expected levels for the lake type.  Overall, walleye sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 11.5-27.7 inches and averaged 18.9 inches in length.  The overall growth rate of walleye in North Browns was average when compared with other populations in the state.       The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in North Browns (185.7/gill net) significantly increased from the last survey (80.0/gill net) and remained above expected levels for this lake type.  The average size yellow perch caught in gill nets was 6.3 inches.  While this average size may seem small, yellow perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like the northern pike and walleye.       The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets (8.3/net) was high for this lake type.  Black crappies sampled ranged in length from 5.0-11.2 inches and averaged 8.5 inches in length.  The mean weight of black crappie caught in trap nets was good (0.4 pounds) and appeared to increase from the 1990 survey.            The trap net catch of bluegills in North Browns (15.0/trap net) appeared to decline from the previous netting in 1990 (111.5/lift).  Variation in catch rates of panfish are highly dependent on the weather during trapnetting, therefore, a change in catch rate like this may not always mean a significant change in the fish population.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 2.5-8.9 inches and averaged 6.1 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Brown's Lake is located in south-central Stearns County, north of Eden Valley.  It is the third in a series of lakes that outlet to the Sauk River Chain of Lakes.  A survey was conducted in 2013 to assess fish populations, including spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to previous surveys and lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of North Brown's. <br> \n   <br> \nThe immediate watershed of North Brown's Lake is 4,000 acres, although the lake also receives inputs from Eden and Mud Lakes, which have a watershed of 24,000 acres.  Water clarity is typically greater than ten feet during spring, but declines over summer.  Submersed plants were found growing as deep as 8.5 feet, but the overall plant community was not very diverse.  Coontail and Canada waterweed were the most common plant species found.  Curly-leaf pondweed was much less abundant than it was in 2003 when it was found growing over much of the shallow area of the lake.  The above average snowfall and unusually late spring may have contributed to the decline of this nuisance species.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in spring by day-time electrofishing.  The catch rate (33.0/ hr) was similar to the average rate for lakes in the Montrose management area (37.6/hr).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 2.3 pounds. Of the catchable size bass, 81 percent were greater than 12 inches and 58 percent were greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of North Brown's Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye.  In 2013, the catch of Northern Pike was higher than the expected range for lakes similar to North Brown's, and 2-3 times higher than desired.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 18.2 to 34.5 inches and averaged 23.2 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Estimated growth rates were similar to statewide averages and 34 percent of Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nThe Walleye population of North Brown's Lake is managed through stocking.  Fingerlings were used in the 1980s and 1990s, and catch rates were below the range of expected values for lakes similar to North Brown's.  In an attempt to increase the population, Walleye fry were stocked in the odd numbered years since 2003. Evidence of fry survival was seen in fall electrofishing surveys with 50 percent of the stockings producing medium to strong year classes, but the 2013 gill net catch was still low.  Walleye ranged in length from 17.6 to 23.8 inches and averaged 20.6 inches. Since fry stocking can result in a higher population of Walleye at a lower cost, it will still be the preferred stocking strategy, but Walleye fingerlings will be stocked when fry survival is poor. <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish population in North Brown's has increased significantly over the past ten years. Catfish catches went from a total of two fish in 2003 when they were first sampled, to 28/gill net in 2013.  Periods of high water likely allowed migration from nearby Long Lake and the rest of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, where Catfish are abundant.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 15.7 inches to 27.3 inches and averaged 18.8 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were average compared to the expected range for lakes similar to North Brown's, but catch rates have declined over the past two surveys.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.3 to 11.9 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and 0.36 pounds. Most of the individuals were age 2 or 3, indicating fast growth rates.  The average size of crappies may increase in the future as these two year classes grow. <br> \n   <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate in 2013 was above average for this lake class, but down from the previous two surveys.  Bluegill ranged in length from 1.8 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.3 inches and 0.22 pounds. Bluegill growth was fast and fish grew to six inches in three years.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low numbers included: three bullhead species (Yellow, Black, and Brown), White Sucker, Common Carp, and Bowfin. <br> \n</p>",
