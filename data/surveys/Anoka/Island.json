Several walleye were captured, migrants from Linwood or Martin lakes.  Largemouth bass numbers were low.  Bowfin, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch were also present.</p>",

Walleye, northern pike, black bullhead, bluegill, and black crappie were all found in numbers below the local and statewide medians for the respective gears.  Carp, black bullhead, and black crappie were, however, found in numbers significantly higher than the gill net medians.Northern pike numbers are below the medians.  This was also true in the 1960 lake survey.  Low reproduction and/or persistent winterkills account for this.  Black bullheads were found in low numbers in trap nets and high numbers in the gill net.  Previous surveys indicated fairly high numbers.  The fish tend to be somewhat small for commercial harvest.  Walleyes taken in the nets appear to be migrants from Martin Lake downstream which has been stocked in the recent past.  White crappie were above the local trap net median.  fish aged had II to VI annuli.  Fish with IV annuli were most common.  Black crappie catches were low in trap nets but quite high in the gill nets.  IV and V annulus black crappie were most abundant, and II annulus fish were also common.  II annulus crappie were growing at an average rate but IV and V annulus fish exhibited slow growth.  Bluegill were almost nonexistent in the catch.  Yellow perch were taken only by shoreline seining.  Largemouth bass were found to be all young fish.</p>",

Fish are known to move between the three lakes.Bluegill were present in average numbers for this type of lake.  Over 40% of the fish were at least 7 inches long and 5.9% were at least 8 inches long.  Catch in 1995 and 2000 were similar, much higher than in previous assessments.Black and white crappie were average in abundance.  White crappie had a higher average size, with one-third of the fish over 10 inches long compared to 4.3% of the black crappie.Northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass were present in low numbers.  A few northern pike were between 25 and 28 inches long.  Walleye were between 17 and 21 inches long.  Largemouth bass sampled were small, less than 12 inches long.Black, brown, and yellow bullhead were present in low numbers with most over 10 inches long.Bowfin, carp, and white sucker were present in average numbers.</p>",

Growth of NOP was good, but fish were of small average size.  Three strong year classes were identified despite the recent drought.  The walleye sampled were most likely migrants from Martin L. or Linwood L.  Growth of walleye was average for the area.  One walleye sampled was of the 1986 year class when walleye were stocked in both Linwood and Martin lakes.  The three walleye of the 1985 year class sampled would have migrated from Martin Lake (fry stocking).  No walleye were stocked in Linwood in 1985.  Bluegill were sampled in lower than median levels, although some larger individuals were sampled.  Largemouth bass from two year classes were sampled.  Natural reproduction of LMB was average for the area.  Black bullhead were taken at twice the median level.  All other species were sampled at low levels.  The fish population of Island Lake was typical of a Central Minnesota bass-panfish lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a small, hard-water lake located in northeastern Anoka County.  A number of lakes and marshy areas are present in the area.  The hills and uplands are usually well wooded with soils being mainly composed of a loamy sand.  Numerous well-grassed or brushy lowlands exist which contain the expected, characteristic peat soils.The lake maintains a dense growth of submerged aquatic vegetation in waters up to 10 feet in depth.  Two small areas near the east shore range from 15 to 20 feet deep; otherwise a high percentage of the lake is less than 15 feet.  Cattails form a fringe of varying depth along the shores except on the east side where A.W. Nelson has cleared a section for his boat livery and beach.  Further mechanical removal of cattails is planned by Mr. Nelson.  At the time of survey the water was clear and colorless - Secchi disc reading to 8 feet. Waters of the lake are said to never have more than a very light algal bloom.  Shoal water soils were judged to be about equally divided between firm sand and soft muck.  A small amount of clay and marl was observed in scattered areas.Net catches (numbers per set) when compared to the statewide medians indicate an average northern pike population with above normal numbers of black and yellow bullheads, perch, and black crappies.  The numbers of bluegills and largemouth bass appear to be somewhat below the average.  The population of an important predator, the dogfish, is near normal.During the past winters of 1950-51 and 1955-56 the lake has been opened to promiscuous fishing as a result of anticipated winterkills.  However, local residents contacted state that at no time were abnormal numbers of dead fish seen.Island Lake is located in an area of high fishing pressure.  However, until recent years it has experienced little of this pressure.  The establishing of a boat livery by A.W. Nelson on the east shore is responsible for increased angling on the lake.  In the past when but few local residents fished the lake good success was reported for northern pike, crappies, and bluegills.  Recently, however, angling success for bluegills has been poor.  No reduced angling success for other species has been reported.</p>",
