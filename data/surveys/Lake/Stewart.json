                "narrative": "<p>Stewart is a 248 acre lake located 10 miles north of Two Harbors, MN off County #131.  Stewart Lake has a developed, county administered access on the south side of the lake.  Maximum depth is 24 feet and 99% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Stewart has been stocked with walleye fry in 1988 and 1990.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1957, 1974, 1991, 1994 and 1997.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 4.7 per lift in 1997.  This index value was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Eighty one percent of the walleye sampled in 1997 were longer than 15 inches and the mean length was 18.5 inches.  Growth rates were average with walleye reaching 14.3 inches at age IV.  Only 5% of the walleye sampled in 1997 were aged to years correlating to fry stocking.     Northern pike abundance index of 8.3 per lift was also high compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Size, however, was relatively poor with only 24% of sampled northerns longer than 21 inches.  Northern pike length at age IV of 20.7 inches was slow compared to other populations sampled in the Duluth Area.     Yellow perch abundance index value of 12.2 per lift was average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Size structure and growth rate were both excellent, with 77% of sampled perch longer than 8 inches and a length at age IV of 8.9 inches.     Other fish species sampled during the 1997 assessment include pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",

The lake is located 10 miles north of Two Harbors, MN off County #131 and has a county administered, concrete, back-in access.  Stewart was surveyed during the summer of 2008 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (5.5) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 16.5 inches and growth was above average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A total of six year-classes were represented.  The 2005 year-class was the strongest, comprising 39% of captured fish.  Other year-classes sampled include 1994, 1998, 2001-2002, and 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 9.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2002 (8.3) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 24.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 through 2006 were represented except the 2000 and 2001 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.0 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (0.0) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 10.1 inches.  Not enough individuals were sampled (8) to evaluate stock density or growth.

The lake is located 10 miles north of Two Harbors, MN off County #131 and has a county administered, concrete, back-in access.  Stewart Lake young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye have been indexed annually since 2009 to examine the extent of natural reproduction following the discontinuation of walleye stocking.  Collection of this data is important as an early indicator of walleye year-class strength for Stewart Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nFourteen YOY walleye with a mean length of 6.2 inches were captured during the 2012 investigation for a catch rate of 13.5 per hour of electrofishing.  The catch rate from prior investigations ranged from 9.8 in 2011 to 13.9 per hour in 2009.  Average size from prior investigations ranged from 5.1 inches in 2009 to 6.2 inches in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nOne age-1 walleye was sampled in 2012 for a catch rate of 1.0 per hour of electrofishing.  The walleye captured was 9.7 inches long.  Zero age-1 walleye were captured during the 2009 and 2010 YOY walleye investigations, but four were captured in 2011.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stewart Lake is located about fifteen miles north of Two Harbors. There is a county owned public water access with concrete log boat ramp, mooring dock, and parking for up to six vehicles located at the end of County Road 131.  The lake has an area of 238 acres with a maximum depth of 20 feet and an average depth of 6 feet.  Boaters should use caution while navigating from the public access to the main part of the lake as there are several shallow and rocky areas between the islands.  The lake provides anglers opportunities to catch Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie.  A lake survey was conducted the week of August 3, 2020 to monitor the fish community in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was within the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Natural reproduction continues to support a Walleye population with age analysis identifying several year classes.  The average Walleye sampled was 17 inches long and weighed two pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was also within the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  Size was very good with an average length of 24 inches and weight of 3.9 pounds. Several year classes were identified indicating consistent natural reproduction recently. The current population offers anglers good opportunities for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch was higher than would be expected compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 6.5 inches with a maximum observed length of 8 inches. Bluegill recruit consistently, but year class strength appears to be quite variable.  Most panfish in the lake are shorter than 7 inches, anglers should limit harvest of larger individuals to protect and improve panfish size structure. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was well above the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Average length of perch was 7.5 inches with 10 percent of the catch 9 inches or longer and the longest fish measuring almost 11 inches.  Yellow Perch recruitment is also consistent and growth is normal compared to other area lakes.  The Yellow Perch population is large enough and has fish of large enough size to be worth targeting by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch was similar to previous surveys of the lake and within the normal range. Average length was just under ten inches with a maximum observed length of 12 inches.  White Sucker and Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled in large numbers during the survey. <br> \n</p>",

The 1994 population assessment confirmed the presence of nice sized walleye with an average length of 17.3 inches and occasional fish up to 26 inches.  Walleye abundance has declined from previous levels although is typical of other lakes of similar physical and chemical features.     Northern pike average 18.7 inches with a rare fish over 35 inches.  Abundance levels are high.     The yellow perch population is one of the top in the Duluth area.  Abundance is very high with over 80% of the fish longer than 8 inches and with very fast growth.     Panfish are limited to an occasional black crappie or pumpkinseed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stewart is a 248 acre lake with 247 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 24 feet. The lake is located 10 miles north of Two Harbors, MN off County #131 and has a county administered, concrete, back-in access.  Stewart was last assessed in 2008.  Stewart was surveyed during the summer of 2014 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate natural walleye recruitment after the discontinuation of walleye stocking (2002).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2008 (2.2) but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, this catch is the lowest documented on Stewart in eight investigations dating back to 1950.  Walleye average length was 15.8 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A total of nine year-classes were represented.  Recruitment appears relatively stable, with only two missing year-classes from 2002 through 2012.  All year-classes beyond 2002 are exclusively from natural reproduction.  However, all year-classes appear fairly weak, with no more than three specimens captured in any given year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 8.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2008 (9.2) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 21.1 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fourteen percent of the captured fish were greater than 30 inches in length, with fish up to 37.6 inches sampled.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2007 through 2013 represented.  The 2011 year-class was strong, contributing to 46% of the overall catch.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 32.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2008 (25.2) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of Perch was 8.2 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2006 through 2012 represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.3 per trapnet lift was down from 2008 (17.5) but still above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 6.3 inches and specimens were sampled up to 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was up from 2008 (1.0) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was 9.5 inches.  Although Black Crappie were not aged for this assessment, some smaller fish were captured in the gillnets, suggesting that fairly consistent recruitment is occurring. <br> \n <br> \nNo prior Largemouth Bass electrofishing assessments have been conducted on Stewart Lake, but Largemouth Bass were sampled with regular assessment gear from 1946 to 1957.  Zero Largemouth Bass were sampled, for a catch rate of 0.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was also collected on aquatic vegetation.  Twenty-five aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 176 sampling points.  Bushy pondweed was the most frequently found plant (25% of stations sampled) followed by Robbins' pondweed (16%) and flat-stem pondweed (13%).  Several other additional plants were documented but did not fall within the designated sampling stations including; blue flag iris, broad-leaved cattail, broad-leaved arrowhead, jewelweed, reed canary grass, skullcap group, Joe-pye weed, St. John's-wort, swamp candles group, swamp five-finger, water horehound and variable-leaf pondweed.  These data can be compared to future aquatic plant surveys of Stewart Lake to estimate how the plant community may be changing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stewart is a 248 acre lake with 247 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 24 feet.  The lake is located 10 miles north of Two Harbors, MN off County #131 and has a County administered, concrete, back-in access.  Walleye fry have been stocked in 1990, 1998, 2000 and 2002.  The primary management species are walleye and yellow perch and the secondary management species is northern pike.     Walleye abundance of 5.5 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Of the 38 aged walleye from the 2002 investigation, only nine (18%) were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  Age analysis also revealed a strong (34%) naturally reproduced 1999 year-class.  Mean length of 16.3 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 16.7 inches.       Yellow perch abundance of 27.3 was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 8.3 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 9.2 inches.  Age analysis revealed only 6 of 164 perch older than four, and fish in all year-classes from 1998 through 2001.     Northern pike abundance of 8.3 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 20.1 is large.  Growth was average with length at age four of 21.3 inches.  Age analysis revealed steady recruitment and all year-classes from 1995 through 2001 represented.     Pumpkinseed sunfish abundance of 13.2 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 4.5 inches was small.     Bluegill were sampled in 2002 for the first time since 1950.  Bluegill abundance of 3.4 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 4.3 inches was small.  Growth was fast with length at age three of 5.5 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and no fish older than three.          Other fish species sampled in Stewart lake include black crappie and white sucker.  Black crappie have been sampled at very low abundance.     Stocking of walleye fry in Stewart lake has resulted in only limited contribution to natural reproduction.  The lake management plan will be revised in 2003.</p>",
