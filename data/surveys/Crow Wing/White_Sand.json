Water level fluctuations are rather extreme and most of the lake's once dense hardstem bulrush fringe has been removed by riparian owners during low water years.  Whitesand Lake has a relatively extensive shoal area and little fishing structure, but provides good fishing opportunities.In 1995, northern pike were found in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes and were represented by seven year classes showing good growth.  Brown bullheads, yellow bullheads, pumpkinseeds, rock bass and yellow perch were found in \"low\" numbers.  Walleyes were found in \"average\" numbers, as were largemouth bass, bluegills, black crappies and black bullheads.</p>",

Previous walleye stocking ended in 1997.  Prior to that, they were stocked annually as fry.  Gill net catches since 1949 have ranged from 0.2 to 7.6/gill net with mean and median catches of 2.8 and 2.4/gill net, respectively.  At 2.4/gill net, this was the first time since 1990 that the catch has exceeded the lake class median  Most of these fish (91%) were the result of the 2005 stocking of yearling and adult fish. Mean length and weight were 18.3\" and 2.2 lbs.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was the third highest of the 12 nettings to date and in the third quartile for the lake class at 9.0/gill net.  Previous catches ranged from 2.2/gill net (1985) to 15.5/gill net (1995) with mean and median catches of 6.7 and 6.4/gill net, respectively.  Eight year classes were represented with the 2006 year class (age 2) contributing 53% of the catch.  Fish from the 2000-2005 year classes accounted for an additional 44% of the catch.  Mean length and weight were 19.4\" and 1.8 lbs with only 19% measuring at least 24\".  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was in the upper quartile for the lake class at 6.1/gill net with 40% measuring at least 8\".  Past catches have ranged from 0.2 to 16.3/gill net.  Yellow perch abundance has been relatively low since the 1950's.  The 2008 catch of 2.2/gill net is only the third time in 9 nettings since 1956 that the catch has been above the first quartile.   <br> \n</p>",

With heavy rain and snowfall in recent years, White Sand looks much different, with water up into trees and into lawns and even houses in some areas.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community is diverse, with largemouth bass and black crappies currently providing the best options for anglers.  Bass were sample by night electrofishing in the spring at a high rate of 133.5/hr.  Average length was 13.3\" and 64% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Black crappie were caught in average numbers for this type of lake at 4.6/gill net.  Crappies had an average length of 7.2\" and 39% of the fish measured 8\" or larger.  Fish up to 12.0\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nAnother possible option in White Sand are walleyes.  They are stocked as yearlings or adults up to 512 lbs. in a 4 year window.  This basically makes them catchable almost immediately and the netting showed that, as all of the fish were 17\" or larger, with an average length of 20.5\".  The net catch of 2.3/gill net was average for this type of lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and bluegill weren't as impressive.  Northern pike numbers and size have been a problem in the past.  Since the water level fluctuates dramatically, spawning habitat for pike can disappear in low years and be abundant, with many connections to suitable spawning, in high years.  Numbers were down a little in this survey at 6.6/gill net, a reasonable level.  In high water years, it is not feasible to operate the northern pike spawning barriers in 2 locations on the lake that may help.  Size was relatively small, with an average length of 17.8\" and 9% of the fish above the 22\"-26\" protected slot.  Bluegill numbers were average at 9.7/trap net with an average length of 5.3\" and 24% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake's once dense hardstem bulrush fringe has by and large been removed by riparian owners typically during low water years.  Whitesand has an extensive shoal area and very little fishing structure, but still provides some good fishing opportunities.  The water clarity is good, with an 11 foot secchi disc reading.In 2000, northern pike were found in average numbers compared to similar lake types and were represented by 6 year classes and showed good growth.  Walleye, black crappie, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and yellow bullheads were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Sand Lake is a 368 acre lake that lies within the city of Baxter, Minnesota.  The lake is highly developed and water levels fluctuate widely with groundwater levels.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 10 feet in 2013. The lake's once dense hardstem bulrush fringe has been significantly reduced due to removal by lakeshore owners, typically during low water years.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Vegetation also provides spawning habitat and cover for fish. The lake has an extensive shoal area with little fishing structure, but still provides good fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a rate of 67.2/hr. run-time. Average length was 13.3 inches with a maximum length of 19.1 inches. The northern pike gillnet catch of 12.2/net was above average.  Average size was 19.7 inches and 1.9 lbs. Fish at least 24 inches long accounted for 18% of the catch. Two and three year old fish (2010 and 2011 year classes) made up 57% of the catch. These fish were between 14 and 23 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sand is stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year.  These stockings appear to be providing anglers with an occasional walleye catch. The walleye gillnet catch of 1.2/net was average when compared with similar lakes.  Average size was 18.3 inches and 2.4 lbs, with walleyes up to 22 inches captured.  Walleye 15 inches or longer accounted for 64% of the catch and 55% were 20 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies had a gillnet catch of 8.7/net and a trap net catch of 2.2/net.  Past gillnet catches have ranged from 0.2/net (1985) to 16.3/net (1956).  Average length was 6.7 inches with a maximum length of 11.9 inches.  For both gillnets and trap nets combined, 27% of the black crappies were at least 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for bluegill, rock bass, and yellow bullhead were average in 2013 compared to similar lakes, and catches of yellow perch, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish) were relatively low.  Research has shown that large, nest protecting, bluegill are important to the fish community but are especially vulnerable to angler harvest.  Please consider releasing them. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Sand is a 368 acre lake that lies within the City of Baxter, Minnesota.  The lake is highly developed and water levels fluctuate widely with changes in groundwater levels.  The lake's once dense hardstem bullrush fringe has, by and large, been removed by riparian owners, typically during low water years.  The lake has an extensive shoal area and very little fishing structure, but still provides some good fishing opportunities.  The water clarity remains good, with a secchi disc reading of 9.5 feet in August, 2005.In 2005 catch rates of rock bass yellow perch and three bullhead species were low compared to similar type lakes.  The bluegill catch was in the high category and catches of northern pike, walleye, black crappie, dogfish, largemouth bass and pumpkinseed were average when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in White Sand Lake was conducted on July 1-2, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Ten sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance.  White Sand Lake is at the top of the watershed and has limited connectivity, it is common for lakes with limited connectivity to have a smaller number of species than lakes that are more connected.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data are combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicate White Sand Lake is healthy with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
