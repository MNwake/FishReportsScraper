The average length was 12.0 inches with a few fish larger than 17 inches. Average size was similar to past assessments, although growth remained slower than other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike numbers (2.8 per lift) and average size (16.1 inches) were below average for the lake class. Growth was also slower than other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were below average (4.2 per lift) but their size was larger than average with several fish greater than nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first assessment where bluegill sampled in trap nets. Three, age-3 fish were caught ranging in size from 7.0 to 7.5 inches. Growth was above average. <br> \n <br> \nAccess to South McDougal is through North McDougal Lake; take the channel from the south side of the west basin of North McDougal Lake to South McDougal Lake. The McDougal Lakes have very dark bog stained water with shallow boulder areas. Caution is advised when boating on these lakes. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye catch in this survey is considered normal for this lake.  The largest walleye sampled was seven pounds but almost all were less than 16 inches with an average size of about one pound.Northern pike were collected in average numbers which is normal for this lake.  The largest northern pike sampled was 13.4 pounds but the majority of the fish were less the 20 inches with an average size of 1.0 pound.Yellow perch were collected in relatively low numbers but nearly half of the yellow perch taken were between 9 inches and 11 inches.  The largest yellow perch taken in this survey was 12.3 inches.The public can access South McDougal Lake by boat or canoe through the channel that connects with North McDougal Lake.  Caution should be used when motoring to South McDougal Lake since the shallow reefs present are not readily visible in the dark water.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South McDougal Lake is located in the Isabella area within the Superior National Forest. The lake is shallow, with a maximum depth of just seven feet, and 287 acres in size. Anglers access the lake by boating from North McDougal Lake upstream via Coyote Creek approximately 1.6 miles. The current fish community is maintained by natural processes that regulate the populations of each species that inhabit the lake. A standard survey was complete in 2021 to monitor the status of the fisheries resources in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers that make their way to South McDougal Lake in the coming years will be greeted by an abundant Walleye population with a small size structure. The 2021 catch rate of 13.7 per gill net was above normal for similar lakes and the highest to date from nine previous surveys of the lake. Size of Walleye captured from all gears combined ranged from 7.2 to 26.2 inches, but a majority of the fish were less than a foot long. Age analysis determined eleven year classes were represented in the catch with the 2019 year class accounting for 35% of the catch. These results indicate that natural reproduction continues to provide a Walleye population with good opportunities for smaller fish along with the potential for catching a quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 2.33 per gill net was below the normal range for similar lakes, but not significantly different from historic catches on the lake. While most pike captured tend to be of a small size, fish exceeding 30\" long have been sampled in surveys fairly regularly over the years. Although unlikely to encounter a trophy sized pike, anglers have a reasonable chance to catch this hard fighting species.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are a relatively new species to the McDougal chain of lakes and appear to have established a self-sustaining population throughout the system. They were first sampled from Middle McDougal Lake in 2000, when all of the lakes in the chain where sampled in a single season. They have subsequently been sampled in all of the surveys of North, Middle, and South McDougal Lakes. The 2021 catch rate of 3.89 per trap net was the highest to date on South McDougal Lake. Anglers able to catch Bluegill from the lake will appreciate the large size structure of the current population as the average size of fish sampled was over eight inches long. <br> \n</p>",

Average size of Walleye has diminished over the last two assessments, from 13.9 inches in 1986, to 11.0 inches in 1988 and 1991. Natural reproduction is evident, but 63% of the aged sample corresponds with stocking in adjoining North McDougal Lake. This correlation suggests the Walleye population in South McDougal Lake may be influenced by stocking in North McDougal.      The Northern Pike gillnet catch was at an all time low, however this decrease was not noted in trapnets. The last 2 assessments have sampled Yellow Perch at less than half their former levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South McDougal Lake is a 273 acre lake located 11.0 miles west of Isabella, Minnesota within the Superior National Forest.  The shoreline around the lake is forested in the upland and bog in the lowland areas.  There is a mix of private and public ownership along the lake shoreline.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet although most of the lake is 5.0 feet or less.  The Secchi disk measurement was 2.4 feet in brown bog-stained water.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse and grows to depths of 3.0 feet along the mainly gravel and sand shoreline.  There are several areas in the lake with submerged boulder pockets as well as many large boulders throughout the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAccess to South McDougal Lake is via Coyote Creek (1.6 miles upstream) from North McDougal Lake.  Coyote Creek does have some submerged rocks and tree stumps; caution is advised when navigating the creek. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch are the primary game fish found in South McDougal Lake.  The 2015 Walleye gill net and trap net catches were above average compared to similar lakes in the area but growth of Walleye was slow for the Finland Area. The average weight of the Walleye caught was 0.5 pounds and measured 11.2 inches in length.  The largest Walleye sampled was 18.4 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Ten year classes were represented in the sample with 43 percent being comprised of ages 1 and 2, indicating good natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch was near the average for the lake class and higher than the three previous investigations on the lake, although growth of pike was very slow when compared to the average for the Finland Area.  Northern Pike averaged 15.8 inches in length with an average weight of 0.9 pounds; largest fish sampled was 26.0 inches and 3.4 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was near the average for the area and growth was fast in younger year classes and was considered average with the older year classes.  The average weight of Yellow Perch was 0.2 pounds with an average length of 6.9 inches; the largest fish sampled was 9.9 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Six year classes were present in the sample with age-2 and age- 3 comprising 70 percent of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nSixteen Bluegills were caught in trap nets, which were slightly above average for the lake class and higher than previous assessments on South McDougal Lake.  The average Bluegill length in 2015 was 8.3 inches and the average weight was 0.54 pounds.  The largest individual was 10.6 inches and weighed 1.1 pounds (age-10).  Bluegill growth was above average compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Smallmouth Bass were sampled in South McDougal Lake, both age-11 and weighing over 3 pounds each.  Smallmouth Bass are present in other lakes in the McDougal chain and in the Stony River system. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Suckers were sampled at lower than average numbers with gill nets and at average numbers with trap nets.  The average size of White Sucker was 16.0 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Golden Shiner, Spottail Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Tadpole Madtom comprise the rest of the non-game fish community in the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population in South McDougal Lake is comprised of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker and burbot.     Test nets in 1996 sampled fewer walleye than in previous assessments but abundance is still about average compared to similar lakes of this type. Walleye collected ranged in size from 6.3 inches to 29 inches (8.0 pounds) and although large walleye (greater than 7 pounds) are occasionally sampled they are not common. The average size of walleye taken in the 1996 assessment were small, averaging 11.3 inches with approximately 80% of the fish smaller than 14 inches (1.0 pound).     The northern pike fishery in South McDougal Lake is one of low quality as the population borders on being average at best and the size is smaller than average. The lake historically has produced mostly very small northern pike and this was observed again in 1996 with no fish over 22 inches sampled.     Yellow perch abundance is about average compared to similar class lakes with fewer individuals near 12 inches taken in test nets. Yellow perch are not normally sought by anglers here although there appears to be a fair number larger than 9 inches present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper McDougal Lake is a 262 acre, soft-water lake of the Kawishiwi Watershed. The maximum depth is five feet, and there are four inlets and an outlet. Shoal soils are mostly sand or muck, with areas of occasional gravel or boulders. The lake is accessible through the outlet channel and a private road on the north side of the lake.     At the time of the survey two cabins were present on the lake. The remaining portion of the lake was surrounded by forest land. Aquatic vegetation was sparse in Upper McDougal Lake, and submerged aquatic plants were found to in depths to 1.5 feet.      Most of the Walleye sampled were below 15 inches in length, the Northern Pike ranged between 9 and 25 inches in length. Shoreline seining results indicate current natural reproduction of Walleye, Yellow Perch and White Sucker. Several species of minnow were also taken. Spawning conditions were rated \"poor\" for Largemouth Bass and panfish, \"fair\" for Northern Pike and Smallmouth Bass, and \"fair to good\" for Walleye. Fishing had generally been poor during the current season. June has usually been the best month for fishing in past years.</p>",
