                "narrative": "<p>South Lida Lake is a 856-acre moderately fertile lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2000 lake survey was 8.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.  Water clarity in this lake diminishes periodically due to plankton/algae blooms.  South Lida Lake is included in lake class 25 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed.  Eighty-six homes/cabins and two resorts/campgrounds were recorded in the 1997 lake resurvey.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the eastern shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     South Lida Lake is a popular angling lake.  The species most sought after are walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.       The test-net catch rate of walleye was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The walleye catch rate has been within or exceeded the normal range in every survey conducted on this lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 27.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17.3 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Thirty-one percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at four years of age.      The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of surveys has remained within the normal range for lake class 25.  Age data indicate that the 1998 year class is very strong.  This year class should provide good bluegill angling in the future.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at five years of age.       As part of a statewide experimental regulations project, an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie was implemented in 1997 on South and North Lida Lakes and will be in effect through 2005.  The intent of the regulation is to increase the average size of black crappie in the Lida Lakes. A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  Crappies ranged in length from 4.7 to 12.7 inches with an average length and weight of 8.8 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Sixteen percent of the crappies were at least 11.0 inches in length.  Crappies reach an average length of 11.4 inches at five years of age.     The DNR does not stock any fish in South Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present. To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2011 year class is strong and should provide good walleye angling in the future.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.5 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The general trend over recent surveys has been an increase in northern pike abundance.  Age and length data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.5 to 34.6 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black crappies ranged in length from 6.1 to 13.0 inches with a mean length of 10.2 inches.  Thirty-seven percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill population is very abundant and  has a good size structure.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 7.9 inches at age-VI. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Lida Lake is a 856-acre moderately fertile lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2003 lake survey was 8.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.  Water clarity in this lake diminishes periodically due to plankton/algae blooms.  South Lida Lake is included in lake class 25 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed.  Eighty-six homes/cabins and two resorts/campgrounds were recorded in the 1997 lake resurvey.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the eastern shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     South Lida Lake is a popular angling lake.  The species most sought after are walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant.       The test-net catch rate of walleye exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The walleye test-net catch rate has been within or exceeded the normal range in every survey conducted on this lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.8 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.7 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Northern pike reproduction rates increased during the late 1990's due to high water levels which increased accessability to suitable spawning habitat.  Northern pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Twenty-six percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 21.1 inches at four years of age.      The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of surveys has remained within the normal range for lake class 25.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that bluegill year class strength is variable which results in fluctuations of size structure.  In this survey, only five percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.       As part of a statewide experimental regulations project, an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie was implemented in 1997 on South and North Lida Lakes and will be in effect through 2005.  The intent of the regulation is to increase the average size of black crappie in the Lida Lakes.  A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted in 2002 to analyze the black crappie population.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.6 to 12.1 inches with an average length and weight of 9.6 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Fifteen percent of the crappies were at least 11.0 inches in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.4 inches at four years of age.     The DNR does not stock any fish in South Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present. To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.9 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     An 11.0-inch minimum length limit for Black Crappie was implemented in 1997 to improve and maintain the size structure of the Black Crappie population. Catch and length data from ensuing special spring surveys indicate that the regulation improved size structure and is now maintaining a high quality Black Crappie population.  In this survey, Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.8 to 13.8 inches with an average length of 10.6 inches.  Thirty-four percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     South Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The 1980 and 1984 year classes, which were skip years, were present in good numbers, which indicates good natural reproduction.  <br> \n     The tullibee population is maintaining stable numbers with moderate harvest pressure being exerted.  <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment indicates largemouth bass have a good population size structure with above average number of age classes II+ and III+ bass.  <br> \n      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 survey was 2.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these populations. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 12.9 to 26.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2011 and 2012 year classes are strong.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.7 inches at age four. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has increased in recent surveys.  Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 32.7 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.9 inches at age four.  <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 18.3 pounds with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.2 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 9.5 inches.  Seventeen percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The Bluegill population is abundant and has a good size structure.  Thirty percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     South Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

Other area lakes in this class are: Beers, Heilberger, Stuart, Sybil, and Swan. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance remained below normal at 2.5 per gill net lift, similar to the 1988 survey.  The average individual weight has steadily increased from 1.5 pounds in the 1975 survey to 2.5 pounds.   <br> \n     Black bullhead abundance declined from 9.3 per gill net lift in 1988 to 0.8, and is now within the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 16.6 per trap net lift in 1988 to 43.9, which remains within the normal range.  There were no substantial changes in bluegill size structure from the 1988 to the 1991 sample.  Eighteen percent of the bluegills measured were greater than seven inches in length compared to 14% in 1988.  Bluegill recruitment is consistent as indicated by the presence of five consecutive year classes in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 23.0 per gill net lift in 1988 to 38.7, exceeding the normal range.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance was unchanged from 1988 to 1991 with a gill net catch rate of 4.8 per lift for both surveys, and remains within the normal range.  Walleye natural reproduction is evident as year classes were sampled for all skip years in the past stocking sequence.   Walleye growth rates approximate the statewide average. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 27.7 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2012 year class is strong and should provide good Walleye angling in the future.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at age four. <br> \n     Recent surveys have shown an increase in Northern Pike abundance.  Age and length data indicate that pike reproduction is consistent.  Pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 32.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at age four.  <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 10.1 inches.  Thirty percent of crappies sampled were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The Bluegill population is very abundant and has a moderate size structure.  Twelve percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is a 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  South Lida Lake is included in lake class 25; other area lakes in this same classification include Franklin, Leek, West Silent, Sybil, and South Turtle.\n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\n     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.\n     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes.  The walleye test-net catch rate has been within or exceeded the expected range in every survey conducted on this lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 12.1 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Data from a fall electrofishing assessment indicate that the 2006 year class is very strong and should provide good walleye angling in the future.\n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.5 to 34.6 inches with an average length and weight of 24.1 inches and 3.3 pounds.\n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black crappies ranged in length from 3.4 to 12.7 inches with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Fourteen percent of the crappie sample was 11.0 inches or greater in length.  \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for similar lakes.  Fourteen percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.\n     The DNR does not stock any fish in South Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26 inches allowed.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum size limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of the respective populations.\n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    South Lida Lake is a 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwest Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 5.4 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for this type of lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate has been within or exceeded the expected range in every survey conducted on this lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.8 to 27.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2006 year class is strong and should provide good walleye angling in the future.  Walleye reach an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 18.7 to 32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 25.2 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Pike reach an average length of 23.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Bass reach an average length of 14.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black crappies ranged in length from 5.5 to 12.2 inches with a mean length of10.0 inches.  Eleven percent of the crappie sample was 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies reach an average length of 10.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Thirty-six percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 7.7 inches at age-VII. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26 inches allowed.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum size limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of the respective populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 9.2 feet.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.9 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has declined in recent surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.7 to 24.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.8 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has increased in recent surveys.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve and maintain the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     South Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Lida Lake is an 856-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.9 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2022.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is extremely abundant and has a high quality size structure.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Ninety-nine percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 51% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.4 inches at seven years of age.  <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have also been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to maintain the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n     South Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",
