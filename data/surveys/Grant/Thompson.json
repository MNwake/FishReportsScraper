                "narrative": "<p>Yellow Perch gill net catches increased in 1990 to an average catch of 82.5 perch/gill net. Previous surveys conducted in 1965, 1979, 1980 and 1985 indicated a range of catch rates from 79.0 fish/gill net in 1965 to 18.0 fish/gill net in 1985. While Yellow Perch gillnet catches increased, PSD has decreased from 54.0% in 1980 to 1.0% in 1990. This decrease in PSD values indicates a strong year class was established in 1988. The abundant Yellow Perch population provides an excellent forage base for Northern Pike and Walleye. Growth rates reflect forage abundance. Age 4 Walleye averaged 19.16 inches. The sample of Walleye captured was comprised of four year classes, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988. Presence of Walleye is either the result of natural reproduction, illegal stocking, or migration into lake in 1986 or 1987 during high water. The 1988 year class would have to represent natural reproduction or illegal stocking. The state has not stocked any Walleyes in Thompson Lake since the 1970's.  A 1985 survey makes reference to an illegal stocking in 1983.  Gillnet catch averaged 1.5 Walleye/net in the 1990 assessment. Captured Walleye had a mean weight of 3.3. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a 150-acre basin located five miles north of Hoffman in Grant County.  It is a relatively shallow, turbid, and excessively fertile lake that is prone to occasional fish kills.  Diversity and abundance of rooted aquatic plants are limited.  Aquatic vegetation provides critical habitat for many fish species. Strong winds and wave actions can result in re-suspension of fine silts and attached nutrients, stimulating frequent algal blooms.  Water clarity and recreational uses can be seasonally impaired.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch statistics from the 2015 survey suggest possible occurrence of a partial fish kill event in advance of the survey.  This is most evident in Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie catch data.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings have been stocked in odd-numbered years since 2003.  Walleye catches were elevated during the 2015 survey with a catch rate of 12.0-fish/gill net.  A few larger Walleye were present but the catch was largely comprised of juvenile fish no older than age two.  These young fish were likely products of fingerling and yearling stockings in 2013 and early 2015.  Bluegill catches declined from 12.0-fish/trap net in 2009 to 2.9-fish/trap net in 2015.  Black crappie catches were also low in 2015.  All Bluegill and Black Crappie catches were comprised of young fish.  However, these young fish grow rapidly in this fertile basin.  In 2015, average size was 6.9 inches for Bluegill and 8.4 inches for Black Crappie.  The largest Bluegill measured was 9.8 inches.  The largest Black Crappie measured 10.9 inches.  Thompson Lake currently supports an excellent Largemouth Bass fishery.  Spring 2015 electrofishing results indicated record-high bass abundance and exceptional size structure.  Almost 25% of the electrofishing sample exceeded 15.0 inches and the largest bass collected measured 19.9 inches.  The Yellow Perch population also exhibited a favorable size structure.  Good numbers of 8.0- and 9.0-inch perch were collected with the largest perch measuring 11.0 inches.  This population provides a unique angling opportunity because high-quality Yellow Perch populations are not common in the Glenwood Management Area.  No northern pike have been captured since 1999.  Limited aquatic vegetation and high water temperatures during summer months likely explain the absence of this cool water species.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers include Common Carp, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a small, shallow lake that is vulnerable to summerkill and winterkill events.  Thefish community in Thompson Lake is typical of lakes that experience occasional winterkill conditions. Yellow perch and black bullhead have been the predominate fish species since the initial lake surveyin 1965.  The latest winterkill likely occurred during the winter of 1992-93.A relatively strong walleye year class developed in 1993. Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of1993 following the suspected winterkill of 1992-93.  Walleye catches averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet and 11.3fish/trapnet.  Age-1 fish comprised the entire sample.  Fish ranged from 6.5 - 9.0 inches in totallength at time of capture.  These fish may provide some angling opportunities in 2-3 years in theabsence of future winterkill.  Yellow perch abundance declined significantly following the suspectedwinterkill.  Gillnet catches decreased from 82.5 fish/net in 1990 to 4.0 fish/net in 1994.  Predationby walleye may limit the expansion of the yellow perch population following the winterkill. Bluegilltrapnet catches averaged 1.7 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds.  Eighty percentof the fish captured were 6.0 inches or greater in length and over one-fourth exceeded 8.0 inches. Bluegill abundance has been limited on Thompson Lake since the initial survey in 1965.  Trapnet catchesranged from 0.1 - 6.0 fish/net in previous surveys.  Black bullhead catches averaged 22.5 fish/gillnetand 18.0 fish/trapnet.  Catch rates have been highly variable in past surveys.  Fish have been alwaystoo small for any commercial value.  Two pumpkinseed sunfish and one white sucker were the only otherfish captured in survey nets.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a relatively shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic lake located five miles north of Hoffman in Grant County.  Thompson Lake is prone to occasional partial winterkill events.  The last partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 1992-93.  Poor water clarity and degraded aquatic habitat have been reported since the 1970's.  Diversity and abundance of aquatic plants is limited.  Vegetation provides critical habitat for many fish species in healthy lake environments.  Fish community structure and lake survey catch rates continue to be quite variable.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 4.0 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 18.5 to 24.1 inches in total length.  Age distribution of walleye captured did not correspond to fry stocking chronology.  Surplus fingerlings and adults were stocked in 2003.  The Lake Management Plan was amended in 2005 to include alternate year fingerling stockings at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre.  Largemouth bass are relatively abundant and should provide quality angling opportunities.  Most of the fish captured were between 13 and 16 inches in total length.  Mean weight was about 1.5 pounds. Black crappie were also abundant and may provide additional fishing opportunities in a few years.  Most of the fish captured in 2004 were two- year old fish that averaged 6.4 inches in total length.  Bluegill were present in low numbers, but most of the fish were between 6.0 and 6.5 inches in length.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a 150-acre basin located five miles north of Hoffman in Grant County. It is a relatively shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic lake that is prone to occasional winterkill. Poor water quality and degraded aquatic habitat have been reported since the 1970\u0019s. Diversity and abundance of rooted aquatic plants is limited. Aquatic vegetation provides critical habitat for many fish species. Strong winds and wave actions can result in re-suspension of fine silts and attached nutrients, stimulating frequent algal blooms.  Water clarity and recreational uses can be seasonally impaired. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye net catches were 8.0 fish/gillnet. Walleye fingerlings and adults have been stocked in odd number years since 2003 to supplement natural recruitment and sustain greater abundance.  Catch statistics from the 2009 survey did not show a strong correlation between year of stocking and elevated catches of walleye produced in stocked years.  Gillnets catches were within the normal range for the lake type, and met management objectives.  Growth is above average and thus fishing quality in terms of size caught, is relatively good.  Walleye captured in gillnets averaged 19.9 inches and 3.2 pounds. Walleye accounted for 73 per cent of the total weight of fish captured in gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are moderately abundant. Electrofishing catches averaged  44.0 fish/hour. Mean length and weight were 14.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Thirty-six per cent of captured largemouth bass exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rate for bluegill was 12.0 fish/trap net. Eighty-one per cent of the fish were less than 5.0 inches long and were from the 2008 year class. Growth is excellent with age III fish averaging 5.8 inches at annulus formation. Mean weight of captured bluegill was 0.1 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike were netted during the survey. Only one black bullhead was captured in the assessment. Other species sampled were common carp, black crappie, brown and yellow bullhead, yellow perch, hybrid sunfish and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a relatively shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic lake located within the West Branchof the Chippewa River Watershed in Grant County near the town of Hoffman.  The shallow and fertilenature of the lake make it prone to occasional winterkill.  Poor water quality and degraded aquatichabitat have been reported since the 1970's.  Water clarity is poor throughout most of the year.  Thislimits the growth and survival of aquatic vegetation which provides critical habitat for many gamefishspecies.  A highly desirable walleye fishery existed in 1999.  Walleye were abundant and most of the fish rangedfrom 20 to 24 inches in length.  These fish are the result of successful fry stockings in 1993 and1994, following a partial winterkill during the winter of 1992-93.  There is also some evidence ofnatural reproduction.  Yellow perch may also provide some quality angling.  They are relativelyabundant and averaged almost 10 inches in length.Despite the poor environmental conditions, abundant bluegill and largemouth bass populations havedeveloped in recent years.  Thompson Lake may provide some quality bass and sunfish anglingopportunities in the near future if these species continue to survive and reproduce.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thompson Lake is a 154-acre basin located four miles east of Barret in Grant County. It is a relatively shallow, fertile lake that is prone to occasional fish kills.  Average and maximum depths were 16 and 22 feet, respectively. Water clarity has significantly increased and was 16 feet during the 2021 survey, which may be attributed to lack of precipitation and subsequent runoff. However, even with the increased water clarity aquatic vegetation continues to be limited.\n \nThe current Walleye population (9.0/gill net) slightly declined from the 2015 survey but was still high when compared to similar lakes. Walleye grow fast, reaching 15 inches by age 3. Anglers should expect to find predominately large fish, which ranged from 19.1 to 26.8 inches, with an average of 22.1 inches.\n \nFifty-six stock-length Largemouth Bass per hour were sampled, higher than all previous surveys. Size structure was impressive, with most bass exceeding 15 inches. The largest bass sampled was 18.7 inches and average length was 14.7 inches. \n\nModerate numbers of Bluegill (4.7/trap net) were sampled in 2021, which have varied considerably in past surveys. Size structure was poor, even though growth was fast. This is because all Bluegill sampled were young. If fish can survive long enough they should reach sizes that would be of interest to anglers in a couple years.\n\nAlthough the 2021 survey was the second highest Black Crappie catch rate on record (2.7/ trap net), it is still quite low, as it has been in past surveys. Similar to Bluegill, crappies tend to be young and small but grow fast. Average length was only 5.2 inches but the largest sampled was 12.5 inches. \n\nOther species sampled were Common Carp, Green Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead. \n</p>",
