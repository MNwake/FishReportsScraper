                "narrative": "<p>Historical netting data for this lake represents a classic example of how overstocking can adversely impact a fishcommunity.  The 1959 initial survey recorded 2.1 northern pike per gillnet (normal range is 2.33 - 8.33 for lakeclass 23).  Average weight was 2.72 lbs. with a growth rate equaling 23.4 inches at age three.  The yellow perchpopulation was extemely high at 217.6 per gillnet.  Managers viewed the availability of yellow perch for food asan opportunity to enhance northern pike and walleye populations and began heavily stocking these species,particularily northern pike.  From 1959 through 1982, northern pike were stocked almost annually.  A controllednorthern pike spawning area adjoining the lake was constructed in 1968.  By 1983 the northern pike population hadclimbed to 12.75 per gillnet, but the yellow perch population had been descimated (2.8 per gillnet).  Averagenothern pike weight had dropped to 1.15 lbs. and growth had slowed to where the former length at age three nowtook five years to attain.  Northern pike, having run out of yellow perch to eat, likely contributed to a walleyedecline as well.  Northern pike stocking was discontinued after 1982 and numbers are still high but appear to bedeclining.  Also, the yellow perch population appears to be rebounding.  Walleye numbers are currently above thenormal range for this lake class and they have a good size structure (avg. length = 16 inches).  Walleye have beenregularily stocked in this lake since the mid-50's.  Although significant natural reproduction has occasionallyoccurred, periodic stocking is likely what sustains the population.  Largemouth bass and black crappie are two species present in the lake that need to be evaluated more thoroughlywith special test nets or electrofishing.  Both species appear to be present in modest numbers and provide anglingopportunities.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked in 1980 following two successive surveys, 1969 and 1977,where none were taken in test nets.  Anglers have reported black crappie fishing to be excellent at times,particularily in the spring, when many \"good sized\" fish are caught. Historical lake survey data for bluegill shows a high degree of variability, ranging from very high to very lowabundance.  The current trapnet catch rate is within the normal range for this lake class but less than what wasfound in the 1988 survey.  Associations between bluegill fluctuations and changes in the rest of the fishcommunity are not readily apparent.  It does appear that increasing northern pike abundance in the 1960's and1970's may have impacted bluegill abundance but the association is not very consistent.  Something that isconsistent is the ability for this lake to produce large bluegill despite significant fishing pressure and anglerharvest, both summer and winter.  The current population, with 56% of the fish over six inches and 38% over eightinches, represents an excellent angling opportunity.Examination of historical data for this lake finds some net catch \"anomolies\" that are interesting.  Onesmallmouth bass was taken in the 1977 survey, one burbot was also taken in 1977, one carp was taken in 1985 andtwo more again in 1993.  Apparently these species were or are present in the lake in very small numbers.  Carpcan adversely impact the fish community in some lakes but this lake does not represent typical carp habitat andthey should not pose a significant threat here.Little Toad Lake is a very popular fishing lake, particularily with local anglers.  It has a reputation as a \"fishproducer\", both in size and numbers.  Walleye, bluegill, and black crappie are probably the most sought afterspecies.  Exactly what elements enable some lakes to routinely produce \"good fishing\" are not well understood,but this seems to be one of those lakes.  A substantial portion of the shoreline is still undeveloped.  Theseundeveloped areas are home to extensive bulrush beds that may well be a key element in the welfare of the lakeand fish community, enabling this lake to \"produce\" the way it does.  Protection against the wholesale removalof bulrush that has occurred on many developed lakes should be a high priority.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad Lake is primarily noted as a northern pike/bass/panfish lake.  Spawning habitat is considered good to excellent for these species in this lake.  There is a mostly stocked population of walleyes, as well.  With continuing shoreline development, fishing pressure is also likely to increase.Compared to other ecologically similar Minnesota lakes, northern pike test net catches have historically been high in Little Toad.  The past two survey reports (1998 and 2003) showed the highest catches ever.  Sampled pike averaged 21 inches and 2.0 pounds, but some over 30 inches were found.  When abundances are high, pike have been shown to impact perch and other species in several area lakes.  High numbers of northern pike in recent years may be at least partially responsible for the crash in yellow perch catches.  Perch are a primary forage for pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.Even with a doubling of walleye stocking rates since 2000, walleye net catches dropped to the lowest point ever recorded for Little Toad.  Walleyes averaged 1.8 pounds and 16.8 inches.  Growth rates remained good.Bluegill catches increased to the highest numbers in recorded history for this lake.  Although many of these fish are small, some bluegills over eight inches were found during test netting.  The average bluegill length was 5.9 inches.With increasing shoreline development, maintaining water quality and fish habitat are important concerns for stakeholders on Little Toad Lake.  Aquatic plants should not be considered a nuisance.  They are extremely important to the health of the lake.   These plants provide cover, food, spawning habitat, and rearing areas for fish and for the insects and small animals they eat.  In addition, several species of aquatic plants are valuable for protecting shorelines from erosion and for removing pollutants from the water.  Protecting these stands, especially the bulrush beds that are currently so common in Little Toad, should be a priority.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad Lake is primarily regarded as a northern pike/bass/panfish lake.  Spawning habitat is considered good to excellent for these species in this lake.  There is a mostly-stocked population of walleyes, as well.  With continuing shoreline development, fishing pressure is also likely to increase. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to other ecologically similar Minnesota lakes, northern pike test net catches have historically been high in Little Toad.  In 2008, pike catch rates dropped back into the \"normal\" range for class 23 lakes, but were near the top end of that range at 7.7 per gill net.  Sampled pike averaged 20 inches and 1.8 pounds, but some over 30 inches were found.  When abundances are high, pike have been shown to impact perch and other species in several area lakes.  High numbers of northern pike in recent years may be at least partially responsible for the crash in yellow perch catches.  Perch catch rates were at their historical lows during the past two test net studies.  Where present, perch are the primary forage for pike, walleye, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nEven with a doubling of walleye stocking rates since 2000, walleye net catches dropped to the lowest point ever recorded for Little Toad in 2003.  In 2008 however, the walleye catch rate increased to 5.0 per net which was closer to the long range goal of 6.0 per net.  Walleyes averaged 1.5 pounds and 16.0 inches.  Growth rates remained acceptable. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches declined from the highest numbers in recorded history for this lake to a more typical 18.1 per trap net.  Although many of these fish are small, some bluegills over eight inches were found during test netting.  The average bluegill length was 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWith increasing shoreline development, maintaining water quality and fish habitat are important concerns for stakeholders on and around Little Toad Lake.  Aquatic plants should not be considered only a nuisance.  They are extremely important to the health of the lake.   These plants provide cover, food, spawning habitat, and rearing areas for fish and for the insects and small animals they eat.  In addition, several species of aquatic plants are valuable for protecting shorelines from erosion and for removing pollutants from the water.  Protecting these stands, especially the bulrush beds that are currently so common in Little Toad, should be a priority.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad Lake is a 405-acre, moderately developed lake located in south central Becker County.  It is surrounded by a mixture of wetlands, forest, and agricultural land.  Little Toad Lake has two intermittent inlets which enter from the north and west shores.  Little Toad Lake is considered the headwaters of the Toad River, a designated trout stream, and is the only outlet.  Special regulations were implemented for Northern Pike and Bluegill in 2008.  The Northern Pike regulation resulted in a 24-to-36-inch protected slot, a possession limit of three, and one allowed over 36 inches.  The sunfish regulation is a possession limit of ten sunfish.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in June 2023 to assess the fish populations of Little Toad Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a moderate number of Northern Pike in Little Toad Lake, however, most of these fish will be on the small side.  The average size of the pike captured was 21.5 inches, but one 33-inch fish was measured.  Walleye numbers are well below average for the lake, but size is good.  About 89% of the Walleye captured in 2023 were over 15 inches and 44% were over 20 inches.  Anglers can expect to find high numbers of small Bluegills, but fish over eight inches are present.  About six percent of the Bluegills sampled in 2023 were over eight inches and Bluegills up to 9.5 inches were sampled.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured in low numbers in the nets, which is often the case with this sampling gear.  Black Crappie up to 11 inches were measured and up to 14.5 inches for Largemouth Bass.  Other fish species observed were Bowfin, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad is a 345 acre, moderately-developed lake with heavy seasonal use.  Fishing pressure has undoubtedly increased in recent decades.  The lake's relatively small size and increased use probably make certain portions of its fish community vulnerable to over-fishing.Increased fishing pressure is only one of many factors affecting the fish community in Little Toad.  Weather patterns and water levels affect spawning success for most species.  Vegetation removal can disrupt spawning, feeding, and shelter use for several fish species.  Fish stocking can impact (sometimes negatively) the entire fish community in a lake, not just the species being stocked.  Shoreline erosion, nutrient input, and hazardous chemical introductions can all detrimentally impact fish habitat, spawning success, and fish abundance.  In spite of all these potential impacts on a fishery, fish populations attempt to maintain themselves through reproduction.  Thus, the preponderance of small individuals of a particular fish species is sometimes an indicator of over harvest.Bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye populations were all dominated by young, fast-growing fish in 1998.  Little Toad has a history of producing large fish, especially panfish, and average sizes of these fish species should increase as the populations age, unless they are \"cropped off\" first.  Northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch were all more abundant than in most ecologically similar lakes.  Of these species, only walleye are currently maintained by stocking in Little Toad.  Bluegill numbers were about average and black crappie were below normal in abundance.Anglers tend to remember the good times most vividly.  The good fishing for large black crappie during the late 1980s and early 1990s has virtually disappeared.  In looking at seven test net catches of crappie since 1969, however, only the 1988 catch was higher than normal.  The other six assessments showed crappie abundances below normal compared to similar lakes.  While black crappie are typically a \"boom or bust\" species and fishing success can vary drastically over time, the good news is that most fish species appear to grow rapidly in Little Toad Lake.There is more good news for this lake in the fact that extensive areas of bulrush (fish spawning and cover habitat) still exist and water quality is relatively good.  The ratio of black to yellow bullheads is one biological indicator of water quality in a lake.  Yellow bullheads outnumber black bullheads in Little Toad and water quality is considered relatively good.Natural fluctuations in a lake's fish populations are normal.  However, there are several things that watershed dwellers and lake users can do to help maintain a viable fishery.  Fish habitat is more than just water.  It includes both quantity and quality of water, bottom substrate, and fish cover such as vegetation.  One can maintain the integrity of the lake and it's fish community by protecting bulrush and cattail stands, preventing erosion, preventing nutrient input, and by catching and releasing a portion of the \"keepers\" that might normally be kept.  Individuals from Little Toad's lake association already participate in several of these endeavors and all other lake and watershed users are also encouraged to use best management practices, always keeping in mind the long term effects of todays actions.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Toad Lake was conducted on June 14-15, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad Lake is primarily regarded as a Northern Pike/bass/panfish lake.  Spawning habitat is considered good to excellent for these species in this lake.  There is a modest, stocked population of Walleyes, as well.  With continuing shoreline development, fishing pressure is also likely to increase. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to other ecologically similar Minnesota lakes, test net catches of Northern Pike have historically been high in Little Toad.  In 2013, pike catch rates remained in the \"normal\" range for class 23 lakes, but were near the top end of that range at 8.1 per gill net.  Sampled pike averaged 22.5 inches and 2.5 pounds, but some over 30 inches were found.  When abundances are high, pike have been shown to impact perch and other species in several area lakes.  High numbers of Northern Pike in recent years may be at least partially responsible for the crash in Yellow Perch catches.  Perch catch rates were at their historical lows during the past three test net studies.  Where present, perch are the primary forage for pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nEven with a doubling of Walleye stocking rates since 2000, Walleye net catches dropped to the lowest point ever recorded for Little Toad in 2013 at 0.5 per set.  This was well below the long range goal of 6.0 per net and also well below the lake's historical average catch rate of 6.2 Walleyes per net.  Despite regular stocking of fingerlings or larger Walleyes, fish under age six were not found.  The few Walleyes sampled averaged 3.9 pounds and 22.8 inches.  Growth rates were slower than normal for Little Toad. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches also declined in number, but more Bluegills over eight inches were found than during the three previous surveys. The average Bluegill length was 6.1 inches and fish up to nine inches in length were caught. <br> \n <br> \nWith increasing shoreline development, maintaining water quality and fish habitat are important concerns for stakeholders on and around Little Toad Lake.  Aquatic plants should not be considered only a nuisance.  They are extremely important to the health of the lake.   These plants provide cover, food, spawning habitat, and rearing areas for fish and for the insects and small animals they eat.  In addition, several species of aquatic plants are valuable for protecting shorelines from erosion and for removing pollutants from the water.  Protecting these stands, especially the bulrush beds that are currently so common in Little Toad, should be a priority.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 27, 2016 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and conditions prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 22 native species of fish including several that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2013 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Little Toad Lake based on these surveys is just above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. The score suggests the lake may be vulnerable to future impairment with additional human caused stress to the fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Otter Tail River watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Toad is a 405-acre, moderately developed lake located in south central Becker County.  The lake is surrounded by a mixture of wetlands, forest, and agricultural land.  It has an average water clarity of 11.0 feet and a maximum depth of 65.0 feet.  Large stands of native emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and water lily are located on the 4.2 miles of shoreline.  Little Toad Lake has two intermittent inlets which enter from the north and west shores.  The only outlet is the Toad River, a designated trout stream, which exits on the south shore and eventually connects to the Otter Tail River.  The 8.5-acre Little Toad Lake Aquatic Management Area (AMA) is located on the north shore and the public boat access is located on the northeastern shore. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Little Toad Lake in late June 2018 to assess the fish community.  The survey was completed using nine gill nets and nine trap nets.  The gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance increased in 2018 and growth rates were slower in comparison to the previous surveys.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  Bluegills greater than 8.0 inches were found and typically were seven years or older in age.  In addition to the special sunfish regulation of a possession limit of 10, anglers can help maintain a balanced population by keeping smaller Bluegills and releasing the majority of larger Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was typical for this lake and similar to 2013.  Northern Pike average length was close to 22 inches, with pike ranging in size from 12.7 to 33.2 inches long.  Twenty-five percent of the measured pike were greater than 24 inches long, which was the largest percentage observed since 1959. <br> \nThe Walleye abundance continues to be low in Little Toad Lake.  Even with the regular stocking of fingerlings, fish younger than four years old were not sampled.  Based on the few Walleyes sampled, the mean total length was 22.0 inches and the largest measured was 27.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was slightly above average for this lake.  Largemouth Bass total lengths ranged from 8.1 to 20.3 inches and averaged 2.1 pounds.  Growth rates were slow but average for this lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been decreasing since 1998 and was at a historic low in 2018.  This low abundance may be attributed to the high abundance of Northern Pike.  Only one Black Crappie was captured and measured 11.6 inches.  Other species sampled during the survey included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWith increasing shoreline development, maintaining water quality and fish habitat are important concerns for landowners and stakeholders on and around Little Toad Lake.  To protect the water quality, habitat, and the fish community, lakeshore owners and stakeholders need to preserve riparian habitat and aquatic plants.  The riparian habitat is important in protecting shorelines from eroding and the lake from pollutants.  The aquatic plants provide cover, food, spawning habitat, and rearing areas for fish and for the insects and small animals they eat.  By protecting the current habitat, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike will continue to be abundant in Little Toad Lake.</p>",
