                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is located in southern Jackson County 1.5 miles north of the Iowa border, has surface area of 738 acres, and a maximum depth of 7 feet. Loon is connected to Pearl and drains into Big Spirit Lake in Iowa. Under high water conditions, fish can move back and forth between Loon and Pearl lakes. Loon Lake is primarily managed for walleye with yellow perch and northern pike as secondary species. Ample shoreline is available for angling with two county parks providing camping and picnic areas along with two fishing piers on the southwest and southeast side of the lake. A population assessment was conducted on Loon during the week of 06/28/04. Five gill nets and 11 trap nets were used to assess the fish population.The walleye catch rate was near average for lakes similar to Loon. Lengths of walleye ranged from 9.3 to 24.5 inches with an average length of 17.1 inches. Loon has historically had a good walleye fishery present. Past natural reproduction has been good and walleye fry have been stocked two of every three years. In an attempt to increase the walleye population fingerlings will be stocked every other year beginning in 2005.Yellow perch abundance continues to be low but the perch that are present average nearly half a pound. Lengths of yellow perch sampled ranged from 6.1 to 11.1 inches with an average length of 9.5 inches. Although yellow perch numbers tend to cycle in most lakes, this population was probably competing poorly with the abundant black crappies.Northern pike numbers continue to be low compared to similar lakes. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 16.8 to 39.7 inches and averaged 24 inches. With the lack of adequate natural reproduction, northern pike fingerlings will be stocked to help bolster the pike numbers.Black crappie catch rates were at a historic high for Loon. Lengths of black crappie ranged from 4.1 to 12.2 inches. Five year classes were observed during the survey and the majority were age 3 and averaged 9.5 inches. Loon has continued to show great natural reproduction with five year classes present.. A short time after ice-out many anglers line the shores in pursuit of these \"slabs\". Loon Lake truly has some nice \"yellow bellies\" lurking in its waters. The average black bullhead is nearly 11 inches long and weighs three quarters of a pound. Black bullhead numbers are right about were we like to see them and anglers will have to do very little sorting when the bite is on. Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 7.1 to 13.4 inches.Channel catfish first showed up in our nets in 1997 and have increased their numbers to the point of providing a fishery. Lengths of channel catfish ranged from 13.3 to 29.2 inches and averaged 15.6 inches. Channel catfish have not been stocked by the MNDNR and may have entered Loon during high water conditions from Big Spirit or are the result of illegal stocking. Channel catfish may be helping to reduce the numbers and increase the average size of black bullheads by foraging on small bullheads.Other species of fish sampled during the assessment include bigmouth buffalo, common carp, freshwater drum(sheepshead), shortnose gar, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Loon Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Walleye natural reproduction has occurred sporadically in Loon Lake and is typically not enough to maintain the Walleye population.  Walleye fry were stocked 3 out of 4 years beginning in 2013, so 2016 was a non-stocked year.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 28, 2016, to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Loon Lake during the non-stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 53.1 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing, so the 2016 natural year class exceeded this goal.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 6.9 to 9.5 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake is part of an effort to introduce a unique strain of Walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  Loon Lake was stocked with the Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2015 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  Loon Lake was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population, has habitat that is conducive to Walleye reproduction, and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction.  If LMS fry are available, they will be stocked into Loon Lake in an effort to spread the LMS genetics to other lakes with the ultimate goal of creating a self-sustaining Walleye population similar to Lake Sarah. <br> \n</p>",

The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Loon Lake is part of an effort to introduce a unique strain of Walleye to area lakes.  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  Loon Lake was stocked with the LMS Walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2015 and LMS Walleye fry in the spring of 2017.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 7, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 239.2 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful.  A tiny piece of tail fin was sampled from 50 Age-0 Walleye for genetic analysis and found that over 88% of those fish were from the stocking.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing, so the 2017 fry stocked year class exceeded this goal.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 4.9 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.0 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the Loon Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

THE POPULATION CONSISTS OF A BROAD DIS- TRIBUTION OF FISH SIZES RANGING FROM 10 INCHES TO 25 INCHES AND AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 2.5 LBS. THE MOST ABUNDANT AGE GROUPS ARE THE TWO YEAR OLDS AND THE FIVE YEAR OLDS. WALLEYE FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1982, 1984 AND 1986. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION APPEARS TO BE STABLE. THE GILLNET CPE OF 25.7 FISH PER LIFT IS SIMILAR TO THE 1983 CPE OF 20.7 FISH PER LIFT AND IS CLOSE TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 20.7 FISH PER LIFT. THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION SAMPLED BY THE GILL AND TRAP NETS IS COMPOSED OF THREE CONSECUTIVE YEAR CLASSES AND A SIZE DISTRIBUTION RANGING FROM 5.0 TO 9.5 INCHES. NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED IN 1988 WITH 106.4 YOY YELLOW PERCH PER ACRE SAMPLED BY SHORELINE SEINING. THE BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION APPEARS TO BE ABUN- DANT WITH A TRAPNET INDEX 2.5 TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE TRAPNET LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION ILLUSTRATES A BROAD RANGE OF SIZES FROM 4.0 TO 12.9 INCHES. WHITE SUCKERS WERE SAMPLED IN THE GILL NETS AT A RATE OF 3.7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND CARP WERE SAMPLED IN THE TRAP NETS AT A RATE SIMILAR TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BLACK CRAPPIES, PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH, HYBRID SUN- FISH, YELLOW BULLHEADS, GOLDEN SHINERS AND BIG- MOUTH BUFFALO WERE CAPTURED IN SMALL NUMBERS. ALTHOUGH NO BLUEGILLS WERE CAPTURED IN THE TRAP OR GILL NETS, 1938 YOY BLUEGILL PER ACRE WERE CAPTUR- ED DURING SHORELINE SEINING. LARGEMOUTH BASS AND FRESHWATER DRUM WERE ALSO CAPTURED DURING SHORE- LINE SEINING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon is a 738 acre lake with a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and is located near the Iowa border in Jackson County.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while yellow perch and northern pike are managed secondarily.  A resurvey was conducted on 06/25/2001 using five gillnets and 11 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was conducted on 08/07/2001 using a standard 50 ft. bag seine.  Loon is connected to Pearl and Big Spirit Lake and fish can move from lake to lake under the right conditions.Loon has historically had a good walleye fishery present. The lake is stocked two of three years with walleye fry but good natural reproduction has also been docomented in years Loon wasn't stocked.  Walleye abundance appears to be good compared to lake similar to Loon.  Lengths of walleye sampled in 2001 ranged from 8.6 to 23.7 inches with an average length of 13.3 inches.  Six year classes were observed during the survey but the majority of fish were age 1 and 2.  The age 1 fish were the result of natural reproduction.  This should provide some good fishing opportunities in the next few years.Yellow perch abundance is low compared to lakes similar to Loon.  Yellow perch have a tendency to cycle in many Southern Minnesota Lakes.  It appears this is the case right now.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled ranged from 5.4 to 14.4 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  Shoreline seining information showed good natural reproduction of yellow perch so hopefully the perch population is on its way back.Northern pike abundance is low compared to lakes similar to Loon.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 16.8 to 34.3 inches and averaged 23.8 inches.Black crappie abundance is high for lakes similar to Loon.  Not only are there good numbers of black crappie but there are some nice sized fish also.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 7.5 to 13.0 inches and averaged 9.9 inches.  Five different year classes of black crappie were observed during the survey which means the population has successful natural reproduction.Bluegill abundance is low for lakes similar to Loon.  Lengths of blugill ranged from 6.7 to 8.8 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.Black bullhead fishing has been very popular on Loon especially in the Spring.  Black bullhead abundance is right about where we want it so that nice size bullheads are present.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 9.5 to 13.1 inches and averaged 11.4 inches.Shoreline seining results indicated natural reproduction of bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, black crappie, channel catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.Other fish sampled during the survey included common carp, orangespotted sunfish, pumkinseed sunfish, shortnose gar, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Loon through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a class 43 lake with considerable agricultural row crop drainage.  Prior to 1979, when a helixor aeration system was installed, Loon Lake had a history of winterkill.  Dissolved oxygen readings during most winters since 1979 have not been sufficiently low to cause extensive winterkill.  This 738-acre lake, with a maximum depth of  7 feet, has a watershed to lake ratio of 27 to 1.  This large catchment area for the lake might explain some of the poor water quality values from the lake over the years.  In 2002, the MN PCA conducted water quality assessments on several southwestern MN lakes and found total phosphorus levels in Loon Lake that was nearly 5 times higher than the normal upper range of the Western Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population abundance has not changed much since the last survey in 2004.  Although the walleye population was within the expected range for this type of lake, it is not attaining the long-range management goal.  Nearly 40,000 walleye fingerlings have been stocked into Loon Lake since 2005 with little change in their abundance.  The condition of walleye was slightly below the desired range although growth rates were average.  There didn\u0019t appear to be a year class that was more abundant with total lengths ranging from 7.2 to 27.6 inches.  As this report is being written during the winter of 08-09, Loon Lake has experienced lower dissolved oxygen readings.  It is unclear if the lake experienced a partial winterkill or not.  Although walleye numbers are not exceedingly high, it is still possible to catch a few walleyes.     <br> \n <br> \nHistorically yellow perch catch rates have ranged from 1.7 to 25.7 fish/set.  The 1993 survey found abundant yellow perch, but numbers have remained low since.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.9 to 10.5 inches with a mean of 9.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3 northern pike were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets despite 3 different stockings of northern pike fingerlings in 2004, 2005, and 2007.  Historically northern pike abundance appears to be variable and might be most dependent on climatic conditions if brood stock is present.  Targeting any cooler water during summer may be a key spot to catch a few northerns. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate in gill nets was 10.0 fish/set, which was the highest ever-documented on Loon Lake.  Total lengths ranged from 9.2 to 25.8 inches with an average of 21.0 inches.  Most of the fish sampled were 13-15 inches and 5-6 years old.  The lack of harsh winters the last 10 years has likely contributed to a naturally reproducing channel catfish population.  If you fish Loon Lake, you will have good odds of catching a few catfish.  It is possible that channel catfish could be controlling black bullhead numbers.  Good numbers of 9-10 inch bullheads can be caught with some regularity. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were bigmouth buffalo, black crappie, bluegill, common carp, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, shortnose gar, white bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doornebos <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE 22.06 POUNDS OF WALLEYE CAUGHT IN EACH NET WAS NEARLY DOUBLE THE LOCAL MEDIAN HOWEVER.  THE WAE COLLECT- ED IN GILL NETS ALL EXCEED 13 INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH, MEAN = 18.2 INCHES.  THE WAE AGE DISTRIBUTION WAS DOMINATED BY OLDER YEAR CLASSES (AGES FOUR THROUGH SIX).  GROWTH OF THESE COHORTS WAS GOOD, SLIGHTY ABOVE AVERAGE, WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER WAE POPULATIONS IN THE AREA.  THE 1986 AND 1984 COHORTS (FOUR AND SIX) WERE MOST LIKELY PRODUCED FROM FINGERLINGS STOCKED IN THOSE YEARS. NO ONE OR TWO YEAR OLD WAE WERE COLLECTED IN THE SURVEY.  THIS INDICATED THAT THE 1989 FRY STOCKING OF LOON LAKE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE YEP GILL NET CATCH OF 1.67 FISH PER NET WAS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 18.50.  THE 1990 CATCH MARKS A DRAMATIC DECREASE FORM THE 1988 AND 1985 SURVEYS. YEP GROWTH WAS NEAR AVERAGE FOR THE WINDOM AREA. THE NOP GILL NET CATCH OF 3.67 FISH PER NET EXCEEDS THE LOCAL MEDIAN BY MORE THAN 300 PERCENT. LOON LAKE IS ONE OF THE FEW LAKE IN THE AREA THAT STILL SUPPORTS A VIABLE NOP POPULATION, PROBABLY DUE TO STABLE WATER LEVELS IN RECENT YEARS. GROWTH INFORMATION FOR NOP IN THE AREA LIMITED, LOON LAKE FISH APPROXIMATE NORMAL GROWTH WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER LOCAL POPULATIONS.  SOME OF THE NOP CAPTURED ARE MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A 1988 STOCKING OF RESCUED ADULTS.  THE WTS GILL NET CATCH OF 10.0 PER NET IS FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  WITH THE DECREASED NUMBERS OF YEP IN LOON LAKE, THE WTS POPULATION HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME A MORE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE FISH COMMUNITY, PROVIDING A FORAGE SOURCE FOR THE NORTHERN PIKE AND WAE POPULATIONS.  THE BLB TRAP NET CATCH OF 305 PER NET IS FIVE TIMES GRATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MOST OF THE FISH WERE EIGHT TO TEN INCHES IN TOTAL LENGTH AND ONE-THIRD OF A POUND, INDICATING THAT THE POPULATION IS OVERCROWEDE.  BLC CATCH INDICES WERE BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS.  FRD WERE COLLECTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1990.  THE CAP TRAP NET CATCH APPROXIMATED THE LOCAL MEDIAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a 700-acre lake near the Iowa border.  The lake has a maximum depth of about 7 feet and is connected to Big Spirit Lake in Iowa.  Loon Lake is managed for walleye as the primary species whereas yellow perch and northern pike are managed as secondary species.Walleye abundance is above average compared to lakes similar to Loon.  The average weight of walleye sampled during our 1997 population assessment was just over 1lb.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7.5 to 26.5 inches and averaged about 16.5 inches.  Natural reproduction of walleye was documented in 1994 and 1996.Yellow perch abundance was fairly low during the 1997 population assessment.  Perch numbers in Loon Lake have a history of fluctuating.  In 1997 our net catch was 2.3 fish per net, 15.0 in 1993, 1.7 in 1990, and 25.7 fish per net in 1988.  Lengths of perch from our 1997 assessment ranged from 7 to 10.5 inches and averaged almost 9 inches.  The average weight of yellow perch was almost one half pound.Black bullhead fishing has been very popular to resident and nonresident anglers.  The black bullhead population is normal compared to lakes similar to Loon.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged just above 10.5 inches.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Loon Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

The seine hauls captured 14 species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=93), Black Bullhead (N=8), Black Crappie (N=21), Bluegill (N=10), Channel Catfish (N=147), Common Carp (N=2), Fathead Minnow (N=177), Freshwater Drum (N=52), Largemouth Bass (N=2), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=9), Spottail Shiner (N=93), Walleye (N=7), Yellow Bullhead (N=3), and Yellow Perch (N=56).  Electrofishing captured 13 species of fish, including Bigmouth Buffalo (N=2), Bluegill (N=20), Channel Catfish (N=14), Common Carp (N=8), Fathead Minnow (N=27), Freshwater Drum (N=26), Green Sunfish (N=3), Iowa Darter (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=4), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=24), Spottail Shiner (N=3), Walleye (N=2), and Yellow Perch (N=4).  Natural reproduction exists for some species of fish in Loon Lake, as young-of-the-year Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch were sampled.  Walleye were not stocked in 2020. The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Loon Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and could be used to indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score at Loon Lake was 18, below the impairment threshold of 36.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a 738-acre class 43 lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet, located in Jackson County, approximately 10 miles south of the City of Lakefield near the Iowa-Minnesota border.  The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Loon Lake has been stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye from 2015 through 2023 (not 2020), in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high abundance through natural reproduction.  Loon Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction. A stocking evaluation was conducted on October 2, 2023, using daytime boat electrofishing, to determine if the Walleye fry stocking was successful at Loon Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 142.0 per hour, which indicates that the Walleye fry stocking was successful, natural reproduction occurred, or a combination of the two occurred in Loon Lake in 2023.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class but it's not certain.  Walleye fingerlings ranged from 6.6 to 10.1 inches in length and averaged 8.4 inches.  Interestingly, Walleye lengths were bimodal with a group of fish being 6.5 to 8.5 inches and the others being 8.5 to 10.5 inches.  A subsample of Walleye were aged and were confirmed to be age-0, regardless of size.  It could be speculated that the different sizes may be the difference between stocked and unstocked Walleye.  Fin clips were taken to determine the percentage of stocked Walleye in the 2023 year class. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nLoon Lake is a 738-acre class 43 lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet and 6.24 miles of shoreline 10 miles south of Lakefield, MN near the Iowa-Minnesota Border.  The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural.  Historically, Loon Lake was susceptible to regularly occurring winterkill situations.  In 1982, an aeration system was installed in an attempt to remedy the low dissolved oxygen in the winter months in order to sustain a fishable walleye population.  Dissolved oxygen readings during most winters since 1982 have not been low enough to cause extensive winterkill.  While this helped the fish population, problems still exist in the way of water quality.  In 2002, the MN PCA conducted water quality assessments on several southwestern MN lakes and found total phosphorus levels in Loon Lake that were nearly 5 times higher than the upper normal range for the Western Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion.  Loon Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 27 to 1 (27 acres of land for every 1 acre of water); this large catchment area for the lake might partially explain some of the poor water quality values.  Loon Lake is managed for walleye, yellow perch, and northern pike.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 18, 2012 using 4 gill nets and 12 trap nets as well as shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing (nearshore sampling) to determine the health of the fish community by sampling as many species of fish as possible (generally more species present equals a better index score). <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were first stocked into Loon Lake in 1979 (as fry) when walleye management was started on Loon Lake. Since 1979, a combination of walleye fry, fingerling, and adults have been stocked into Loon Lake.  Walleye fry are now stocked 3 of every 4 years, after a lake management change in 2009.  The spring of 2012 was the first non-stocked year of the 4 year walleye stocking rotation started in 2009, and was a great year to assess the walleye population during a non-stocked year to determine if any natural reproduction exists.  The gill net catch rate in 2012 was 11.8 fish per net, which was the second highest catch rate observed since 1997 (18.3 per gill net) but still within the normal range of 2.3 to 18.1 fish per gill net for lake class 43.  The Loon Lake walleye gill net catch rate has only exceeded the normal range one time in 1997 with a catch rate of 18.3 fish per gill net, which was nearly identical to the upper normal range of 18.1 fish per gill net.  Also, the walleye catch rate has never been less than the low end of the normal range of 2.3 fish per gill net with the lowest observed gill net catch rate equal to 3.0 in 1983.  Therefore, the walleye population in Loon Lake appears to be stable regardless of the rate at which walleye are stocked into the lake.  However, the current management plan does have a benefit to the size structure of the walleye in the lake, as reflected in the 2012 sample.  The mean length of walleye in the gill nets and trap nets was 17 and 13 inches, respectively, with walleye ranging in length from 6 to 24 inches in both gears.  Growth of walleye was excellent with walleye reaching 15 inches by the end of age 2 and 18 inches by the end of age 3 with 8 different year classes present in the sample.  The size structure of walleye in the sample indicated a population that is dominated by fish greater than 15 inches.  The health of the walleye in the sample was good as well.  Given a high prevalence of walleye in the sample across multiple year classes, coupled with the good size structure and good overall health of the fish in the sample, the walleye population appears to be doing well.  Loon Lake may be one of the more stable populations of stocked walleye in the Windom Fisheries Management Area.  The outlook for the walleye population is good and average numbers of healthy fish should be expected to be found in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are a secondary management species in Loon Lake.  The historical yellow perch catch in gill nets shows a decline from highs in the 1980's (2.2 to 2.7 fish per trap net in 1988 and 1983, respectively), to lows in the late 1990's and 2000's (between 0 and 0.8 fish per trap net from 1997 to 2012).  The 2012 catch rate of 4.5 fish per gill net is within the normal range of 2.7 to 25.0, albeit the low end of the range, and below the long-term catch rate of 8.7 fish per gill net indicating a population that is lower than expected for Loon Lake.  The current catch rate shows some improvement, but careful analysis of the yellow perch population again in 2016 should help to assess whether 2012 is a true increase or simply a temporary increase.  Yellow perch in the 2012 sample ranged in length from 5.5 to 10.5 inches.  The bright spot of the yellow perch population was the good size structure of the population with 20% of the fish being 10 inches or bigger.  The yellow perch in the sample were healthy indicating the fish are finding enough food.  Future improvements in the abundance of yellow perch may be directly related to a reduction in the number of predators in the lake.  Loon Lake has walleye, black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, northern pike, and shortnose gar all of which will prey upon the yellow perch population.  A reduction in the number or abundance of predators in Loon Lake may increase yellow perch abundance.  Future stocking may be needed to help boost the population to levels where they can successfully reproduce if increased abundance does not naturally occur.  Fishing for yellow perch will be hit-or-miss over the next 2 to 4 years depending on natural reproduction success.    <br> \n  <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been stocked 11 times in Loon Lake from 1982 to 2007 as fry, fingerling, yearling, adults, or a combination of each.  Since 2009, northern pike fingerlings have been stocked every other year.  Seven northern pike were caught in gill nets and trap nets in 2012 with a gill net catch rate of 1 fish per net and a trap net catch rate of 0.3 fish per net.  The northern pike gill net catch rate was lower than the normal range of 1.1 to 8.0 for lake class 43.  Historically, the northern pike gill net catch rate has never exceeded 4.6 fish per net and it has only been within the normal range during 3 out of 9 surveys (in 1988, 1990, and 1993).  Most likely, northern pike will always be at a low abundance in Loon Lake with some years of increased abundance when conditions are right.  Conditions were right from 1988 to 1992 which were drought years and low water levels may have led to more aquatic vegetation abundance and increased abundance of northern pike.  While the 2012 catch rate was low, the size structure of the fish in the sample was fair with fish ranging in length from 21.0 to 27.2 inches.  The health of the northern pike in the sample was good, showing the fish are finding adequate food.  Northern pike are creatures of habitat; when favorable habitat is present, including abundant aquatic vegetation, the northern pike population will do well and the population abundance will reflect that.  Continued stocking will be needed to keep northern pike present in Loon Lake, but the future outlook for the population is promising as the size structure and health of the population are fair and good, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nNineteen other species were present in the netting and nearshore sampling in Loon Lake, all of which are not managed and maintain themselves without stocking from the DNR.  Those species included bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, common carp, channel catfish, fathead minnow, freshwater drum, green sunfish, Iowa darter, johnny darter, largemouth bass, orangespotted sunfish, shortnose gar, white bass, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Including walleye, yellow perch, and northern pike (all discussed above), 22 total species were sampled in Loon Lake during 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two species of fish were present in Loon Lake in 2012.  A lake that has 22 species of fish exhibits very high diversity, particularly for a class 43 lake in southwest Minnesota.  An index of biotic integrity (IBI score) score (from 0 to 100) will be developed for Loon Lake based on the catch of fish in 2012, and future monitoring (every 4 years from 2016 on) will help to determine if conditions are getting better, or worse, for the fish in Loon Lake.  A high diversity of fish will most likely lead to a higher IBI score (greater than 50) for Loon Lake relative to other southwest Minnesota lakes, indicating a relatively healthy fish community was present in Loon Lake in 2012.  This is further evident by the second highest gill net catch rate observed for walleye in 2012, with a good size structure of fish and fish in good health condition.  Yellow perch and northern pike were at lower abundances than expected, but with a large number of predators in Loon Lake it is expected that yellow perch will be heavily preyed upon and northern pike will be in competition for food.  Additionally, the prevalence of bluegill in the 2012 sample was a surprise and a highlight in the 2012 fish community sample.  The bluegill trap net catch rate has been increasing since 2001 and the 2012 catch rate is the highest on record even though the DNR has not stocked bluegill into the lake since 1982.  The increase in the abundance of bluegill in Loon Lake may be a reflection of increased spawning habitat through improved water quality conditions in the lake.  Future IBI sampling in addition to managed species monitoring in 2016 and beyond will help to determine if conditions are truly improving or if it merely appeared so in 2012.  Best management practices in the surrounding watershed (i.e. treating and slowing agricultural and urban runoff) will greatly improve conditions for fish community in Loon Lake and lead to better water clarity as well.  <br> \n   <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Loon Lake has been stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye from 2015 thru 2019 in an effort to get this strain established in additional waterbodies.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high abundance through natural reproduction.  Loon Lake was stocked with LMS Walleye because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  Due to safety issues surrounding COVID-19, Walleye eggs were not taken in Minnesota in 2020, thus no stocking of age-0 Walleye occurred in the Windom management area.  A natural reproduction check was conducted on September 24, 2020 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Loon Lake. <br> \n  <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 101.5 per hour, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Loon Lake in 2020.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class but it's not certain.  Walleye fingerlings ranged from 7.3 to 9.6 inches in length and averaged 8.4 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2020 year class, since the 2015 and 2016 stocked LMS Walleye could be sexually mature.  LMS was the most persistent strain sampled, accounting for 62 percent of fingerlings, followed by Spicer strain (16 percent).  Other strains accounted for 8 percent or less of the sample. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a 738-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet, located in Jackson County, approximately 10 miles south of the City of Lakefield near the Iowa-Minnesota border.  The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Historically, Loon Lake was susceptible to winterkill; however, severe winterkill events have rarely occurred in the last decade, with the most recent partial winterkill occurring during the winter of 2013 - 2014.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted the week of June 29, 2020 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in surveys on Loon Lake have ranged from 3.0 to 30.3 per gill net and averaged 11.8 per gill net since 1983.  The 2020 Walleye catch rate was 24.3 per gill net, which is the second highest observed catch rate.  The Walleye catch rate exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Eighty-five percent of Walleye were age-3 or younger, with forty-seven percent of Walleye being age-2 (2018 year class).  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled (2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019), all of which corresponded to stocking events.  Natural reproduction was observed in 2016 (53.1 per hour of electrofishing), but the 2016 year class was not sampled in this survey.  Age-0 Walleye were not sampled in the 2020 standard survey, but were sampled at a rate of 101.5 per hour of nighttime electrofishing during the fall of 2020, likely from natural reproduction.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.8 to 24.1 inches and averaged 15.6 inches.  Walleye growth is fast, as mean length at age-2 was 14.4 inches and age-3 was 16.7 inches.  Walleye were plump, suggesting that forage is abundant in Loon Lake.  The current Walleye stocking regime of stocking fry 3 of 4 years at 500 per acre, appears to be effective.  Since 2015, Loon Lake has been stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye. LMS Walleye have shown the ability to naturally reproduce in southern Minnesota lakes, thus LMS Walleye were stocked with the goals of increasing natural reproduction and creating a self-sustaining Walleye population. High abundance with a nice average size should make Walleye angling on Loon Lake good for the near future.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2020 was 10.3 per gill net, an increase from the 2016 catch rate of 5.5 per gill net, and the highest catch rate in the last two decades.  The 2020 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net) and exceeded the long term average of 8.6 per gill net.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 6.1 to 12.1 inches and averaged 9.9 inches.  While abundance is not high, the opportunity exists to catch nice sized Yellow Perch on Loon Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Black Crappie catch rate of 1.4 per trap net was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.1 per trap net), was an increase from the 2016 catch rate of 0.6 per trap net, but was below the long term average of 3.2 per trap net.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.3 to 10.5 inches and averaged 6.0 inches. Three to four year classes of Black Crappie were present indicating that natural reproduction has occurred.  It appears the Black Crappie population is slowly recovering following the winterkill event during the winter of 2013-2014.  <br> \n <br> \nSix Northern Pike were captured in the 2020 survey with lengths ranging from 24.0 to 33.3 inches and averaging 29.9 inches. The catch rate of 0.3 per gill net was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Adult Northern Pike were stocked in December of 2016 (N=475), but have not been stock since due to poor Northern Pike fingerling production.  Although abundance is low, the opportunity is present to catch Northern Pike in Loon Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate remained low at 17.0 per gill net. Lengths of Black Bullheads ranged from 8.7 to 13.8 inches and averaged 11.2 inches.  Common Carp catch rates decreased to 1.0 per gill net and 1.5 per trap net, both low when compared to similar lakes.  The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 4.7 per gill net, which is the highest recorded catch rate in survey history on Loon Lake, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net).  Other species sample included Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, Shortnose Gar, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  The walleye population is currently higher than most lakes similar to Loon Lake.  Walleye ranged from 7 to 27 inches with most of the fish 14 inches and longer.  The strongest year class of walleye averaged around 15 inches and is a result of natural reproduction.  Walleye fishing on Loon Lake has historically been good and our sampling suggests it should continue to be good in the future.Northern pike are also managed for in Loon Lake.  The population is at the level the DNR Fisheries have targeted.  Northern pike ranged from 8 to 34 inches but most of the fish were 18 inches and larger.  The future of the northern pike population looks promising because of several years of high water allowing good natural reproduction.  Only time will tell for sure.Yellow perch are not managed for specifically in Loon Lake but do not be surprised to catch an occasional 8 to 12 inch fish if you are fishing with minnows.  Yellow perch abundance can really change in just a few years in southwestern Minnesota lakes (prairie lakes).  The present population looks pretty good (15 fish per net) but just three years ago there were only 1.5 fish per net.Do not overlook the black bullhead fishing in Loon Lake.  Our sampling suggests that Loon Lake does not produce trophy (12 to 15 inches) black bullhead but 7 to 11 inches are common.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loon Lake is a 738-acre lake with a maximum depth of 8 feet, located in Jackson County, approximately 10 miles south of the City of Lakefield near the Iowa-Minnesota border.  The surrounding land use of Loon Lake is largely agricultural, resulting in excessive nutrient loading and typically turbid water.  There are 2 large drainage ditches that contribute to the poor water quality in the Loon Lake Watershed.  Historically, Loon Lake was susceptible to regularly occurring winterkill situations.  In 1982, a Helixor aeration system was installed and has, for the most part, reduced the frequency of winterkill, with the most recent severe winterkill occurring during the winter of 2013-2014.  Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted the week of June 27, 2016 to monitor fish populations using four gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate was the highest catch rate recorded for Loon Lake at 30.3 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net) and the long term average of 10.7 per gill net.  Fifty-eight percent of the Walleye were age-2 (2014 year class), likely a result of fry and/or fingerling stockings that occurred in 2014 following the partial winterkill.  Strong year class success in not uncommon following winterkill events.  Twenty-seven percent were age-1 (2015 year class), and 13 percent were age-3 (2013 year class), both of which corresponded to stocking events.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.4 to 26.8 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.  Walleye growth was fast, as mean length at age-3 was 17.0 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked 3 of 4 years at 500 per littoral acre.  Following the winterkill in 2013-2014, Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2014 and 2015, with the 2015 stocking being the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS; Lake Sarah spawn-take).  The goal is to infuse LMS genetics to create a Walleye population that may become self-sustaining through natural reproduction in the time.  Good Walleye fishing was reported throughout the year in 2016, and should continue into 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was 5.5 per gill net in 2016, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net) and is the highest catch rate in the last two decades.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6.3 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  While the 2016 catch rate is low enough that anglers shouldn't expect to catch a lot of Perch, enough brood stock Yellow Perch should be present to produce a strong year class when conditions are favorable.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate of 0.6 per trap net was less than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) and was below the long term average of 3.3 per trap net.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.3 to 13.2 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Three year classes were present, indicating that natural reproduction is occurring, and a strong year class could be produced when conditions are favorable.  Additionally, Loon Lake is connected to Pearl Lake and Rush Lake, so movement of crappies among these lakes should provide an angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nSix Northern Pike were captured in the 2016 survey with lengths ranging from 15.8 to 28.4 inches and averaging 24.4 inches. The catch rate of 0.3 per gill net was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). To bolster the population, 475 adult Northern Pike (approx. 2 pounds apiece) were stocked in December of 2016, and should provide good angling in 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 20.3 per gill net and 1.3 per trap net, both below the expected catches for similar lakes.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 4.7 to 14.8 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.  Common Carp catch rates were 4.8 per gill net and 8.3 per trap net, both above the long term average for each gear.  The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 1.0 per gill net which is low compared to similar lakes.  Channel Catfish catch rates were low at 0.8 per gill net and 0.1 per trap net, well below the long term averages.  Freshwater Drum catch rates were 1.3 per gill net and 0.1 per trap net.  Other species sampled included White Sucker, Bluegill, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
