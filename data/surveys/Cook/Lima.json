Public access is through a carry-in trail off an old logging road through a jack pine plantation southeast of the lake. It lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, draining to Lake Superior via an unnamed outlet stream to Fiddle Creek and the Brule River. The 2023 survey was conducted to update information on the brook trout population and evaluate stocking success.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey was the first time that a combination of short term gill net sets and angling were used to determine the presence of stocked year classes while reducing mortality of brook trout. These methods were successful at capturing brook trout. Brook trout ranged from 8.9 to 14.9 inches with a mean of 12.3 inches. Aging results showed individuals from the 2022 stocked year class with a mean length of 6.2 inches and fish from the 2020 year class with a mean length of 12.3 inches. Growth rates were average compared to similar stocked brook trout lakes at about 3 inches per year. Lima Lake may interest anglers looking to target decent sized brook trout in the area.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",
