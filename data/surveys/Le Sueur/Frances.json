                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nFrances Lake is an 870.0 acre lake located in LeSueur County near the Town of Elysian. Frances Lake is a mesotrophic lake that has good water quality and a diverse plant community. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Frances Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Despite substantial residential development, Frances Lake has very good water quality and a diverse, abundant aquatic vegetation community. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation are relatively common, providing valuable fish habitat. A DNR owned ramp is located at the east end of the lake, and a county access is located at the west end of the lake. The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Walleyes have been stocked extensively in Frances Lake to maintain the Walleye population. Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings or adults have been stocked in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. The current management plan calls for Walleye fry to be stocked at a rate of 500,000 fry every other year (odd years) and 500 pounds of fingerlings if fry stocking is unsuccessful, contingent on surplus availability. Other sport fish populations maintain their populations through natural reproduction. A standard survey was conducted on July 11, 2016 to monitor the sport fish populations in Frances Lake using 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate decreased from 91.5/hour in 2011 to 78.4/hour in 2016.  However, overall sizes increased from 2011.  In 2011, Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.7 to 14.1 inches in length and averaged 9.1 inches and in 2016 Largemouth Bass ranged from 2.7 to 20.5 inches in length and averaged 10.1 inches.  Approximately 29% of Largemouth Bass sampled were greater than 12.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nPast catches of Bluegill have consistently been between 15.0/trap net and 30.0/trap net. The 2016 catch rate (24.3/trap net) increased from the 2012 catch rate (19.0/trap net), and indicated moderate numbers were present. Nine year classes of Bluegills were sampled (2006-2014), indicating that Bluegills are long lived in Frances Lake. Lengths averaged 6.3 inches and increased from the 2012 sample (average=4.9 inches) however, growth was relatively slow compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye have historically occurred in low abundance at Frances Lake, as catch rates have ranged from 2.7/gill net in 1996 to 6.8/gill net in 1986. The 2012 catch rate fell within this range at 4.0/gill net, which was virtually unchanged from the 2012 catch rate (3.9/gill net). Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2008-2014 with 49% being from the 2014 year class (age-2). Walleyes ranged in length from 12.1 to 24.8 inches and averaged 17.2 inches. Walleye grew fast early in life, averaging 14.5 inches at age-3, but grew slow thereafter, with average length at age estimates being less than 20.0 inches up to age-8. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nPast catch rates of Northern Pike have ranged between 0.9/gill net in 1991 and 7.6/gill net in 2001. In 2016, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 4.9/gill net, which was consistent with the 2012 catch rate of 5.4/gill net. Nine year classes of Northern Pike were sampled including fish from 2007-2015 with 57% being age-3 and age-4.  The majority of the Northern Pike were small, ranging in length from 14.0 to 35.2 inches and averaging 20.1 inches. Sixty-three percent of the Northern Pike captured were less than 19.0 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nCatch rates of Black Crappie have historically been low in Frances Lake, not surpassing 11.9/gill net or 3.0/trap net. In 2016, Black Crappies were caught at rates of 1.7/gill net and 1.0/trap net. Gill netted Black Crappies were small, ranging from 5.5 to 11.0 inches and averaging 7.3 inches. Four year classes of Black Crappies were sampled (2011-2014), and had growth consistent with other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead <br> \nThe 2016 Yellow Bullhead catch rate (34.6/gill net) was double the 2012 catch rate (17.3/gill net). Yellow Bullheads were large, as they averaged 11.7 inches, and had a maximum length of 14.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species <br> \nBlack Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish were present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

The following taxa were noted during the survey: arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.), bulrush (round-stem group) (Schoenoplectus spp.), burreed Emergent Group (Sparganium spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), floating pondweed (Potamogeton natans), large-leaved pondweed (Potamogeton amplifolius), spikerush (Eleocharis spp.), water smartweed (Persicaria amphibia), white waterlily (Nymphaea odorata). Emergent and floating-leaf vegetation was limited to just a few sections of shoreline. For more information see map and summary table below.</p>",

Size and condition of these fish are less than perfect; but despite that, anglers can expect plenty of fish between 6-7.0 inches.  Black crappie are low in abundance, with almost 1/5 of these fish exceeding 8 inches.  Most of the population are fish between 5.5-6.5 inches, and these will become more attractive to anglers over the next several years.  The walleye population is one of consistency, always having average numbers but with a good size distribution; most fish are between 14-22 inches.  Northern pike in general follow this same population trend in Lake Francis.  Most fish are between 18-26 inches but, as with the walleye population, larger fish do exist.  Anglers can expect good largemouth bass fishing, with many fish in the 12-15 inch size range.  The good stands of natural vegetation, riparian cover, and a multitude of docks provide unlimited cover.  Species such as black bullhead, yellow bullhead, white bass, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed sunfish are all present, but at low abundance levels.</p>",

Residential development is common on the shores of Lake Frances, with lawns being maintained to the water's edge and shorelines being altered with rock riprap or sand blankets.  Despite substantial residential development, Frances Lake has relatively good water quality and a diverse, abundant aquatic vegetation community.  Emergent and floating leaf vegetation were relatively common, providing valuable fish habitat.  Nighttime boat electrofishing was conducted on Frances Lake on June 6, 2011 to monitor the largemouth bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass catch rate nearly doubled from the 2006 assessment, increasing from 48.0/hour in 2006 to 91.5/hour in 2011.  Size structure of the largemouth bass population has decreased from 2006.  In 2006, largemouth bass ranged from 4.0 to 17.7 inches in length and averaged 10.9 inches and in 2011 largemouth bass ranged from 3.7 to 14.1 inches in length and averaged 9.1 inches.  Approximately 14% of largemouth bass sampled were less than or equal to 12.0 inches. </p>",

In the fishery survey conducted in July 2001, yellow bullhead were the most abundant species in gill net catches (13 per net).  Black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike were also common in gill net catches with over 7 per gill net catch.  Northern pike catch per gill net increased from 1996 to 2001.  Most northern pike were around 19 to 20 inches with the largest 28 inches.  Walleye catch per gill net in 2001 was similar to 1996 with fish from 12 to 24 inches.  Bluegill were the most abundant species in the trap net catches (16 per net).  Bluegill catch per trap net in 2001 was similar to 1996.  Bluegill growth was slow with only 4.5 inches achieved in four years of growth.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Francis Lake is an 870.0 acre lake located in LeSueur County near the Town of Elysian. Francis Lake is a mesotrophic lake that has good water quality and a diverse plant community. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Francis Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Despite substantial residential development, Francis Lake has very good water quality and a diverse, abundant aquatic vegetation community. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation are relatively common, providing valuable fish habitat. A DNR owned ramp is located at the east end of the lake, and a county access is located at the west end of the lake. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye. Walleyes have been stocked extensively in Francis Lake to maintain the walleye population. Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings or adults have been stocked in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2011. The current management plan calls for walleye fry to be stocked at a rate of 500,000 fry every other year and 500 pounds of fingerlings if the fry stocking is unsuccessful. Other sport fish populations maintain their populations through natural reproduction. A resurvey was conducted on 7-16-2012 to monitor the sport fish populations in Francis Lake using 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets. Nighttime boat electrofishing was conducted on Frances Lake on June 6, 2011 to monitor the largemouth bass population.  Additionally, a near shore survey (Index of Biotic Integrity; IBI) was conducted in June and July to assess populations of non-game species and young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish using backpack electrofishing and seining.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality at Lake Francis was good, having a secchi depth reading of 6.0 ft. The water was moderately green, likely the result of a minor algae bloom. A dissolved oxygen profile was taken on 7-19-2012. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 9.0 ppm at the surface to 0.1 ppm at 20.0 feet of depth. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 16.0 and 17.0 ft of depth, as evidenced by a drop in temperature from 81.1 to 78.4 degrees Fahrenheit. <br> \n <br> \nPrimary management species at Francis Lake include largemouth bass and bluegill. The largemouth bass catch rate nearly doubled from the 2006 assessment, increasing from 48.0/hour in 2006 to 91.5/hour in 2011.  Size structure of the largemouth bass population has decreased from 2006.  In 2006, largemouth bass ranged from 4.0 to 17.7 inches in length and averaged 10.9 inches, and in 2011 largemouth bass ranged from 3.7 to 14.1 inches in length and averaged 9.1 inches.  Approximately 14% of largemouth bass sampled were greater than 12.0 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nPast catches of bluegill have consistently been between 15.0/trap net and 30.0/trap net. The 2012 catch rate (19.0/trap net) decreased from the 2006 catch rate (28.3/trap net), and is about average when compared to other similar lakes. Age estimates indicated that 10 year classes of bluegills were sampled (2002-2011), indicating that bluegills are long lived in Francis Lake. The size structure of bluegills in 2012 was small (minimum=2.8 inches, maximum=8.3 inches, average=4.9 inches) and decreased from the 2006 sample (minimum=2.6 inches, maximum=8.2 inches, average=6.4 inches. Based on the data, growth of bluegill in Francis Lake is relatively slow, with lengths averaging 3.4 inches, 4.4 inches, 5.3 inches, 6.2 inches, 6.8 inches, 7.6 inches, 7.4 inches, 8.3 inches, 8.0 inches, and 7.8 inches at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nSecondary management species at Francis Lake include walleye and northern pike. Walleye have historically occurred in low abundance at Francis Lake, as catch rates have ranged from 2.7/gill net in 1996 to 6.8/gill net in 1986. The 2012 catch rate fell within this range at 3.9/gill net, and is slightly higher than what would be expected in similar lakes. Estimated ages indicated a long lived walleye population, as fish up to age-13 were observed. Nine year classes of walleye were sampled including walleye from 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011, with 56% being from the 2009 year class (age-3). Walleyes ranged in length from 15.0 to 22.1 inches and averaged 17.9 inches. Walleye grew fast early in life, averaging 16.3 inches at age-3, but grew slow thereafter, with the average length of walleye being less than 22.1 inches up to age-13. The largest walleye captured was 26.6 inches and was captured in a trap net.  <br> \n <br> \nPast catch rates of northern pike have ranged between 0.9/gill net in 1991 and 7.6/gill net in 2001. In 2012, northern pike were captured at a rate of 5.4/gill net, which is moderately high when compared to similar lakes, and was consistent with the 2006 catch rate of 5.0/gill net. Seven year classes of northern pike were sampled including pike from 2001, 2002, and 2005-2009, with 75% of the pike being age-3 and age-4.  The majority of the northern pike were small, ranging in length from 12.9 to 38.6 inches and averaging 18.9 inches. Ninety-three percent of the northern pike captured were less than 21.0 inches long and nearly 50% were less than 17 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of black crappie have historically been low in Francis Lake, not surpassing 11.9/gill net or 3.0/trap net. In 2012, black crappies were caught at rates of 1.8/gill net and 0.5/trap net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Gill netted black crappies were small, ranging from 6.2 to 10.2 inches and averaging 8.4 inches. Five year classes of black crappies were sampled (2006, and 2008-2011), and had growth consistent with other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 yellow bullhead catch rate (17.3/gill net) decreased from the 2006 catch rate (24.3/gill net), which is high when compared to similar lakes. Yellow bullheads were large, as they averaged 11.7 inches, and had a maximum length of almost 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker were present, but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing and seining (10 ft or 50 ft) was conducted at 12-100 ft stations around the perimeter of Francis Lake. Nearshore IBI sampling captured several species of fish including 13 johnny darter, 717 bluegill, 216 bluntnose minnow, 19 green sunfish, 16 hybrid sunfish, 279 largemouth bass, 10 yellow bullhead, 81 yellow perch, 9 Iowa darter, 38 banded killifish, 3 black crappie, 1 blackchin shiner, 2 northern pike, 2 pugnose shiner and 59 pumkinseed. Nearshore catches will be used to develop an IBI score which will help us determine the health of Francis Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Frances is an 870-acre lake located in LeSueur County near the Town of Elysian. Lake Frances has good water quality and a diverse plant community. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Lake Frances's shoreline. In areas with residential development lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Lake Frances has very good water quality and a diverse, abundant aquatic vegetation community despite substantial residential development. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation are relatively common, providing valuable fish habitat. Eurasian Watermilfoil was found in Lake Frances in 2017 and now has an infested designation. A DNR owned ramp is located at the east end of the lake, and a county access is located at the west end of the lake. The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye.  <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of July 9, 2019 to monitor the sport fish populations in Lake Frances using 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate increased from 78.4/hour in 2016 to 212.3/hour in 2019.  However, size structure of Largemouth Bass decreased from 2016.  In 2019 Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.6 to 16.4 inches in length and averaged 10.1 inches. Approximately 12% of Largemouth Bass sampled were greater than 12.0 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nPast catches of Bluegill have consistently been between 15.0/trap net and 30.0/trap net. The 2019 catch rate was 14.5/trap net. The size structure of Bluegills in 2019 was moderate and ranged from 2.8 to 8.2 inches and averaged 5.7 inches. Age estimates showed 8 year classes of Bluegills were sampled (2010-2017), indicating Bluegills are long lived in Lake Frances. Mean length at age estimates indicated relatively slow growth of Bluegill in Lake Frances, with fish averaging 5.6 inches at age 4 and reaching 8 inches around 7 years of age. <br> \n <br> \nSecondary management species at Lake Frances include Walleye and Northern Pike. Walleye have historically occurred in low abundance at Lake Frances, as catch rates have ranged from 2.7/gill net in 1996 to 6.8/gill net in 1986. The 2019 catch rate fell within this range at 2.8/gill net. Walleye up to age-11 were observed. Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and, 2017.  Walleyes ranged in length from 12.7 to 25.6 inches and averaged 18.5 inches. Walleye grew fast, averaging 15.9 inches at age-3. <br> \n <br> \nPast catch rates of Northern Pike have ranged between 0.9/gill net in 1991 and 7.6/gill net in 2001. In 2020, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 6.1/gill net. Five year classes of Northern Pike were sampled including from 2013-2017 with 64% being age-3 and age-4.  The majority of Northern Pike were small, ranging in length from 15.4 to 29.9 inches and averaging 18.7 inches. Ninety-four percent of the Northern Pike captured were less than 24 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nLake Frances is in the Northern Pike regulation southern zone.  The regulation for Northern Pike in this zone is a 2 fish limit with a minimum length of 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Black Crappie have historically been low in Lake Frances, not surpassing 11.9/gill net or 3.0/trap net. In 2019, Black Crappies were caught at rates of 1.5/gill net and 1.2/trap net. Gill netted Black Crappies were small, ranging from 5.2 to 10.8 inches and averaging 8.8 inches. Six year classes of Black Crappies were sampled (2012-2017), and had growth consistent with other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Yellow Bullhead catch rate (50.1/gill net) was the highest on record. Yellow Bullheads were large, as they averaged 12.1 inches, and had a maximum length of 15.0 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), Pumpkinseed, hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Perch were present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nResidential development has disturbed much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Frances. Nearly 70% of Lake Frances's shorelines have been disturbed by residential development, which can adversely affect fish habitat by reducing aquatic vegetation, removing woody debris, and destabilizing lakeshores. Natural shoreline is limited (15%), occurring along the west and north shores of the lake. Municipal utilities comprised nearly 5% of the shoreline and include areas such as roads, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces. Agriculture is common in the area and accounts for approximately 10% of the shoreline. In residential areas, much of the shoreline has been altered with rock riprap or sand blankets and turf grass lawns are maintained to the edge of the water. In 2016 Dock density was high at 307 docks, and the number of houses was consistent with the previous survey at 235. <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Frances watershed is approximately 3,105 acres and is dominated by pasture (33%) and agriculture (27%) land use types. Forest (18%) is the next most abundant land use type, followed by municipal (11%), marsh (10%), and grassland (1%).  Land uses within a lakes watershed can have substantial effects on the water quality in a lake via runoff of nutrients and erosion.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Frances supports a self-sustaining population of Northern Pike, suggesting that good Northern Pike spawning habitat exists in the form of shallow vegetation and access to adjacent wetlands. Firm substrates, abundant shallow vegetation, and wind protected bays provide good habitat for centrarchids including Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. Walleye spawning habitat is poor, as windswept gravel/rubble and rocky shores are limited, except for a few areas along the north shore of Lake Frances. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality at Lake Frances was good, having a secchi depth reading of 9.0 ft. The water was brown to green, likely the result of a minor algae bloom. A dissolved oxygen profile was taken on July 8, 2019. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 9.3 ppm at the surface to 0.0 ppm at 27.0 feet of depth and greater. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 18.0 and 24.0 ft of depth. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nLake Frances has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, and motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, natural resource specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Frances is an 870-acre lake located in LeSueur County near the Town of Elysian. Lake has good water quality and a diverse plant community. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of Lake Frances's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Despite substantial residential development, Lake Frances has very good water quality and a diverse, abundant aquatic vegetation community. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation are relatively common, providing valuable fish habitat. A DNR owned ramp is located at the east end of the lake, and a county access is located at the west end of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Walleye have been stocked extensively in Lake Frances to maintain the population. Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings or adults have been stocked in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022. Fry stocking was discontinued in 2018. Other sport fish populations maintain their populations through natural reproduction. A standard survey was conducted the week of July 11, 2022, to monitor the sport fish populations in Lake Frances using 8 gill nets and 11 trap nets. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The next standard survey is scheduled for 2025. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate decreased from 212.3/hour in 2019 to 111.6/hour in 2022.  In 2022 Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.8 to 17.6 inches in length and averaged 11.1 inches. Approximately 48% of Largemouth Bass sampled were greater than 12.0 inches long. Twelve year-classes of Largemouth Bass were sampled, included in the sample were age-1 through age-12 (2010-2021).  <br> \n <br> \nPast catches of Bluegill have consistently been between 14.0/trap net and 30.0/trap net. The 2022 catch rate (15.6/trap net) increased from the 2019 catch rate (14.5/trap net). Age estimates showed 11 year-classes of Bluegills were sampled (2010-2020), indicating that Bluegills are long lived in Lake Frances. The size structure of Bluegills in 2022 was moderate with an average length of 5.6 inches and a maximum length of 8.9 inches. Mean length at age estimates indicated relatively slow growth of Bluegill in Lake Frances, typical of a long-lived population. <br> \n <br> \nSecondary management species at Lake Frances include Walleye and Northern Pike. Walleye have historically occurred in low abundance at Lake Frances, as catch rates have ranged from 2.7/gill net in 1996 to 6.8/gill net in 1986. The 2022 catch rate fell within this range at 3.2/gill net. Scales and otoliths were used to estimate age of Walleye in Lake Frances and fish up to age-16 were observed. Nine year-classes of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019.  Walleyes ranged in length from 13.3 to 23.2 inches and averaged 17.9 inches in gill nets. Walleye grew fast, averaging 15.9 inches at age-3. <br> \n <br> \nPast catch rates of Northern Pike have ranged between 0.9/gill net in 1991 and 7.6/gill net in 2001. In 2022, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 5.4/gill net which was similar to the 2019 catch rate of 6.1/gill net. Five year-classes of Northern Pike were sampled including from 2016-2021 with 69% being age-2 and age-3.  The majority of Northern Pike were small, ranging in length from 15.8 to 32.9 inches and averaging 20.5 inches. Seventy-nine percent of the Northern Pike captured were less than 24 inches long. Lake Frances is subject to southern zone Northern Pike regulations of 2 fish daily and 24 inch minimum size limit. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Black Crappie have historically been low in Lake Frances, not surpassing 11.9/gill net or 3.0/trap net. In 2022, Black Crappies were caught at rates of 4.0/gill net and 2.0/trap net. Gill netted Black Crappies were small, ranging from 5.8 to 12.3 inches and averaging 8.3 inches. Five year-classes of Black Crappies were sampled (2017-2020 and 2014), and had growth consistent with other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Yellow Bullhead catch rate (70.4/gill net) was higher than 2019 (50.1/gill net). Yellow Bullheads were large, as they averaged 12.9 inches, and had a maximum length of 15.3 inches.  Some larger fish were noted to have deformed pectoral and dorsal spines.  It was hypothesized that these fish had been sampled in 2016 and 2019 and the deformities were due to healing of broken spines from previous removal from gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker and Yellow Perch were present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nResidential development has disturbed much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Frances. It was estimated that nearly 70% of Lake Frances's shorelines have been disturbed by residential development, which can adversely affect fish habitat by reducing aquatic vegetation, removing woody debris, and destabilizing lakeshores. Natural shoreline is limited (15%), occurring along the west and north shores of the lake. Municipal utilities comprised nearly 5% of the shoreline and include areas such as roads, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces. Agriculture is common in the area and accounts for approximately 10% of the shoreline. In residential areas, much of the shoreline has been altered with rock riprap or sand blankets and turf grass lawns are maintained to the edge of the water. In 2016 dock density was high at 307 docks, and the number of houses was consistent with the previous survey at 235. <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Frances watershed is approximately 3,105 acres and is dominated by pasture (33%) and agriculture (27%) land use types. Forest (18%) is the next most abundant land use type, followed by municipal (11%), marsh (10%), and grassland (1%).  Land uses within a lake's watershed can have substantial effects on the water quality in a lake via runoff of nutrients and erosion.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Frances supports a self-sustaining population of Northern Pike, suggesting that good Northern Pike spawning habitat exists in the form of shallow vegetation and access to adjacent wetlands. Firm substrates, abundant shallow vegetation, and wind protected bays provide good habitat for centrarchids including Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. Walleye spawning habitat is poor, as windswept gravel/rubble and rocky shores are limited, except for a few areas along the north shore of Lake Frances. <br> \n  <br> \nWater quality at Lake Frances was good, having a secchi depth reading of 9.0 ft. The water was brown to green, likely the result of a minor algae bloom. A dissolved oxygen profile was taken on July 11, 2022. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 7.4 ppm at the surface to 0.0 ppm at 23.0 feet of depth and greater. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 18.0 and 24.0 ft of depth.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM 81 BUT GROWTH RATES HAVE IMPROVED AND ARE PROBABLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN BLUEGILLS AND POSSIBLY THE EXPANDED FEEDING AREAS CREATED BY HIGH WATER. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE 81 AVGING 2.00/TRAPNET COM- PARED TO 3.00/TRAPNET IN 86. THREE AGE CLASSES II,III AND IV ARE PRESENT COMPARED TO I-V AGE CLASSES SAMPLED IN 81. WHITE CRAPPIES REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM 81 WITH VERY FEW PRESENT. NORTHERN PIKE APPEAR TO HAVE DECLINED, NOW AVERAGING 1.50/ GILLNET COMPARED TO 3.42/GILLNET IN 81. THE NORTHERN POPULATION REMAINS DOMINATED BY SMALL FISH WITH A STRONG II AGE CLASS., COMPARED TO THE VERY LARGE I AGE CLASS THAT WAS PRESENT IN 81. WALLEYES WERE SAMPLED IN GOOD NUMBERS AVERAGING 6.75/GILLNET, WHICH ALMOST EXCEEDS THE AREA MEDIAN BY THREE TIMES; WALLEYES AVERAGED 3.50/GILLNET IN 81. WALLEYES ARE NOW DOMINATED BY I AGE CLASS FISH COMPARED TO THE STRONG II AGE CLASS IN 81. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THE I AGE CLASS IS PROBABLY FROM AN 85 WALLEYE FRY STOCKING THAT COULD BE DUP- LICATED IN THE FUTURE. IN BOTH 81 AND 86 SURVEYS SIX AGE CLASSES OF WALLEYES WERE SAMPLED. AGE GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATES A SLOW GROWING WALLEYE POPULATION AND MAY INDICATE INSUFFICIENT FORAGE PRESENT. LARGEMOUTH BASS APPEAR TO BE DOING WELL, AVERAGING 1.25/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.50,GILLNET IN 81. OTHER GAMEFISH SPECIES THAT REMAIN UNCHANGD AND IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE WHITE BASS AND PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE SHOWN A NOTABLE INCREASE FROM 0.92/GILLNET IN 81 TO 40.58/GILLNET IN 86. OTHER NON-GAMEFISH POPULATIONS THAT HAVE SHOWN LITTLE CHANGE AND ARE IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS INCLUDE WHITE SUCKER, CARP, BOWFIN, YELLOW BULLHEAD, AND GREEN SUNFISH.</p>",

Lake Francis continues to support a healthy population of northern pike, although the average size is small.  Bluegill remain abundant, although slow growth has resulted in a relatively small average size with most individuals ranging from 4-7 inches.  Largemouth bass remain abundant and the population supports fair numbers of quality-sized individuals.</p>",
