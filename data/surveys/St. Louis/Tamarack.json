The surrounding landscape is dominated by a coniferous forest with rock outcroppings common. There are several private cabins located near the lake primarily along the N and W shores. There is no public access present. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2017 survey of Tamarack Lake indicate a fish community where bluegill and northern pike are common. Other species sampled in relatively low abundances include largemouth bass and walleye. One black crappie was also sampled. Yellow perch were observed in pike stomach samples and reported by a property owner. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2017 (19.9/trap net) were higher than the long term average (0.9/ trap net) for Tamarack Lake and higher than average compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average bluegill sampled was 5.6 inches long with less than 3 percent of the bluegill sampled 8 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (4.3/gill net) were higher than the long term average (1.0/gill net) and above average compared to other similar area lakes. The average pike sampled was 20.6 inches and largest pike was 33.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
