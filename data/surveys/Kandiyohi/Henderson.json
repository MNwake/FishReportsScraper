BLG PSD AND MEAN WEIGHT PER FISH IN 1990 WERE SIMILAR TO PAST SURVEY'S HOWEVER, BLC PSD AND MEAN WEIGHT PER FISH WERE AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS IN THE 1990 SURVEY.  THE BLACK BULLHEAD GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN 1990 (0.33 PER SET) COMPARED TO THE HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVEL FOUND IN THE 1986 SURVEY (40.7 PER SET).  THE DECLINE IN THE NOP GILLNET CATCH INDEX IN 1990 WAS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NOP STOCKED INTO THE LAKE FROM WINTER RESCUE OPERATIONS DURING THE MID-TO-LATE 1980'S.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Henderson is a small and moderately deep lake with good water quality and clarity.Henderson is highly developed with 1 resort and 38 homes/cabins (1991 survey). Submergentvegetation stands (coontail, water moss, bushy pondweed, flatstem pondweed) are moderate indensity. Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) is restricted to the shallow west bay whereHenderson connects to Ringo Lake via a shallow wetland during high water conditions. Amoderate red/brown algae bloom is sometimes apparent in Henderson after the fall turnovereach year. Local anglers have reported good success for catching moderate sized bluegillduring the summer and black crappie during the spring of 2000.     Northern pike numbers in 2000 (9.67 fish/gillnet) were abundant compared to thehistorical average (5.28 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pike average size was small (1.88lbs. and 18.96 inches, gillnet). The largest northern pike captured was 31.10 inches from the2000 survey nets.     Yellow perch numbers in 2000 (18.33 fish/gillnet) were moderately abundant, but similarto the historical average (17.61 fish/gillnet).  The 2000 yellow perch average size was small(0.10 lbs. and 6.22 inches, gillnets), but similar to the historical average (6.20 inches,gillnets and trapnets combined). Large adult yellow perch (555 pre-spawn fish) were stockedin 1997 to boost previously low numbers in Henderson.     Walleye numbers in 2000 (0.33 fish/gillnet) were low compared to the historical average(1.67 fish/gillnet). Walleye adults (171 fish at 1.1 lbs each) and fingerlings (2,850 at 10.8fish/lb.) were stocked into Henderson during the fall of 2000.     Bluegill numbers in 2000 (138.33 fish/trapnet) were abundant and above the historicalaverage (66.56 fish/trapnet). The 2000 bluegill average size (0.19 lbs. and 5.78 inches,trapnets) was moderate and above the historical average (5.26 inches, gillnets and trapnetscombined). Bluegill growth rates have improved in Henderson during the last few years.     Black crappie numbers were low in the 2000 survey (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to thehistorical average (2.82 fish/gillnet). Adult black crappie (243 pre-spawn fish) were stockedinto Henderson during the spring of 1999.     There was no spring electrofishing survey conducted in 2000 for largemouth bass.Abundant numbers of largemouth bass (102.04 fish/hour, 10.91 inches average size) weredocumented in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey.      Local anglers have experienced good fishing success in recent years for a variety ofspecies in Henderson. It appears that the bluegill average size has significantly improvedin Henderson compared to previous surveys. Presently, there are moderate to high numbers ofbluegill predators (northern pike, largemouth bass, yellow perch) present in Henderson.Further stockings of large yellow perch may be warranted as an experimental technique forreducing young of year bluegill numbers through predation. A resurvey will be conducted onHenderson to determine gamefish abundance, size, and growth in 2004.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey was conducted on Henderson Lake in early July of 2014. Henderson is a small (75 acres), deep (57 feet maximum), and lowly productive lake (2014 total phosphorus=0.015 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. Henderson is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. The water clarity was excellent on July 7, 2014 (secchi=9.0 feet). Dissolved oxygen was less than 1.0 ppm below 24 feet deep on July 7, 2014. Submergent vegetation (various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, and northern milfoil) was moderate to abundant within the littoral area of the lake. Filamentous algae was notable along the northeast corner of the lake in 2014. Algae blooms with a brown/red color have occasionally occurred in past years during the fall or spring turnover periods. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush along the west shore and common cattail along the west bay area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, pastures, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are no discernable inlets that flow into the lake. The outlet is connected to a marsh area west of the lake. The marsh area can connect to Ringo Lake during high water via a 30 inch steel culvert under U.S. Highway 71. Less desirable species such as black bullhead and carp have moved into Henderson from Ringo during high water events. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Henderson Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were moderately abundant (54.71 fish/hour) in a 2014 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 57.27 fish/hour for Henderson Lake. The 2014 largemouth bass average size was small (0.78 pounds and 11.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. The historical average weight and length were 1.17 pounds and 12.42 inches. Low numbers of larger (15.00 plus inches) largemouth bass (3.53 fish/hour) were captured in 2014. Largemouth bass growth rates were poor. The 2010 year class comprised 43% of the 2014 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (16.99 fish/trapnet). The 2014 black crappie average size was moderate (0.45 pounds and 9.27 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were poor. All of the black crappie captured were from either the 2009 or 2008 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers of small fish (2.09 pounds and 20.43 inches average size) were abundant in 2014 (10.50 fish/gillnet) especially compared to the historical average of 5.43 fish/gillnet. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.18 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were poor for ages 1-3, but excellent for ages 4-5. The majority of northern pike were from the 2012 and 2011 year classes. The largest northern pike captured was 32.7 inches from a gillnet in 2014. There have been occasional reports of large northern pike (10 pound plus) harvested in recent years from Henderson. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were absent in both 2014 gillnets and trapnets. There were 4.67 yellow perch/gillnet in the previous 2009 assessment. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 15.63 fish/gillnet. Adult perch were last stocked into Henderson during 2002 (556 fish, 270 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2014 (1.50 fish/gillnet) but similar to the historical average of 1.61 fish/gillnet. The walleye average size was moderate (1.02 pounds and 14.32 inches) from 2014 gillnets. The walleye historical average weight was 2.46 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were poor. The majority of walleye captured were from 2010 and 2011 year classes. Walleye yearlings or adults have been stocked in recent years instead of fingerlings due to better potential survival in lakes with abundant bass and northern pike populations. Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in Henderson Lake based on previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2014 (12.17 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 115.72 fish/trapnet. The bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.85 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 8.0 inches from a trapnet in 2014. There were moderate numbers of bluegill 6.0 plus inches (7.33 fish/trapnet), but low numbers of bluegill 8 plus inches (0.17 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were generally poor to fair for ages 1-6. A variety of bluegill year classes were captured in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (0.17 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (1.24 fish/trapnet). The 2014 black bullhead average size was large (1.34 pounds and 13.27 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.90 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were not captured in 2014 (0.00 fish/gillnet). The carp historical average catch rate is 0.52 fish/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Henderson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Henderson Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2019 spring for largemouth bass and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Henderson Lake in early July of 2009. Henderson is a small (73 acres), deep (57 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake (2004 total phosphorus=0.021 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. The water clarity was excellent on July 6, 2009 (secchi=11.0 feet). Submergent vegetation (various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, northern milfoil, and filamentous algae) is moderate to abundant within the littoral area of the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush along the west shore and common cattail along the west bay area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, pastures, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are no discernable inlets that flow into the lake. Henderson Lake can connect during high water periods via a wetland area (west bay) to Ringo Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Henderson Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were low (16.96 fish/hour) in the 2009 spring electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.01 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 58.00 fish/hour for Henderson Lake. The 2009 largemouth bass average size was large (1.70 pounds and 14.42 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2009 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger) largemouth bass was low (6.52 fish/hour) for Henderson. Largemouth bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2002 and 2001 year classes each comprised 27% of the 2009 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2009 (1.33 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 2.69 fish/gillnet. The 2009 black crappie trapnet catch rate (0.33 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (18.24 fish/trapnet). The 2009 black crappie average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.99 inches) from gillnets, but large (0.68 pounds) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in Henderson were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2007 black crappie year class comprised 33% of the 2009 black crappie assessment catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low to moderate in 2009 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.01 fish/gillnet. The 2009 northern pike average size was moderate (3.25 pounds and 24.05 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.27 pounds from gillnets. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches and larger) northern pike was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet) for Henderson. Northern pike growth rates were below or near the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2007 northern pike year class comprised 44% of the 2009 northern pike assessment catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2009 (4.67 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 16.93 fish/gillnet. The 2009 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.27 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.10 pounds. Yellow perch growth rates were below or near the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2007 and 2005 yellow perch year classes each comprised 45% of the 2009 yellow perch assessment catch. Adult perch were stocked into Henderson during 2002 (556 fish, 270 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate to high in 2009 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.62 fish/gillnet for Henderson. The 2009 walleye average size was moderate (1.39 pounds and 14.68 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight was 2.59 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates in Henderson were above or near the high end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2007 walleye year class comprised 70% of the 2009 assessment catch from gillnets and trapnets. Walleye were recently stocked in 2002 (6,409 yearlings, 556 adults), 2004 (3,260 yearlings, 60 adults), 2005 (1,000 fingerlings), 2007 (1,791 yearlings/adults), 2008 (1,000 fingerlings), and 2009 (166 adults). Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in Henderson Lake based on previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2009 (327.33 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 124.35 fish/trapnet for Henderson Lake. The 2009 bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.14 pounds and 5.55 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches and larger) bluegill was high (126.56 fish/trapnet) in 2009. The catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches and larger) bluegill was low (0.50 fish/trapnet) in 2009. Bluegill growth rates in Henderson Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2005 year class comprised 39% of the total bluegill catch in the 2009 assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low to moderate in 2009 (0.83 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The 2009 black bullhead average size was large (1.01 pounds and 11.65 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.85 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers were low in 2009 (0.33 fish/gillnet). The carp historical average catch rate is 0.56 fish/gillnet. The 2009 carp average size was large (7.89 pounds and 25.67 inches) from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Henderson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Henderson Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2014 spring for largemouth bass and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Henderson Lake in late June of 2004. Henderson is a small (73 acres), deep (57 feet maximum), and low to moderate productivity lake (total phosphorus=0.021 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. The water clarity was excellent on June 14, 2004 (secchi=13.67 feet). Submergent vegetation (various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, northern milfoil, and filamentous algae) is moderate to abundant within the littoral area of the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush along the west shore and common cattail along the west bay area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, pastures, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are no discernable inlets that flow into Henderson Lake. Henderson Lake can connect during high water periods via a wetland area (west bay) to Ringo Lake. There are 39 homes and a resort located along the lakeshore. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Henderson Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye. Largemouth bass abundance was high (70.91 fish/hour) in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey compared to the average catch rate from area lakes (47.22 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 68.26 fish/hour for Henderson Lake. The 2004 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.49 pounds and 13.83 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey was 18.43 inches. The 2004 catch rate of largemouth bass 15.00 inches and larger was high (28.64 fish/hour) in Henderson. Largemouth bass growth rates in Henderson were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 1999 year class comprised 35% of the 2004 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Black crappie numbers were moderate to high in 2004 (4.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 2.81 fish/gillnet. The black crappie average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.06 inches) from gillnets. Black crappie growth rates in Henderson were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2000 black crappie year class comprised 83% of the 2004 black crappie resurvey catch. Black crappie adults (243 fish) were stocked into Henderson Lake during 1999. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2004 (4.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.19 fish/gillnet. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (3.23 pounds and 24.07 inches) from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 resurvey was 30.16 inches. Northern pike growth rates in Henderson were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2001 northern pike year class comprised 46% of the 2004 northern pike resurvey catch. Yellow perch numbers were abundant in 2004 (22.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 18.04 fish/gillnet for Henderson Lake. The 2004 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 5.99 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2001 yellow perch year class comprised 99% of the 2004 yellow perch resurvey catch. Adult perch were stocked into Henderson during 2002 (556 fish, 270 pounds).Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.58 fish/gillnet for Henderson Lake. The 2004 walleye average size was large (3.08 pounds and 19.74 inches) from gillnets. Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in Henderson Lake base on previous surveys. Walleye fingerlings were last stocked in 2000 (2,850 fish, 81 pounds). Walleye adults or yearlings were stocked recently in 2000 (171 adults, 184 pounds), 2002 (6,409 yearlings, 196 pounds), and 2004 (3,260 yearlings, 60 pounds; 60 adults, 30 pounds). Walleye fingerlings or yearlings will be stocked into Henderson Lake during 2006.Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2004 (499.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 105.90 fish/trapnet for Henderson Lake. The 2004 bluegill average size was small (0.08 lbs. and 4.85 inches) from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured in the 2004 resurvey was 7.05 inches. The 2004 catch rate of bluegill 6.00 inches and larger bluegill was high (28.69 fish/trapnet) in Henderson. Bluegill growth rates in Henderson Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 1999 bluegill year class comprised 72% of the total bluegill catch in the 2004 resurvey catch.Current fish management activities on Henderson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Henderson Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2008 spring for largemouth bass and summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Henderson is a small (73 acres), deep (maximum depth=57 feet), and clear lake. Nutrientlevels (phosphorus) are low in the lake. Henderson is one of the best lakes for water qualityin the area. There is a small connection (west side) to Ringo Lake via a marsh during highwater. This connection is an outlet most of the time. Presently, there is a small fishbarrier at the Henderson outlet. The lake is developed around the entire shoreline except forthe west shore marsh area with 38 residential homes/cabins and one farm site. Summerdissolved oxygen levels were good above 19 feet during 7-13-95. The top water layers (0-19feet) lose nutrients throughout the summer to the bottom layers (>19 feet) which becomesanoxic (low or no oxygen). Algae blooms have been occurring during the spring and falloverturn events. The spring/fall algae blooms give the water a brown/red appearance. Coppersulfate has been used in the past to reduce algae blooms caused by spring overturns. However,copper sulfate treatments in the early summer may speed up the clear water phase which mayalso damage the food chain and further in-lake nutrient recycling. Submergent vegetation werefrequently occurring throughout the lake down to depths of 19.0 feet in 1994. Emergentvegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail) were restricted to the outlet marsh area (westshore). Hardstem bulrush stands (important fish habitat) were once located along most of thewest shore (1975 survey). Development related activities and possibly copper sulfateapplications have caused these bulrush stands to disappear. The shoalwater substrates aremostly sand and gravel. The shoreline is characterized by a hardwood fringe withinresidential lots on moderate to steep slopes. Past fisheries management activities onHenderson have included walleye fingerling (3 lbs/littoral acre) stocking every other year,winter rescue northern pike stocking, stunted bluegill removal (416 fish in 1974-75, 1,430fish in 1986, 5,701 fish in 1987, 192 fish in 1989), and issuance of B-permits for blackbullhead removal. It has been proposed to stock Henderson with numerous large (> 7 inches)yellow perch when available to increase predation upon bluegill young of year and yearlings.A decrease in small bluegills could stimulate increased bluegill growth rates because ofdecreased competition for food resources. Yellow perch were not stocked during the 1994-95or 1995-96 winters because large fish were unavailable.          Henderson was surveyed in 1994 and 1995 to provide base line data prior to experimentalstocking of large yellow perch in order to possibly reduce young of year/yearling bluegillnumbers and increase bluegill growth rates. It appears that suitable numbers of large yellowperch (> 7 inches) were not present within Henderson. Bluegill have been historicallyabundant (average=46.3 fish/trapnet), but small (average size=5.3 inches) with slow growthin Henderson. Presently bluegill numbers are reduced (19.3 fish/trapnet in 1995) and theaverage size (5.9 inches in 1995) has increased compared to previous surveys, however, growthrates are still slow compared to other area lakes. Presently, northern pike numbers are low,but the average size is large (27.8 inches). The largest northern pike captured was 35.9inches. Northern pike natural reproduction has been historically limited, but adequatenorthern pike numbers can be maintained by stocking winter rescue fish when available. Thespring electrofishing survey indicated that moderate to abundant fish (35.8 fish/hour,average size=13.0 inches) were present in the spring of 1995. The low catch rates of walleyein the gillnets may not be indicative of the true population abundance. If walleye arestocked in the future, carry over adults or large fingerlings would probably have the bestchance of surviving and providing a fishery in Henderson for the angling public. Ifexperimental stocking of large yellow perch does occur then northern pike and walleye numbersmay have to be managed at lower levels. Black crappie numbers and average size (8.7 inches)appear to have improved in 1995. The largemouth bass population appears to have moderatenumbers (spring electrofishing=25.0 fish/hour) and good average size (1.5 lbs, 13.0 inches).The largest bass captured in the spring survey was 19.5 inches. Carp and black bullheadpopulations were minimal and below the historical averages in 1995. Habitat priorities forHenderson Lake include restoring hardstem bulrush stands along the west shore with landownersupport, encouraging residential lakeshore owners to reduce lawn fertilizer use, encouraginginadequate septic systems to be updated, discouraging copper sulfate treatments, andencouraging the residential and agricultural landowners to implement best managementpractices such as planting shoreline buffer strips.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Henderson Lake in mid-July of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nHenderson is a small (75 acres), deep (57 feet maximum), and low productivity lake (2014 total phosphorus=0.015 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. Henderson is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. The water clarity was excellent on July 13, 2020 (secchi=12.0 feet). Dissolved oxygen was less than 1.0 ppm below 24 feet deep on July 13, 2020. Aquatic vegetation (clasping-leaf pondweed, bushy pondweed, sago pondweed, water moss, muskgrass, filamentous algae, coontail, and northern milfoil) was moderate to abundant within the littoral area of the lake. Eurasian water milfoil was present at 80% of the transect sites. Eurasian water milfoil was first documented during 2018 in Henderson. Algae blooms with a brown/red color have occasionally occurred in past years during the fall or spring turnover periods. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush along the west shore and cattails along the west bay area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The lake is highly developed (51 homes, 2020 survey). The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, pastures, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are no discernable inlets that flow into the lake. The outlet is connected to a wetland area west of the lake. The wetland area can connect to Ringo Lake during high water via a 30 inch steel culvert under U.S. Highway 71. Less desirable species such as Black Bullhead and Common Carp have moved into Henderson from Ringo during high water events. Water levels were low during 2020. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Henderson Lake for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2020 (0.83 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 15.83 fish/trapnet. Black Crappie were absent in the 2020 gillnets. The 2020 Black Crappie average size was large (0.64 pounds and 10.43 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.35 pounds from trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were slow for ages 1-8. The 2015 and 2014 year classes comprised 60% and 40% of the 2020 Black Crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2020 (1.17 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 107.54 fish/trapnet for Henderson Lake. The 2020 Bluegill gillnet catch rate (7.00 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (3.29 fish/gillnet). The 2020 Bluegill average size was large from trapnets (0.29 pounds and 6.96 inches) and gillnets (0.24 pounds and 6.77 inches). The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 8.35 inches. Bluegill growth rates were slow for ages 1-5, but normal for ages 6-8. The 2013 and 2016 year classes comprised 38% and 29% respectively of the 2020 Bluegill catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2020 summer survey gear (2.00 fish/gillnet). A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2020 due to Covid. Largemouth Bass were abundant in a 2014 spring electrofishing survey (54.71 fish/hour) and was similar to the historical average of 57.27 fish/hour for Henderson Lake. The 2014 Largemouth Bass average size was small (0.78 pounds and 11.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2020 (7.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.55 fish/gillnet. The 2020 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.30 pounds and 23.99 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 3.19 pounds from gillnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 37.99 inches. Northern Pike growth rates were slow for ages 1-5, but above fast for ages 4-5. The 2015 year class comprised 44% of the 2020 Northern Pike catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Henderson in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2020 (3.50 fish/gillnet) when compared to similar lakes and the historical average catch rate (1.74 fish/gillnet) for Henderson. The 2020 Walleye average size was moderate (1.11 pounds and 13.21 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight was 2.35 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were fair for ages 1-5. The 2019 and 2017 Walleye stocked year classes comprised 67% and 20% respectively of the 2020 Walleye catch. Walleye were recently stocked in 2013 (474 yearlings), 2014 (157 adults), 2015 (109 adults and 19 yearlings), 2016 (111 adults, 6 yearlings), 2018 (52 adults) and 2019 (59 adults, 1,783 fingerlings). Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in Henderson Lake based on previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2020 (12.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 15.40 fish/gillnet. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.14 inches). The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.10 pounds. Adult perch were last stocked into Henderson during 2002 (556 fish, 270 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured included low numbers of White Sucker and Hybrid Sunfish. Black Bullhead and Common Carp were not captured in the 2020 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nMultiple private chemical treatments for Eurasian water milfoil had occurred on Henderson shortly before the 2020 summer survey was conducted. This may have negatively affected our nearshore trapnet catch of fish species. Copper based herbicides are a known fish irritant, which may have pushed fish from away the shallow nearshore treatment areas and trapnets stations and into deeper water, thus reducing our trapnet catch numbers especially of Bluegill and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Henderson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Henderson Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2025 spring for Largemouth Bass and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Henderson is a small (73 acres), deep (maximum depth=57 feet), and clear (secchi=15.3feet on 6/27/94) lake. Total phosphorous levels were low (0.021 ppm), but total alkalinitywas moderate (224 ppm) on 8-22-90. Henderson is one of the best water quality lakes in thearea. There is a small connection (west side) to Ringo Lake (34-172) via a marsh during highwater. This connection is an outlet most of the time. There has been some possibleimmigration of black bullhead during the 1980's and carp in the 1950's from Ringo intoHenderson. Presently, there is a small fish barrier at the Henderson outlet. The lake isdeveloped with 38 residential homes/cabins and one farm site (west shore) around the entirelake except for the west shore marsh area. Summer dissolved oxygen levels are good (> 5 ppm)above 25 feet. The thermocline (temperature barrier) is generally persistent throughout thesummer. The upper layers of the lake loses nutrients throughout the summer to the bottomlayers (below the thermocline) which becomes void of oxygen. Algae blooms have been commonlately during spring and fall mixing of water layers (the water has a brown/red appearancedue to the algae). Copper sulfate has been used in the past to reduce algae blooms caused byspring mixing. Copper sulfate treatments in the early summer may speed up the clear waterphase, however it may also damage the food chain and further in-lake nutrient recycling.Submergent vegetation species were frequently occurring throughout the lake to depths of 19.0feet. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail) were restricted to outlet marsharea (west shore). Hardstem bulrush stands were once located along most of the west shore(1975 survey). Development and possibly copper sulfate applications have caused these standsto disappear. The shoalwater substrates were mostly sand and gravel. The shoreline ischaracterized by a hardwood fringe within residential lots on moderate to steep slopes.Recent fisheries management on Henderson has included walleye fingerling (3 lbs/littoralacre) stocking every other year, winter rescue northern pike stocking, stunted bluegillremoval (416 fish in 1974-75, 1,430 fish in 1986, 5,701 fish in 1987, 192 fish in 1989),issuance of B-permits for black bullhead removal. It has been proposed to stock Hendersonwith numerous large (> 7 inches) yellow perch when available to promote bluegill growththrough the predation of young of year/yearling bluegill. The 1994 survey was conducted todetermine the abundance of various species prior to any stockings. Preferred sizes of yellowperch were not available in 1994-95 winter so stocking has not yet taken place.        Bluegill abundance in 1994 (34.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (5.7 - 40.5fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (50.1 fish/trapnet). The1994 average size (5.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly above thehistorical average (5.2 inches). The largest bluegill caught was 6.8 inches. Growth rateswere slow in 1994 and similar to previous surveys. All fish captured were 4 plus years orolder.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (2.8 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.5 -3.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (30.2 fish/trapnet).The 1994 average size (7.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was similar to thehistorical average (7.3 inches). The largest fish captured was 7.7 inches. All of the blackcrappie captured were from the 1991 year class. Growth rates appear slow.     Largemouth bass have been historically abundant in Henderson. The 1991 catch rate washigh (75.4 fish/hour) with moderate growth rates, an average size of 1.0 lb. A springelectrofishing survey was not conducted in 1994, but was conducted during the spring of 1995(25.0 fish/hour, average size=1.5 lbs) for an upcoming full survey.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (4.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.8 -8.7 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average (5.6fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (2.6 lbs from gillnets) was below the historical average(3.1 lbs). The largest fish caught in 1994 was 27.8 inches. Growth rates appear average togood. There appears to be fish represented in the survey catch throughout the first five yearclasses. Natural reproduction is fair within the lake, but spawning access into the westshore marsh is prohibited by a fish barrier used to prevent migration of carp and bullheadinto the lake.      Walleye abundance in 1994 (1.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.5 - 3.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and comparable to the historical average (2.1 fish/gillnet).Spring electrofishing in 1995 indicated a successful 1993 stocked year class (30.0 fish/hour,average size=13.0 inches on 5-26-95) present. The 1994 survey average size (16.1 inches fromgillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly below the historical average (17.9 inches). Thelargest fish caught was 26.2 inches. About 82% of the fish captured in the survey appear tobe from stocked year classes.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (3.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.5 -23.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (20.6 fish/gillnet).The spring electrofishing crew reported seeing many small yellow perch while shockingHenderson in 1995. The 1994 average size (6.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wassimilar to the historical average (6.2 inches). The largest fish caught was 6.7 inches.Growth rates appear average. About 82% of the fish appear to be from the 1991 year class.      Carp abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 1.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (3.0 fish/trapnet). The1994 average size (3.5 lbs from trapnets) is above the historical average (2.7 lbs).     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (1.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.5 -11.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (6.5 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (9.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly below thehistorical average (9.9 inches). There have been no reported catches of yellow bullhead inHenderson.     Henderson was surveyed in 1994 to provide base line data prior to experimental stockingof large yellow perch in order to possibly reduce young of year/yearling bluegill numbers andincrease bluegill growth rates. It appears that suitable numbers of large yellow perch (> 7inches) are not present within Henderson. The decision to stock yellow perch to controlbluegill within the next few years is on hold presently to promote continued good growthrates for a good year class of walleye (1993) in Henderson. Although, bluegill numbers arereduced compared to previous surveys, growth rates are still slow. Both largemouth bass andnorthern pike populations appear to have moderate numbers and adequate size ranges present.Northern pike numbers could be supplemented after successive years of poor naturalreproduction with stocked winter rescue fish when available. If experimental stocking ofyellow perch does occur then northern pike numbers may have to be managed at lower levels.Habitat priorities include restoring hardstem bulrush stands along the west shore withlandowner support, encouraging residential lakeshore owners to reduce lawn fertilizer use,encouraging inadequate septic systems to be updated, discouraging copper sulfate treatments,and encouraging the residential and agricultural landowners to plant shoreline buffer strips.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Henderson is a small and deep lake located in Kandiyohi County. It is one of the bestlakes for water quality in Kandiyohi County. Nutrient productivity is low to moderate inHenderson. The water clarity was excellent on June 29, 1998. Aquatic vegetation densities aremoderate in Henderson. Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) are restricted to the outletarea. The shoal water substrates are mostly sand and gravel. Henderson is highly developedwith lake homes and cabins. Henderson is primarily a bass-panfish angling lake. However,northern pike and walleye are also sought by anglers. DNR Spicer Fisheries have stockedwinter rescue northern pike, walleye fingerlings, black crappie adults, and yellow perchadults in the past. Walleye fingerlings (215 fish, 86 lbs.) were last stocked during the 1998fall. In 1997, large yellow perch (555 fish, 150 lbs.) were stocked into Henderson for youngof year \"YOY\" bluegill control.     Largemouth bass were abundant in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (101.69fish/hour) compared to the historical average (67.49 fish/hour), but the average size wassmall (0.83 lbs.). The largest bass captured during the 1998 spring electrofishing survey was19.5 inches. Approximately 69% of largemouth bass captured in the 1998 spring electrofishingsurvey belonged to the 1994 year class.     Bluegill were also abundant in the 1998 summer survey (157.00 fish/trapnet) compared tothe historical average (58.58 fish/trapnet), however the average length was also small (4.5inches, trapnets). The largest bluegill captured in the 1998 survey was 6.9 inches. Themajority of bluegill captured in the 1998 survey nets belonged to the 1995 year class.     Black crappie numbers in the 1998 summer survey (0.50 fish/trapnet, 1.00 fish/gillnet)were below the historical averages (24.21 fish/trapnet, 2.84 fish/gillnet), however theaverage length was good (9.3 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined). The 1994 black crappieyear class accounted for 67% of the 1998 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults (81 lbs.)are scheduled to be stocked in the 1999 spring to increase brood stock numbers and increase natural reproduction.     Walleye numbers were low in the 1998 summer survey (1.67 fish/gillnet), but similar tothe historical average (1.82 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average length was large (17.8inches, gillnets and trapnets combined). The majority of walleye caught in the 1998 surveywere from stocked year classes except for the 1995 year class. Northern pike abundance in the1998 summer survey (2.67 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (4.80 fish/gillnet),however the average length was moderate (24.8 inches, gillnets). The largest northern pikecaptured in the 1998 survey was 27.8 inches. Yellow perch abundance in the 1998 summer survey(13.33 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the historical average (17.53 fish/gillnet), butabove the two previous surveys. The 1998 yellow perch average length was moderate (6.5inches, gillnets). The largest yellow perch captured during the 1998 survey was 9.6 inches.     Henderson generally receives minimal fishing pressure throughout the year. Thelargemouth bass numbers are presently high, however the average size is small. Although,there are a few big bass (>18 inches) present in the lake. Both northern pike and walleye arepresent in sufficient numbers to provide a secondary fishery in Henderson Lake. Henderson hasa history of producing stunted bluegills. Large yellow perch were stocked in 1997 in orderfacilitate greater predation of YOY bluegill. Hopefully, bluegill numbers can be reduced bythe abundant largemouth bass population and moderate yellow perch population in order toimprove bluegill growth rates and size structure. It will take more time and yellow perchstockings before we can properly evaluate the success or failure of this technique forincreasing bluegill growth in Henderson. Henderson will be monitored every four years byspring bass electrofishing and summer test netting in order to evaluate the effectiveness ofmanagement practices.</p>",
