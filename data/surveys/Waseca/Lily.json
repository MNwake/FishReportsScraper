                "narrative": "<p>ADULT BLG AND BLC WERE STOCKED IN LILY LAKE AT 10 LB./ACRE IN 1990.  ONLY A FEW OF THESE FISH WERE CAPTURED AS 4 YEAR OLDS IN THE 1991 SURVEY, AND NO AGE 5 BLG WERE CAPTURED IN THIS NETTING. THE SAME (1990 & 1989) YEAR CLASSES THAT DOMINATED THE 1991 SURVEY AS 1 AND 2 YEAR OLDS CONTINUED TO DOMINATE IN 1992, AS 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS.  TRAP NET CATCH INCREASED FROM 22.75/NET IN 1991 TO 44.00/ NET IN 1992.  BOTH THESE CATCH RATES ARE WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES, THOUGH THE 1992 CATCH IS NEAR THE LIMIT OF THE UPPER QUARTILE.  THE 1992 RANGE OF BLG LENGTHS WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT SEEN IN 1991; 3.0-7.4, COMPARED TO 3.0-7.9.  MODAL LENGTH RANGE INCREASED FROM 3.5-3.9 IN 1991 TO 4.5-4.9 IN 1992.  BLG GROWTH CONTINUED TO BE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGE CLASSES.  THE 1990 YEAR CLASS OF BLC WAS THE ONLY ONE SAMPLED IN THE 1991 SURVEY.  THIS YEAR, THAT YEAR CLASS DOMINATED THE NET CATCH AGAIN, AND NO OLDER BLC WERE SAMPLED.  TRAP NET CATCH RATE INCREASED AS EXPECTED AS BLC GREW TO A SIZE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE GEAR.  CATCH WAS 1.75/TRAP NET, COMPARED TO 0 BLC CAPTURED IN TRAP NETS AND ONLY 2 CAPTURED IN GILL NETS IN 1991.  BLC TRAP NET CATCH IS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES, BUT IS JUST WITHIN THE LIMIT OF THE LOWER QUARTILE. GROWTH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE FOR BOTH AGE 1 AND 2 BLC.  NOP GILL NET CATCH INCREASED FROM 3.67/NET IN 1991 TO 6.00/NET IN 1992, PUTTING THE CATCH WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES.  NOP WERE AGES 3-6, WITH HALF OF THE FISH AGE 4.  THIS AGREES WITH THE 1991 AGING, WHEN ALL OF THE NOP WERE SOMEWHAT TENTATIVELY AGED AT 3.  NOP LENGTHS RANGED FROM 18.0-26.9, LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE 1991 RANGE OF 18.0-29.9.  GROWTH WAS AVERAGE FOR ALL NOP EXCEPT THE ONE AGED AT 6.  AGING ERROR IS POSSIBLE HERE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE 1991 COMMENT THAT  DECREASED FROM 9.67/GILL NET IN 1991 TO 7.00/GILL NET IN 1992 A CATCH STILL ABOVE THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES.  WAE RANGED FROM 15.0- 19.9 LENGTH CLASS.  IN 1991, WAE RANGED FROM 11.5-17.9 INCHES, WITH FISH 13.0-15.9 INCHES.  ALL FISH WERE AGE 3, A COHORT CORRESPONDING TO THE USE OF LILY LAKE AS A WAE REARING POND IN 1989.  GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE WELL ABOVE AVERAGE, NOT UNLIKELY GIVEN THE POST-WINTER KILL ENVIRONMENT INTO WHICH THE FISH WERE STOCKED.  THOUGH THE PMK CATCH HAS DECLINED FROM 54.50/TRAP NET IN 1991 TO 11.25/TRAP NET IN 1992, THE CATCH IS STILL ABOVE IN INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES.  THE LENGTH RANGE FOR PMK HASN'T CHANGED APPRECIABLY SINCE 1991, AND THE MODAL LENGTH CLASS HAS ONLY INCREASED 0.5 1990 YEAR CLASS CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE CATCH, AND GROWTH IS AVERAGE.  YEP WERE SAMPLED AT 14.00/ GILL NET, UP FROM 2.33/GILL NET IN 1991.  THE 1992 CATCH IS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES.  SMALLER YEP SAMPLED IN BOTH YEARS WERE IN THE 5.5-5.9 INCH LENGTH CLASS, BUT THE UPPER END OF THE LENGTH RANGE INCREASED FROM 6.4 TO 7.4 FROM 1991 TO 1992.  THE 1989 AND 1990 YEAR CLASSES WERE THE ONES CAPTURED IN THIS SURVEY, AS THEY WERE IN 1991.  ONCE AGAIN, GROWTH AT AGE 1 WAS ABOVE AVERAGE, AND WAS AVERAGE FOR AGES 2 AND 3. BLB CATCH DECLINED FROM 186.00/GILL NET IN 1991 TO 112.00/GILL NET IN 1992, BUT WAS STILL ABOVE THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 36 LAKES.  BLB LENGTH RANGE IS 5.0-7.9 INCHES, THE SAME AS IN 1991.  FISH 5.0-6.5 INCHES WERE PREDOMINANT LAST YEAR.  IN 1992, FISH 5.5-6.4 AND 7.0-7.9 INCHES WERE MOST COMMON.  THE YEB CATCH OF 6.00/GILL NET IS UNCHANGED FROM THE 5.67/GILL NET CAPTURED IN 1991.  YEB RANGED FROM 6.5/12.9 INCHES IN 1991 AND FROM 8.0-13.9 INCHES IN 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake in Waseca County is a 59 acre lake east of the city of Elysian. A public access is located on the north end of the lake, off Minnesota State Highway 60. Lily Lake is split into two distinct basins. The western basin is slightly larger, with areas of deeper water, between 10 and 20 feet deep; the eastern basin is only a few feet deep. Aquatic vegetation in abundant in Lily Lake with numerous emergent, floating leaf, and submergent plant species present. Lily lake is one of very few lakes in southern Minnesota with abundant wild rice growing in shallow water areas. Lily has exceptional water clarity; during this assessment secchi disk transparency reached 13.5 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nLily Lake was surveyed the week of June 3rd, 2010 to monitor the fish community. Northern pike averaged 7 fish per gill net lift. Pike ranged in size from 15 to 35 inches in length. Average length was 23 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were abundant in trap nets at 27 fish per lift. Bluegill ranged from 3 to 9 inches, with an average size of 5 inches. 28% of bluegill were larger than 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 11 fish per trap net lift. Size ranged from 3 to 8 inches. 55% of pumpkinseeds were larger than 6.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were netted in low abundance. Crappies were netted at a rate of 3.5 per gill net lift and 0.6 per trap net lift. Black crappie ranged in size from 7.2 to 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads have not overrun Lily Lake after infrequent winterkills as often occurs on other similar lakes. Black bullheads averaged 17 per gill net lift and ranged from 6 to 12 inches in length. Winterkills have been observed in 1996-1997, 1999-2000, and 2006-2007. More recently, Lily Lake fish survived more intensive winters that brought on winterkill in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish surveyed include hybrid sunfish and largemouth bass. Largemouth bass are not well sampled in trap or gill nets; boat electrofishing is the preferred sampling method used for largemouth bass. Electrofishing will be used to survey largemouth bass during the next scheduled full survey on Lily Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lily Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a small, 59 acre lake located in Waseca County east of the city of Elysian.  A public access is located on the north end of the lake, just off Highway 60.  Lily Lake has a maximum depth of 23 feet and consists of two distinct basins.  The west basin is deeper and is the main focus of angling efforts, while the east basin is shallow and has dense aquatic vegetation.  The shoreline of Lily Lake is largely undeveloped, which has resulted in exceptional water clarity with a secchi disk reading greater than 10.0 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nLily Lake was surveyed the week of June 10, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap- and gill-nets to monitor the fish community.  Bluegills were the most abundant fish in the 2013 survey and were likely the primary targeted species by anglers in Lily Lake.  Trap net catch rates of bluegill were 62.0 fish/net, which is above average for similar lakes in the area.  The size of bluegill in Lily Lake was generally small, averaging about 4.0 inches in total length.  However, nearly 12% of all measured bluegills were greater than 8.0 inches and the largest was nearly 10.0 inches, so the population has larger individuals that are typically sought by anglers.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and northern pike had similar catch rates in 2013 as that observed in 2009.  Black crappie abundance was low during this survey.   Black crappies were netted at a rate of 3.0 fish/gill net and 1.0 fish/trap net.  The length of all black crappies sampled in the 2013 survey averaged 6.0 inches and ranged from 4.0 to 11.0 inches.  Northern pike catch rate averaged 7.0 fish/gill net in 2013.  The average length of northern pike was 23.0 inches and ranged from 14.0 to 31.0 inches.  The average weight of northern pike captured in 2013 was 3.5 lbs, which is above average for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Northern pike ranged in age from one to six years old in 2013.  The only northern pike stocking event in Lily Lake took place in 2003, so the current population was likely sustained through natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance was moderate to high in Lily Lake, with catch rates at 35.0 fish/gill net and 29.0 fish/trap net.  The average length of all black bullhead from the survey was 7.0 inches, with 25% of all measured bullhead being 9.0 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough largemouth bass were present in Lily Lake, trap and gill nets did not effectively sample largemouth so the population was not represented in this survey.  Lily Lake has favorable habitat and forage for largemouth bass, so there is strong potential for a quality fishery.  Other fish species sampled in the survey included pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lily Lake is a 114-acre lake located in Waseca County just east of the town of Elysian. A DNR-owned public access is located on the northwest side of the lake off Minnesota State Highway 60. Lily Lake has a maximum depth of 23 feet with 45% of the area less than 15 feet deep. Lily Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. A history of periodic winterkill events has made management of these species difficult. Management species are stocked following winterkill events to repopulate the lake. The last documented hard winterkill occurred in 2013-2014 but evidence of partial winterkill has occurred multiple times since then. Lily Lake is a Tier-2 Lake and surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years. The 2021 standard survey was conducted the week of 7 June 2021 using 3 gill nets and 7 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike was the only management species of any abundance sampled in 2021. Fifteen Northern Pike ranging from 14.6 to 30.1 inches were sampled with the gill nets for a rate of 5.0/net. In five surveys from 1999 to 2021, Northern Pike catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 12.0/net with an average of 6.1/net. Northern Pike ranged from 14.6 to 30.1 inches with an average of 22.3 inches. Approximately 40% of Northern Pike sampled were larger than the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Twelve more Northern Pike up to 19.3 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Northern Pike from both gears were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year classes present. Nearly 60% were 2 years old indicating a strong, naturally reproduced year class. Northern Pike growth was moderately fast with an average length of 16.2 inches at 2 years old. Currently, Northern Pike are the only species that are present in numbers and sizes attractive to anglers in Lily Lake. The lack of a Yellow Perch population may limit the maximum size potential. Clear Lake is included in the Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are limited to 2 Northern Pike daily which must be at least 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nJust seven Black Crappies were sampled with trap nets in 2021 for a catch rate of 1.0/net, indicating low numbers were present. Since 1999, Black Crappie numbers have been sampled in low numbers with gill nets averaging 2.0/net and trap nets averaging just 1.1/net. Black Crappies were small and ranged from 6.0 to 6.6 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. All Black Crappies were 2 years old, indicating that at least some natural reproduction exists. However, the population falls well below management objectives. The presence of periodic winterkill appears to limit the establishment of a quality Black Crappie fishery in Lily Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNo Bluegills were sampled in 2021. From 1999 to 2021, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 143.0/net with an average of 46.8/net. The 2013 catch rate was 62.0/net with fish up to almost 10 inches present, indicating the potential for a decent Bluegill fishery in Lily Lake. However, periodic, and unpredictable winterkill events remain a challenge to producing one. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not sampled in 2021 and like Bluegills, were likely impacted by an unreported winterkill event occurring sometime since 2014. Stocking mature adults in 2022 should be considered to reestablish a population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most common species sampled in 2021 with a gill net catch rate of 94.0/net. Given the lake's history of instability and winterkill events, it's not surprising that elevated bullhead numbers have been commonplace in past surveys. The lack of Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Largemouth Bass in the 2021 survey coupled with high Black Bullhead numbers was a clear indication of a winterkill event taking place sometime in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Golden Shiner and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>While no gill nets were set fully below the thermocline, many were close to the anoxic water.  Furthermore, the shallow thermocline may have influenced how fish used pelagic and deeper bethic areas thus influencing their gill net catchability.  Black crappies captured in gill nets were large; most were around 8 to 10 inches long.  Channel catfish ranged from 20 to 30 inches with an average weight of 6 lbs.  Walleye ranged in size from 9 to 20 inches.  Trap net catch of walleye actually exceeded the gill net catch.  All but one walleye were from the 2000 and 2001 year classes.  These two year-classes were stocked as both fingerlings and yearlings.  Walleye catch per gill net has been consistently low in Roberds Lake, except for a high catch in 1986.  Bluegill catch per trap net showed some increase from 1993 to 1998, but was similar between 1998 and 2003.  The size distribution of bluegill did show significant changes.  In 1998, most bluegill were between 5.5 and 6.7 inches with the largest 6.8 inches.  Bluegill length distribution shifted to a much wider range, having more smaller and larger fish than in 1998.  In 2003, 45% of bluegill were > 8 inches with the largest over 9 inches in length.  Most of the 8-inch range bluegill appeared to be from a strong 1997 year-class.  Backcalulated length at age for bluegill at age 2 through 4 was near or exceeded the third quartile for class 24 lakes.  Black crappie catch per net increased from 1993 to 1998 then returned to levels similar to 1993 in 2003.  Black crappie median size has consistently increased over the last three surveys (1993: 7.3 inches, 1998: 7.7, 2003: 8.7).  In 2003, most black crappie were between 7.9 and 9.8 inches.  Aquatic vegetation was limited to a few areas of Roberds Lake.  Most of the north shore had little vegetation.  Areas of elodea and coontail occurred in the southeast corner near the outlet and in the south and west bays.  A patch of yellow waterlily was located near vegetation transect 23.  The most species (11) were found at transect 22, located in the southwest corner of the south bay.  </p>",

ADULT BLG AND CRAPPIE WERE STOCKED AT 10 LB./ACRE IN 1990 TO BOLSTER THE FISHERY.  AGE 1 AND 2 BLG DOMINATE THE 22.75/TRAP NET BLG CATCH.  ONLY A FEW BLG (NOW AGE 4) FROM THE 1990 STOCKING WERE SAMPLED.  GROWTH IS AVERAGE.  ONLY 2 BLC, BOTH AGE 1, WERE SAMPLED. NO BLC FROM THE 1990 STOCKING WERE CAPTURED. NOP AVERAGED 3.67/GILL NET, WITH FISH RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 18.0-29.9 INCHES.  SCALES WERE DIFFICULT TO READ, BUT IT APPEARS ALL THE NORTHERN WERE 3 YEAR OLDS.  THE 17.5 INCH LENGTH AT AGE 3 IS AVERAGE FOR NOP.  LILY LAKE WAS USED AS A WAE REARING POND IN 1989.  FEW WAE FINGERLINGS WERE HARVESTED.  WAE NOW AVERAGE 9.67/GILL NET WITH MOST FISH 13.0-17.9 INCHES.  GROWTH IS FAST FOR WAE, AVERAGING 11.2 INCHES AT AGE 2, COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 9.0 INCHES.  THE WAE PRESENT ARE ESSENTIALLY KNOWN AGE FISH, SINCE THE 1989 FRY STOCKING WAS THE FIRST WAE STOCKING IN OVER 30 YEARS.  PMK ARE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 54.50/TRAP NET.  1 AND 2 YEAR OLD FISH, 3.5-4.5 INCHES LONG, DOMINATE.  PERCH WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS, 2.33/GILL NET.  THIS MAY BE A RELECTION OF THE HIGH PREDATOR POPULATION.  BLB WERE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 186.00/GILL NET.  BLBS ARE DOMINATED BY 5.0-6.5 INCH FISH.  YEB ARE PRESENT IN MODERATE NUMBERS, 5.00/TRAP NET AND 5.67/GILL NET.  LMB WERE NOT SAMPLED IN NETTING.</p>",
