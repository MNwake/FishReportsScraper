Aging scales of these Walleyes show that the age 2 and 3 walleyes are in low supply and that the 1983 fry stocking probably did not contribute much to the Walleye population. The age 1 walleyes sampled were either a result of natural reproduction or a small spring fingerling stocking in 1985. The PSD for the Walleyes sampled was 70.3. This high number denotes a quality rather than quantity fishery. Northern Pike gill net indices dropped from 9.22/gill net in 1980 to 2.67/gill net. Yellow Perch gill net indices were unchanged.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on July 22, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 24 stations. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 22 stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. The nearshore sampling captured 25 native fish species with six species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and three species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake Reno based on this survey is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net catches have increased from 6.6 fish/net in the 1985 netting survey to 30.3 fish/net in 1989. Mean weight has decreased correspondingly from 2.6 lbs to 1.5 lbs. This decline in mean size may be attributable to natural recruitment of a strong 1988 year class. Cohorts of the 1988 year class measured from 9.0 to 11.0 inches in total length. Most individuals of this year-class should have attained stock-size by the end of the 1989 survey season. The 1988 year class may be stronger than the netting survey would indicate since this year class is probably not fully vulnerable to capture in survey nets. Relative stock density of quality-size individuals, increased from 40.0 percent in 1985 to 72.0 percent in the 1989 survey. This increase is a result of a strong 1986 year class. Representatives of this age group measured 15.0-19.0 inches in total length. Establishment of 1986 year class may be attributable to fingerling stockings or natural reproduction. Growth rates remain good with age 3 Walleyes averaging 15.7 inches in total length. Age 4 Walleyes averaged 18.8 inches in length. Yellow Perch abundance remained stable with a catch rate value of 12.3 fish/gill net. Gill net catch rates from previous assessments ranged from a low of 9.1 fish/net in 1975 to a high of 16.0 fish/net in 1985. PSD has decreased significantly to 15.0 percent. This decline would indicate less adult fish. Given the abundance of predators capable of utilizing stock-size Yellow Perch, this forage population may bear close monitoring to evaluate its capacity to support the expanded Walleye population. The northern pike relative abundance, which is represented by a catch rate of 3.8 fish/gill net, is adequate to support a limited fishery comprised of quality-size fish. Mean weight averaged 2.4 lbs. Only 3 of 30 Northern Pike captured were less than 20.0 inches in total length. Bluegill catches would suggest a low density. Only 8 Bluegills were caught in the 9 trap nets. The few fish caught were large. RSD-P was calculated at 88 percent. Natural reproduction or recruitment would appear to be limited. Black Bullhead catch rates may indicate a sharp decline in abundance. Assessments conducted in 1980, 1985, and 1986 yielded 41.0, 63.0 and 52.0 fish/gill net, respectively. Catch rate averaged only 1.83 Black Bullhead/gill net in 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3,722-acre, highly productive lake located between Glenwood and Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  Public accesses are located on northeast and southwest shorelines of the lake. An extended high water period that began in the mid-80s has greatly reduced emergent vegetation coverage.  Submerged vegetative growth is limited and generally restricted to narrow leaf species.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Reno is well known as a good walleye lake.  Walleye are very abundant in response to  natural reproduction and solid performance of supplemental fry stockings. Average catch rates during surveys dating back to 1989 have been well above expected catches for similar lakes.  Gillnet catches averaged 17.9-fish/net in 2010.  Mean weight of walleye captured was 2.0 lbs. The 2005 year class (age-5 fish in 2010) accounted for 65 per cent of walleye netted. These fish averaged 16.0 to 20.0 inches at time of the survey.  Age distribution of the 2010 walleye population sample extended out to 15 years-of-age.      <br> \n <br> \nDespite excellent fishing potential, walleye fishing has been slow.  The yellow perch population increased greatly in the late-90s and remains high. Perch catches in 2010 averaged 132.8-fish/gillnet.  Walleye have been presented with an abundance of young-of-year perch to consume.  Young walleye were also competing with adult perch populations for food and space.  Adult perch may also prey on or compete with young sunfishes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches during the 2010 survey were lower than during the 2006 survey. The 2010 trapnet catch rate was more typical of catches recorded in surveys prior to 2006.  Strong 2002, 2003, and 2004 year classes prevalent in the 2006 population sample have passed from the fishery. Only two year classes were represented in the 2010 population sample.  Poor nesting success and excessive mortality of larval bluegill contribute to the population decrease.  Black crappie catches also declined.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.5 fish per net. Most crappies captured were greater than 10.0 inches. Electrofishing efforts to capture largemouth bass yielded a catch rate of 63.0-fish per hour. Ninety-eight percent of captured bass exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size of bass, should be good.  The high relative proportion of older bass in the population is also indicative of poor reproductive success or low survival of larval and juvenile bass.  Fishing quality will erode with little recruitment of young fish in the population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gillnet catches averaged 0.7 fish/gillnet in 2010. Mean weight of pike was 3.2 lbs.  Low pike abundance is likely reflected in high walleye and perch numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack, brown and yellow bullheads are all present in Lake Reno. Size structure of all three species is impressive with many fish exceeding 12.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a shallow, 3,793-acre, highly productive basin located between the cities of Glenwood and Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  Lake Reno is connected to Maple Lake via an equalizer culvert under State Highway 29.  Most of the watershed area is in agricultural production.  Water quality and clarity can be diminished during summer months due to excessive nutrient loading and resultant algae blooms.  Lake Reno was added to the MPCA 303(d) listing of Impaired Waters in 2011.  Public accesses are located on the northeast and southwest portions of the lake.  Parking space at the northeast access off State Highway 29 is limited. <br> \n <br> \nLake Reno is now designated as an infested waterbody because zebra mussels are present in Maple Lake, which is connected to Lake Reno.  Zebra mussels were first confirmed in Maple Lake in 2013.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> \n  <br> \nLake Reno is well known for its high-quality Walleye fishery.  Catch statistics from the 2014 survey described a healthy Walleye population.  Walleye are abundant in response to natural recruitment and supplemental walleye fry stockings.  Gillnet catches exceeded 18.0 fish/net.  Mean size was 17.9 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Approximately 90% of gill net captures exceeded 15.0 inches and more than 25% exceeded 20.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSustaining such high densities of Walleye and acceptable growth rates necessitates existence of a stable, high-quality prey base.  Yellow Perch fulfill that need.  Walleye fishing success has, at times, been only fair due to an excessive abundance of small Yellow Perch, a preferred food item.  Yellow Perch abundance has declined in recent years, but survey catch rates remain relatively good and higher than that of many other lakes within the Glenwood Management Area.  Fair numbers of harvestable-sized fish are present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes commonly targeted by anglers include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass populations have expanded through the 2000s in probable response to improving habitat conditions and increasing coverage of aquatic vegetation.  Annual recruitment inconsistencies strongly influence fishing success and quality among years, but the expanded diversity of fishing opportunities has been very welcome.  Due to fast growth of members of the sunfish family, fishing quality can be good.  Bluegill exceeding 8.0 inches, Black Crappie exceeding 10.0 inches, and Largemouth Bass exceeding 15.0 inches are relatively common.  Progressively much more angling effort is now directed at these species.  Smallmouth Bass are also expanding in Lake Reno.  Anglers reported catches of Smallmouth Bass prior to the 2014 survey, but 2014 was the first year this species was captured during a MN DNR lake survey.  <br> \n <br> \nA low-density Northern Pike population exists in Lake Reno.  Size of captures during the 2014 survey ranged from 16.3 inches to 35.7 inches.  Pike catches averaged 22.6 inches and 2.7 pounds.  <br> \n  <br> \nLake Reno also supports a harvestable surplus of bullheads.  Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads are all present in Lake Reno.  Size structure of these populations is impressive.  Most bullheads caught in survey nets exceeded 12.0 inches.  The current state record Black Bullhead came from Lake Reno back in 1997.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the 2014 survey include Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2018. <br> \n <br> \nLake Reno is a popular destination for many anglers and fishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain quality of this fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in future fishing trips.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a large, relatively shallow, and fertile lake.  Water clarity is adversely affected bysuspended sediment and algal blooms.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 9.0 feet and is densein limited areas.  Emergent vegetation is scattered throughout the lake and is dense in some areas.   Walleye are abundant in Lake Reno and should provide quality angling opportunities.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 16.8 fish/net in 1994.  Catches have ranged from 6.6 - 30.3 fish/gillnet in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical andphysical characteristics is 3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet.  Approximately 90% of the fish are 15 inches inlength or greater and 40% exceed 20 inches.  The average weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  Bothwalleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked in the last ten years.   The age class distribution ofwalleye captured in gillnets suggests that stronger year classes were produced in years in whichwalleye fry were stocked.  However, natural reproduction may be responsible for these strong yearclasses.  Strong year classes produced in 1988 and 1991 correspond to years of no stocking.  Fallelectrofishing documented the presence of another strong year class in 1994, a year in which there wasno stocking.  Yellow perch catches averaged 13.5 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches rates have beenconsistent in previous surveys dating back to 1980, ranging between 10.4 and 15.3 fish/net.  Most ofthe fish are between 5 and 8 inches in length.   Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds. Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers, however the size structure of the population isdesirable for quality angling.  Electrofishing yielded 10.7 fish per hour.  Most of the fish capturedwere 12 inches in length or greater and over 50% exceeded 15 inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was2.3 pounds.  Bluegill abundance is limited.  Trapnet catches averaged 5.1 fish/net in 1994.  Trapnetcatches in previous surveys have also been low, ranging from 0.2 - 3.3 fish/net.  Despite the lowrelative abundance, size structure and growth rate of the bluegill population is poor.  Four out offive fish are between 3 and 6 inches in length.  Northern pike catches averaged 0.5 fish/net which isbelow the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (2.8 - 9.2 fish/gillnet).  Catch rateshave ranged from 2.7 - 9.2 fish/gillnet in past surveys dating back to 1980.  Sample size was notadequate to evaluate size structure or growth rate of the northern pike population.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3,808-acre, highly productive basin located between the towns of Glenwood and Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  Lake Reno lies within the Chippewa River watershed and is connected to Maple Lake via an equalizer culvert under State Highway 29.    Residential development around the lake is minimal and the majority of the watershed is in agricultural production.  Public accesses are located on the northeast and southwest shorelines.  The northeast access includes a north and south lot.  The north lot is primarily used for additional parking when needed.  Lake Reno is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html. This lake is primarily managed for Walleye with sunfish and bass being species of secondary management importance.\n  \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in 2022 to assess the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  This lake is well known as a quality Walleye fishery.  However, netting results indicated a recent decline in the Walleye population as record-low abundance (9.0 fish/gill net) was documented in 2022.  Only three Walleyes shorter than 15 inches were captured in gill nets, which resulted in a large average size of 20 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Record-low abundance and a size structure dominated by larger fish is due to consecutive poor year classes in recent years.  Current aging data and previous fall electrofishing results suggest the last moderate to strong year class was likely produced in 2017.  Consecutive weak Walleye year classes across multiple years is concerning because it is not typical for this fishery and has led to an \"unbalanced\" population.  An extremely strong year class was produced in 2022 but these fish were too small to be sampled by gill nets.  Hopefully, this population rebounds as the 2022 year class recruits to the fishery.  Yellow Perch abundance has also declined in recent years.  Harvestable size perch are still available but small perch now dominate this population.  Other gamefishes commonly targeted by anglers include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, and bass populations have expanded greatly in recent years and much more angling effort is now directed at these species.  Current size structure of these populations is favorable.  Good numbers of Bluegill exceeding 8 inches and Black Crappie exceeding 10 inches were collected in 2022.  Sunfish anglers are reminded that a special regulation was implemented in spring 2022 that reduced the daily bag limit of sunfish from 20 to 10 to help protect and improve sunfish quality on this lake.  For more information regarding the Quality Sunfish Initiative see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/sunfish/index.html.  The largest bass sampled in 2022 measured almost 19 inches for Largemouth Bass and 18 inches for Smallmouth Bass.  The Northern Pike population is typically characterized as having low to moderate abundance and size structure.  Mean size of pike in 2022 was 24 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Lake Reno is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  \n\nBlack, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads are all present in Lake Reno and provide a unique angling opportunity for trophy-sized fish.  The largest Brown and Yellow Bullhead collected in 2022 measured almost 16 and 19 inches, respectively.  The current state record Black Bullhead came from Lake Reno back in 1997.  Other fish species sampled during the 2022 survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.\n\nLake Reno is a popular destination for many anglers and fishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the quality of this fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3,722-acre eutrophic (highly productive) lake located between the towns of Glenwood and Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County and is primarily managed for walleye with sunfish being species of secondary management importance.  Lake Reno has a reputation as being a consistent producer of quality walleye fishing during both open water and winter.  Natural reproduction sustains the fishery but fry are stocked periodically to supplement natural reproduction.  Currently, the walleye fishery is the best it has been in many years.  Gill-net catches in the 2002 survey indicate that walleye abundance is extremely high.  Size structure of the walleye population should be highly desirable to anglers with the mean length being 17.0 inches and the mean weight being 1.9 pounds.  The current size structure of this population is highly influenced by the extremely strong 1996 year class and size structure will likely decline in future years as these fish move through the fishery.  Another strong year class was produced in 2001 and these fish will be approximately 15.0 inches by 2005.A few \"trophy\" fish are also present in Lake Reno.  Several fish exceeding 25 inches were sampled in 2002, with the largest going 28 inches.  Although the numbers and sizes of walleyes are currently good, fishing may be somewhat difficult due to the high abundance of small yellow perch, a preferred food item of walleyes.  Yellow perch catches in 2002 were the highest documented in over 20 years.  Small fish dominate the population but good numbers of larger fish (8-10 inches) are also present.  The abundance of northern pike, bluegill, and crappie can be considered low to moderate and the size structure of these populations is relatively poor.  Largemouth bass numbers have increased in recent years and most fish are larger individuals.  In fact, forty-one percent of the 2002 sample exceeded 15.0 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3,808-acre, shallow lake located between Glenwood and Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  Maximum depth is 23.0 feet.  Average depth is 17.0 feet.  The lake is well known for its capacity to sustain good Walleye fishing.  Public accesses are located on the northeast and southwest shorelines.  Parking space at the northeast access can be limited.\n  \nAngler reports suggest expanded and quality fishing opportunities for panfishes and Largemouth Bass.  A standard fisheries survey was completed over the summer months of 2018 to provide updated information on fish community structure, gamefish abundance, and measures of fishing quality.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the survey was completed in early July.\n\nBased on electrofishing catch rates and size structure of the catch, Lake Reno supports a good bass fishery.  Fishing quality potential is diminished by slow growth of older bass, but due to a broad age distribution of captures extending to age 15 and an elevated proportion of eight-year-old and older bass, approximately 50% of Largemouth Bass captures were 15.0 inches or larger.\n\nNetting efforts confirmed that Walleyes remain abundant in response to natural reproduction and supplemental fry stockings.  Gill net catches averaged 18.4 Walleyes/net.  Length of captures ranged from 7.4 to 25.5 inches and averaged 17.4 inches.  Age assignments extended to age 17.  Over 75% of the gill net sample exceeded 15.0 inches in length and approximately 20% of Walleye captures exceeded 20 inches.  Relatively strong 2013, 2015, and 2016 year classes provide promise to continued good fishing.\n\nNorthern Pike catch rates continued to be modest, which may partially explain the greater population density of Walleyes.  Mean size of pike in 2018 was 21.9 inches and 2.5 pounds.\n\nAnglers have enjoyed greater catches of Black Crappie following establishment of exceptionally strong year classes in 2010 and 2011.  Crappie catches remained higher than anticipated in 2018 in response to recruitment of a moderately strong year class in 2015, which was followed by a stronger year class in 2016.   Two- and three-year old crappies comprised 87% of all crappies captured during the 2018 survey.  The three-year-old captures averaged 8.9 inches.  Assuming good growth rates, many of these fish should grow to exceed 10.0 inches in 2019.\n\nRecord-high catches of Bluegills occurred in 2018 in response to exceptional reproductive success and recruitment in 2014 and again in 2015.  Due to the high proportion of younger captures, average length of Bluegills captured in trap nets was 5.4 inches.  These young fish were growing well.  Older captures averaged 8.6 inches at age 6, so it is anticipated that fishing quality will improve as these two strong year classes recruit into the fishery.  The largest Bluegill captured during the survey measure 9.2 inches.\n\nSmallmouth Bass were caught from Lake Reno for the first time during the 2014 survey.  None were captured in 2018.  It may be assumed that the lake continues to support a very low density population. Other fish species sampled during the 2018 survey included Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfishes, Brown, Yellow, and Black Bullheads, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, and White Sucker.  All Yellow Perch captures were too small to stimulate harvest.  While underutilized, some bullhead captures were large fish exceeding 14.0 inches in length.  The largest Brown Bullhead measured 16.6 inches.  The current state record Black Bullhead came from Lake Reno back in 1997.\n\nThe next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2022.  Anglers are reminded that Lake Reno is located within the North-central Harvest Zone and there are expanded harvest opportunities for smaller Northern Pike.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Lake Reno is also designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted September 25-28 on Lake Reno, to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 to 10 was implemented in 2022. The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates (25.4/trap net) were moderately high. Growth is fast, but mean length was only 6.4 inches because of predominately young fish. Eight percent of Bluegill sampled were over 8 inches; the largest sampled was 8.9 inches. Black Crappie catch rates (2.3/trap net) were low, but crappie also grow fast. Crappie ranged in length from 10.7 to 13.5 inches; mean length was 12.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3,722-acre, highly productive lake located between Glenwood and Alexandria. It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  An extended high water period that began in the mid-80s greatly reduced submergent and emergent vegetation diversity and coverage.  Water quality suffered with increased run-off.  Gamefishes dependent upon vegetated habitat and clear water, i.e. northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch were suppressed.  Water clarity has steadily improved since the late-90s. Average summer transparency measurements now approach 9.0 ft.  Correspondingly, vegetative abundance and diversity have increased.  In response, the fish community has transcending back from a relatively simple walleye fishery to a more diversified fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Reno is well known as a good walleye lake.  Walleye are very abundant due to natural reproduction and solid performance of supplemental fry stockings.  Average catch rates in surveys dating back to 1989 have been well above expected catches for similar lakes.  Population density is at or exceeded the lake's capacity to support such high numbers, particularly with expansion of other gamefish populations.  Walleye growth has slowed.  A three-year-old walleye captured during the 1998 survey exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  In 2006, the same age fish averaged only 12.4 inches.  Walleye ages 1, 4, 5, and 10 comprised most of the total catch.  Four- and five-year old walleye averaged 17.0 inches.  Cohorts of the sizeable 10-year-old age group averaged 21.5 inches in length at time of capture.  Age distribution of 2006 walleye captures extended out to 14 years-of-age.      <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population exploded in the late-90s.  Average gillnet catches during 1998, 2002, and 2006 have been two to three times greater than normal for such lakes.  Perch catches in 2006 averaged 120.0 fish/gillnet.  Walleye were presented with an abundance of young-of- year perch to consume.  High perch abundance at times can reduce walleye angling success.  Young walleye were also competing with adult perch and expanding sunfish populations for food and space.  Most yellow perch are young and small, but good numbers of larger fish (8.0-10.0 inches) and a few \"jumbos\" (over 12.0 inches) are also present.  These large perch can augment fishing success. <br> \n <br> \nSunfish species have benefited most with improving water quality and expansion of submergent and emergent vegetation.  Record-high bluegill and black crappie catches were documented in 2006.  Size structure of both populations was skewed towards a smaller average size in response to high proportion of young fish in both populations.   Modest numbers of large bluegill and crappie were recorded.  If current growth rates can be sustained, size structure of both populations will likely improve in future years as the abundant smaller fish grow into the fishery.   Largemouth bass abundance has not kept pace with that of bluegill, but modest population expansion is evident in electrofishing catch rates.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size of bass, should be good.  Eighty-one percent of 8.0 inch and larger bass captured in 2006 exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Mean size captured was 13.2 inches and averaged 1.7 pounds.  Other sunfishes, specifically rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish have become much more abundant. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has been relatively stable since the mid-1980s.  Gillnet catches averaged 3.5 fish/gillnet in 2006.   Even though preferred-prey, yellow perch, were very abundant, pike growth was slow.  Correspondingly, few large fish were observed.  Some expansion is likely with improving water quality and increased vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nNear-term fishing attributes will be exceptional.  Generalist anglers will value greater diversity of fishing experiences.  Walleye anglers will likely be frustrated by a net decrease in abundance and average size accompanying community expansion.  It will be interesting to monitor evolution of Lake Reno's fishery. <br> \n</p>",

The 2 Walleyes sampled were the result of a small spring fingerling stocking in 1985 or the result of an unauthorized 1984 fall fingerling stocking by an area sportsmen club. Northern Pike abundance and size remains relatively unchanged since the 1985 survey. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch abundance has significantly declined since 1985. Largemouth Bass were difficult to sample due to expansion of the littoral zone, however indication are that a sizable population exists in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Reno is a 3722-acre eutrophic lake located 8 miles south of Alexandria.  It is the second largest lake in Pope County.  Lake Reno ranks ninth out of 15 lakes in terms of water quality and clarity measured by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.   Water clarity is impacted by suspended sediment and algal blooms during late summer months.  Run off from adjacent agricultural lands and inflow from County ditch #9 are the main sources of sediment and nutrients. The bottom substrate consists primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble with large expanses of sandy shorelines around the lake.  Aquatic vegetation is limited.  However, there are scattered large areas of emergent vegetation.  The emergent vegetation protects the shoreline from wave action, provides shelter for fish, and takes up nutrients to aid in preserving the water quality.  Duck hunters also utilize this vegetation during the late-season diver migration with good results.Lake Reno is known for consistently producing quality walleye fishing.  Gill net catch of 17.7 fish per net is well above the expected range for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Fish averaged 14.7 inches in length and 1.6 pounds.  Many larger fish were captured, the largest fish measuring 28.5 inches.  Age-2 fish comprised 63% of the fish captured in gill nets.  These fish averaged 11.5 inches and should reach approximately 15 inches by the 1999 fishing opener providing excellent angling opportunities.  This year class corresponds to a year of no stocking in 1996.  Lake Reno is stocked with walleye fry on a regular basis.  However, natural reproduction is likely responsible for the exceptional walleye fishing the lake is known for. Northern pike and largemouth bass are moderately abundant.  Northern pike catch of 4.9 fish per net is within the expected range for this type of lake.  The average size of fish caught was about 23 inches.  Several fish exceeded 28 inches and the largest fish measured 32.8 inches.  The size structure of the largemouth bass population should appeal to most anglers.  More than 40 percent of the fish are 15 inches in length or greater.  Northern pike and largemouth bass can be difficult to catch because there is not a well-defined weed line to concentrate the fish.Black bullheads are relatively abundant. The fish average about  0.5 pounds and can provide quality angling opportunities.  The state record black bullhead was caught on Lake Reno in 1997. It weighed 3 pounds, 13 ounces.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 24 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Reno.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty-two species were collected during this survey.  Seven species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Reno.</p>",
