The trapnet catch of bluegill (24.6/TN) is not high.  The RSD-7 value is 22.  The growth rate for bluegill is good compared to many area lakes.  Few largemouth bass were sampled.  Several year classes of black crappie were sampled, indicating good natural reproduction and recruitment.  Yellow perch numbers appear to be low.Rusty crayfish were found to be present in Rat Lake.</p>",
