There is a public boat access and fishing pier on the east side of the lake as well as camping, picnic area and swimming beach. The fishery in Dower Lake is generally comprised of Bluegill, Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. All species are common and can provide decent fishing opportunities from the pier, from shore or from a boat. Walleyes were stocked in the 1980s but not since that time. Future stocking of Walleyes will be considered if fish are available. Overall, gamefish and panfish average size tends to be on the smaller side but there are large bass and pike in the lake. Water clarity is good and submerged vegetation is abundant.</p>",

This sampling was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of daytime shocking in assessing bass and panfish populations on this smaller basin.  Due to its small size Dower is a relatively low priority lake for intensive sampling with gill nets and trap nets.  Sampling in 2018 consisted of 0.67 hours of on-time effort while traveling around the entire shoreline in varying depths and distances from shore.   <br> \n <br> \nVery few fish were observed during this assessment as only 8 Largemouth Bass and a single Black Crappie were netted and measured.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 12.1 inches.  A low number of Bowfin and a single Northern Pike were seen but not netted.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed were also observed in fair numbers but few appeared to exceed 5 inches.  If future attempts are made to assess Dower Lake via daytime electrofishing it may prove more effective to sample earlier in the season.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dower Lake is a small (79 acres), shallow body of water that experiencespartial winterkill on an infrequent basis.  The lake was stocked heavily withnorthern pike from the early 1960's through 1980.  Walleyes were also stockedfrom 1985 through 1989.  High northern pike populations probably accounted forpoor survival of stocked walleye.     Northern pike numbers were higher than normal when compared to other lakessimilar to Dower.  Although this can lead to fast fishing action, it generallycauses problems for other species in the fish community.  Northerns feed heavilyon yellow perch driving their populations down to abnormally low levels. Northern pike grow slow as a result leading to a lake full of \"hammer handles\". In our survey no northern pike over 24 inches in length were caught.  Werecommend that anglers keep northern pike under 21 inches and release all pikeover 21 inches.     Yellow perch abundance was below normal for this lake class.  High northernpike numbers maintain perch at a low level.  We would like to see an increase inthe number of yellow perch.  For this to happen, northern pike abundance mustdecline.  A higher perch population would not only improve pike growth, it wouldalso help in producing larger bluegills.  Perch feed heavily on young bluegillslowering their numbers and lessening competition.  The result is better bluegillgrowth rates.     Few walleye were sampled during the 1994 lake survey.  Walleye managementwas suspended due to poor survival of fingerlings stocked in the past.  Walleyefry will be stocked, however, in the event of a winterkill.  Anglers seekingwalleye should try their luck on other area lakes.     Largemouth bass and black crappies were absent in the survey.  Largemouthadults will be stocked in the spring of 1995 in order to establish a population. The presence or absence of black crappies will be evaluated during a springelectrofishing assessment in 1995.     Bluegill abundance on Dower was about average for this type of lake. Growth was slow and most fish caught were small.  Only 4 fish caught during thesurvey exceeded 7 inches.     An old railroad structure on the northeast portion of the lake functions asa fishing pier and receives light to moderate fishing pressure during the springand summer.  Improvements to the pier have been proposed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dower Lake is a small (79 acres), shallow body of water that provides fishing opportunities for the residents of Staples as well as other anglers.  Bluegill are the most sought after species in the lake with some anglers also looking for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappies.  Bluegill abundance was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes but the average size was small.  Few of the bluegills seen in the survey were over 7 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers appear to have declined and the average size improved.  In the last survey no pike over 24 inches were caught while this survey caught some fish up to 28 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest northern pike under 21 inches and release the larger fish to maintain a healthy pike population of fast growing individuals by reducing competition for food.  Most of the largemouth bass and crappies that were seen in the survey were small by most anglers standards.  The bass were all under 12 inches and the crappies 8 inches and less.  Bass up to 17 inches have been documented in previous assessments.      There are still a few walleye in Dower Lake and for anglers lucky enough to catch one, the fish is likely to be a big one.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1989 due to poor survival of the fingerlings.  Yellow perch abundance has been low in Dower since 1984 which is likely due to the high northern pike population.  Higher perch numbers are desired as they can be an important factor in good northern pike and bluegill growth rates.  All three species of bullheads were caught during the survey with yellow bullheads being more abundant than the black or brown bullheads.  The average size for both the black and brown bullheads was near 11 inches while the yellow bullheads averaged around 9 inches.    Dower Lake does have an old railroad structure on the northeast side of the lake that serves as a fishing pier.  The City of Staples is seeking funds to repair the structure.  The City also owns and maintains a park/campground on the east side of the lake.  The park has a softball diamond and swimming beach as well as a picnic area.  The campground has 47 campsites of which 19 have electricity.  Much of the lake has a wide cattail fringe along the lake shore.  Developement has increased along the west shore with the subdivision of the property there.  Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the good water quality and fish habitat in the lake. Information on shoreline regulations, restoration, and best management practices can be found at the Todd County Planning and Zoning website as well as the DNR website.    www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm        and         www.dnr.state.mn.us</p>",
