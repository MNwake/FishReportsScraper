                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 536-acre lake located in Pine County that has been assigned to lake class 32.  The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge with Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as the secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nA Muskellunge assessment was conducted on Island Lake from April 18 to May 5 2016.  A total of 28 fish were caught, including 8 in-year recaptures.  The eight in-year recaptures were not included in the length frequency or used in the calculation of catch rate, average length, average weight, proportional stock density (PSD), relative stock density (RSD), or relative weights.  There were 8 males, 10 females, and 2 fish of unknown sex caught.  Total average length was 44.9 inches, up from 42.1 inches in 2010 and 43.3 inches in 2009, with a length range of 38.1 to 53.4 inches.  Male average length was 43.0 inches, with lengths ranging from 38.1 to 45.0 inches.   Male average weight was 20.1 pounds, ranging from 15.4 to 24.1 pounds.  Female average length was 47.0 inches, with a length range of 38.9 to 53.4 inches.   Female average weight was 28.5 pounds, with a weight range of 15.7 to 47.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nRelative weight (Wr), a calculation of the true weight of a fish compared to its optimal weight, was calculated for all adult fish using an equation specific to Leech Lake strain muskellunge.  A Wr of 100 or greater means that a fish is at its optimal weight or larger.  Four of the fish sampled in Island Lake had a relative weight above 100, and 10 were over 90.  The average Wr was 92.  That means on average the fish sampled were 92% of their ideal weight.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rate for the 2016 survey was 0.08 fish per set.  The catch rate is lower than previous catches in 2010 (0.14 fish per set), 2009 (0.11 fish per set) and 2004 (0.14 per set).  Previous survey catch rates have ranged from 0.01 to 0.13. <br> \n <br> \nA Schnabel formula was used to calculate a population estimate of the Muskellunge of Island Lake.  Daily catches of fish were used in the calculation, which gave an estimated population size of 35 fish, with 95% confidence limits of 28 and 44 fish.  This is a density of 0.07 fish per acre.   <br> \n <br> \nA method for estimating fish mortality called catch curve analysis was done by combining males, females, and fish of unknown sex.  Mortality and survival were then estimated for ages 12 through 15.  Estimated annual mortality was 30% and estimated annual survival was 70% for this age range.  This indicates there is very little mortality of Muskellunge caused by natural factors or harvest by fishermen. <br> \n <br> \nProportional stock density (PSD), a measure of the number of quality size fish divided by the number of stock size fish, was 100.  This means that all fish caught were of quality size (30 inches) or greater.  Relative stock density (RSD) was calculated for fish 40 inches and greater.  The RSD40 was 85, similar to the 82 in 2010 and much higher than the 55 in 2004.  This means about 85% of all fish sampled in 2016 were 40 inches or longer. The RSD48 was 20, once again similar to the 18 in 2010, which means about the same percentage of the fish were 48 inches or longer.  The RSD54 was 0, indicating no fish captured were of legal size.  A 54 inch state wide size limit was instituted in 2015, so it may take a few years to see if any fish attain that size in this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAccording to aging analysis with anal spines there were fish from the 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2002-2008 year classes captured.  There were no fish stocked in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008.  Based on this there would appear to be some limited natural reproduction occurring.  However, aging Muskellunge with anal spines with any degree of accuracy is difficult, especially with larger fish. As a result, whether or not some of these fish are truly the result of natural reproduction is questionable.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the opportunity to catch a musky in this lake may be lower than in some lakes, but your chances of a hooked fish being a nice one here are good, as 17 of the 20 fish caught were 40 inches or larger and four of those fish were 50 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Muskellunge, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eleven species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass), and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Island Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Island Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Kettle River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish; Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Blackchin Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Rock Bass, Tadpole madtom, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, and Northern Pike. <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from previous Island Lake surveys to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Island Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Island Lake is located in the Kettle River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  During July 24-28, 1989 a lake survey was conducted on Island Lake to assess the fish population and various lake parameters.  Six (6) gillnets and six (6) trapnets were set.  Nine (9) gillnets were intended to be set but numerous catches of larger-sized walleyes reduced the number of gillnet sets to six (6).  Shoreline seining efforts took place in early September to evaluate the natural reproduction success.\n  Based on respective local medians from test net indices the present fish population is as follows:  The walleye (7.33/set) net catch showed a real increase from the previous survey catch (2.44/set) in 1986.  This increase put the net catch considerably above the local median catch (2.73/set) and at the highest level for all Island Lake surveys dating back to 1954.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 11.0 to 27.9 inches with a median length group of 21.0- 21.9 inches.  This length group was substantially larger than the length groups of the two previous surveys in 1986 and 1982, 15.0-15.9 inches and 14.0-14.9 inches respectively.  The mean weight for walleyes captured in this survey was 2.97 pounds.  Age groups represented by test netting ranged from II-XI and were within normal growth rate ranges when compared to statewide average.\n  The northern pike (4.50/set) net catch showed a real increase from the previous survey (0.78/set) and went above the local median catch (3.50/set).  This was also the highest net catch since 1954.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 14.0 to 32.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0-23.9 inches.  The mean weight was 3.58 pounds.  Age groups II-VIII were represented by the test netting and these fish expressed normal growth when compared to statewide averages.\n  Muskellunge (LCH) (0.50/set) have been present in Island Lake since their first fingerling stocking in 1982.  This net catch was above the local median catch (0.20/set).  Spring muskellunge population assessments and/or spawn taking operations have been conducted each spring since 1985.  Extensive information of the muskellunge status can be reviewed and/or referred to in the Island Lake file.  At the time of this survey four (4) year-classes were known to be present in the lake; 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1988.  Year classes 1987 and 1988 were caught in this survey. \n  The yellow perch (117.33/set) net catch was up considerably from the previous survey (69.33/set) and remained well above the local median (8.58/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.0 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 6.0-6.4 inches.\n  The black crappie (2.67/set) net catch was down significantly from the previous survey (30.33/set) and fell below the local median (5.75/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 4.0-9.9 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  The gillnet catch was 2.50/set which was below the local median (4.40/set).  Five (5) different age groups were represented by test netting, I-IV and VI.  It should be noted that large numbers of black crappies were trapped during the spring muskellunge operation in 1989.\n  The bluegill sunfish (8.00/set) net catch was also down significantly from the previous survey (66.00/set) and fell below the local median (20.00/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 4.0 - 4.4 inches.  This was the smallest median length group for all bluegill sunfish catches dating back to 1954.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded good spawning success with high catches of young-of-year bluegill sunfish.  Additionally, large numbers of adults were also trapped during the spring muskellunge operation.\n  Largemouth bass were not captured by trapnet sets, however, the gillnet catch (1.67/set) was above the local median (0.33/set) and consequently was the highest catch of all previous surveys.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.0 to 11.4 inches.  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 24 young-of-year.  During the spring muskellunge operations since 1987, good numbers of largemouth bass were recorded.  All sizes were present with many fish ranging from 12.0 to 19.9 inches.\n  Five (5) other species sampled by test nets (black bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish) were not substantially above or below their respective local medians.  Also, these catches did not exhibit noticeable changes when compared to previous survey catches. The white sucker was absent in this survey, however, Area Fisheries Personnel reported some were trapped during the 1989 spring muskellunge operation.  Historically, white sucker catch numbers were similar to that of the local median catch (1.50/set).\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake has been known primarily for abundant walleye, but in the past several years muskellunge, originally stocked as fingerlings in 1982, have grown above the minimum legal size and some have been known to exceed 50 inches, providing a good trophy fishery.  DNR Fisheries crews conducted a fish population assessment in spring and summer of 1994 to determine the current status of these and other fish species in Island Lake.     Gill net catches of walleye in 1994 were the highest ever recorded for this lake.  However, walleye numbers have been above average (compared to similar lakes) in every survey since 1967.  The catch consisted mainly of smaller fish; the average weight was one pound.     Several younger muskellunge (ages 1-4) were netted during the 1994 survey.  Larger muskies are not usually caught in test nets, but several individuals over 45\" were seen while trap netting in the spring. Anglers have reported catches over 50\".     Northern pike, a close relative of the muskie, have never been abundant in Island Lake, but a small population is maintained through natural reproduction, and these fish provide an occasional bonus catch.     Black crappie tend to be fairly abundant in this lake.  Trap net catches in 1994 were above average, consisting of fish 6-11 inches in length.  The average weight was slightly less than half a pound.     Bluegill catches have varied from year to year but tend to fall within the normal range for this lake type.  The mean length was 5.1 inches, although bluegills up to 7.5 inches were seen.     Largemouth bass are present in the lake, with an average weight of about a pound.  The population appears to be made up primarily of younger fish, but bass up to 17 inches have been seen.     Other species present include yellow perch, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bullheads, white sucker, and several shiner species.Prepared by Deborah Sewell, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 546 acre, fertile lake in northern Pine county with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  Lakeshore developement is high with moderate water clarity.  The lake is managed for walleye and muskellunge.  Both are stocked as fingerlings biennially.  A public access is located on the lakes west shore.  Fishing pressure is usually moderate. Island lake anglers can expect moderate populations of northern pike and largemouth bass.  Northern size structure has improved since 1999.  Captured pike ranged from 21 to 30 inches and averaged 3.8 pounds.  Bass averaged a pound with nearly half the catch exceeding 12 inches.Walleye abundance was comparable to similar lakes but lower than in past assessments.  Like northerns, walleye size structure has increased with a 2.2 pound average.  Netted walleye ranged from 11 to 20 inches in length.Bluegill and black crappie numbers were normal for the lake type and should be readily available.  Size, however, may be an issue with some anglers.  Relatively few bluegill exceeded 7 inches and most crappies were under 8 inches.  Yellow perch were very abundant but were also on the small side averageing 6.8 inches.Muskellunge were sampled in a separate assessment in April.  Based on catch rates, muskie are not as abundant as they were in the 1990's.  However, quality sized fish are available with more than half the sample exceeding 40 inches in length.Shoreline seining in September found bass, bluegill, and northern pike reproduction.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 546-acre lake in northern Pine County with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The shoreline is highly developed with homes. Water clarity is moderate. The lake is managed for Walleye and Muskellunge; both are stocked annually as fingerlings. Fishing pressure is usually moderate.  <br> \n <br> \nIsland lake anglers can again expect moderate populations of Northern Pike and Walleye.  Numbers and sizes for both species were similar to the 2019 assessment.  Captured pike ranged from 13.6 to 31.1 inches and averaged 2.7 pounds.  Walleye abundance was slightly higher than similar lakes and the highest recorded for Island Lake since 1999.  Netted Walleye ranged from 9.8 to 24.8 inches in length and averaged 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBased on trap net catches, Bluegill catch rates increased but average size declined.  Only 7% of captured Bluegill exceeded 7 inches in length. Similar to other lakes, Black Crappie numbers fluctuate greatly in Island Lake.  Currently, the Crappie catch (1 per net) is likely at the bottom of this cycle.  The Crappie present are good sized and averaged nearly 9 inches.   Yellow Perch remain very abundant and acceptable in size with 44% of the catch greater than 8 inches and 22% exceeding 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are sampled in separate assessments. Based on recent catch rates, muskies are not as abundant as they were in the 1990's. However, quality sized fish are available with Muskellunge greater than 50 inches present. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is managed for Walleye and Muskellunge; both are stocked annually as fingerlings. Fishing pressure is usually moderate.  <br> \n <br> \nIsland lake anglers can again expect moderate populations of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Abundance and average size for both species were similar what was seen in the 2009 assessment.  Captured pike ranged from 10 to 34.5 inches and averaged 3.3 pounds. Over one third of measured bass topped 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was comparable to other similar lakes. Both abundance and average size mirrored the previous two assessments. Netted Walleye ranged from 13 to 25.7 inches in length and averaged 2.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie numbers, based on the trap net catch, both exceeded the norm for the lake type and their historic averages for Island Lake.  Both species should provide more harvest opportunity than in 2009. While only 14% of Crappie exceeded 9 inches and 19% of Bluegill bested 7, their abundance is much higher overall. Yellow Perch remain very abundant and acceptable in size. More than a third of measured Perch were 8 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are sampled in separate assessments. Based on catch rates, muskies are not as abundant as they were in the 1990's. However, quality sized fish are available with three fourths of the sample exceeding 40 inches in length. Muskellunge greater than 50 inches are present.</p>",

FIVE ADDITIONAL TRAPNETS WITH LARGER, 4' FRAMES WERE SET ON MAY 3RD AND ALSO CHECKED DAILY. IN AN EFFORT TO DISCOVER MORE PRODUCTIVE LOCATIONS OR TECHNIQUES FOR TAKING MUSKELLUNGE, SOME TRAPNETS WERE OCCASSIONALLY RELOCATED AND OTHERS SET IN UNCOVENTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS. A SPECIFIC, PREFERRED HABITAT WAS NOT DETERMINED; MUSKELLUNGE WERE TAKEN IN A VARIETY OF VEGETATIVE COVER AND BOTTOM TYPES. THE PRESENCE OF SOME VEGETATION SEEMED TO BE PREFERRED OVER VEGETATION FREE AREAS. NONE OF THE VARIATIONS OF THE STANDARD TRAPNET SET SEEMED TO SIGNIFICAN- TLY OUT PRODUCE THE STANDARD SETS. TRAPNETS SET WITH THE LEAD AT AN ANGLE TO SHORE RATHER THAN PERPENDICULAR SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE SUCCESS- FUL. THIS WAS POSSIBLY COINCIDENTAL AND RELATED MORE TO LOCATION THAN THE ANGLE OF SET. THREE OF THE 20 MUSKELLUNGE CAPUTRED WERE TAKEN IN THE LARGER TRAPNETS. WATER TEMPERATURES WERE RECORDED DAILY USING A MAXIMUM/MINIMUM THERMOMETER SUSPENDED 1.5 FT BELOW THE SURFACE, IN 3 FT OF WATER, APPROX. 20 FT FROM SHORE. DURING THE 15 DAY NETTING PERIOD, MEAN DAILY WATER TEMP. ROSE STEADILY FROM 49F ON DAY 1 TO 59F ON DAY 8, THEN REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE, FLUCTUATING BETWEEN 58F AND 59F FOR THE REMAINING 7 DAYS. ON THREE DAYS, DAY 8, 12, AND 13, THE MAXIMUM DAILY WATER TEMP. REACHED 62F. DAY 8 AND 12 PRODUCED 5 OF THE 6 FEMALE MUSKELLUNGE TAKEN. STARTING WITH DAY 6 MALE MUSKELLUNGE WERE TAKEN EVERY DAY EXCEPT DAY 7 AND 15. DISCOUNTING NETS THAT WERE JUDGED TO BE (TIPPED DOWN BY WIND, OR LARGE MUSKRAT HOLES), A TOTAL OF 388 LIFTS WERE MADE. IN ADDITION TO MUS- KELLUNGE DATA, NUMBERS AND LENGTHS OF NORTHERN PIKE, WALLEYES, AND LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE RECORDED AS INCIDENTAL INFORMATION. A TOTAL OF 208 NORTHERN PIKE, 72 WALLEYES, 141 LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND 20 MUSKELLUNGE WERE TALLIED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT. A NUMBER OF OTHER SPECIES THAT WERE NOT TALLIED WERE ALSO PRESENT IN THE TRAPNETS. THE 20 MUSKELLUNGE CAPTURED CONSISTED OF 6 FEMALES AND 14 MALES. MALES WERE CRIBBED IN THE LAKE UNTIL FEMALES WERE AVAILABLE FOR STRIPPING. STRIPPING WAS CARRIED OUT IN A PROTECTED BAY ADJACENT TO THE HOLDING CRIBS. FISH TO BE WORKED WERE FIRST ANE- THETIZED WITH MS-222. SPERM WAS COLLECTED WITH AN ASPIRATOR, AND SPERM EXTENDER, EQUAL TO LAKE WATER TEMPERATURE, ADDED AT A 2 TO 1 RATIO. THE SOLUTION WAS THEN HELD AT LAKE WATER TEMPERATURE UNTIL EGGS WERE STRIPPED. EGGS WERE STRIPPED INTO A DRY PAN AND THE SPERM SOLUTION ADDED USING THE VORTEX METHOD. THE EGGS AND SPERM WERE GENTLY MIXED FOR SEVERAL RINSED, COVERED WITH LAKE WATER, AND HELD IN STYROFOAM CONTAINERS FOR APPROX. 2 HOURS OF HARDENING BEFORE SHIPPING TO THE HATCHERY. AFTER STRIPPING FISH WERE IMMEDIATELY REVIVED IN FRESH WATER AND RELEASED. THE 6 FEMALE MUSKELLUNGE CAPTURED WERE ALL FROM THE INTIAL 1982 STOCKING THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 38.2 INCHES TO 40.8 INCHES AND IN WEIGHT FROM 12.6 LBS. TO 15.5 LBS. THE QUANTITY OF EGGS PRO- DUCED BY INDIVIDUAL FISH VARIED CONSIDERABLY, FROM A LOW OF 7 OZS. TO A HIGH OF 27 OZS. THERE APPEAR- ED TO BE NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE FISH AND THE QUANTITY OF EGGS PRODUCED. SOME FISH MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY SPAWNED OUT BUT MORE LIKELY THE VARIATION WAS A NATURAL CONDITION OF FISH IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF MATURATION. SEVEN MALE MUSKELLUNGE WERE 4 YEARS OLD AND SEVEN WERE 6 YRS OLD. THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 31.1 INCHES TO 39.0 INCHES AND IN WEIGHT FROM 6.0 LBS. TO 14.4 LBS. BOTH AGE GROUPS SEEMED MATURE WITH NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUANTITY OF MILT PRODUCED. EGGS WERE TAKEN ON THREE DIFFERENT DAYS OF THE PROJECT, DAY 9: 2 FISH - 42 OZS, DAY 10: 1 FISH - 9 OZS., AND DAY 12: 3 FISH - 47 OZS. DUE TO THE SMALL QUANTITY TAKEN ON DAY 10, THESE EGGS WERE HELD OVER TWO NIGHTS IN LAKE WATER AND SHIPPED TO THE HATCHERY WITH THE DAY 12 EGGS. THE LENGTHY HOLDING PERIOD WAS APPARENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR A TOTAL LOSS OF THE DAY 10 EGGS. EGGS FROM EACH FISH WERE MAINTAINED IN SEPARATE LOTS AND INFORMATION REGARDING SIZE OF THE FEMALE, NUMBER OF MALES USED FOR FERTILIZATION, ETC., WAS RECORDED. IN ONE CASE THREE MALES WERE USED FOR FERTILIZATION ETC., WAS RECORDED, IN ONE CASE, THREE MALES WERE USED FOR FERTILIZATION ON TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS, AND SEEMED TO PROVIDE ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS MILT ON THE SECOND DAY THAN THE FIRST. LIMITED HATCHERY SPACE REQUIRED ADDING LOTS TOGETHER, CONSEQUENTLY, ANALYSIS OF HATCHING SUCCESS FOR INDIVIDUAL LOTS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. A TOTAL OF 98 OZS. OF EGGS WERE DELIVERED TO THE HATCHERY. THEY AVERAGED 1633 PER OZ. TO EQUAL 160, 034 EGGS. OF THESE, 65,320 REACHED THE EYE-UP STAGE, AND NO LOSS WAS RECORDED FOLLOWING EYE-UP. IF THE EGGS LOST DUE TO THE EXTENDED HOLDING PER- IOD IN THE LAKE ARE DISCOUNTED, THE PERCENT HATCH IS EQUAL TO 44.9%. PERCENT HATCH WILL BE AN INTERESTING PARAMETER TO WATCH IN SUBSEQUENT EGG TAKING OPERATIONS, WHEN FISH ARE MORE MATURE. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT EGGS FROM 1ST YEAR MATURING FEMALES AND SPERM FROM 4 YEAR OLD MALES ARE LESS THAN 100% VIABLE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians, the present fish population status is as follows:  The northern pike as has been its history in Island Lake was low at 0.78 per set and showed a real decrease from 1.56 per set in 1982.  Size range was from 19.0 to 28.0 inches with a mean length of 23.0 inches and an average weight of 3.35 pounds.  The walleye was also low at 2.44 per set and showed a real decline from 5.22 per set in 1982.  Size range was from 8.0 to 22.9 inches.  Mean length was 15.0-15.9 inches which was one inch higher than in 1982 while relative average weight remained the same at 1.50 pounds.  The muskellunge was slightly high at 0.44 per set as represented by four fish from the 1984 stocking.  Size range was from 20.0 to 24.9 inches.  Average weight was 2.7 pounds.  The yellow perch was very high at 69.33 per set showing a real increase from 25.33 in 1982 and a mean length of 5.5 to 5.9 inches.  The largemouth bass was about average in both the gillnet (0.22) and trapnet (0.33) but did show a marked decline from the high status of 1.44 and 2.67 per set respectively in 1982.  Note:  Spring trapnetting 1986 (muskellunge) resulted in good catches of largemouth bass. The bluegill population while very high at 66.00 per set, was mostly made up of small to fair size fish with a range of 3.0-8.9 inches and a mean length of 5.4-5.9 inches.  The pumpkinseed sunfish was slightly high at 8.50 per set with a population of small to fair size fish ranging from 3.5 to 6.9 inches.  Mean length was 5.0 -5.4 inches.  The black crappie was high at 30.33 per set and had a pronounced increase as compared to five previous netting evaluations.  The size range was from 4.0 to 11.4 inches with a mean length of 6.5-6.9 inches.  The white sucker, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, and black bullhead had population figures ranging from slightly low to very low respectively.  The golden shiner was present in the trapnet only at 0.33 per set.  Note:  1986 spring trapnetting information for general comparison:  Northern pike - 155 - range of 13.0 to 35.9 inches: - mean length of 22.0 - 22.9 inches.  Walleye - 131 - range of 15.0 - 26.9 inches.  Mean length of 20.0 to 20.9 inches was 5 inches high than mean length 15.0-15.9 inches in 1986 population assessment.  Numerous white suckers and few yellow perch taken in spring netting does not relate to 1986 survey results for these two species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 546-acre lake located in northern Pine County just 2 miles northeast of the town of Sturgeon Lake.  Boat access to the lake can be obtained through a state-owned public access located along the north shore towards the west end of the lake off Pine County 51.  Because the lake is one of a few lakes in Pine County that is home to a quality muskellunge population, it is frequently a destination of many avid muskie anglers.  A diversity of other game fish, such as walleye, northern pike largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish also attracts fishing enthusiasts.  The majority of the shoreline is surrounded by residential homes and land use within the watershed consists of undeveloped forest or woodland, agricultural land, and marshland.  The fishery in Island Lake is primarily managed for  walleye, muskellunge, and northern pike with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.During the open water season of 1999, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Sampling gear consisted of spring and fall electrofishing, gill and trap nets, and shoreline seining.  Walleye abundance was above normal for lakes of this type while the average weight, at 1.3 pounds, fell below normal.  Above average walleye abundance has been reported in MN DNR surveys since 1967.  Measured walleye ranged from 9.0 to 24.7 inches with an average length of 15.0 inches.  Just over 60% of the walleye captured were at 14.0 inches or greater in length.  Growth was found to be normal when compared to statewide growth averages at each age.  Walleye year classes were found during stocked and non-stocked years.  The lack of young-of-the-year walleye in recent fall night electrofishing evaluations and the presence of sparse walleye numbers during non-stocked years indicates that the contribution of naturally reproduced fish to the population is probably limited and not capable of sustaining a suitable walleye population without being supplemented by stocking.  The catch of adult muskie along with the average length, at 38.3 inches, was similar to the previous survey in 1994.  Male muskie ranged in length form 34.8 to 45.2 inches while females extended from 40.2 to 43.7 inches.  All fish ages were accounted for by stocking.  The 1999 northern pike catch and an average weight of 2.1 pounds both were within a normal range for this type of lake.  Historically, northern pike numbers have been low.  Total lengths extended from 10.7 to 30.3 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  All sizes of pike were found, but there was a good number (50%) of fish at 20.0 inches or greater in length.  Spring night electrofishing found good numbers of largemouth bass that had an average size of 0.7 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 16.5 inches and an average of 9.3 inches was determined.  Both northern pike and largemouth growth was normal.  Black crappie abundance was above normal in 1999 with their lengths ranging from 4.0 to 9.6 inches.  Most of the sampled crappie fell within the 4.0 to 5.0 inch category, however, around 30% were at 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were found to be at a normal level for lakes of this type.  Their lengths ranged from 3.2 to 7.7 inches with good numbers of fish in all length categories between 3.0 and 6.5 inches.  Yellow perch were found at above normal levels.  When compared to the previous survey done in 1994, perch numbers have more than doubled.  Good natural reproductive success was found for bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass while black crappie and yellow perch showed some success.  Other fish species present in Island Lake included black bullhead, blacknose shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, spottail shiner, and white sucker.The fish community residing in Island Lake offers anglers a diverse fishing opportunity.  Walleye anglers may encounter an abundance of nice sized walleye, with most fish between 12.0 and 19.0 inches while muskie anglers have a good chance at hooking a quality fish since a good number of muskie have reached lengths that are of legal size.  Reports from anglers have confirmed muskie lengths extending beyond 50.0 inches.  An abundance of northern pike greater than 20.0 inches are available with an occasional lunker possible.  Largemouth numbers are abundant, but the majority of the population appears to be smaller in size.   Panfish anglers can expect good numbers of black crappie and bluegill sunfish with the majority of these species on the smaller side.  It is likely that a number of these smaller fish will reach a more acceptable size.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would enjoy catching a quality sized fish.  Because Island Lake is currently classified as having fertile water, additional nutrient input from land uses within the surrounding watershed could further reduce lake water quality.  Further nutrient loading can be prevented or reduced by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline and along streams that drain in these lakes, updating failing or outdated septic systems, discontinuing the use of fertilizer on surrounding lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizer, if it is needed, on surrounding lawns or cropland, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 546 acre, fertile lake in northern Pine County with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  Lakeshore development is high with moderate water clarity.  The lake is managed for walleye and muskellunge.  Both are stocked as fingerlings biennially.  A public access is located on the lakes west shore.  Fishing pressure is usually moderate.  <br> \n <br> \nIsland lake anglers can expect moderate populations of northern pike and largemouth bass.  Both species were more abundant than in 2004 but with a smaller average size.  However, more northern exceeded 30 inches than in past samples.  Captured pike ranged from 14.8 to 37.7 inches and averaged 3.2 pounds.  Over one third of measured bass topped 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was comparable to similar lakes.  Both abundance and average size mirrored the previous assessment.  Like northern, the proportion of memorable sized walleye has increased.  Netted walleye ranged from 10.9 to 29.8 inches in length and averaged 2.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie numbers, based on the trap net catch, were normal for the lake type and should be readily available.  Although harvestable fish are present, size may be an issue with some anglers.  Relatively few bluegills exceeded 7 inches and most crappies were under 9 inches.  Yellow perch remain very abundant and have increased in size with 19% of the catch exceeding 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were sampled in a separate assessment in April.  Based on catch rates, muskies are not as abundant as they were in the 1990's.  However, quality sized fish are available with nearly three fourths of the sample exceeding 40 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 546 acre lake in northern Pine County with a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The shoreline is highly developed with homes. Water clarity is moderate. The lake is managed for Walleye and Muskellunge; both are stocked annually as fingerlings. Fishing pressure is usually moderate.  <br> \n <br> \nIsland lake anglers can again expect moderate populations of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Abundance and average size for Northern Pike were very similar to the previous two assessments.  Captured pike ranged from 15 to 33 inches and averaged 3 pounds. Bass abundance ticked down slightly but with an increase in size.  Half the bass topped 12 inches with individuals up to 19 inches present in the catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was comparable to other similar lakes and mirrored the previous three assessments.  Although fish up to 26.4 inches were present Walleye average weight was half that of the 2014 assessment.  Most of the catch were three years or less in age resulting in the slighter average size. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie numbers, based on the trap net catch, met and surpassed the norm for the lake type respectively and exceeded their historic averages for Island Lake.  Just over a quarter of the Crappie catch topped 9 inches and just under a quarter of Bluegill bested 7 inches.  Yellow Perch remain abundant and acceptable in size. More than a third of measured Perch were 9 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are sampled in separate assessments, most recently in 2016. Based on catch rates, muskies are not as abundant as they were in the 1990's. However, quality sized fish are available with more than three fourths of the sample exceeding 40 inches in length. Muskellunge greater than 50 inches are present.</p>",
