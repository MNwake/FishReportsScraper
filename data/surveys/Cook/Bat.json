Lake trout (Gillis Lake strain) were introduced in this lake in 1982, and since 1991 the population has been self-sustained.  Lake trout growth was very slow - six-year-old fish were just 11.5 to 17.8 inches long when collected in July 2004.  Slow growth was due to the relatively high number of lake trout present, and the limited forage available for those fish.  White sucker were the only other fish taken in the 2004 survey.  They weren't abundant, and were too large to have been taken by lake trout.</p>",

The next assessment is currently scheduled for 2023. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout were abundant in Bat Lake in 2013, although most were fairly small.  The lake trout gill net catch was the highest seen in this lake to date, easily exceeding the normal range for a lake of this type.  No lake trout larger than 20 inches were taken; however, the lack of larger fish was not unusual for a lake of this type, where lake trout are limited to a mostly invertebrate forage base.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, with none standing out as having been exceptionally strong.  Lake trout growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of just 15.5 inches at the end of their sixth year, compared to a mean of 17.7 inches for similar lakes in this area.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were still present in Bat Lake in 2013, but were apparently not abundant.  None were taken in gill nets in this assessment.  Catches in previous assessments have also been very low.  Minnow traps used in this assessment marked the first attempt to identify fish species found in nearshore areas of the lake.  Minnow traps added Iowa darter, fathead minnow, longnose dace, and northern redbelly dace to the list of fish species observed in this lake, and confirmed the continued presence of white sucker. <br> \n</p>",
