Yellow perch were next most abundant, followed by black crappie.  Most of the crappie present were less than 8 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers are good, with a number of fish over 30 inches long.  Walleye numbers were average with most fish at least 15 inches long.  One muskellunge was sampled, age 6 and 38.4 inches long.  Bullhead numbers were low, with most fish over 10 inches long.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for walleye (WAE) and muskellunge (MUE). Since the introduction of Muskellunge in 1981, stocking has primarily consisted of planting fingerlings at a rate of up to 1 fish/surface acre/year. Stocking prior to 1994 essentially occurred annually using Wisconsin strain Muskellunge, and since that time management goals have been to stock Leech Lake strain Muskellunge on a biennial schedule. Recent distributions have been of marked fingerling and yearling muskellunge that are part of a stocking evaluation. The 2011 spring assessment was conducted on Bald Eagle Lake to collect information on the current status of the Muskellunge population. The catch rate for MUE in 2011 was one of the lowest ever recorded in this lake since spring assessments have been recorded beginning in 1990, but is almost equal to catch rates observed on non-stocked native Muskellunge waters in Minnesota. The average size of MUE sampled was 42.34\" in length and 18.78 pounds. Captured MUE ranged in size from 35.24\" to 50.75\" in length. Fifteen percent of all Muskellunge captured measured at or above the 48.0\" minimum harvest length. The overall growth rate for MUE in this lake appears to be good. At age 6, lengths for male MUE averaged 36.82\" and females averaged 40.93\". All mature adult MUE sampled were Leech Lake strain fish from 5 different year classes ranging from the 2000-2006 (ages 5-11 years old). This is an indication that the present adult MUE population consists primarily of the Leech Lake strain. All MUE captured during this assessment were implanted with an individually numbered tag for future identification. This lake has been a popular local MUE fishery since the late 1980's. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is a 1,047 acre lake (class 24) located in northeastern Ramsey County. Bald Eagle Lake Regional Park facilities are limited to the eastern parcel which contains the boat access with 50 car- trailer spaces, a picnic shelter and fishing pier. Other site amenities include a restroom facility and play area. Park property on the west shore is undeveloped. Bald Eagle is a popular fishing lake and a popular site for recreational boating.  Submersed aquatic vegetation can become matted on the surface during summer months hindering recreational and angling activities. Zebra mussels were discovered in August, 2018 and have the potential to increase the water clarity in Bald Eagle Lake which could alter fish abundances in the future. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. Beginning in 2017, Walleye fingerlings were stocked annually at a rate of 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral acre based on a randomized stocking schedule, allowing DNR Fisheries to assess the effects of fingerling stocking density on Walleye year-class strength. Muskellunge fingerlings are currently stocked at a rate of 1 fish per acre (1,047 fish) in even numbered years. Bald Eagle Lake is in the North-Central Northern Pike Management Zone which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with two fish allowed over 26 inches in length and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. The objectives of this regulation are to see some modest improvement in northern pike size distribution, reduce densities of small pike, and improve harvest opportunity for smaller and preferred size pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 2.42 fish per gill net and in the normal range for Bald Eagle Lake, but lower than previous surveys. Walleye sampled were between 10 and 26 inches long (15.5 inch average). Almost all of the Walleye sampled in 2020 were from the 2016 stocking (age 4 fish). This strong year-class should support quality Walleye fishing in Bald Eagle Lake for many years to come. The 2016 year-class was comprised of larger fingerlings than what are normally stocked. Yellow Perch averaged 6.3 inches and were within a normal range for Bald Eagle providing a solid forage base for Walleye, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Northern Pike abundance is up considerably from all previous surveys and was the highest ever recorded. Northern Pike average length was 24.85 inches. One 39.17 inch Muskellunge was sampled in the gill nets during this survey. Black Crappie and Bluegill Sunfish numbers were in the normal ranges for this lake and didn't have any outstanding qualities. Crappies averaged 6.5 inches and Bluegills 5.6 inches long. Summer surveys are not as good as spring surveys for sampling these species, especially larger individuals. Pumpkinseed Sunfish were found in good abundance and were similar in size to Bluegill. Above average numbers of Largemouth bass were observed during this survey and sizes ranged from 7.28 to 15.35 inches long. <br> \n</p>",

Surface acreage is 1,046 acres with 751 acres being littoral (72%) and the lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet. The primary management species in Bald Eagle are Walleye and Muskellunge. Fingerling Muskellunge are stocked at a rate of one fish per acre (1,047 fish total) in even numbered years. The Muskellunge population is assessed by an independent survey separate from a standard lake survey. Muskellunge surveys are conducted using large trap nets set shortly after ice-out to target adult fish moving along shore to spawn.  Spring of 2019 was the first of a two-year survey with the goal of calculating a population estimate for Muskellunge in the lake. Previous surveys have only included one year of netting which does not allow for a population estimate. Instead, the population was evaluated based on the number of fish captured per net. This can be highly variable from year to year when sampling a spawning population which is strongly affected by weather conditions. Our future population estimates should eliminate that variability from year to year changes in sampling conditions. In this first year marking effort, a total of 59 Muskellunge were captured with sizes ranging from 34.6 to 50 inches and a mean length of 41.8 inches. Fish sampled in this study were marked with an external fin clip and internal, uniquely numbered passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag to allow for tracking of individual growth and for use in calculating population size in the second year of sampling. This population estimate will also be used as part of a larger research study investigating the amount of prey consumed by predatory fish species in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for Walleye (WAE) and Muskellunge (MUE). Walleye stocking since 2000 has been conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of  2.0 pounds/littoral-acre (1,502.0 lbs). Muskellunge stocking currently consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (1,268 fish) biennially on even numbered years. All Muskellunge stocked in Bald Eagle Lake from 1994 to present have been the Leech Lake Strain. The WAE population has been above median levels for abundance in the gill net sample since 1992. The 2006 WAE catch rate for gill nets reflected a decrease from the 2002 assessment (from 4.6 to 3.0 fish/set). The average size of WAE sampled in 2006 was 16.8 inches and 2.1 pounds. Over 25 percent of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer.  Only one 37.2 inch MUE was captured during this assessment. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight and reflected an increase in catch rate from the 2002 assessment. The average size NOP captured was approximately 24.7 inches and 3.5 pounds. Over 15 percent of sampled NOP measured 28.0 inches or larger. Yellow Perch abundance was double the catch rate recorded in 2002, but still well below the historic range observed in the 1972 to 1997 samples. The average size of YEP sampled was 6.2 inches and 0.10 pounds. Only 2 percent of all YEP sampled measured over 8.0 inches in length. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for walleye (WAE) and muskellunge (MUE). Since the introduction of Muskellunge in 1981, stocking has primarily consisted of planting fingerlings at a rate of up to 1 fish/surface acre/year. Stocking prior to 1994 essentially occurred annually using Wisconsin strain Muskellunge, and since that time management goals have been to stock Leech Lake strain Muskellunge on a biennial schedule. Recent distributions have been of marked fingerling and yearling muskellunge that are part of a stocking study evaluation conducted in partnership with Muskies, Inc.  Management plans for Bald Eagle also include stocking walleye fingerlings at a rate of 2.0 lbs/littoral acre (1502 lbs) every other year.\n\nThe 2012 spring assessment was conducted on Bald Eagle Lake to collect information on the current status of the Muskellunge population. Mean length of MUE sampled in the Spring 2012 assessment was 41.4\" TL and 18.9 pounds. Of the 17 MUE sampled, approximately 70% were males.  Male MUE averaged 39.8\" TL and 16.6 pounds, while female MUE averaged 45.2\" TL and 24.5 pounds. Sampled MUE ranged in size from 37.3\" TL to 47.6\" TL, with male MUE ranging from 37.3\" TL to almost 43\" TL and female MUE ranging from 43.1\" TL to 47.6\" TL. The RSD40 for this assessment is 70 percent. Unlike previous years, no fish captured measured over 48\" (minimum harvest length for MUE in Bald Eagle Lake).    All MUE captured during this assessment were implanted with an individually numbered tag for future identification. \n\nThe mean length of MUE sampled in Spring netting assessments increased steadily through the first half of the 1990's, but then stabilized during the late 1990's. The slight drop in mean length in 2002 was likely a reflection of young adult Leech Lake strain MUE starting to recruit into the Spring catch. The mean length of MUE sampled in 2012 (41.58\" TL) is the second highest (only to 2011 assessment) ever observed during Spring assessments on this lake.  This is an indication that the present adult MUE population consists primarily of the Leech Lake strain.  Growth of MUE sampled in 2012 was average, with MUE reaching 35\" in year V.\n\nMUE ice-out trap nets also captured a significant number (126) of walleye in 2012.  The average size of spring netted walleye was 23.8\" and over 5 lbs in weight. 87% of the walleye caught exceeded 20\".  The largest fish caught in the spring exceeded 33\" in length.  Growth of these fish was fast, with age IV fish averaging almost 18\" TL.  This lake has been a popular local MUE and walleye fishery since management of the two species began.\n\n</p>",

From 2000 to 2012, the Walleye stocking rate was 2.0 lbs/littoral-acre (1,502 pounds). Muskellunge stocking normally consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (1,268 fish) biennially on even numbered years. Supplemental stocking of Muskellunge has occurred under permit by local sportsman clubs. All Muskellunge stocked into Bald Eagle Lake from 1994 to present have been the Leech Lake strain. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have increased since the last assessment in 2012. Mean weight continues to increase (1.82 lbs. in 2012 to 1.93 lbs. in 2014) which is noteworthy. Walleyes of this average weight in the lakes of the East Metro Area is not typical. Twenty-two percent of Walleyes captured were 20 inches in total length or larger. One adult Muskellunge was captured in gill nets and it was 27.68 inches in total length and weighed 3.75 pounds. Five adult Muskellunge were captured in trap nets. The total lengths ranged from 39.37 to 47.24 inches and average weight was 17.4 pounds. Northern Pike were sampled above the third quartile for abundance and mean weight. The average size of pike sampled was 25.38 inches in total length and 3.96 pounds.  Twenty-six percent of pike captured were 28 inches or longer with the largest being 37.13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at almost double the third quartile level for abundance. The average size of perch sampled in 2014 was 7.25\" TL and 0.19 lbs. Largemouth Bass were sampled by standard electrofishing methods. Largemouth Bass abundance had dropped from 2012. Average size increased to 10.91\" TL and mean weight of 0.87 lbs. (7.7\" TL and 0.40 lbs. in 2012).  Black Crappies were sampled below the middle quartile for both gill net and trap net abundance. Average size of crappie captured in gill nets and trap nets were 7.41\" TL and 7.21\" TL, respectively. Bluegills were sampled above the median level for abundance, but catch was still lower than in 2010. The average Bluegill captured in 2014 was 5.67\" TL.  <br> \n</p>",

The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. Black Crappie are a secondary species of management in Bald Eagle Lake and have historically been sampled in high numbers in the gill nets and moderate to high numbers in the summer trap net sets. <br> \nIn an effort to better understand the size and age structure of Black Crappie in Bald Eagle Lake a spring trap netting assessment was conducted from April 10-14, 2017. A total of 32 Black Crappie were sampled and otoliths extracted for age assignment. A total of nine different year classes were found, ranging from age 3 to age 12. The largest year class of Black Crappie was from 2011 (age 6) followed by 2008, 2007 and 2012. Black Crappie populations will continue to be monitored through standard lake surveys and special nettings such as this.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is a 1047 acre (751 littoral acres, LA) class 24 lake located in northeastern Ramsey County.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially in odd numbered years at a rate of 2lb/LA (1502 lbs) since 1998.  Muskellunge fingerlings are currently stocked at a rate of 1 fish per acre (1268 fish) biennially in even numbered years.  A standard survey comprised of gill nets, trap nets, and night-time boat electrofishing was conducted during the summer of 2016 to assess the fish community in Bald Eagle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate was 0.75 fish per net in the gill nets, below average for class 24 lakes and a significant decrease from 3.08 fish per net sampled in 2014.  This is the lowest catch rate for Walleyes recorded in Bald Eagle Lake since 1989.  Sampled Walleye ranged from 12 to 24 inches in length, and the average Walleye sampled was 20.45 inches long.  Aging revealed 6 year classes, most aligning with stocking years.  The 2010 year class (age-6) made up over 50% of the catch, and was also noted as a strong year class in the 2014 survey.  It appears there have been no strong year classes since 2010, which is likely responsible for the drop in Walleye catch rate.  Age-6 Walleyes displayed above average growth, with a average length of 20.4 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rate was 3.75 fish per gill net, average for class 24 lakes.  This is a slight increase from 2.92 per net in 2014, and is a relatively low catch rate compared to other East Metro area lakes.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 13 to 34 inches in length, and the average Northern Pike was 23.64 inches long. Over 77% of pike sampled in this survey were over 21 inches long, and 14% were over 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rate was 43.83 fish per gill net, well above average for class 24 lakes.  Sampled Yellow Perch ranged in size from 4 to 11.5 inches, and the average Yellow Perch was 7.57 inches long.   A subsample of otolith aged Yellow Perch revealed two primary year classes, 2013 and 2011 (age-3 and age-5).   Yellow Perch growth was above average, reaching an average length of 9.76 inches by age-5.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 59.98 per hour of on time during night-time electrofishing, a moderate to high catch rate compared to other lakes in the East Metro area.  Largemouth Bass sampled during this survey ranged from 4 to 17.5 inches in length, with an average length of 9.67 inches.   Over 34% of sampled bass were greater than 12 inches and 3% were greater than 16 inches.         <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rate was 3.58 fish per gill net and 4.83 fish per trap net, both below average abundances for class 24 lakes.  The average Black Crappie sampled was 7.16 inches long, and fish ranged from 5 to 9.45 inches in length.  Over 22% of Black Crappie were over 8 inches in length and 3% were over 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 41 fish per net in the trap nets, above average for class 24 lakes.  The average Bluegill sampled was 5.56 inches long, and fish ranged from 2.8 to 7.28 inches.  Over 45% of sampled bluegills were greater than 6 inches in length, and 2% were greater than 7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for walleye (WAE) and muskellunge (MUE). Walleye stocking since 2000 has been conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of  2.0 pounds/littoral-acre (1,502.0 lbs). Muskellunge stocking currently consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (1,268 fish) biennially on even numbered years. All muskellunge stocked in Bald Eagle Lake from 1994 to present have been the Leech Lake strain. The WAE population has been above median levels for abundance in the gill net sample since 1992. The 2008 gill net catch rate for WAE was the highest ever observed in this lake. The average size of WAE sampled in 2008 was 16.95 inches and 2.94 pounds. Over one-third of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. No MUE were captured during this assessment. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled near the median levels for abundance and mean weight during this assessment, but catch rates were down slightly from those observed during 2006. The average size NOP captured was approximately 22.9 inches and 2.9 pounds. Approximately 9 percent of sampled NOP measured 28.0 inches or larger. Yellow Perch (YEP) abundance has continued to increase steadily since 2002. Over 16 percent of YEP sampled measured 8.0 inches or larger. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled above median levels for both gear types with 12 percent of all fish captured measuring 8.0 inches or larger. Bluegills were sampled above median levels for abundance in trap nets with the average size fish being 5.95 inches and 0.16 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for walleye (WAE) and muskellunge (MUE). Walleye stocking since 2000 has been conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of  2.0 pounds/littoral-acre (1,502.0 lbs). Muskellunge stocking generally consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (1,268 fish) biennially on even numbered years. Supplemental stocking of MUE has occurred under permit by local sportsman clubs. Currently, biennial stocking of marked fingerlings and yearlings at a 3:1 ratio is being conducted through 2011 as part of a stocking strategy study. All muskellunge stocked in Bald Eagle Lake from 1994 to present have been the Leech Lake strain. Prior to 2010, the WAE gill net catch had been above median levels for abundance since 1992. The gill net catch rate for WAE, while down from that recorded in 2008, has remained relatively stable for this lake since 1992. The average size of WAE sampled in 2010 was 18.84 inches and 2.83 pounds. Approximately one-half of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. No MUE were sampled during this assessment, however a 5 year old hybrid muskie (TME) measuring 37.64 inches in length was captured in a gill net. Hybrid muskies have never been stocked in this lake. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled near the median levels for abundance and mean weight during this assessment, but catch rates were down slightly from those observed during 2008. The average size NOP captured was approximately 23.5 inches and 3.4 pounds. Approximately 17 percent of sampled NOP measured 28.0 inches or larger. Yellow Perch (YEP) abundance has continued to increase steadily since 2002. Over 21 percent of YEP sampled in 2010 measured 8.0 inches or larger. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled above median levels for both gear types with approximately 4 percent of all fish captured measuring 8.0 inches or larger. Bluegills were sampled above median levels for abundance in trap nets with the average size fish being 6.28 inches and 0.21 pounds. Approximately 9 percent of the BLG sampled measured 7.0 inches or longer. A Smallmouth Bass (SMB) was sampled for the first time in the history of fisheries assessments for this lake. The gill net sampled SMB measured 14.45 inches and weighed 1.57 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is a 1,047 acre class 24 lake located in northeastern Ramsey County.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. Zebra mussels were discovered in August, 2018 and have the potential to increase the water clarity in Bald Eagle Lake which may impact future survey catch rates. Walleye fingerlings were stocked biennially in even numbered years at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (1,502 lbs.) from 1998-2016.  Beginning in 2017 Walleye fingerlings are being stocked annually at a rate of 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral acre based on a randomized stocking schedule. This will allow DNR Fisheries to assess the effects of fingerling stocking density on Walleye year-class strength. Muskellunge fingerlings are currently stocked at a rate of 1 fish per acre (1,047 fish) in even numbered years. Two surveys were conducted in 2018, a standard lake survey comprised of gill nets and trap nets, and an index of biotic integrity (IBI) to assess nearshore and non-game species using backpack electrofishing and seines. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 1.80 fish per gill net which is in the normal range for Bald Eagle Lake, but lower than most previous surveys. Fish sampled were between 9.4 and 25.5 inches long (17.3 inch average). Almost all of the Walleye sampled in 2018 were from the 2014 stocking (age 4 fish). This strong year-class should support quality Walleye fishing in Bald Eagle Lake for many years to come. The 2014 year-class was comprised of larger fingerlings than either the 2012 or 2016 year-class. Stocking records indicate that the fingerlings stocked in 2017 and 2018 were similar size to 2014 and should provide more strong year-classes. The Yellow Perch sample also had a strong year-class in 2014 as well as 2013, providing a solid forage base for the Walleye and Muskellunge. Perch numbers were high in the gill net catch in 2018, but the average size of fish was similar to past years at 7.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were up from previous surveys, but still low compared to other metro area lakes. The average length was 23.9 inches and seven fish exceeded 30 inches in length. The pike population appears to be much more balanced than other area lakes and is most likely due to the presence of Muskellunge keeping them from overpopulating. Two Muskellunge were sampled in the trap nets during this survey, but a focused population analysis to be conducted in 2019-2020 will reveal more about their status. Beginning in 2018 the new Northern Pike zone management regulations went into effect. Bald Eagle Lake is in the North-Central Zone which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with two fish allowed over 26 inches in length and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. The Northern Pike sampled in 2018 split almost equally in regards to the regulation, with one-third under 22 inches, one-third in the protected slot, and one-third over 26 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill Sunfish numbers were in the normal ranges for this lake and didn't have any outstanding qualities. Crappies averaged 8.1 inches long and Bluegills 5.4 inches from the trap net catch. Summer surveys are not as good as spring surveys for sampling these species, especially larger individuals, but a few crappie over 10 inches were present and a couple Bluegill over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore IBI sampling found 18 different species of fish. Sunfish species were the most abundant fish sampled and other interesting species included darters, Banded Killifish, Tadpole Madtom and Brook Silverside along with various minnows and shiners. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Bald Eagle Lake was conducted the week of July 16th, 2018 by East Metro Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations and seining occurred at 8 of the 14 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish. Bluegill Sunfish were the most abundant species sampled followed by Bluntnose Minnows.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey conducted the week of July 7th, 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score of 55 for Bald Eagle Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is a 1,047 acre (751 littoral acres), class 24 lake located in northeastern Ramsey County.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. Zebra mussels were discovered in August, 2018 and have the potential to increase the water clarity in Bald Eagle Lake which may impact future survey catch rates. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially in even numbered years at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (1,502 lbs.) from 1998-2016.  Beginning in 2017 Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually at a rate of 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral acre based on a randomized stocking schedule. This will allow better assessment of the effects of fingerling stocking density on Walleye year class strength. Muskellunge fingerlings are currently stocked at a rate of 1 fish per acre (1,047 fish) biennially in even numbered years.  Additionally, Muskellunge yearlings and age-2 juveniles were stocked during 2015 and 2016. Bald Eagle was surveyed with gill nets in July to target Northern Pike and Walleye while Bass were sampled in May by electrofishing. Muskellunge were sampled during a separate standalone survey that will cover two years with the first year occurring spring 2022. The previous survey on this lake occurred in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 4.3 fish per net. This is well above the median catch rate for the lake class of 2.8 fish per net and the highest catch for this lake since 2008. This is meeting the long-range management goal of a Walleye catch rate between 4 and 6 fish per net. Fish size was fairly evenly distributed with lengths ranging from 9.7 to 26.6 inches and averaging 17 inches. The ages of those fish were also well distributed with the majority of fish being 2 to 9 years old with one individual at 14 years old. It appears that stockings are consistently contributing to the fishery with adequate growth and persisting to offer an opportunity for larger size classes of fish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 6.2 fish per gill net. This also exceeds the median catch rate for the lake class of 3.8. This was a substantially lower catch rate than the previous survey's catch of 14 fish per net but higher than the average over the last 30 years of between 3 to 4 fish per net. Fish size was typical for the lake and the lake class with an average length of 24 inches and a range of 16.6 to 33.9 inches. Seven percent of fish exceeded 30 inches in length so an opportunity for quality fish does exist.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate or 24.2 fish per gill net which is double the median for the lake class but typical relative to the lake's history. Fish size small, as is typical, with a mean length of 7.1 inches. The largest fish sampled measured 9.7 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at a rate of 27 fish per hour. Electrofishing catch rates on this lake have been quite variable in the past but this sampling was on the low end. Mean size was the largest yet with an average length of 11.3 inches. There was a lack of larger fish as the longest bass sampled was 16.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile other game fish species were sampled, summer gill netting does not produce data that is reliable for making inferences as to their abundance or size structure. As a note for anglers, two Muskellunge were sampled, a 42 and a 44 inch long fish. Other fish sampled were; Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. The Walleye population has steadily increased since 1987 and is presently above median levels for abundance. The average Walleye captured measured 15.41\" and 1.73 pounds. About 16% of all walleyes sampled measured 20.0\" or longer, with the largest being 28.86\". Growth rate for Walleyes was found to be good with 4-year old fish being about 16.2\" long. Although few Muskellunge were captured, they ranged in size from 21.3 to 42.3 inches. The average size was 35.3\" and 11.3 pounds. Although the number of Northern Pike captured was down from 1997 levels, they were still sampled within the normal range of abundance. The average Northern Pike sampled was 23.39\" and 2.85 pounds. About 8% of the fish captured measured 30.0\" or more. Growth rates for Muskellunge and Northern Pike were found to be good. Largemouth Bass were sampled in above normal abundance with the average fish being 10.8\" and 0.93 pounds.Black Crappies catch rates were double from those observed in the 1997 assessment. The average Black Crappie was 6.90\" and 0.17 pounds. Over 12% of the sample measured 8.0\" or more. A strong 1998 year class is present. These fish exhibited good weight for their length. Bluegill (BLG) abundance remained nearly the same as in 1997. The average BLG sampled was 5.57\" and 0.14 pounds. Over one-third of all captured BLG measured 6.0\" or more. Yellow Perch abundance is the lowest observed since 1957 and shows a significant decrease since 1997. The average Yellow Perch captured was 6.11\". Bullhead abundance also continues to be low. Black Bullheads averaged 11.11\" and 0.72 pounds, while Yellow Bullheads averaged 11.85\" and 0.99 pounds. Golden Shiner abundance remains above average, though down from 1997 levels.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is primarily managed for walleye (WAE) and muskellunge (MUE). Walleye stocking since 2000 has been conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of  2.0 pounds/littoral-acre (1,502.0 lbs). Muskellunge stocking currently consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (1,268 fish) biennially on even numbered years. All muskellunge stocked in Bald Eagle Lake from 1994 to present have been the Leech Lake strain.   \n\nThe WAE population was sampled in average numbers for this lake class in 2012. The average WAE sampled by gill nets in 2012 was 16.3 inches long and weighed 1.8 pounds. Only 3 of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled near the median levels for abundance and mean weight during this assessment.  Pike sampled ranged from 13\" to 34\".  The pike sampled by gill nets averaged 23.8 inches long and weighed 3.3 pounds. Three of the 25 pike sampled were more than 30\" long. Five adult MUE were sampled in gill nets during this survey. The MUE ranged in size from 38.5\" TL to 43.9\" TL. Mean length and weight of these 5 fish was 41.3\" TL and 16.5 pounds, respectively. One muskellunge was captured during the largemouth bass electrofishing investigation.  The fish weighed 17.7 lbs. and measured 41.5\" TL. Yellow Perch (YEP) were sampled in average numbers for this lake class, but perch observed in the catch were small.  The largest perch in the catch was 9.4\" long. \n\nBlack crappie and bluegill populations were not evaluated as part of this investigation.\n\n</p>",

Surface acreage is 1,047 acres with 751 acres being littoral (72%) and the lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet. The primary management species in Bald Eagle Lake are Walleye and Muskellunge. Beginning in 2017, Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually at a rate of 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral acre based on a randomized stocking schedule. This will allow assessment of the effects of fingerling stocking density on Walleye year class strength. Fingerling Muskellunge are stocked at a rate of one fish per acre (1,047 fish total) in even numbered years. The Muskellunge population is assessed by an independent survey separate from a standard lake survey. Muskellunge surveys are conducted using large trap nets set shortly after ice-out to target adult fish moving along shore to spawn. Population estimates using a two year mark-recapture analysis is the standard means of assessing Muskellunge populations. 2019 was the first of a two-year survey with the goal of calculating a population estimate for Muskellunge in the lake. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the second year of this survey was cancelled. Survey schedules were then adjusted and a new two-year population estimate began in 2022.  <br> \nThe 2022 survey sampled a total of 30 Muskellunge in Bald Eagle Lake from May 3rd to May 12th. Sizes ranged from 36.4 to 48.9 inches long and each fish was scanned for an existing passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag and the number recorded, or if absent, tagged with one. This allows for tracking of individual growth and calculating population size in the second year of sampling. A disparity in sex was evident in the sampling, with 24 males caught, 5 females and one unknown. The data collected in 2022 will be used in conjunction with the data from similar sampling in 2023 to estimate a total adult population size for Muskellunge in Bald Eagle Lake.</p>",

NOP NUMBERS AND WEIGHT PER GILL NET WERE COMPARABLE TO THE RESPECTIVE STATE MEDIANS WHILE BEING GREATER THAN LOCAL MEDIANS.  INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT WAS AVERAGE.  GROWTH OF NORTHERNS WAS GREATER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE TO ALL ANNULI MEASURED.  A FEW NOP Y-O-Y WERE TAKEN SHORELINE SEINING.  ONE MUE WAS CAUGHT; ON A PER NET BASIS THIS CATCH WAS GREATER THAN STATE OR LOCAL MEDIANS.  THE MUSKY'S WEIGHT WAS BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO STATE AND LOCAL AVERAGES FOR THIS SPECIES TAKEN IN GILL NETS. GROWTH RATE TO THE TWO ANNULI PRESENT WAS 30-50 PERCENT ABOVE AVERAGE.  LOW NUMBERS OF LMB SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE WERE SAMPLED.  GROWTH OF LMB WAS AVERAGE.  NUMBERS OF SEINE-CAUGHT Y-O-Y LMB INDICATE A SUCCESSFUL YEAR-CLASS IS PRESENT FOR 1992.  SUNFISH NUMBERS VARIED FROM BELOW TO ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL TEST NET MEDIANS DEPENDING ON SPECIES; THE FISH WERE SMALL TO AVERAGE IN SIZE.  BLG Y-O-Y WERE NUMEROUS IN SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.  PERCH AND GOS WERE SEEN IN LOW (GOS) TO HIGH (YEP) NUMBERS IN GILL NETS; SIZE OF THESE PREY SPECIES WAS AVERAGE.  LOW NUMBERS OF SMALL WHC AND LARGE NUMBERS OF BLC OF AVERAGE WEIGHT WERE SAMPLED IN GILL NETS; TRAP NETS YIELDED AVERAGE NUMBERS OF BLC OF SMALL SIZE AND NO WHCS. THE THREE LOCAL SPECIES OF BLH WERE ALL TAKEN IN LOW NUMBERS BUT WERE ABOVE AVERAGE IN SIZE.  TWO ROUGH FISH SPECIES, BOF AND SNG, WERE TAKEN IN GREATER THAN AVERAGE NUMBERS AND GREATER THAN AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT; CARP WERE LOW IN NUMBERS BUT HIGH IN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT.</p>",
