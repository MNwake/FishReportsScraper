THIS INDICATES A DECLINE FROM 1986 WHEN TRAPNETS FROM BOTH HALVES OF DOUBLE LAKE CONTAINED PIKE WELL ABOVE LOCAL MEDIANS.  PIKE THAT WERE SAMPLED WERE ALL OVER 20 INCHES.  NO SCALES WERE EXAMINED, BUT LENGTH-FREQUENCY SUGGESTS THAT MOST PIKE COLLECTED WERE NOT YOUNG.  DRY YEARS MAY HAVE REDUCED RECRUITMENT.  BOTH BLC AND WHC ARE SUSTAINING POPULATIONS IN DOUBLE LAKE, WITH CATCHES NEAR LOCAL MEDIANS IN THE NORTH LAKE, AND MUCH LOWER IN THE SOUTH LAKE.  WHC NUMBERS HAVE DECLINED IN THE NORTH LAKE SINCE THE 1986 SURVEY, AND BLC HAVE DECLINED IN BOTH LAKES.  BOTH SPECIES APPEAR TO BE EXHIBITING NORMAL GROWTH.  YEP HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY SINCE THE 1986 SURVEY, BUT CATCHES WERE STILL BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS.  PERCH REPRODUCTION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELIABLE, WITH NO YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED SINCE THE LAST STOCKING IN 1987.  WAE NUMBERS WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, AND WELL ABOVE MEDIAN GILLNET CATCHES IN THE SOUTH LAKE. SHORELINE SEINING RESULTS ON NORTH DOUBLE INDICATED SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WAE. APPARENT REPRODUCTION IN 1985 AND 1986 MAY BE EITHER ACTUAL REPRODUCTION OR INACCURATE SCALE INTERPRETATION.  BLB CATCHES ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET.  GILLNET CPUE DECLINED IN THE NORTH LAKE AND INCREASED IN THE SOUTH LAKE, WHILE TRAPNET CATCHES INCREASED IN THE NORTH AND DECLINED IN THE SOUTH.  AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE BLH DECLINED EXCEPT IN THE SOUTH LAKE GILLNET,  WHERE THE AVERAGE WEIGHT DOUBLED COMPARED TO THE 1986 SURVEY.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE BLH ARE INCREASING AND SHOWING GOOD GROWTH.  CARP NUMBERS IN TRAP NETS HAVE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT 8, TO A CURRENT CPUE ABOUT 3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN TRAPNETS.  WTS HAS APPARENTLY DECLINED IN THE LAST 5 YEARS.  CATCHES FOR THIS SPECIES ARE STILL ABOUT 3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake, near Storden, is a 246-acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Double is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie and yellow perch.  Double is composed of two lake basins that are connected by a culvert.  Most of the watershed is dominated by agricultural practices that likely influence the lake's water quality and clarity.  Rip-rap efforts to minimize shoreline erosion has temporarily stabilized some of the shoreline.  Downed trees on eroded banks have created excellent crappie habitat.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of June 16 utilizing 3 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 5 seine hauls.The walleye catch rate was within the expected range and averaged 17.3 inches.  Most of the fish sampled were from the 1999 and 2001 year class.  A stocking regime of  fingerling instead of fry stocking will continue due to the large crappie population.  The good news is that walleye numbers are within the normal range and that many of the fish sampled were 18 to 21 inches.If the walleyes are not biting then perhaps you should give crappie fishing a try.  The black crappie catch rate was 5 times the normal range.  Black crappie catch rates have been higher than the \"normal\" range for nearly ten years.  Although the crappie numbers are quite high, it might require some sorting to get some eaters.  Most of the fish were from 6.02 to 12.56 inches and averaged 6.98 inches.  Length-weight data indicated the fish were in relatively plump condition.  If you can find some of these suspended fish, you will likely find yourself with some good action.The yellow perch catch rate was below the expected range but not surprising given the high crappie population.  The few perch that were sampled ranged from 6.1 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Only two year classes of fish were captured (2000 and 2001) and growth rates were above average. The northern pike catch rate was within the \"normal\" range in 2003.  Most of the fish were 22 to 29 inches and averaged 25 inches.  All previous assessments done on Double Lake sampled only a few northern pike during each survey.  This would indicate that the population has limited access to spawning habitat and therefore is likely maintained solely by stocking. The freshwater drum catch rate in gill nets was virtually identical to the previous survey.  This species first showed up in the lake in 1999.  These drum averaged 8.1 inches and were relatively plump.  Perhaps the northern pike population will aid in reducing these numbers.Black bullhead abundance was slightly below average for small prairie lakes.  The bullheads ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged 8 inches.  Most of the bullheads were in below average condition, which seemed  worse in bigger fish.A total of sixteen species of fish were sampled.  Other fish captured were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, channel catfish, common shiners, fathead minnows, largemouth bass, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Double Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake is a 246-acre lake located near Storden in Cottonwood County.  The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six-foot diameter culvert.  This culvert is the only boat access for the general public available to enter the South basin.  The South basin does provide a handicapped accessible fishing pier located along county highway 53.  Water levels were low in 2023, which allowed the survey crew to pass through the culvert into the south basin of Double Lake to set nets.  Double Lake has a maximum depth of nine feet, a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  While winter aeration is operated by Red Rock Sportsmen's Club in both basins, partial winterkills have still occurred during some winters.  These partial winterkills haven't affected the highly diverse fish community.  Species diversity is usually high likely due to a direct connection to the Cottonwood River via Highwater Creek.  Double Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 26, 2023, using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets in North and South Double Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch rate at Double Lake was 7.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes but down from the 2019 catch of 13.0 per gill net.  Historically, the catch rate has averaged 9.9 per gill net since 1986.  Several year classes of Walleye were present (2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022), with age-4 (2019) being the most common, comprising 33 percent of the aged Walleye.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 8.0 to 27.7 inches and averaged 18.6 inches.  Despite the \"lower than normal\" catch rate good Walleye bites have been reported on Double Lake by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1986, Yellow Perch catch rates at Double Lake have averaged 7.0 per gill net and have ranged from 0.3 per gill net in 2007 to 25.0 per gill net in 2015.  In 2023, the gill net catch rate was 0.7 per gill net, below the long-term average and lower than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow perch lengths were 5.4 and 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBack in the late 1990's and early 2000's, Double Lake consistently had abundant Black Crappie populations; however, since 2011, catches have been below 4.2 per trap net.  The trend continued in 2023 with a Black Crappie catch rate of 0.6 per trap net.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 4.4 to 13.5 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  While it appears that there are at least four year-classes present, abundance of Black Crappie remained low.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in Double Lake has been highly variable, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in multiple years to 6.7 per gill net in 2003.  The catch rate in 2023 was 1.0 per gill net which is near the long-term average of 1.1 per gill net since 1986 but is not in the expected range of catches for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 19.5 to 30.3 inches and averaged 25.3 inches.  Double Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested.  Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Black Bullhead catch rate was 50.0 per gill net, slightly above the long-term average of 29.6 per gill net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 6.6 to 12.4 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, River Redhorse, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie and yellow perch.  The lake has not been opened to liberalized fishing since a helixor aeration system was installed in 1984.  The Double Lake watershed is dominated largely by agricultural land use practices. Intensive agricultural practices within the watershed have contributed to bank erosion which in turn has altered water quality.  These problems have created an environment that is difficult for aquatic vegetation to grow which challenges fish populations to naturally reproduce and recruit \"catchable\" fish for anglers.According to historical gill net catches on Double Lake, the walleye density was lower in 1999 than in previous surveys.  The mean walleye gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 3.33 fish/net set in 1999, 22.00 fish/net set in 1995, 16.00 fish/net set in 1991, and 2.00 in 1986.  Although the walleye catch rate was lower than the past two surveys, the population density was still within the expected range for this type of lake.  Trap nets indicated the population was slightly more dense than what gill nets indicated.  The average walleye trap net catch was 2.56 fish/net set which approached the upper normal range (2.95 fish/net set).  Total lengths of walleye in gill nets ranged between 18.1 and 24.7 inches, with a mean of 20.7.  Total lengths of walleye in trap nets ranged between 6.3 and 28.7 inches, with an average of 18.7.  A mode was recorded in the range of 18.0 and 19.0 inches for both trap and gill nets.  It appears there was some natural reproduction in Double Lake in 1999 because one young of the year walleye was sampled by shoreline seining.  A total of 3,324 fingerlings walleyes were stocked in the fall of 1999 to increase the walleye density.  In an effort to better obtain management goals, walleye stocking may be changed to stocking walleye fingerlings two out of three years.  Additionally we are hoping that stocking walleye fingerlings may aid in controlling freshwater drum numbers.Black crappie fishing should be good for the next couple of years in Double Lake.  The average black crappie trap net catch was 39.0 fish/net set which was substantially higher than expected (20.5 fish/net set).  Black crappie numbers tend to vary considerably in the pothole prairie region.  The catch rates of black crappie in trap nets were 13.22 fish/net set in 1995, 2.17 fish/net set in 1991, and 25.8 fish/net in 1986.  Total lengths of black crappie total lengths ranged between 4.0 and 10.9 inches, with an average of 7.6.  Ten young of the year crappie were sampled in 1999 which indicated some success in natural reproduction.  These data suggest the black crappie population was self-perpetuating and the size structure was dominated by smaller individuals.  Enjoy the crappie fishing for the next couple of years as the population is on a high cycle.The yellow perch gill net catch was 2.00 fish/net set which was below the lower range (2.65 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  The yellow perch gill net catch has ranged between 0 and 3.67 fish/net set in the last four surveys (1986, 1991, 1995, and 1999).  Total lengths of yellow perch in gill nets ranged between 5.8 and 9.9 inches, with an average of 7.7.  Only two year classes (1996 and 1997) of yellow perch were captured which would explain the small size structure.  Young of the year yellow perch were captured in 1993 (40 fish/seine haul), 1995 (93 fish/seine haul), and 1999 (1 fish/seine haul).  These data suggest that Double Lake has had some natural reproduction of yellow perch in the past but success was minimal in 1999.  Double Lake had a low density yellow perch population and the size structure consisted of smaller fish.  Similar to black crappie population numbers, yellow perch densities tend to cycle too.  Yellow perch numbers will probably begin to increase over the next couple of years if spawning habitat is adequate.  The black bullhead gill net catch was 44.33 fish/net set which was within the expected range (30.34 to 150.62 fish/net set) for this lake class.  The black bullhead gill net CPUE has ranged between 6.67 fish/net set in 1995 and 67.00 fish/net set in 1986.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 6.9 and 8.9 inches, with an average of 7.9.  These data suggest the black bullhead population density was as expected and the size structure was dominated by smaller individuals.  The average freshwater drum gill net catch was 31.67 fish/net set which was much higher than expected (8.33 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  The 1999 lake survey was the first time freshwater drum were captured in Double Lake.  The Flandreau Dam on the Cottonwood River was removed in 1995 which may have enabled freshwater drum to immigrate into Double Lake.  The size structure of the freshwater drum was dominated by smaller individuals.  These fish may have been the result of only a few adults successfully reproducing and pulling off a year class dominated by one size.  Total lengths of freshwater drum ranged between 7.1 and 11.3 inches, with an average of 10.4.  The average common carp trap net catch was 4.33 fish/net set which was close to the expected range (4.88 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  Total lengths of common carp ranged between 13.4 and 26.1 inches, with an average of 19.4.  These data suggest the common carp population density was as expected and the size structure consisted mostly of larger individuals.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Double Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake is a 227-acre lake located in Cottonwood County.  This is a class 43 lake that is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike.  The lake has not been opened to liberalized fishing since installation of a helixor aeration system in 1984.  Oxygen readings on January 2, 2008 were very low with the highest reading being 1.3 mg/l on North Double.  Readings had rebounded some by the end of January.  Commercial fishing has removed carp, buffalo, white suckers, and black bullheads in the past.  Double Lake is essentially two lakes connected by a six-foot diameter culvert.  The Double Lake watershed is largely dominated by agricultural uses.  Agricultural land use practices, water quality, and bank erosion have created an environment that is difficult for aquatic vegetation to grow and survive.  This situation challenges some fish populations to self perpetuate because of poor spawning habitats.\n\nFreshwater drum appeared in Double Lake assessments for the first time in 1999.  The Flandrau dam on the Cottonwood River at New Ulm was removed in 1995, fueling speculation that drum may have moved upstream in the Cottonwood River and Highwater Creek to Double Lake.  Northern pike were added to the management plan as a secondary species in order to provide an additional predator which could prey on freshwater drum.   Gill net catch rates of freshwater drum were 31.7 per set and 30.7 per set in 1999 and 2003.  The gill net catch rate in 2007 was down to 12.3 per set.  The average length of freshwater drum sampled in gill nets increased from 8.1 inches in 2003 to 13.0 inches in 2007.  \n\nWalleye have always been  popular in Double Lake.  There appears to be an increase in walleye numbers when compared to surveys done in 1999 and 2003.  The gill net catch rate was 8.7 in 2007 compared to 3.3 in 1999 and 2003.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 9.8 to 15.3 inches and averaged 12.1 inches.  The lake is presently stocked with walleye fingerlings two of every three years.\n\nExcellent black crappie fishing was reported by area anglers with many limits of nice crappie being caught during the spring of 2007.  This may have been one of the factors why trap net catch rates in 2007 were down a bit from the record high catch rates in 2003.  There are still very good numbers of black crappie available for harvest in Double.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 6.6 to 11.6 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.\n\nDouble has what could be considered an average northern pike population when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of northern pike caught in trap nets ranged from 24.5 to 33.1 inches and averaged 28.9 inches.\n\nYellow perch numbers were low in 1999 and 2003.  According to our survey in 2007, numbers of yellow perch continue to be down.\n\nOther species sampled during our survey included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, white crappie, white sucker, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, and river redhorse.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Double Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double is a 246 acre lake located near Storden in Cottonwood County.  The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six foot diameter culvert under county highway 53.  This culvert is the only boat access available to enter the South basin.  The South basin does provide a handicapped accessible fishing pier located along county highway 53.  Due to high water levels in 2018 and 2019 DNR fisheries crews were unable to enter the South portion of the lake to set nets and assess the fish community.  Double Lake has a maximum depth of nine feet, a shoreline length of 3.8 miles.  While winter aeration is operated by the Redrock Sportsmen's Club in both basins, partial winterkills have occurred.  These partial winterkills haven't affected the highly diverse fish community.  Fourteen species of fish sampled are likely due to a direct connection to the Cottonwood River via Highwater Creek where fish can come and go when water levels are high.  Double Lake is managed for Walleye, crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 10, 2019 using 2 gill nets and 5 trap nets in the North basin. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nForty-four Walleye were caught in 2 gill nets and 5 trap nets.  The gill net catch rate of 13.0 per net was within the expected range of 2.3 to 18.0 and above the long-term average of 10.2 per net.  The trap net catch rate of 3.6 per net was above the expected value of 2.3 per net and above the long-term average of 2.1 per net.  Gill nets are more likely to represent the true picture of the Walleye population than trap nets because they catch better in the summer.  Walleye in the gill net sample ranged in length from 8.5 to 26.8 inches with an average length of 15.1 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were present in the sample (2017, 2016, 2014, 2013, and 2011) with the 2016 (age-3) and 2017 (age-2) year classes making up 73% of the aged fish sample combined.  The Walleye in the gill nets and trap nets were in fair condition.  Interestingly, it appeared that the condition of the young fish lagged behind the condition of the older fish. This may indicate some stress on younger fish to find enough food to maintain good weights.  Overall, the Walleye population is doing well, even if some stress was apparent in the younger fish.  Typically, Walleye populations when abundant, will experience some stress that helps to balance the population in the long-term.  The good news is that a hungry Walleye population is a good population to fish and may provide faster than typical action.        <br> \n    <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nThere are 2 species of crappie in Double Lake, Black Crappie and White Crappie. Black Crappie have 7-8 anal spines and White Crappie have 5-6 anal spines.  Twenty-four Black Crappie and 9 White Crappie were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets. White Crappie were captured in trap nets at a rate of 1.6 per net and were captured at a rate of 0.5 per net in gill nets.  Black Crappie were captured in trap nets at a rate of 4.2 per net and were captured at a rate of 1.5 per net in gill nets.  Both species of crappie were captured within their normal range values in trap nets and gill nets.  White Crappie ranged in length from just over 5.5 inches to just under 14 inches in trap nets with an average length of just over 10.5 inches!  Black Crappie ranged in length from 7.5 to 12.5 inches in trap nets with an average length of over 10 inches!  Both crappie species were healthy.  The crappie populations appear to be doing well, and were found within expected ranges for Double Lake.  Some large crappie could be caught on Double Lake, give it a try!   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nEight Yellow Perch were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  The gill net catch rate was 2.5 per net and the trap net catch rate was 0.6 per net.  Both gill net and trap net catch rates were at or within the interquartile range for Double Lake.  It is not uncommon to have fewer Yellow Perch in the fish community when Walleye numbers are higher.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from just over 6.5 inches to just over 8.5 inches.  Two age groups of Yellow Perch were present in the sample.  Body condition of the Yellow Perch was good.  The Yellow Perch population appears to be doing well, adults are present in the lake so future spawning potential exists to boost the population.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE  <br> \nOnly 2 Northern Pike were sampled in Double Lake.  The Northern Pike were 22.7 inches and 26.3 inches. Those fish indicate an adult population is currently established in the lake.  Double Lake is stocked with adult Northern Pike when they are available as winter rescue from Rice Lake near Aitkin or when the local sports club buys and stocks fish with a permit.  Two hundred and forty winter rescue adult Northern Pike were stocked from Rice Lake in 2016 and 50 adult were stocked by the local Red Rock Sports Club in 2012 with a permit.  It may be beneficial to stock adult fish again in the near future to boost the population.  Additionally, fingerling Northern Pike will be stocked in 2021 from DNR production ponds.  Angling for Northern Pike may be slow on Double Lake.  However, the south lake was not sampled and may have had a few more Northern Pike.  Be aware that a 2 bag, 24 inch minimum length limit of Northern Pike has been in effect since 2018.  This means, you can only keep 2 Northern Pike per day only if they are over 24 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOther species sampled in Double Lake in the trap net and gill net samples were 2 Bigmouth Buffalo, 62 Black Bullhead, 3 Bluegill, 18 Common Carp, 4 Channel Catfish, 18 Freshwater Drum, 2 River Redhorse Sucker, 24 White Sucker, and 21 Yellow Bullhead.  Double Lake has a high number of species compared to other southwest Minnesota lakes.  The high number of species is a result of the lake being connected to the Cottonwood River via Highwater Creek.  Additionally, 3 small low head dams have been modified during the winter of 2019-20 near Sanborn and Lamberton to enhance fish passage.  River Redhorse Sucker are unique and are not found often in southwest Minnesota lakes.  Double Lake will continue to be characterized as a high diversity fishery due to its river connection.  With that connection, the lake will receive and lose some fish naturally as they come and go from the lake.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake consists of two basins of similar size which are intermittently connected by a six-foot diameter culvert.  The deepest spot in this 246-acre lake is approximately 9 ft.  The lake bottom is dominated by sand areas, and aquatic vegetation is limited.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye. Walleye numbers are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye collected in our gillnets ranged in length from 9 to almost 26 inches with an average of approximately 16 inches.  The population is comprised mainly of larger fish which should provide anglers with 20 inch and greater walleye in 1996.   Current yellow perch numbers are comparable to past surveys and considered normal compared to other lakes in our area.  Perch ranged in length from 5 to 8 ? inches with an average of 7 ?inches.  The yellow perch population appears to be healthy and self supporting.  Yellow perch were last stocked in 1987.Black crappie numbers are considered normal while white crappie numbers are considered high.  On average, black crappie collected in our trapnets were approximately 5 inches in length and white crappie were 8 inches.  Both populations appear to be healthy and self supporting.  Crappie were last stocked in 1984.Black bullhead numbers have decreased since our last survey in 1991 and are currently considered low compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bullhead collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches with an average of approximately 10 inches.Double lake also supports good numbers of carp, bigmouth buffalo, and white sucker.  Between 1992-94, commercial fishermen removed more than 7,000 lbs. of carp and 5,000 lbs. of buffalo.  Other species collected during our 1995 survey include bluegill, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, shorthead redhorse, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Double Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double Lake is a 246-acre lake located near Storden in Cottonwood County. The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six foot diameter culvert. This culvert is the only boat access available to enter the South basin.  This is a class 43 lake that is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike.  The lake has not been opened to liberalized fishing since installation of an aeration system in 1984. Although both basins are aerated they have experienced partial winterkills in recent years.  This may account for overall low numbers of most species present compared to previous sampling.  Despite low oxygen readings at times, Double still exhibits a highly diverse fish community with sixteen species sampled.  This is likely due to a direct connection to the Cottonwood River via Highwater Creek.  Commercial fishing has removed carp, buffalo, white suckers, and black bullheads in the past.  The Double Lake agricultural land use practices, water quality, and bank erosion have created an environment that is difficult for aquatic vegetation to grow and survive.  This situation challenges some fish populations to self perpetuate because of poor spawning habitats.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 20, 2011 using 2 gill nets and 4 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum appeared in Double Lake assessments for the first time in 1999.  The Flandreau dam on the Cottonwood River at New Ulm was removed in 1995, fueling speculation that drum may have moved upstream in the Cottonwood River and Highwater Creek to Double Lake.  The drum population has continued to decline since their peak in 1999 with current numbers at 4.5 per gill net.  This dam removal may be partially responsible for allowing passage of four new species into Double Lake.  They are present in low numbers and include channel catfish, shorthead redhorse, stonecat, and bluegill.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have always been popular in Double Lake.  There was a decrease in walleye numbers when compared to surveys done in 1999, 2003, and 2007.  The gill net catch rate was 8.7 in 2007 compared to 3.3 in 1999 and 2003.  This year the catch rate in gill nets was 3.0 per gill net.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 7.0 to 17.0 inches and averaged 12.0 inches.  The lake is presently stocked by DNR with walleye fingerlings two of every three years.  The Red Rock Sportsmen's Club has also elected to purchase walleye and northern pike to stock in some years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nDouble Lake has a reputation for excellent crappie angling over the years.  This may change for a few years since our assessment captured near record low numbers of black crappie in trap nets at 3.0 per net.  The crappies caught appear to be from three year classes and ranged in size from 5.5 to 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike were sampled during the 2011 assessment despite stockings of fingerlings in 2005 and 2006.  They may have been harvested, exited the lake during high water, or been victims of winterkill.  The Red Rock Sportsmen's Club in conjunction with the DNR is planning to restock northern pike in 2012. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 1999, 2003, and 2007. According to our survey in 2011, numbers of yellow perch have increased significantly to 14.5 per gill net.  Total lengths ranged from 5.5 to 9.0 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  These perch should provide some quality angling over the next couple years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker and bigmouth buffalo populations are at an \"all time\" high, whereas black bullhead are at an \"all time\" low. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during our survey included, common carp, white crappie, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, and orange spotted sunfish. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Double Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Charles Obler <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Double is a 246 acre lake located west of Storden in Cottonwood County.  The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six foot diameter culvert.  This culvert is the only public boat access available to enter the South basin.  There is a MNDNR owned public access on the North basin and the Red Rock Sportsman's Club maintains a handicapped accessible fishing pier on the South basin.  Despite both basins having winter aeration systems, occasional partial winterkills still occur, but haven't affected the diverse fish community.  Sixteen fish species were sampled in a population assessment conducted during the week of June 8, 2015 using 2 gill nets and 5 trap nets in the north basin.  This complex system is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch rate of 20.0 per set was the second highest on record in eight surveys dating back to 1986.  Historical gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 22 per net with a long term average of about 10 per net.  There were four year classes present and they were dominated by two year old fish from the 2013 fry stocking.  Total lengths of Walleye sampled ranged from 9 to 22 inches with an average length of 13.7 inches.  Walleye have always been popular in Double Lake and should continue to provide excellent angling in the future. <br> \n <br> \nDouble has a reputation for excellent crappie angling over the years.  This may change for a few years since our assessment captured record low numbers of Black Crappie at 0.8 per trap net.  There were 4.0 to 5.2 inch crappie captured in gill nets, and 9.0 to 9.6 inch fish captured in trap nets.  Hopefully these two year classes can reestablish the crappie population without additional stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of 25.0 per set is the highest catch on record for 8 surveys since 1986.  Total lengths of perch in gill nets ranged from 5.9 inches to 10.4 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches.  These perch should provide quality angling for \"keeper\" size fish for the next couple years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one 18.2 inch Northern Pike was captured in gill or trap nets during this assessment although the south basin was not sampled.  The most recent stocking of 50 adult northern in 2012 does not appear to have improved the abundance of pike.  Additional stocking of pike may be necessary to meet management goals for a \"predator\" to control Freshwater Drum populations. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum, also known as sheepshead, were first observed in the 1999 population assessment.  There is speculation that drum entered Double through the Cottonwood River and Highwater Creek  after the Flandreau dam was removed in 1995.  The catch rate of 6.0 per gill net was down slightly from the 2011 survey catch rate of 4.5 per set.  These fish ranged from 11 to 17 inches in total length, and provide another angling opportunity.  There is some negative stigma about eating Freshwater Drum but their fillets consists of white flakey meat that can be hard to differentiate between other game fish fillets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate of 10.2 per trap net, and the Common Carp catch rate of 2.2 per trap net are well below the long term average for this lake type.  The relatively low abundance of these two species may be contributing to higher water transparency readings in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish first appeared in the 2015 survey, and although their numbers are still low at 1.6 per trap net they may continue to flourish with the improved water clarity.  The majority of Bluegill sampled were of preferred size to anglers at 7.5 to 10 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in relatively low numbers during this assessment included White Sucker, Bigmouth Buffalo, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and Shorthead Redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Double Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six foot diameter culvert.  Despite having aeration in both basins, partial winterkills occur infrequently but haven't affected the highly diverse fish community.  Sixteen species of fish sampled are likely due to a direct connection to the Cottonwood River via Highwater Creek.  Double Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Double Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 11, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 195.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 4.8 to 5.9 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the Double Lake Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",
