The white sucker abundance appears to be high as the gill net CPUE is above the third quartile for all lakes within the same ecolgocial class.  The gill net CPUE for yellow perch has doubled since the previous survey.  All centrarchid species appear to be very low in abundance.  A walleye population has been established within the lake as a result of fry stocking.  All walleyes in the sample were age 3 fish.  The growth rate for walleyes appears to be good as defined in the DNR Fisheries Lake Survey Manual.  The mean total length at last annulus formation for the walleye sample was 10.9 inches which is within 20% of the statewide average.  Only nine age 3 fish were used to make this determination.South Basin:  Northern pike were caught in this basin but the catch rate was low; the gill net CPUE was 1.5 fish per net.  A comparative analyses of the present catch data with previous testnetting studies for this basin was inconclusive as only one of the last four studies had recorded separate catch data for each basin.It could be determined that the presence of green sunfish in this assessment was the first time this species was identifed within this basin. No green sunfish were observed in the north basin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Longyear Lake is 158 acres and is located in the city of Chisholm, MN. The lake is shallow, nutrient rich and split into two distinct basins by a man-made roadway with a large box culvert maintaining connectivity. The City of Chisholm owns the entire shoreline which is relatively undeveloped and popular with the community. The fisheries lake management plan was last revised in 2011. Walleye were the primary management species with a goal of maintaining a catch rate greater than 2.0/net. Northern Pike were considered a secondary management species with no goals. Walleye are actively managed by fry stocking in odd years. A standard survey was conducted in September 2022 to collect updated information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches have been consistent since regular stocking began. The 2022 catch was within the expected range for lakes with similar habitat, attaining the management goal. Lengths of gill net sampled fish ranged from 10.2 to 20.5 inches and averaged of 16.5 inches. Size distribution was comparable to past surveys. Almost all age classes correlate to years of stocking. Like past surveys, stocking appears successful and plays an important role in maintaining a modest Walleye population. Anglers can expect Walleye to average about 17 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch was considered average when compared to similar lakes. Catches have had a slightly increasing trend since 1990 but still lower than lakes with similar habitat. Lengths ranged from 13.1 to 34.3 inches and averaged 19.1 inches. Length frequency suggests small pike are common, yet the occasional large pike has been observed in past surveys. Recruitment was consistent and growth was similar to the statewide average. Northern Pike averaged about 24 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nLongyear Lake and lakes of this type are not known to produce Bluegill. The Bluegill trap net catch was low, as expected, and similar to past surveys. Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.6 inches with an average of 5.4 inches. Growth was average when compared to similar lakes. Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches by age 5. Bluegill anglers might find the action slow but could be rewarded with a couple nice fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch was low when compared to similar lakes. Past catches have been variable. Sampled perch had an average length of 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were the most abundant species sampled in gill nets, yet the catch was within the expected range. Past catches were variable. Bullhead had an average length of 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Crappie, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Longyear Lake, located in the city of Chisholm, is a 158 acre lake in lake class 18.  Lakes in this class are small (mean area = 142 acres), shallow (15.1 feet) and have a high littoral (area less than 15 ft deep) percentage (97.7%).   Longyear Lake has a maximum depth of 19 feet and is 98% littoral.The walleye gill net catch rate (1.5/set) was within the expected range for this lake class.  Gill net captured walleye were small, ranging from 6.6 - 15.1 inches with a mean length of 10.1 inches.  In contrast, all three walleye sampled in the trap nets exceeded 19 inches.  Growth for walleye was good. Longyear Lake has been stocked four times since 1994 with walleye fry.The northern pike gill net catch rate (2.8/set) was below the expected range. Northern pike ranged from 14.5 to 21.9 inches and had a mean length of 19.1 inches.  Growth was fast for young northern pike.The trap net catch rate for bluegill (1.8/set) was low.  Low bluegill catch rates are often desirable, as growth is usually faster when numbers are low because of the reduced competion for food.  Sampled fish ranged from 3.4 to 9.5 inches and had an average length of 4.2 inches.A total of six crappies were sampled in this assessment.  Crappies sampled in the trap nets ranged from 2.7 to 11.2 inches and had a mean length of 8.4 inches.Yellow perch are often an important prey item for walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch catch rate was low (0.7/gill net), although still within the expected range.Black bullhead were very abundant (70.8/gill net; 36.2/trap net).Other fish sampled during the assessment include; brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.Longyear Lake has poor water quality relative to other lakes in the area.  Some efforts have been taken by the City of Chisholm to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching Longyear Lake to improve the lake's water quality.  Landowners in the watershed can also contribute (by using phosphorus free fertilizer on lawns: prevent lawn clippings, leaves, oils and other lawn care or care washing chemical from reaching storm sewers; maintain functioning septic sytems).  The lake's water level was lowered by approximately 2 - 3 feet in the fall of 2003. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Longyear Lake is a 158 acre lake located in the City of Chisholm.  Longyear is in ecological lake class 19.  Lakes in this class are small, shallow, and have a high percentage of littoral area.  Longyear Lake has a maximum depth of 19 feet and is 98% littoral.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch in 2010 was 2.3/net, which is similar to other recent assessments and above the management plan goal of 2.0/net.  Sampled fish ranged from 9.2 to 22.8 inches, with a mean length of 16.0 inches.  Recent management has consisted of walleye fry stocking in odd-numbered years.  Age analysis indicated 77% of sampled fish were from years when stocking occurred.  Mean length-at-age was similar to the statewide average for all ages, with walleye growing to 17.2 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch was 3.7/net, which is within the expected range for this lake class and similar to other recent assessments.  Sampled pike ranged from 9.6 to 32.6 inches, with a mean length of 20.8 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent with ages 1 through 7 present in the sample.  Mean length-at-age was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern pike reached 24.4 inches in 5 years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead was the most abundant species in the gill nets at 24.0/net.  Net catches for black bullhead have periodically been very high in historic assessments.  The 2010 catch was down from the 2003 catch rate of 70.8/net, but still above the lake class expected range.  Sampled bullheads had a mean length of 9.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was 17.8/net, which is up from the previous assessment and near the lake class third quartile (19.0/net).  Sampled perch had a mean length of 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for bluegill have generally been low for this lake class.  The 2010 catch of 1.7/net was below the expected range but similar to the previous survey.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 6.7 to 8.3 inches, with a mean length of 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets include black crappie, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and white sucker.  Near-shore IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling with a small-mesh seine and back-pack electrofishing was conducted in 2010 in an attempt to capture smaller fishes not normally encountered with standard sampling gear.  Additional species captured in near-shore sampling included golden shiner, Iowa darter and largemouth bass.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Longyear Lake is a northern pike/panfish lake that has also been stocked with walleye.  Walleye were first stocked in 1987.  Walleye were sampled in gill nets at the highest rate yet and this rate was within the expected range for this type of lake.  These walleye ranged from 9.9 to 19.8 inches in length.  Growth appears to be good.     Northern pike were sampled at a rate below the expected rate.  They ranged from 19.2 to 30.5 inches in length.  They had a mean length of 23.2 inches and a mean weight of 2.9 pounds.     Yellow perch were sampled at a rate above the expected range.  They ranged from 5.3 to 9.8 inches in length.  Growth rates appear to be good.     Black crappie were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets at rates within  their expected ranges.  The mean lengths of gill net caught fish and trap net caught fish were 5.6 inches and 6.9 inches respectivly.     Other species captured include; white sucker, golden shiner, black and brown bullhead and pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.     Tests on water samples showed higher levels of phosphorus than is normally seen in lakes in this region.  Algae grows well because of this high level of phosphorus which then reduces water clarity.  The fact that most of the streets and lawns in the area drain directly into the lake without passing through any sort of wetland is probably the main cause of this elevated level of phosphorus.  Creating wetlands and reducing fertilizer use on lawns would help.  If nothing is done, Longyear Lake will continue to age at an accelerated rate and water quality will worsen.</p>",
