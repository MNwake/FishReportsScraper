This survey was conducted to update fish population information since the last survey (1990).  Five trap nets were set for two days in July and the lake sampled with an electrofishing boat on the morning of September 19.  Shamrock Lake has a fish community dominated by panfish species, mainly bluegill and black crappie.  The major predators in the lake are largemouth bass and to a lesser extent, northern pike.  The bluegill population currently has a quality size structure.  More than half of the fish caught in the trap nets were larger than or equal to 7.5 inches in length.  Growth rate of bluegill in Shamrock Lake is above statewide average for this species.  Though few crappies were caught in this assessment, it is likely that most of the crappie in the lake were suspended away from the heavy shoreline vegetation beds, and therefore not likely to be caught in the survey nets.The largemouth bass population has increased since 1990.  However, it also appears that there are fewer larger bass than there were in 1990.  Conversely, northern pike have declined in abundance since 1990.Another good sign for Shamrock Lake is that no bullheads, or other rough fishes, were caught during this assessment.       </p>",

NORTHERN PIKE WERE FIRST INTRODUCED IN TEH RESER- VOIR IN SEPTEMBER, 1975 WHEN 37 AGE REMOVED FROM THE TROUT WATER OF CROOKED CK AND STOCKED INTO THE RESERVOIR. THIS PREDACIOUS FISH HAS PROBABLY BECOME OVERABUNDANT IN THE CENTRAR- CHID LAKE AND MIGHT HAVE REDUCED THE BASS POPULA- TION BUT BASS LOSSES MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST CRAPPIE FINGERLINS SINCE THERE ARE NO FORAGE FISH SPECIES IN THIS LAKE. THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT RE- CORD OF LARGEMOUTH BASS OR CRAPPIES HAVING BEEN STOCKED IN SHAMROCK LAKE. EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL PLANT OF NORTHERNS, ONLY TROUT HAVE BEEN STOCKED BY THE MINNESOTA DNR.</p>",

Fish samples were collected using five standard trap nets set overnight between July 12 and 13; the entire lake was sampled once with an electrofishing boat on September 5.The most common species collected were bluegill and black crappie.  Small numbers of largemouth bass and northern pike were also collected.  In addition, the single yellow perch in the trap net sample represents the first record of this species in Shamrock Lake.  Black bullheads have not been collected since 1990.Populations of both bluegill and black crappie are high for lakes like Shamrock Lake, and both populations have developed a quality size structure.  Although only eight northern pike were captured, average size was good and growth rate is above statewide average for this species.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A lake population assessment was completed on Shamrock Lake in July of 2008 as directed by the Operational Planning portion of the 2001 Lake Management Plan.  The Operational Plan had listed 2005 as the next assessment date, but due to the increased workload of the Lanesboro Office the assessment was postponed until 2008.  The impoundment was sampled with five standard trap-net sets that were set on July 16, 2008 and lifted the following day.  Largemouth bass and northern pike populations were sampled during the day with an electrofishing boat on September 4, 2008. <br> \n <br> \n     Black crappie and bluegill dominated the fish community in Shamrock Lake in 2008 and have dominated the trap net catch in every assessment dating back to 1986. The abundance of both black crappie and bluegills has increased dramatically since the 2000 assessment.  However, average size has declined slightly for bluegills and to a much greater degree for black crappies.  Abundance of both species far exceeds the 75% quartile for Lake Class 42.  Mean weight however falls below the 50% quartile for lakes of similar type.    Northern pike were also sampled in the trap nets and with electrofishing gear and their numbers were low, as has been historically the case, with trophy size fish present. <br> \n <br> \n     Largemouth bass catch per effort (CPE) also increased dramatically since 2000 and is at the highest level since 1986.  The average size of the bass collected in 2008 also increased from 2000 and is the largest average weight for largemouth bass ever collected in Shamrock Lake.  One young-of-year largemouth was also captured while completing the shoreline electrofishing station.    <br> \n</p>",
