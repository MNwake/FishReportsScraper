                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mina is a 425-acre basin located 4 miles west of Alexandria.  It is a relatively deep lake with steep drop offs and complex bottom topography.  There are some extended shallow areas away from the shoreline on the north end of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is present along the entire shoreline and shallow areas have dense stands of submerged vegetation.  These aquatic plants provide valuable fish habitat as well as an effective buffer for nutrient and sediment laden run-off from the immediate watershed.The fish community in Lake Mina is typical of densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish provide ample fishing opportunities.  Northern pike in Lake Mina tend to be small, averaging about 18 inches in length and 1.4 pounds.  Largemouth bass and bluegill populations have desirable size structures at the present time.  About one-half of the largemouth bass sampled were 12 inches in length or greater and 90% of the bluegills exceeded 6 inches.Walleye are managed as a bonus fishery.  Gill net catches averaged 2.2 fish/net.  Alternate year fingerling stockings over the past fifteen years have failed to increase walleye numbers in Lake Mina.  High northern pike densities and low yellow perch abundance likely contribute to poor stocking success.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mina is a deep 424-acre basin located approximately four miles west of Alexandria.  Maximum depth is 123 feet.  Mean depth is 28 ft.  Water quality and clarity are excellent.  Lake Mina is morphologically diverse with separated basins, shallow bays, flats, and sharp drop-off along the north shoreline.  Most of the lake has an emergent vegetation fringe of cattail and hardstem bulrush. Shallow areas have healthy stands of submergent vegetation dominated by Chara.  Due to great habitat diversity and quality, Lake Mina supports an equally diverse fish community.  Sixteen fish species were captured during the 2006 fish community assessment.   Various deviations in catch rates and size distribution from that of prior surveys introduces some uncertainty in accuracy of 2006 survey findings.  It is suspected that exceptionally high water temperature during the 2006 survey may have stimulated gamefishes, particularly adult gamefishes, to occupy deeper and cooler refuge areas.  Trapnet catches may under-represent population abundance and size distribution of largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nSunfishes are abundant.  Family members include largemouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, and black crappie.  Relatively few black crappie have been captured among surveys, yet crappie support a modest fishery.  Panfish anglers can anticipate excellent catch rates, but high population densities comes with some sacrifice in fishing quality, expressed as average size caught.  Largemouth bass and bluegill growth rates are slow.  Even though nine-year-old bluegill were captured during the 2006 survey, no 8.0-inch and larger bluegill were measured.  Only five bass captures exceeded 14.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches during the 2006 survey fell within the range of normal for similar lakes, but the average catch rate was well below that of previous surveys.  It might appear that pike abundance declined to an acceptable level.  It is more probable that high water temperature drove pike into deeper water, reducing sampling vulnerability and catch rates.  This supposition is supported with growth information.  Pike growth remained slow despite indications of lower abundance.   Four-year-old pike caught in the 2006 survey averaged 19.8 inches.  Only one fish captured was larger than 28.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight was 1.4 lbs.   Excessive numbers of small pike threaten fish community stability and likely impact survival of stocked walleye fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nLarge walleye fingerlings are stocked during even-number years at a rate of 2.0-lbs/littoral acre in efforts to sustain a viable walleye fishery.  Age structure of walleye captured during the 2006 survey provided affirmation that walleye stockings are supplemental to natural recruitment or immigration from connected basins.  Catches in 2006 averaged 5.1fish/gillnet, which is near normal for similar lakes.  The 2006 catch rate exceeded that of prior surveys.   Walleye grow fast in Lake Mina and in response to poor survival of stocked fingerlings and immigration of adult walleye during spawning runs, the population is comprised of a high relative proportion of large individuals.  Walleye grow to 16.7 inches in total length by age-4.  Thirty-seven percent of stock-size walleye captured in 2006 exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Mean weight was 2.3 pounds <br> \n <br> \nLake Mina's resident fish community is top heavy with predators.  Numbers and optimal sizes of prey are limited.  Catches of yellow perch have remained unacceptably low.  No perch were captured by gillnets through six of the last seven fish community assessments.   Limited prey availability is evident in poor growth rates of larger northern pike and largemouth bass.  Energy transfer up the food chain is further compounded by a surplus of medium-size sunfish that are too large for most predators to consume.   <br> \n <br> \nThere is a limited population of large predators that proper from their ability to consume high-energy prey fishes such as tullibee and white sucker.  A low-density muskellunge population has existed in Mina Lake since initially stocked in 1971.  Some downstream movement from Lobster Lake may also account for their sustained presence in absence of natural reproduction and maintenance stocking.  Population abundance was estimated at 20 fish in 1987.  No muskie were captured during the 2006, but an occasional follow and rare catch generate a great deal of excitement. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have a role in shaping fish community structure and directed fishing pressure can improve predator/prey balance and energy transfer.  Lake Mina supports excess numbers of small- to intermediate-size largemouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike.   Sufficient harvest of surplus medium-size gamefishes and release of large predators has potential to improve community balance and average size of fish caught. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Mina Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 11-13 July 2023.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with two sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 native species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 11-13 July 2023 by IBI Program Staff.  Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was about the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with 21% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Mina Lake in July 2022 resulting in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates an exceptional fish community is present in Mina Lake and it is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mina is a deep, 424-acre lake located approximately four miles west of Alexandria.  Maximum depth is 123 feet.  Water quality and clarity are excellent.  The lake is morphologically diverse with small bays separated by shallow reefs and flats.  Much of the lake is fringed by shallow growing cattail and bulrush.   Chara or muskgrass carpets much of the shallow bottom areas.  Overall, Lake Mina is a quiet, relatively scenic lake that can provide enjoyable, family-oriented fishing experiences. <br> \n <br> \nHabitat in Lake Mina is best suited for largemouth bass, sunfish and northern pike.  Anglers can anticipate high catch rates of small- and medium-size bass.  Electrofishing efforts yielded over 100.0 largemouth bass/hour.    Most captures were less than six-years-old, thus average size was approximately 10.0 inches.  Bass grow slow so older fish are not large.  The largest bass measured during the 2009 survey was 15.4 inches in total length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest 10.0 \u0013 14.0 inch bass to reduce competition for food, improve growth, and restructure predatory/prey balance.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are moderately abundant.  Average size caught in trapnets was 6.2 inches, but 8.0 inch and larger bluegill are common.  At present there are excessive numbers of 5.0 \u0013 7.0 inch bluegill in the population.  These fish are too large to be consumed by most predators.   Harvest of this surplus is desirable to stimulate production tied up in medium-size bluegill.  Black crappie contribute to the fishery, but few were captured during the 2009 survey.  They likely occupied deeper, cooler water and weren\u0019t vulnerable to capture in trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has declined from an over-abundance to a more normal and desirable density described by a gillnet catch rate of 4.8 pike/net.   Average size has improved in response to fewer young fish in the population.  The largest pike recorded was 33.0 inches in length.    There is another member of the pike family roaming Lake Mina.  A low density muskellunge population has existed since 1971.  An ice-out population assessment conducted in 2008 resulted in capture of five muskies.  The largest muskie captured measure 47.3 inches.  Harvest is regulated with a 48.0-inch minimum length limit and one fish possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes fingerlings have been stocked for many years to meet local angler demand.  It has proven difficult to get the young walleye past largemouth bass and northern pike predation to elevate population abundance to the desired objective.  That objective has been met in probable response to reduced northern pike abundance.  Walleye catches during the 2009 survey averaged 6.0 fish/gillnet.  Lake Mina is a good pick for anglers seeking to catch very large walleye.  Average size of captures was 17.0 inches.  The largest walleye was 30.0 inches.  Thirty-five percent of 10.0-inch and larger walleye captured exceeded 21.0 inches in total length.    <br> \n</p>",

The average size of these Northern Pike is about 1.7lbs each. Largemouth Bass have been adequately sampled for the first time by a boom electrofisher. The Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 72 fish/hr. Aging by scale reading shows that while these fish are numerous they are quite slow growing reaching only 12.2 inches on average by the end of their 5th year. The Bluegill population as sampled by trapnets remain very high at over 3 times the state average. This number was similarly high in the 1982 survey. The large majority of these Bluegills are under 6.5 inches long and slow growing..</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mina is a deep, 424-acre lake located approximately four miles west of Alexandria. Maximum depth is 123 feet.  Water clarity is excellent.  Water transparency averages 11.9 feet in summer months.  Basin morphology is characterized by small bays, separated by shallow reefs and steep drop-offs.  Chara or muskgrass carpets much of the shallows.  The lake is mostly fringed by cattail and bulrush.  Despite the lake's limited fertility, it does become thermally stratified during summer months.  The thermocline was detected below 20.0 feet during the July 2014 survey.  Due to low dissolved oxygen concentrations in deep water in summer months, most gamefishes are confined to that the portion of the lake less than 25.0 feet in depth. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mina is a quiet, relatively scenic lake that can provide enjoyable, family-oriented fishing experiences.  Common gamefishes present in Lake Mina include Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Walleye.  <br> \n  <br> \nMembers of the sunfish family, specifically Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie, tend to be abundant.  Due to low fertility of the lake and intense competition for food, these fish grow slow.  Most captures will be comprised of small- to medium-size fish.  Average size of Largemouth Bass captured during the spring 2014 electrofishing survey was 9.8 inches.  Based on age and growth calculations, bass don't attain 10.0 inches in length until age 5.  Older, 11-year-old bass captures in the 2014 population sample were only 13.0 inches in length.  Bluegill may not grow to 6.0 inches in length until age 6.  No 8.0-inch or larger Bluegills were captured in 2014.  The largest Black Crappie caught in 2014 was 11.1 inches.   This fish was seven-years-old and likely near the end of its life expectancy.  Other sunfishes common to Lake Mina include Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and sunfish hybrids.  Anglers should not be reluctant to harvest from surplus stocks of bass and panfishes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike densities have decreased through the 2000s, but this under-exploited gamefish remains abundant.  Pike captures during the 2014 survey varied from 13.3 inches to 28.7 inches in length and averaged 19.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLarge Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Lake Mina on an alternate-year frequency to sustain a modest fishery.  Walleye catches in 2014 averaged 5.1 fish/gillnet.  Ten age classes were represented in the population sample.  Age distribution was estimated to extend to age 15.  In contrast to most other gamefishes in Lake Mina, Walleye growth is above average.  Walleye attain a harvestable size of 17.0 inches by age 4.  Average size of Walleyes captured was 18.6 inches.  Angling catch rates may be modest, but Lake Mina can give up memorable-size fish.  The largest Walleye caught during the 2014 survey measured 28.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers fishing Lake Mina may also encounter Muskellunge.  A single Muskellunge stocking occurred in 1971.  A low-density population continues to persist through probable downstream movements from Lobster Lake.  None were captured during the July 2014 fish community assessment.  Five Muskellunge were captured during an ice-out population assessment completed in 2008.  The largest capture measured 47.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCisco, a deep-water fish that prefers cold, well-oxygenated water can be found in Lake Mina.  They are an excellent indicator species of overall water quality. <br> \n <br> \nLake Mina is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels in connected upstream lakes.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Mina.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSeventeen species were collected during this survey.  Four species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Pugnose Shiner) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Mina.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mina Lake is a relatively deep basin with steep drop-offs and a limited littoral zone.  However, thelake provides ample spawning and cover habitat for northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish.  Thelittoral zone is densely covered with a diversity of submergent vegetation.  Chara grows to a depth of24 feet.  Emergent vegetation is present along the entire shoreline and provides good habitat as wellas an effective buffer against nutrient and sediment run-off within the immediate watershed.Northern pike abundance has rebounded from poor reproductive success experienced during the droughtyears in the late 1980's.  Gillnet catches averaged 12.3 fish/net in 1997 compared to 5.0 fish/net in1992.  Gillnet catches averaged 15.3 and 16.9 fish/net in 1987 and 1982, respectively.  Mean weight offish captured in 1997 was 1.5 pounds.  About one-third of the fish were 21 inches in length or greater. Bluegill catches averaged 23.3 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 17.0 to 42.2 fish/netin surveys dating back to 1974.  Approximately 70% of the fish captured were 6 inches in length orgreater, however only one fish exceeded 8 inches in total length.  Electrofishing yielded 42.0largemouth bass per hour.  One-half of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greater, howeverfew exceeded 15 inches.  Walleye catches averaged 2.9 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range ofmean catch rates from similar lakes (1.3 - 5.5 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have ranged from 0.4 to1.4 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1974.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 3.4pounds.  Recent walleye fingerling stockings appear to be relatively ineffective.  Gillnet catches havenot increased significantly since stocking began in 1987 and age class distribution of fish captureddoes not correspond well to years of stocking.  A stocking evaluation following the 1992 populationassessment reached a similar conclusion.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fingerlings were stocked in four out of five years from 1987 to 1992.  The last time fingerlings were stocked in Lake Mina prior to 1987 was in 1953.  There was no increase in Walleye catch rates in gillnets between the 1987 and 1992 surveys despite the fingerling stockings. Average Walleye catch rates were 1.3 fish/net in 1987 and 1.4 fish/net in 1992.  Gillnet catches may not accurately reflect actual Walleye abundance due to the shape of the lake basin.  Local reports would suggest that a viable Walleye fishery exists on Lake Mina.  Northern Pike catch rates averaged 5.0 fish/gillnet in 1992 which is within the normal range (3.3-8.5 fish/net) of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 25.  However, this catch rate is significantly less than the catch rates of 16.9 fish/net and 15.3 fish/net recorded in 1982 and 1987, respectively. Trapnet catch rate was 2.4 fish/net during the special ice out trapnetting assessment in 1992.  Ice-out survey efforts did not result in increased survey efficiency.  Despite the apparent decrease in abundance, size structure of the Northern Pike population has not changed.  PSD was calculated at 24.7% and 26.9% in 1987 and 1992, respectively.  Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gillnets during both surveys was 1.7 pounds.  Northern Pike growth in Lake Mina is similar to the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 25.  Age 4 fish average 21.7 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Many lakes in the Glenwood area have experienced a decline in Northern Pike abundance. Low water levels in 1988-1990 may have reduced available spawning habitat and limited natural reproduction.  The effect of the recent Walleye fingerling stockings on the Northern Pike population is unknown.  Daytime, AC electrofishing yielded 20.0 stock-size Largemouth Bass per hour.  Nighttime, ac electrofishing yielded 69.4 stock-size Largemouth Bass per hour in 1987.  These catch rates cannot be directly compared due to differences in capture efficiency between daytime and nighttime sampling. Size structure of the Largemouth Bass captured during the two surveys is similar.  PSD was calculated at 29.3% and 38.0% in 1987 and 1992, respectively.  Growth of Largemouth Bass in Lake Mina is poor and below the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass is other area lakes within lake class 25.  Age 5 fish average 12.6 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  This slow growth may limit this fishery.  Bluegill catches averaged 17.0 fish/trapnet which is within the normal range (10.5 - 50.6 fish/net) of mean catch rates for lakes within lake class 25.  However, the mean catch rate recorded in 1992 is less than the catch rates of 42.2 fish/net and 36.5 fish/net recorded during surveys in 1982 and 1987, respectively.  PSD increased from 16.2% in 1987 to 25.2% in 1992. The mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 0.1 pounds.  Bluegill growth in Lake Mina is below the mean growth rate for Bluegill in other area lakes within lake class 25.  Age 6 fish average 5.9 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Given poor growth, decline in Bluegill abundance may be beneficial towards reducing competition, increasing growth of individuals, and increasing the average size of fish present.  Yellow Perch are scarce in Lake Mina.  Yellow Perch have never been captured in gillnets.  Trapnet catches have never exceeded 1.0 fish/net.  Cisco are present in moderate numbers and may provide an alternate forage for large Northern Pike and Walleye</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Mina is a 411-acre lake located approximately four miles west of Alexandria.  It is a unique lake with a variety of structure and habitat.  Small bays separated by large expanses of shallow vegetated flats quickly drop into deep water, with a maximum depth of 123 feet.  Most of the shoreline is undeveloped, offering a relatively scenic view with cattails and bulrush lining much of the shoreline.  Prevalent aquatic vegetation in nearshore areas provides habitat for fish and improves water quality.  Water clarity was 12 feet during the 2020 survey.  A public access is located on the north shore off County Road 8.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Mina.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n  \nBass and panfish are common in shallow, vegetated nearshore areas of Lake Mina.  Bluegill grow slow and tend to be small.  Average and maximum lengths were 6.3 and 7.4 inches, respectively.  Few Black Crappie were sampled, but catches of crappie in mid-summer surveys tend to be conservative due to the tendency of crappie to suspend off shore in deeper water during summer months.  Average crappie length was 9.1 inches in 2020.  Largemouth Bass that were captured ranged from 9.1 to 15.8 inches in length.\n \nNorthern Pike are abundant but smaller fish tend to dominate this population.  Average length was just 18.2 inches but larger pike are available.  The largest measured in 2020 was just under 31 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase pike size structure.  Lake Mina is in the North-central Zone, where all pike 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Anglers can keep 10 pike but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches.  For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nWalleye abundance tends to be modest in Lake Mina but it has a reputation for producing large fish.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2020 was just under 30 inches.  Average length was 20.7 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Lake Mina on an alternate-year frequency to supplement this population.\n \nLake Mina is not currently stocked or managed for Muskellunge.  However, a low-density population exists, likely due to downstream movement from Lobster Lake.  One small (19.5 inches) Muskellunge was sampled in 2020.\n   \nOnly one Yellow Perch was sampled.  Other species are likely the main forage in Lake Mina.  Large numbers of minnows and shiners were captured during a recent nearshore fish community survey.  In addition, Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled at record-high levels and provide good forage for large predators. \n\nAdditional species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.\n\nLake Mina is considered an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels in connected upstream lakes.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) can negatively affect lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving any access.  For more information regarding AIS see the following: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/index.html. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mina Lake was conducted on July 5th, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted during the week of July 5th, 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill (61%) and Hybrid Sunfish (12%) comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill (35%), Walleye (16%), Hybrid Sunfish (12%), and Yellow Bullhead (12%) comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. Compared to similar Lake Class 25 lakes, the number and average weight of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile, while Walleye was above the 75% quartile for both metrics. Conversely, the number of Black Crappie and Yellow Perch sampled per net were below the 25% quartile for Lake Class 25 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Mimic Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Mina Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
