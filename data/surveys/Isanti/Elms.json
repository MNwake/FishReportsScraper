                "narrative": "<p>Elms lake is a small, shallow lake located a mile south of Cambridge in central Isanti county.  Public access can be gained from Florence lake through a short, navigable channel.  Both lakes are subject to winterkill due in part to dense growths of aquatic vegetation.  Gamefish are typically stocked into Florence lake following severe winterkills, although fish migration is possible from the Rum river.  Bluegill abundance, 26.4 per trapnet, was higher than the 1993 netting and similar to other lakes in Elms class.  While no bluegill exceeded 8 inches, fish between 7 and 7.5 inches were common.  Night electrofishing to assess largemouth bass was conducted for the first time in 2003.  The catch rate of 24.7 bass per hour exceeeded the lake management goal.  Bass were quality sized with a 1.7 pound average and most fish between 14 and 19 inches.  Northern pike numbers were low in the gillnets with more fish being sampled by the trapnets.  Although not abundant, most northerns were between 25 and 26 inches.  Both yellow perch and black crappie were scarce during the assessment and provide little angling opportunity at this time.  Walleye near 14 inches were present during the night electrofishing but none were sampled in the netting.  Shoreline seining for young of the year gamefish found only largemouth bass present.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>On June 9, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Elms Lake (lake class 36).  Standard netting methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Elms Lake is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  It has never been stocked, although fish migration can occur at anytime via the outlet to Florence Lake.  A partial winterkill during the 1991-92 winter season had altered the fish community in Elms Lake for a short period of years.  Netting results showed this effect, but all former species were present and were rebuilding their abundance levels.  The lake sustains its own fish population very well with the exception of walleyes, which require stocking.          Northern pike abundance was somewhat low since the winterkill but will be improving with each year's spawn.       Lengths ranged from 10.9 to 25.2 inches.  Average weight was 1.4 pounds.          Bluegill abundance was normal with fish ranging from 5.2 to 8.1 inches.  The average length was 7.2 inches weighing about 0.30 pounds each.  This was a respectable size group considering the winterkill effect.  Ages 3-7 were present in the sample.          Black crappie abundance was low with fish ranging from 6.8 to 7.9 inches.  These were all 3 year old fish which might explain the low catch (spawning adults may not have been present immediately following winterkill).  Levels should increase with time.          Largemouth bass were only sampled during shoreline seining, which assesses natural reproduction.  A catch of 8   young-of-year bass were taken indicating that spawning adult bass were present in the lake.          Pumpkinseed abundance was normal for this lake type with fish measuring 4.9 to 6.9 inches.  They were responding well since the winterkill.          Yellow perch abundance was normal with the average being 6.0 inches.  Perch provide a good forage base for the northern pike, something which is needed in a bass-panfish lake to provide a healthy northern pike population.            The remainder of the fish population consisted of black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), carp, green sunfish, hybrid      sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  The bullheads were sampled in normal to high abundances, while the others were found at low levels for this lake type.          Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",
