                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake has undergone significant changes since the last assessmentdone in 1988.  Typically, northern pike abundance is high but catches observed in1994 were the highest ever recorded for a gamefish lake in the Little Falls Area. Yellow perch abundance according to prior surveys was generally low.  Catches in1994, however, increased significantly, opposite of what would be expected withsuch a high number of predators in the lake.     Northern pike numbers were more than 4 times the average when compared tolakes similar to Horseshoe.  Anglers should expect high catch rates of small tomedium sized fish in this lake.  The majority of fish sampled were between 19 and22 inches.  It is probable that this high predator density will eventually causea rapid decline in the yellow perch prey base leading to a decline in northern pikecondition.     Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers during the spring electrofishingassessment.  Individuals from 12 to 18 inches were well represented and shouldprovide good angling opportunity for quality sized fish.     Walleye numbers were down significantly in 1994 despite an intensive stockingeffort from 1979 to 1991.  Of the 8 walleyes caught in the survey, 7 were 10 yearsold indicating poor survival of recently stocked fingerlings.  High northern pikeabundance probably reduced or eliminated stocking success in recent years.  Ifwalleyes are caught by anglers, they are likely to be large.  Average weight offish caught in nets was 4.2 pounds.  Anglers seeking walleye, however, should trytheir luck elsewhere.     Bluegill abundance, as in past assessments, was over 3 times what is normalfor lakes of this type.  This is common in lakes overpopulated with northern pike. Sunfish grew poorly and individuals exceeding 7 inches were few in number.  Higheryellow perch abundance could have a positive impact on bluegill growth by preyingon their young, reducing competition for food.     Black crappie abundance appeared to be down somewhat.  Anglers report crappiesare sometimes caught in winter.  Growth is normal and individuals up to 10.5 incheswere caught in the survey and observed during the spring electrofishing assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Horseshoe Lake is a small, 118 acre lake east of Browerville with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  The lake resides in a watershed that is dominated by agriculture.  Water clarity was fair in the middle of June with a secchi disk reading of 9.1 feet.  The lake has abundant submergent vegetation growth out to a depth of about 18 feet with the most common species being muskgrass, northern milfoil, and sago pondweed.  Sand was the most common shoal water substrate around the lake with muck being common in the bays.  Fisheries management focus on the lake is for northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill. <br> \n    Northern pike was the only specie to show a significant change from the last survey in 2000.  Horseshoe Lake has a history of being a hammerhandle lake and the population continues to be dominated by small fish.  The 2000 survey had shown that the pike population had decreased in abundance from 1994, but the 2006 survey suggests that numbers have once again gone up and are more than twice the normal level for this type of lake.  Anglers can expect high catch rates of small to medium size pike.  The majority of the pike sampled were between 16 and 19 inches in length with the average size being about 18 inches or around 1.4 pounds.  The lake does have the potential to produce large fish as pike up to 36 inches have been measured in previous surveys.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community. <br> \n      Horseshoe Lake has a healthy largemouth bass population.  As in many lakes, small to medium size fish are the most common, although bass up to 18 inches were documented.   Walleye stocking sustains the fishery in the lake and usually occurs in odd-numbered years if the fish are available.  Presently abundance appears to be at the lowest level ever in the lake for walleye but for those anglers lucky enough to hook into one, its likely to a nice fish.  The average walleye seen in the survey was about 22 inches or around 4 pounds.  High pike numbers can reduce survival of juvenile walleye as well as suppress yellow perch abundance.  Yellow perch can be an important prey species for both northern pike and walleye and have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Yellow perch abundance appears to be about the same as in the last survey which was near the lower end of the normal range for this type of lake. <br> \n     Bluegill are abundant in Horseshoe Lake and small fish dominate the population as the average size was about 5 inches.  There were a fair number of bluegill over 7 inches seen in the survey but the survey crew remarked that the large bluegills looked thin.  Anglers also reported catching alot of small bluegills.  Black crappies are also present in the lake but few were seen in the summer survey which was not that unusual.  Crappies are one species that can be difficult to catch with standard lake survey gear. Anglers suggest good winter bites occassionally.  Other panfish species found in the lake include pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish.  The pumpkinseed were not as abundant as the bluegills but some nice size fish up to 8 inches were measured. <br> \n     Brown bullheads were the only bullhead specie caught in this survey with some quality individuals over 12 inches being sampled.  Some past surveys have also caught black bullheads.  Bowfin or dogfish are abundant and can provide anglers with a good fight when hooked.  Bowfin can be an efficient predator on small bluegills.  Another rough fish specie in the lake is white sucker although numbers appear to be low. <br> \n     Neascus or black spot was common on the bluegills, largemouth bass, and northern pike which may make the fish undesirable to anglers.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasites also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infestes. <br> \n     Protecting the lake's water quality should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners and lake association.  Buffer strips along the inlets and around the lake would help reduce nutrient run-off to the lake.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water and the common sense use of lawn fertilizers would also help sustain good water quality by reducing nutrients entering the lake.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie have good websites which provide information for shoreline property owners. <br> \n <br> \nMPCA - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\" <br> \n    www.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html <br> \n <br> \nTodd County - \"information for Shoreline Property Owners\" <br> \n    www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nearshore sampling was performed on Horseshoe Lake July 11 and 12 of 2019 to provide data for calculation of a Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score in conjunction with standard gill net and trap net sampling conducted June 24-26.  Nearshore sampling consists of seining and backpack electrofishing at 10 randomly selected stations evenly spaced along the shoreline.  Data from these efforts were combined to arrive at the FIBI score which is used to assess overall lake health and aquatic life use.  The FIBI uses fish community data to help identify stressors that may be negatively impacting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, derived from several fish community attributes provides an indication of lake health by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake within its classification.   Horseshoe Lake is classified within FIBI Tool 5 for comparative scoring and evaluation.   FIBI calculations resulted in a score of 81 which is above the impairment threshold of 24 and also above the excellent threshold (61) suggesting desirable habitat conditions.   These results indicate that Horseshoe Lake is in exceptional health based on the FIBI score which is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biotic integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 native fish species were observed when combining nearshore data with gill net and trap net results.  One of these species is considered intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter).  No tolerant fish species were sampled.    Bluegill made up a majority of the catch in near shore efforts.  Bluegill were also most abundant in the trap nets and also accounted for the most trap net biomass.  Bluegill and Northern Pike were the most numerous species in the gill nets with Northern Pike comprising the most biomass.  Golden Shiners were the only minnow/cyprinid species captured.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a small, 118 acre lake with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  Water clarity was good in the middle of June with a secchi disk reading of 13 1/2 feet.  The 1994 survey shows the lake as having mostly a sandy shoreline with abundant vegetation growth out to 14 feet.  The lake has a public access on the northeast side of the lake.  Management focus on the lake is for northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegills.     Horseshoe Lake has a history of being a hammerhandle lake.  While northern pike continue to be over abundant when compared to similar type lakes, the 2000 catch rate was a significant decrease from the catch rate seen in 1994.  Anglers can expect high catch rates of small to meduim size pike.  The majority of the fish sampled were between 17 and 22 inches in length.  However, the average size of the pike observed in summer survey  did improved from 17 inches in 1994 to 19 inches in 2000.  A 36-inch pike was measured in the survey indicating the lake has the potenial to produce large fish.       While not as many largemouth bass were sampled the spring electrofishing effort as in 1994, the size structure of the  sample was good.  Bass from 6 to 18 inches were represented with an average size of 10 inches.  Quality size fish up to 18 inches were observed.     The walleye population displayed little change since the 1994 survey.  Abundance remained within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes and all of the 12 fish sampled were over 19 inches in length.  If walleye are caught by anglers, the fish are likely to be large.  Horseshoe Lake has a long history of walleye stocking using both fry and fingerlings with limited success.  The high northern pike numbers likely are responsible for the poor walleye survival.      Yellow perch exhibited a significant decline in numbers since the 1994 survey, which may have been the results of the high northern pike population.   Perch are a primary food fish for many of the larger predator species such as northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.     Bluegills continue to be over abundant despite showing a significant decrease in numbers.  The population appears to be dominated by small fish under 6 inches in length.  Anglers also reported catching small bluegills.  A few bluegills exceeding 7 inches were documented in the survey.  The bluegills in the lake are slow growing and are vulnerable to overharvest by anglers.     Most of the black crappies sampled in 2000 were less than 10 inches in length, however, one 13 1/2 inch crappie was measured.  Standard lake survey gear can be ineffective at sampling crappies in the summer.  A spring assessment targetting crappies may need to be conducted to get a more accurate picture of the crappie population in the lake.     Other fish species in Horseshoe Lake which may provide angling opportunity include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds, and white suckers.  The brown bullhead population displayed some desirable characteristics with abundance within the normal range and fish exceeding 11 inches in length being common.     Despite being a fertile lake, several of the fish populations such as northern pike, bluegills, and yellow perch displayed slow growth.  Slow growth means it takes longer for these fish to reach a size desired by anglers.  It takes 8 to 10 years to replace large sunfish harvested ay anglers.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the small northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger ones to improve pike quality in the lake.  Keeping small pike can also reduce predation on the yellow perch, bass, and juvenile walleye, improving survival of those species.  Release of medium to large fish is necessary to achieve a more balanced fish community.     Horseshoe Lake has an agricultural watershed.  Protecting the lake's water quality should be a high priorty of the lakeshore owners and lake association.  Buffer strips along inlets and around the lake would help reduce nutrient run-off to the lake.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer would also help sustain good water quality by reducing nutrients entering the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 121-acre lake located 7 miles north of Browerville. Data from this latest survey described a gamefish community comprised of overly-abundant, small Northern Pike, a very low-density Walleye population, moderately abundant Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass, and high numbers of small Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2000, pike abundance has gone up. Mean length of fish captured was 20.6 inches. Fifty-five percent of sampled pike were less than 20 inches. The largest pike captured was 31.2 inches. Anglers on Horseshoe Lake are advised to take advantage of the statewide 10 fish Northern Pike bag limit by keeping fish under 22 inches and releasing larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of six Walleyes were netted ranging from 17 to 26 inches in size. Despite several years of fingerling stocking, a good walleye population has not been established. Largemouth Bass are present in decent numbers with fish sampled during electrofishing surveys ranging from 10-17.5 inches. Very few Black Crappie have ever been sampled in Horseshoe Lake. Bluegill on the other hand are very abundant. Summer trap nets caught 86.4 fish/net. Mean length was 5.3 inches and lengths over eight inches are rare. Decent numbers of Yellow Perch are present but are not big enough to provide a desirable fishery. Despite consistently moderate to high Northern Pike densities, perch seem to be sustaining their abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Horseshoe Lake is a quiet little lake that would be good to introduce kids to fishing. Water clarity usually ranges from 8-12 feet and because it's a small lake, it typically doesn't get too rough from the wind so it can be fished using a small boat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Horseshoe Lake is a small, 118 acre lake east of Browerville with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  The lake resides in a watershed that is predominantly agricultural.  Water clarity was good in the middle of June with a secchi disk reading of 15 feet.  The lake has some shallow water bays as well as weedlines to look for fish.  Some anglers were observed fishing from docks both at the public access and the swimming beach.  Fisheries management focus on the lake is for northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill. <br> \n    Northern pike abundance showed an increase since the last survey and anglers can expect high catch rates of small to medium size pike.  While the pike population is dominated by \"hammerhandles\", some nicer fish can be found.  The majority of the pike sampled were between 15 and 19 inches in length with the average size being about 17 inches or around 1 pound.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community. <br> \n      Horseshoe Lake has a healthy largemouth bass population.  As in many lakes, small to medium size fish are the most common, but bass up to 18 inches were documented.   Walleye stocking sustains the fishery in the lake and usually occurs in odd-numbered years if the fish are available.  Presently abundance appears to be at a lower level than desired for the lake but for those anglers lucky enough to hook into one, it's likely to be of decent size.  The average walleye captured in the survey was about 19 inches or around 2.8 pounds.  High pike numbers can reduce survival of juvenile walleye as well as suppress yellow perch abundance.  Yellow perch can be an important prey species for both northern pike and walleye and have also been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Yellow perch abundance appears to be about the same as in the last survey, which was near the lower end of the normal range for this type of lake. <br> \n     Bluegill are abundant in Horseshoe Lake and small fish dominate the population as the average size was about 5 inches.  There were some bluegill over 7 inches noted in the survey but finding them could be a challenge.   Black crappies are also present in the lake but few were seen in the summer survey which was not that unusual.  Crappies can be difficult to catch with standard lake survey gear.  Other panfish species found in the lake include pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish.  The pumpkinseed sunfish were not as abundant as the bluegills but some nice size fish up to 8 inches were measured. <br> \n     Brown bullheads were the only bullhead species caught in this survey with some quality individuals over 12 inches sampled.  Bowfin or dogfish are present and can provide anglers with a good fight when hooked.  Bowfin can be an efficient predator on small bluegills and help to reduce stunting.   <br> \n     Neascus or black spot was common on the bluegill and northern pike which may make the fish less desirable to anglers.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasites also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. <br> \n     Protecting the lake's water quality should be a high priority of the lakeshore owners and lake association.  Buffer strips along the inlets and around the lake would help reduce nutrient run-off to the lake.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water and the common sense use of lawn fertilizers would also help sustain good water quality by reducing nutrients entering the lake.   <br> \n</p>",
