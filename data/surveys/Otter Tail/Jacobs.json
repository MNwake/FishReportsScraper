YEB ABUNDANCE, INDEXED BY A TRAP NET CATCH RATE OF 15.8 PER LIFT, IS 2.4 TIMES GREATER THAN THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE NORMAL RANGE.  YEB RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6 TO 13 INCHES.  TWO LMB WERE SAMPLED IN TRAP NETS FOR A CATCH RATE OF 0.3 PER LIFT, WHICH IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  LMB GROWTH RATES APPEAR TO APPROXIMATE STATEWIDE AVERAGES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT AGE III OF 9.3 INCHES.</p>",
