                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in East Crooked Lake was conducted on August 7, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates East Crooked Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in East Crooked Lake was conducted beginning on July 26th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of July 26th, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed counts per net were between the 25th and 50th quartile, while the Bluegill and Pumpkinseed mean weights were above the 75th quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

It is the deepest of the three Crooked Lakes with a maximum depth of 96 feet.  These lakes were managed as one lake originally, but with roadways dividing them they are now seperate lakes.  The shoal water soils on East Crooked Lake are mainly sand, rubble, boulder, and marl.  Species of fish taken at about equal to or greater than the statewide median number per set were: northern cisco (tullibee), sucker northern pike, perch, walleye, bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and rock bass.This is one of the highly developed lakes in the area with one resort, 18 private cottages, and 34 boats located on the lake.  There were 19 fish houses on this lake during the winter of 1962-63.There is no public access at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County. East Crooked Lake has a surface area of 379 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet. There is a state owned public access located on the north end of the lake off Township Road 13. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. East Crooked is in lake class 23.  These lakes generally have hard water, low littoral area, very deep water and very clear water. <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that East Crooked has an abundant walleye population, with trophy walleyes present. Walleye abundance was above the long term average and the range for similar lakes. Trophy walleyes are found in East Crooked with walleye measured up to 31 inches in 2012. East Crooked is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years, but aging also shows some natural reproduction occurring. <br> \nEast Crooked has tullibee (cisco) and yellow perch that provide an excellent forage base for producing large walleye. Tullibees were sampled in low numbers and yellow perch were sampled in the lowest numbers ever in 2012. <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was just below the normal range for similar lakes, and past surveys have shown similar numbers.  Low numbers are likely due to East Crooked Lake having a lack of shallow, vegetated habitat for spawning and juvenile habitat.  Northern pike had an average length and weight of 24 inches and 3.7 pounds. <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant of the panfish species and anglers will find most of them in the 5-8 inch size range. Bluegill abundance was up from recent surveys and at the high end of the normal range for similar lakes. Black crappies were sampled in low numbers compared to recent surveys, but still in the normal range for similar lakes. Black crappies were sampled up to 11.5 inches in 2012.  <br> \nBoth smallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled; with smallmouth bass abundance increasing in recent years. Smallmouth bass were first sampled in East Crooked during the 2001 survey. Smallmouth bass up to 18.5 inches and largemouth bass up to 18 inches were sampled. <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of pumpkinseed, rock bass, white suckers and yellow bullhead. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in East Crooked Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  East Crooked Lake has a surface area of 365 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north end of the lake.  East Crooked is a clear-water lake with exceptional water quality.  East Crooked is best known for it's walleye population and contains both numbers and good sizes of our state fish.Walleye abundance was up (14.8 walleye/gillnet), higher than past surveys and well above the  \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown that East Crooked has always had abundant walleye population, with gillnet catch rates fluctuating from just above to well above the \"normal\" range.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Big walleyes are found in East Crooked with fish measured up to 30.9 inches.  East Crooked has good populations of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) that provide an excellent forage base for producing large walleye.  In addition to being a forage base, yellow perch are of an acceptable size to provide limited angling.  A successful fingerling stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in East Crooked.  Age analysis showed 90% of the sampled walleye corresponding to stocked years.  East Crooked is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.Low numbers of northern pike are found in East Crooked.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 1.5 pike/gillnet is below the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  Previous surveys have had even lower northern pike abundance.  An exception to this is that surveys in the 1960's showed good numbers of northern pike with pike abundance within the \"normal\" range for this lake class.  One possible explanation for this might be that there was a connection to Middle Crooked Lake in the 1960's.  Middle Crooked Lake has abundant northern pike spawning habitat and there may have been fish movement between these two lakes.  Currently there is a culvert between the two lakes but it is regularly blocked and limits fish movement.  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat in East Crooked Lake.  While northern pike numbers are low, catches of large northern pike are reported by anglers.  Low northern pike numbers and an abundant tullibee (cisco) forage base provide the conditions to produce large pike.While not known as a \"bass-panfish\" lake, these species are found in the East Crooked and do provide limited angling for them.  East Crooked has excellent water  quality and sandy shorelines but has limited areas of submerged aquatic vegetation that bass and panfish prefer.  Black crappie was the most abundant of the panfish species and presently there is a fair number of 9.0 inch crappie in the lake.  Black crappie abundance in East Crooked has cycled, but has generally been at low numbers.  Very low numbers of bluegill were found in East Crooked, similar to past surveys. Fair numbers of largemouth bass were sampled and were concentrated in areas of preferred bass habitat.  Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers with fish measured up to 18.9 inches.  This is the first time that smallmouth bass have been sampled in East Crooked Lake.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker and rock bass, and low numbers of pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (11.25 fish/gillnet and 14.80 lbs/gillnet) were well above the third quartile for lake class 23 of the Schupp Classification System.  Although catches have usually been above the third quartile since 1962, numbers have fluctuated from 1.60 walleye/gillnet to 11.67 walleye/gillnet.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in 1991 was 1.32 lbs.  The present PSD (61), RSD-P (26) and RSD-M (3) indicate a good size structure, with fish attaining large sizes.  Growth rates are good through age 4 (mean length of 16.07 inches) and then decline slightly.  Variability in growth rates may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings as a complement to natural recruits.  Walleye in East Crooked are capable of natural reproduction, as evidenced by the 1987 and 1989 year classes.Catch rates of northern pike (2.5 fish/gillnet and 5.75 lbs/gillnet) fall within the normal range, increasing from low density populations since 1974.  Mean weight of northern pike sampled was 2.56 lbs.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth (20.16 inches at age 5) with high variability within and among year classes.  All northern pike sampled (N=9) were between 20.0 and 28.9 inches long.Pumpkinseed, black crappie and largemouth bass catches were within the normal ranges, while bluegill catches were below the first quartile for lakes of this classification.  Largemouth bass and black crappie populations have fluctuated since 1962.  This apparent fluctuation may be caused by neither species being efficiently sampled with gill or trapnets.  Crappie exhibit good growth, with age 5 fish averaging 9.84 inches.  Pumpkinseed and bluegill abundances were above the third quartile in 1962 and peaked again in 1974 before dropping to their present levels.  Bluegill were removed in 1974.  Pumpkinseed are small, as shown by a PSD of 29.  Bluegill have a better size structure (PSD=57), however, there is a low density of preferred length fish.  Mean length at age 4 is 5.87 inches.Yellow perch catch rates (7.00 fish/gillnet and 1.70 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges in 1991, but have been decreasing since 1969.  The present size distribution is good (PSD=57, RSD-P=14).Catches of black and yellow bullhead were below the first quartile for lakes of this class.  It is difficult to assess population changes because some years all three bullhead species were counted together, however, they never appeared to be a problem.  White sucker and rock bass densities were above the third quartile.  White sucker catches have been above the third quartile since 1981, while rock bass catches have been increasing since then.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  East Crooked Lake has a surface area of 365 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north end of the lake.  East Crooked is a clear-water lake with exceptional water quality.  East Crooked is best known for its walleye population and contains both numbers and good sizes of our state fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  East Crooked is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include; Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, Boot, Spearhead, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that East Crooked has an abundant walleye population.  Walleye abundance (8.4 walleye/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and near the current management goal of 9 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been similar, with gillnet catch rates fluctuating from just above to well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Big walleyes are found in East Crooked with walleye measured up to 31.3 inches.  East Crooked has good populations of tullibee (cisco) and yellow perch that provide an excellent forage base for producing large walleye.  East Crooked is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (3.1 pike/gillnet) was up from past surveys.  Northern pike have been sampled in very low numbers in past surveys, with gillnet catch rates below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.5 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Low pike numbers and an abundant tullibee (cisco) forage base provide the conditions to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a \"bass-panfish\" lake, these species are found in East Crooked and do provide limited angling for them.  East Crooked has excellent water quality and sandy shoreline but has limited areas of submerged aquatic vegetation that bass and panfish prefer.  Black crappie were the most abundant of the panfish species and anglers will find black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance in East Crooked has cycled, but has generally been at low numbers.  Bluegill abundance (7.8 bluegill/trapnet) was up from past surveys and at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill have been sampled in very low numbers in past surveys.  Fair numbers of largemouth bass were sampled, with bass concentrated in areas of preferred bass habitat.  Smallmouth bass abundance is increasing in East Crooked.  Smallmouth bass were first sampled in East Crooked during the 2001 survey.  Smallmouth bass up to 18.4 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of white sucker and rock bass, and low numbers of pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Continue stocking walleye fingerlings if available.  Stocking to be every other year, at the rate of 1.5 pounds fingerlings per littoral acre.  The fingerlings should be 50 fish per pound or larger.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1981.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  East Crooked Lake has a surface area of 365 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  The public access is located on the north end of the lake and is owned and maintained by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  East Crooked Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass (3 miles northeast of Akeley), Benedict (1.5 miles southwest of Benedict), Blue (7 miles north of Park Rapids), Boot (6 miles northwest of Two Inlets), Spearhead (6 miles east of Becida), and Tripp (11 miles southeast of Nevis).     The walleye gillnet catch of 5.5/net is just above the range typically found in lake class 23 (1.0/net - 5.0/net).  Historical gillnet catches have fluctuated from moderate to high numbers of walleye.  The 1974, 1986, and 1991 surveys had high walleye gillnet catches (11.0/net).  The 1962 and 1981 surveys had gillnet catches similar to the 1996 survey (6.0/net - 6.3/net).  The one exception in past surveys was in 1969 when WAE were sampled in low numbers (1.6/net).  A strong year class of 10 to 12 inch walleye were sampled, representing 58% of the catch.   This year class should provide good fishing in a few years when they become an acceptable size to the angler.  East Crooked is known for it's trophy walleye fishery.  Walleye up to 29.8 inches were sampled with 16% of the fish measuring 20.0 inches or larger.  An abundant tullibee (cisco) population (11.8/gillnet), provides an excellent forage base for the walleye.  Walleye growth rates were good, and similar to other class 23 lakes.    Natural reproduction of walleye is occurring in East Crooked, however no strong year classes were observed from years of no walleye stocking.  Only three of the forty-three walleye aged were from years of no stocking.  East Crooked Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even calendar years.       Since the 1970's, East Crooked Lake has had a low northern pike population.  Northern pike were not sampled during the 1996 survey.  This is the first time in seven surveys that northern pike were not sampled.  The two previous surveys had low northern pike gillnet catches; 2.3/net (1991) and 0.3/net (1986).  The northern pike gillnet catches were much higher in 1962 (6.2/net) and 1969 (6.8/net).  One possible explanation for this might be that there was a connection to Middle Crooked Lake in the 1960's.  Middle Crooked has abundant northern pike spawning habitat and there may have been fish movement between the two lakes.  At the present time there is no connection to Middle Crooked.  There is a culvert between the lakes, however, it has long been blocked by sand.  Northern pike numbers are limited by lack of preferred marshy spawning habitat in East Crooked Lake.  While northern pike numbers are low, large northern pike are reported in East Crooked Lake by anglers.  Low northern pike numbers and an abundant tullibee (cisco) forage base provide the conditions for a trophy northern pike lake.     Yellow perch were sampled at 4.8/gillnet, within the range typically found for lake class 23 (1.5/net - 13.8/net).  The previous survey in 1991 had a similar yellow perch gillnet catch, while historical catches have fluctuated greatly, from 0.0/net (1974) to 109.0/net (1969).  Yellow perch not only provide an additional forage base for the walleye population, but are of an acceptable size to provide a fishery to the angler.  Yellow perch had an average length of 8.1 inches, with fish measured up to 11.1 inches.     Bluegill abundance was low (3.9/trapnet), below the range typically found for lake class 23 (7.7 - 43.4).  The three previous surveys had similar trapnet catches (5.8/net - 6.1/net).  Bluegill trapnet catches were much higher in 1962 (83.6/net) and 1974 (36.2/net).  A possible explanation for this might the same as mentioned before, that there was a connection between Middle and East Crooked Lakes allowing fish movement.  Middle Crooked has ideal sunfish spawning habitat.  Bluegill averaged 6.3 inches in length with fish measured up to 8.5 inches.  Bluegill exhibited good growth rates, above the average lengths of other class 23 lakes.     Seventeen largemouth bass were sampled using standard survey gear.  Largemouth bass up to 12.0 inches were sampled.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance of size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on East Crooked Lake.  East Crooked Lake has excellent water quality and enough aquatic vegetation to insure a low level largemouth bass population.      One black crappie was sampled (0.1/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 23.  However, summertime sampling of black crappie can be variable due to crappie suspending in deeper water.  Historical catches have ranged from 0.0/net (1974) to 4.4/net (1981).  Anglers have reported large crappies being caught in past years.     Four burbot (eelpout) were sampled in the gillnets (0.5/net).  Burbot ranged in length from 22.4 to 29.6 inches.     Other species sampled in low numbers were pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and golden shiner.  White sucker catches were above the range typically found in lake class 23.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table far, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in East Crooked Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked Lake is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  East Crooked has a surface area of 379 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  There is a state owned public access located on the north end of the lake off Heritage Road.  East Crooked is a clear-water lake with exceptional water quality.  East Crooked is best known for its Walleye population, but also provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  East Crooked is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally clear, deep lakes with hard water and a small littoral zone (area of lake less than 15 feet in depth).  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Blue, Boot, and Eleventh Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that East Crooked supports a healthy Walleye population.  Anglers will find good numbers of Walleye in the 14-20 inch size range.  Big Walleyes are found in East Crooked with Walleye measured up to 30.9 inches.  East Crooked has populations of Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch that provide an excellent forage base for producing large Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nEast Crooked has a low Northern Pike population composed of medium to large-sized fish.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.41 to 37.0 inches.  Low Northern Pike numbers and a Tullibee (Cisco) forage base provide the conditions to produce large Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a \"bass-panfish\" lake, East Crooked does supply angling opportunities for these species.  Anglers will find a moderate Smallmouth Bass and a low to moderate Largemouth Bass population in East Crooked.  The abundant sandy and gravel areas of East Crooked are more suited for Smallmouth Bass, while East Crooked has limited areas of submerged aquatic vegetation that Largemouth Bass and Panfish prefer. Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass up to 20.5 inches were sampled.  East Crooked supports a moderate Panfish population, comprised of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range and Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in East Crooked.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Crooked is located five miles north of Nevis in central Hubbard County.  East Crooked has a surface area of 379 acres and a maximum depth of 96 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the north end of the lake off Heritage Road.  East Crooked is a clear-water lake with exceptional water quality.  East Crooked is best known its Walleye population, but also provides opportunities for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  East Crooked is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally clear, deep lakes with hard water and a small littoral zone (area of lake less than 15 feet in depth).  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Blue, Boot, and Eleventh Crow Wing Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that East Crooked supports a healthy Walleye population.  Anglers will find good numbers of Walleye in the 14-20 inch size range.  Big Walleyes are found in East Crooked with Walleye measured up to 31.1 inches.  East Crooked has a Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch populations that provide an excellent forage base for producing large Walleye.  Yellow Perch numbers have been down in recent surveys. <br> \n <br> \nEast Crooked has a low to moderate Northern Pike population composed of medium to large-size fish.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.8 inches and 2.1 lbs with fish measured up to 26.9 inches.  Low to moderate Northern Pike numbers and a Tullibee (Cisco) population provide the conditions to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not know as a \"bass-panfish\" lake, East Crooked does supply angling opportunities for these species.  Anglers will find moderate to high Smallmouth Bass population and moderate Largemouth Bass population in East Crooked.  Good numbers of Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass in the 12-15 inch size range were sampled with Smallmouth Bass sampled up to 20.7 inches.  East Crooked supports a moderate panfish population comprised of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  The Black Cappie population in East Crooked fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Black Crappie up to 13.7 inches were sampled.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-7 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in East Crooked.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals form their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",
