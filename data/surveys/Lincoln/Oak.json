                "narrative": "<p>Oak Lake is a shallow, nutrient rich, 99 acre lake in Lincoln County in southwestern Minnesota.  It has two basins that are separated by a highway.  Some fish movement can occur between the basins through a culvert under the road.  No designated public access exists and angling access is gained from the road right-of-way.  The lake is managed for walleye and yellow perch.     Periodic partial winterkills appear to be severely restricting establishment of a walleye population.  Winterkills occurred the winters of 1992-1993, 1993-1994, and 1996-1997.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997.  Assessment netting was conducted in 1993, 1994, and 1997.  Only one adult walleye has ever been sampled (1993).  In 1997, 47 young-of-year walleye were caught, but no older fish were sampled.  Older walleye probably did not survive the 1996-1997 winterkill.  Oak Lake contains sufficient forage to maintain a walleye population.  Walleye stockings will be continued in an effort to create at least a periodic walleye fishery at this lake.     Yellow perch were abundant in 1997 and most of them measured 5-9 inches.  Young-of-year through age three perch were present, but the majority of them were from the 1995 year class.  Yellow perch are well suited for Oak Lake's habitat, and they've been very successful at surviving winterkill conditions.     Black bullhead were also abundant in 1997, but they were on the small side.  The majority of them measured 4-7 inches.  Black bullhead can reach a desirable size in this lake.  This was apparent during a 1994 winterkill investigation when bullhead were abundant from 5-11 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oak Lake is a shallow, nutrient rich lake located in Lincoln County in southwestern Minnesota.  The lake     is presently managed for walleye and yellow perch.  Despite 1990 and 1992 walleye stockings, only one walleye     was sampled during the 1993 assessment.  The near absence of walleye was probably due to winterkill conditions     that occurred during the 1992-93 winter, and possibly in part due to predation of young walleye by black     bullhead and yellow perch.  Walleye fry will continue to be stocked during even numbered years with hopes of     producing a moderate walleye population.  If annual winter oxygen monitoring shows that winterkill is a     frequent problem, aeration will be necessary or walleye stockings will be discontinued. Yellow perch were abundant with a good size range of fish present as can be seen in the preceding length-     frequency distribution.  Young of year up through age five perch were present.  The majority of adult perch     were noted in the west basin, however young of year fish were numerous in both basins and perch appear to be     maintaining their population quite well.  A local resident commented during the 1993 survey that a large     number of yellow perch winterkilled in the east basin during the 1992-93 winter. Black bullhead were also abundant, but their numbers were down substantially from levels noted during a     1989 lake survey.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oak is a small, shallow lake located north of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  The lake is separated into two basins by Lincoln County Road 5.  A culvert allows for fish passage between the basins in years of normal water levels.  Both basins were sampled and similar fish species composition was found during the survey.     Periodic winterkill limits the fisheries potential of Oak Lake. Winterkills were documented in 1992, 1993 and 1996.  Oxygen monitoring conducted in February, 2001, also indicated a possible winterkill.  An ice-out investigation will be conducted in 2001 to evaluate the extent of the probable winterkill.    The Oak Lake fishery is managed for walleye and yellow perch.  Prior to the 2000 survey, assessments had documented only one adult walleye.  Young-of-year walleye had been sampled, but failed to recruit.  This was likely due to frequent winterkill.     Walleye were abundant in 2000 and three age classes were present.  Winter monitoring documented adequate oxygen present from 1997-2000, resulting in walleye survival.  Walleye ranged from 11.0-19.7 inches, with the majority 16.0-19.0 inches.     Approximately 50,000 walleye fry are stocked into Oak Lake annually.  Fall electrofishing indicated a weak or absent 2000 year class.  Fry stocking is solely responsible for maintaining the Oak Lake walleye fishery.  Fair spawning habitat is available in Oak Lake.  If walleye are able to reach maturity, natural reproduction may also contribute.     Yellow perch were moderately abundant.  Gill net catch rates were slightly above the expected range.  Most perch were small (less than 8.0 inches).  However, a fishable population of 9.0-10.5 inch fish was also present.     Other species present included abundant black bullhead and moderately abundant green sunfish.  The vast majority of bullhead were less than 7.0 inches and would not offer a quality fishing opportunity.     The Oak Lake fishery was in good shape.  However, winterkill likely occurred during the winter of 2001 and reduced or eliminated the existing fish population.  If a severe winterkill occurred, Oak Lake will be utilized as a walleye rearing pond.  Walleye fry will be stocked annually.  Walleye fingerlings will be harvested during the fall.  If walleye are able to survive and create a fishery, the angling public will be informed and encouraged to utilize the resource.      </p>",
