                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irving is a 613-acre lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet.  The lake is located within the city limits of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. It is upstream from Lake Bemidji via the Mississippi River. There is a city-owned public access on the north side of the lake east of the outlet.  Boats can also navigate upstream from many accesses on Lake Bemidji. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Irving is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Long, Moose, Rice, Three Island and Minerva Lakes. Typically lakes in this class are shallow and regularly shaped with high percentage of the lake 15 feet or less in depth. The species managed for are walleye, northern pike and yellow perch.Because the Mississippi River flows through Lake Irving, migration of fish occurs into and out of the lake, particularly muskellunge, northern pike and walleye occurs and is likely to influence the population of these species at different times of the year.  A radio telemetry study to track walleye is currently being conducted as a cooperative project with Bemidji State University. This will hopefully give us a better understanding of the movement of walleye in the different lakes and river and identify critical spawning habitats.  Even though there is a free interchange of fish between Irving and Bemidji, the two lakes have distinct fish communities.Anglers have a diversity of angling opportunities on Irving Lake.  Anglers can fish for the different panfish species or try their luck at the larger predator fish such as walleye and northern pike. Irving Lake is one of the first lakes in the area to freeze over and safely fish on in the winter.  Northern pike are abundant in Irving and should provide anglers with much action. Pike ranged in length from 12 to 37 inches with an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.2 pounds. There has been a decline in the number of northern pike over 28 inches since the 1990 survey. The decline in pike size is typical of a trend in many area lakes and is likely the result of angling harvest.There are good numbers of walleye in Irving Lake. There numbers probably vary throughout the year depending on the seasonal movement of walleye during spawning. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 8 to 26 inches with an average length and weight of 15 inches and 1.2 pounds. Eleven different year classes were sampled and all are the result of natural reproduction.The primary food fish for predators is yellow perch.  Abundance is typical of other class 39 lakes and similar to what was found in 1990.  There were many quality-sized perch sampled which would interest anglers.Lake whitefish, a species not typically found in this lake class,  were sampled for the first time in Lake Irving.  The presence of whitefish illustrates the influence of the connection to Lake Bemidji on this fish community.  The average length and weight was 21 inches and 4 pounds.The most abundant species of the sunfish family found in Irving is rock bass with fish up to 11 inches in length.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and largemouth bass are present but in have lower abundance. Anglers seeking bullheads can have good luck angling for this often overlooked species.  Brown and yellow bullhead were moderately abundant with fish up to 14 inches sampled.Development in the form of new homes continues to occur on all lakes but, due to the urban location, is especially prevalent on Irving Lake.  Shoreline development can negatively affect water quality and can impact aquatic habitat necessary for fish at various life stages.  Undeveloped shoreline is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  Shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young. Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Lake Irving is also needed to maintain water quality. Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Lake Irving since most of the lakeshore is privately owned.  While future shoreline development may be inevitable, there are ways to minimize disturbances to sensitive aquatic habitats.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irving is a 661-acre lake, located within the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. A targeted survey was completed on Lake Irving by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2022 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 11 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at 13 sites. A total of 28 species were sampled, which included 8 species that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2022 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lake Irving. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov).  <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Lake Irving is in great health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irving is a natural lake on the Mississippi River system located within the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There is a considerable amount of lakeshore development due to the immediacy of the downtown area and numerous lake homes.  There is a public water access located on the north end of the lake adjacent to the city's wastewater treatment facility.  The lake is easily accessible from Lake Bemidji via a short trip up the Mississippi River, although boaters should navigate with caution in the area of the river channel and outlet of Lake Irving due to old railroad pilings that are still present.  The lake's direct connectivity with Lake Bemidji and the river system is beneficial to fish populations due to seasonal movements of species such as walleye and northern pike.  Lake Irving has a maximum depth of 19 feet and is known as a good early season lake in both the open and hard-water fishing seasons. <br> \n <br> \nLake Irving's walleye population is sustained primarily through natural reproduction and migration which both occur throughout the Mississippi Headwaters system.  The 2012 population assessment documented a healthy walleye population in Lake Irving (similar to Lake Bemidji) with a catch rate of 14.56 fish/gill net, which is well above the statewide normal range for class 39 lakes.  Average length and weight of the 2012 walleye sample was 13.8 inches and 0.95 pounds, with a good proportion of \"eater\" size walleye from 12 to 16 inches in length.  An abundance of young walleye from age-1 through age-3 indicates successful reproduction and good potential for walleye fishing in the near term. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill inhabit Lake Irving in low numbers with some quality-size individuals present in the population.  The black crappie catch rate of 1.0 fish/trap net is just within the normal range for lake class.  Black crappie up to 14.2 inches in length were captured in 2012, with a good representation of younger fish in the sample indicating recent reproduction.  Bluegill, which were sampled in very low numbers in previous assessments, appear to be expanding their population in Lake Irving.  The 2012 catch rate of 12.38 fish/trap net is up from 0.67 fish/trap net in 2001 and is now within the normal range for lake class.  Bluegill up to 9.5 inches in length were captured in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at 6.44 fish/gill net, which is within the normal range for lake class.  Average length and weight of the northern pike sample was 20.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  There has been a decline in the proportion of northern pike greater than 30 inches in length, which is occurring on many lakes in the area.  Anglers can help reverse this trend by releasing northern pike over 24 inches in length and keeping smaller pike for table fare.   <br> \nOther species present in the 2012 assessment included pumpkinseed, bullhead species, redhorse species, white sucker, rock bass, yellow perch and largemouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Irving is a 661-acre, heavily developed natural lake located in southern Beltrami County, within the city of Bemidji, and on the Mississippi River. Irving has an average water clarity of 2 feet and a maximum depth of 19 feet. Lake Irving has an inlet via the Mississippi River located on the southern shore and an outlet located on the northern shore, connecting to Lake Bemidji. A public access is located near the outlet on the north shore, adjacent to the Bemidji wastewater treatment facility. Boaters can access the lake from Lake Bemidji via the Mississippi River, but should use cation while navigating the river channel due to current bridge structures and old railroad pilings. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Lake Irving in 2022 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Muskellunge, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye lengths ranged from 7 to 25 inches and averaged around 16 inches. Walleye abundance decreased from 2012, was below the lake's historical average, but still within the typical range for lakes with similar morphological characteristics. The Walleye population is likely sustained from upstream and downstream movement of fish from connected lakes and natural reproduction. A total of 11 year classes were captured, with the 2018 year class being the most abundant. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was below average for the lake but within the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 41 inches and averaged 23 inches. Fifty-two percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low and within the normal range for this lake type. Bluegill lengths averaged 4 inches, with the largest being 6 inches. It is recommended that anglers keep smaller sunfish and release the larger fish to help improve and maintain the population's size structure. In addition, a few Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were captured, which is similar to previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are considered important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Yellow Perch abundance was slightly below average and lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches. Other species sampled during the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Greater Redhorse, Muskellunge, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, Lake Irving is infested with Zebra Mussels, an aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
