Largemouth bass were also captured with the largest individual being only 13.7 inches long. Good growth rate was observed for both species. Bluegill were captured in normal numbers with the average size being 6.4 inches in length. Black crappie averaged less than 7.0 inches long. Growth for both species was found to be slow. Forage species such as yellow perch and golden shiner were present in above average numbers, but averaged only 6.0 inches in length. Black and yellow bullhead were also present in normal abundance and averaged 9.3 and 10.4 inches in length, respectively. Pike Lake winterkills periodically, but is restocked by the normal movement of fish from Eagle Lake. Only extremely low water levels would function as a barrier to fish movement between the two basins.</p>",
