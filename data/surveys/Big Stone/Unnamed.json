                "narrative": "<p>Botkers lake is a small prairie lake in west-central Minnesota that is managed primarily for walleye with secondary emphasis on yellow perch.  Walleye fry are stocked during even numbered years.  The walleye catch of ten per gill net was down considerably from the catch of 48 per gill net in 1991, but it satisfied the long range goal of at least ten per gill net, and was well within the normal range for similar lakes.  Ninety-five percent of the walleye were from the 1992 year class (stocked year), and these fish ranged in size from 8-12 inches.     Yellow perch were abundant with gill net and trap net catches well above their normal ranges for similar lakes and noticeably higher than catches in 1991.  Fish from four consecutive year classes were present and the majority of them were from 4-7 inches.     The catch of black bullhead and carp was down considerably from 1991 and abundances of these species were normal to below normal.  The majority of the black bullhead were decent sized, ranging from 8-10 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Botkers is a small, productive lake located 2 miles west of the city of Clinton in Big Stone County.  An unimproved gravel access off of Big Stone County Road 35 can be utilized to gain access to Botkers Lake.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 2000.  Trap net catch rates were the second highest recorded.  Although fish up to 24.5 inches were caught, the vast majority were less than 12.0 inches (88%).  Growth rates were slow until age 4 and average after that.  Limited forage availability is the likely reason for slow growth rates.  Once fish obtain sizes to utilize available forage, growth rates accelerate.     Approximately 10,000 walleye fry are stocked every other year.  The 2000 stocking was cancelled due to poor growth rates.  Fall electrofishing was conducted to assess the abundance of young-of-year walleye (YWAE).  Zero YWAE were caught per electrofishing hour, indicating an absent or weak year class.  Available data strongly suggests that stocking is primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.     Yellow perch were caught in low abundance in 2000.  Perch ranged equally in size from 7.0-9.9 inches.  Young-of-year perch were also found in low abundance.  Limited forage availability is probably increasing predation on yellow perch.     Black and white crappie were both documented for the first time on Botkers Lake.  Their presence is likely the result of unauthorized stocking.  Although few adults of either species were caught, abundant young-of-year of both were present.   Future assessments will evaluate the survival and growth of these species as well as their impact on other game fish.     Black bullhead were moderately abundant.  They ranged in size from 8.5-11.8 inches and offer a quality fishing opportunity.  Few young-of-year bullhead were documented, likely due to high predation by walleye.     Low abundance of carp and orangespotted sunfish were also documented during the 2000 population assessment.       Management plans for Botkers Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and ice house counts, stocking 10,000 walleye fry in odd numbered years, annual fall electrofishing to assess YWAE abundance, and population assessments every third year to evaluate management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Botker's Lake is located two miles west and three miles north of Clinton in Big Stone County.  It is a small, highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet and a surface area of approximately 40 acres.  A public concrete boat ramp, parking area and fishing pier are located along the northeast corner. <br> \n     The lake can provide good fishing for Walleye, Black Crappie, White Crappie, Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead.  These species were present in moderate to high numbers in 2016.  Walleye typically have experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Walleye are stocked when conditions are suitable, taking into consideration the existing Walleye population, Walleye condition, and available forage.  During this 2016 fish survey, Walleye were caught from five year classes with fish measuring 8-26 inches. <br> \n     Natural reproduction and good growth maintains respectable populations of Black and White Crappies, and Yellow Perch.  Crappies averaged 7 inches and ranged from 4-10 inches.  Yellow Perch averaged 7 inches and ranged from 5-11 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Botkers Lake is a small (36 acres) class 40 lake located west of Clinton in Big Stone County.  This small lake is managed to provide fishing opportunities for walleye, crappie and yellow perch.  \n\nCompared to 2003, crappie are more abundant and larger.  Crappie averaged almost 9 inches long and about 0.4 lb.  \n\nWalleye abundance has declined significantly since 2003.  The walleye that were sampled averaged 14.6 inches long and 1.95 lbs. with the largest walleye sampled being slightly longer than 29 inches and 12 years old.  The large decline in walleye abundance can be attributed to the disappearance of the 2001 year-class.  Of the 73 walleyes aged during the 2003 survey, 96% were from the 2001 year-class.  However, in 2006, only one fish was sampled that was from the 2001 year-class.  It is likely angler harvest and, to a lesser extent, natural mortality reduced the number of walleye present from this strong year-class.  Past evaluations have shown that walleye stocked as fry into Botkers Lake grow slowly due to a lack of suitable forage.  Therefore, since 2003, the use of adult, yearling, and fingerling walleye stockings has been implemented.  Future assessments will allow the evaluation of these stockings.    \n\nYellow perch abundance also declined in 2006, but size increased.  Several year classes (2001, 2003, and 2004) were present with perch averaging 7.7 inches long and 0.3 lb.\n    \nAdult black bullhead appear to be not as abundant as 2003, but a large number of young-of-year bullheads were sampled, indicated a possible strong 2006 year-class.  Abundance of common carp appeared similar to 2003.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were first sampled in 2003, but their establishment in the lake appears to have been unsuccessful as neither species were sampled during this survey.  Other species sampled were orangespotted sunfish and white sucker.  \n\nFuture plans for Botkers Lake include winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and ice-house counts, fish stocking, and fishery surveys.</p>",

This small lake is managed to provide fishing opportunities for walleye, crappie and yellow perch.  This special assessment was conducted to evaluate the abundance of young-of-year (YOY) walleye.  Walleye fry were not stocked in Botkers in the spring of 2007, and no YOY walleye were sampled during electrofishing.  However, numerous YOY yellow perch (428 per hour of electrofishing) and YOY crappie (643 per hour of electrofishing) were sampled.  To supplement the walleye population, 362 adult and 12 fingerling walleye were stocked in the spring and fall of 2008, which may provide future angling opportunities.  Future management activities include monitoring of dissolved oxygen levels, fishing pressure counts, and a population assessment in 2009.</p>",

OSS, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY SAMPLED ONLY BY SHORELINE SEINING, APPEARED IN TRAP NETS IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  OF THE NON-GAME SPECIES SAMPLED, ONLY BLB CATCH CATCH RATES CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE 1988 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY, DECREASING BY 57% IN GILL NETS AND 23% IN TRAP NETS.  DESPITE THESE DECREASES, 1991 CATCH RATES WERE STILL 10.4 TIMES THE STATE AND 5.7 TIMES THE LOCAL GILL NET CPUE MEDIANS.  MEAN TOTAL LENGTH OF BLHS FROM GILL NETS AND TRAP NETS COMBINED INCREASED FROM 5.4 TO 6.6 INCHES WHILE THE RANGE OF TOTAL LENGTHS DECREASED BY 4.5 INCHES WHEN COMPARED TO THE 1988 INITIAL SURVEY.  IN 1991, FEWER BLHS UNDER 5.5 INCHES AND OVER 8.0 INCHES WERE PRESENT IN THE FISHERY THAN IN 1988. ALTHOUGH SPECIFIC AGES OF BLHS WERE NOT DETERMINED 99% OF BLHS SAMPLED IN 1991 APPEAR TO BE FROM A SINGLE YEAR CLASS.  THESE FISH ARE NOT OF AN ANGLER ACCEPTABLE, OR COMMERCIALLY MARKETABLE, SIZE.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF YEP SAMPLED FROM COMBINED GEAR TYPES IN THE 1991 POPULATION ASSESSMENT DECREASED BY 47% FROM 1988 INITIAL SURVEY LEVELS.  CATCH RATES DECREASED IN TRAP NETS FROM 17.5 FISH AND 1.6 POUNDS PER SET TO 6.5 FISH AND 0.8 POUNDS PER SET, WHILE GILL NET CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM THE 1988 INITIAL SURVEY CATCH RATE OF 2.5 FISH AND 0.3 POUNDS PER SET TO 8.0 FISH AND 2.0 POUNDS PER SET.  CATCH PER EFFORT RATES IN 1991 WERE IDENTICAL TO STATE MEDIANS AND 20% BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILL NET CATCHES AND 4.3 TIMES STATE AND 9.3 TIMES LOCAL MEDIANS FOR TRAP NET CATCHES.  TOTAL LENGTHS OF YEP SAMPLED IN COMBINED GEAR TYPES RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 10.1 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 6.8 INCHES AND A MEAN WEIGHT PER FISH OF 0.2 POUNDS.  THIS WAS AN INCREASE IN MEAN LENGTH OF 1.4 INCHES FROM THE 1988 INITIAL SURVEY SAMPLE.  YEP SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION REPRESENTED FIVE YEAR CLASSES, 1990 THROUGH 1986.  FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PERCH SAMPLED IN 1991 WERE FROM THE 1990 (AGE 1+) YEAR CLASS.  38% PERCENT WERE FROM THE 1989 (AGE 2+) YEAR CLASS.  THE YEAR CLASSES FROM 1988 (AGE 3+) THROUGH 1986 (AGE 5+) MADE UP ONLY 12% OF THE SAMPLE.  GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST THROUGH AGE THREE, THEN DECREASED TO AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE MEDIANS FOR YEP GROWTH. NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF YEP WAS DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THE 1988 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY WHEN 795 YOUNG OF THE YEAR YEP PER ACRE WERE SAMPLED IN 0.2 ACRES OF SHORELINE SEINING.  IN 1991, ONLY ONE ADULT YEP WAS SAMPLED WITH IDENTICAL SEINING EFFORT.  WHILE NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO BE SUPPORTING A PERCH POPULATION, VARIOUS FACTORS MAY BE INFLUENCING YEAR CLASS STRENGTH.  A STRONG WAE POPULATION AND THE LOW DIVERSITY AND DENSITY OF THE FORAGE BASE MAY FOCUS PREDATION UPON THE YEP. INCREASED ANGLING PRESSURE AND HARVEST OF OLDER, LARGER PERCH MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE PERCH FISHERY IN A LAKE OF THIS SIZE.  CATCH RATES OF WAE INCREASED BY 47% IN GILL NETS AND 50% IN TRAP NETS WHEN COMPARED TO THE 1988 INITIAL SURVEY. CURRENT RATES WERE 13.2 TIMES STATE AND 17 TIMES LOCAL GILL NET MEDIANS AND 3 TIMES BOTH STATE AND LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIANS.  A TOTAL OF 101 WAE WEIGHING 162 POUNDS WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  TOTAL LENGTHS FROM COMBINED GEAR TYPES RANGED FROM 10.5 TO 22.9 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 15.3 INCHES AND A MEAN WEIGHT PER FISH OF 1.6 POUNDS.  THIS WAS DECREASE IN MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF 3.3 INCHES AND 1.1 POUNDS COMPARED TO THE 1988 INITIAL SURVEY.  THE 1991 WAE AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION INCLUDED FISH FROM THE 1990 (AGE 1+) THROUGH 1986 (AGE 5+) YEAR CLASSES. HISTORICALLY, IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ORIGIN OF VARIOUS WAE YEAR CLASSES DUE TO THE UNAUTHORIZED STOCKING OF WAES INTO BOTKERS LAKE AND THE FACT THAT NO YOUNG OF THE YEAR WAE HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN TWO MDNR INVESTIGATIONS.  THE 1989 (AGE 2+) AND 1987 (AGE 4+) YEAR CLASSES APPEAR TO BE THE PRODUCT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE 1990 (AGE 1+) YEAR CLASS IS THE PRODUCT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR SURVIVAL FROM A DOCUMENTED 1990 FINGERLING STOCKING.  GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE 1988.  WHEN COMPARED TO A STATE MEDIAN THEY EXCEED WHAT IS CONSIDERED AS FAST GROWTH FOR WAE.  VARIOUS MORTALITY FACTORS INCLUDING INCREASED ANGLING PRESSURE AND HARVEST MAY HAVE ALTERED THE WAE POPULATION STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT SINCE THE 1988 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY.  71% OF THE WAE SAMPLED IN 1988 WERE REPRESENTED BY THE 1986 (AGE 2+) AND 1985 (AGE 3+) YEAR CLASSES.  IN THE 1991 WAE AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION, THE 1985 WAE YEAR CLASS WAS ABSENT AND THE 1986 YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED ONLY 3% OF THE WAE SAMPLED.</p>",

These species were present in moderate to high numbers during 2012.  Walleye typically have experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Walleye are stocked when conditions are suitable based on the existing walleye population, walleye condition, and available forage.  Walleye were present in 2012 from five year classes with fish measuring 8-21 inches. <br> \n     Good natural reproduction maintains the populations of crappie and yellow perch.  The majority of the crappie were smaller measuring 6-9 inches, whereas yellow perch were 4-6 and 7-10 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Botkers Lake is a small prairie lake in west-central Minnesota that is managed for walleye and yellow perch.  Anglers primarily fish the lake from a road right-of-way or by launching small boats from a private access.  1997 assessment netting revealed a high walleye population.  Young-of-year fish measuring 2-3 inches and one year old fish measuring 5-8 inches were abundant.  Lower numbers of three year old walleye were also present and they measured 14-18 inches.  Fry stocking appears to be responsible for maintaining the walleye population, and fry are stocked two of three years.  Yellow perch and black bullhead were also present, however their numbers were too low to provide good fishing.</p>",

It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet and a surface area of 40 acres.  A public access exists in the northeast corner that includes a parking area, concrete boat ramp and fishing pier.  One-quarter mile of shore fishing access is present along county road 35. This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical survey data from Botkers Lake. <br> \n     Botkers Lake can provide good fishing for Walleyes, Black Crappies, White Crappies, Yellow Perch and Black Bullheads.  These species were present in moderate to high numbers in 2019.  Walleyes typically have experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained by stocking.  Walleyes from five year classes were caught.  They ranged in size from 7-26 inches, with most in the 10-14 inch range.  Crappies and Yellow Perch have maintained populations through natural reproduction.  Crappies were 4-11 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Yellow Perch were 5-9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Botkers is a 36 acre lake located near the city of Clinton in west-central Minnesota.  An unimproved gravel access of Big Stone County Road 35 can be used to gain access to Botkers Lake.     Walleye were abundant in 2003.  Although most walleye sampled were small, measuring 8-10 inches, individuals up to 26 inches were also sampled.       Until recently, walleye fry were stocked into Botkers Lake every other year.  However, due to recent poor survival and slow growth of stocked fry, 6-10 inch adult walleye were stocked during the spring of 2003.  Prior to stocking, these walleye were marked by clipping their left pelvic fin.  The spring stocking accounted for the 100 percent of the small walleye sampled during the 2003 assessment.  Although growth for these walleye continued to be slow, many 10-13 inch walleye should be present by the winter of 2004.     Black and white crappie were also abundant.  Most crappie measured 6-8 inches and were growing slowly.  Slow growth could be attributed to competition for limited forage.  Considering slow growth, most crappie should measure 7-9 inches by 2004.     Yellow perch were sampled in low abundance.  Sampled perch were small and would not draw much angler interest.  Predaton by walleye will likely limit the expansion of yellow perch for the near future.      Other species sampled included low numbers of black bullhead, common carp, bluegill, orangespotted sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Black bullhead mostly measured 9-11 inches.  This was the first time bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in Botkers Lake.  Young-of-year of either specie were not sampled and it was unclear whether self-sustaining populations were present.     Management activities scheduled for Botkers Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and ice-house counts, stocking as needed, and a fishery survey in 2006.</p>",

A DNR public access is present that includes a concrete boat ramp and a fishing pier.  Botkers Lake is managed to provide fishing for walleye, crappie and yellow perch.  Walleye yearlings and adults are routinely stocked because walleye rarely reproduce in this lake.  High populations of crappie and yellow perch were present in 2009.  Anglers reported good fishing for crappies and walleye.</p>",

It is a highly productive lake with a surface area of 40 acres and maximum depth of 19 feet.  A public access exists in the northeast corner that includes a parking area and concrete boat ramp.  One-quarter mile of shore fishing access is present along county road 35. The 2022 targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical survey data from Botker's Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBotkers Lake can provide good fishing for Walleyes, Black Crappies, White Crappies, Yellow Perch and Black Bullheads.  These species were present in moderate to high numbers in 2022.  Walleyes have experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained by stocking.  In 2022, they ranged in size from 9-27 inches, with most in the 12-14 inch range.  Crappies and Yellow Perch have maintained populations through natural reproduction.  Crappies were 4-11 inches and averaged 9 inches.  Yellow Perch were 5-11 inches and averaged 8 inches. <br> \n</p>",
