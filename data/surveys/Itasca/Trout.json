                "narrative": "<p>Little Trout Lake is a 74 acre lake located 15 miles north of Grand Rapids.  The lake is part of the Wabana chain of lakes and is in ecological lake class 28.  Lakes in this class are small, deep and clear with relatively hard water.  Other area lakes in this class include Nashwauk, Napoleon and Gale Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were the most abundant species sampled in the gill nets in the 2009 assessment, at a catch rate of 11.5/net.  This catch rate is down from the previous survey but still near the lake class third quartile.  Sampled tullibee ranged from 8.9 to 17.9 inches with a mean length of 13.6 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species for large walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch was within the expected range for this lake class at 1.0/net.  No walleye are stocked in Little Trout Lake, but a modest population exists as a result of natural reproduction and/or migration from other lakes in the chain.  Anecdotal reports suggest that some large walleye are caught from the lake, particularly in spring. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch in 2009 was 0.5/net, below the expected range but similar to the previous survey.  One large (36.8 inch) northern pike was also captured in a trap net.  The low-density pike population and an abundant tullibee prey base create good potential for trophy size fish.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species in the trap nets, with a catch rate of 24.7/net.  This is down from the previous survey but still above the lake class median.  Bluegill size structure was poor; fish ranged from 3.6 to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 6.6 inches.  Recruitment appeared fairly consistent, with ages 3-10, 12 and 13 represented in the sample.  Growth rates were below the lake class average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught at a rate of 3.5/trap net.  This is above the expected range and higher than the previous survey.  Sampled bass ranged from 5.6 to 13.3 inches with a mean length of 9.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included black crappie, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass and yellow perch.  The 1981 survey reported sampling one lake trout and one splake.  A special deep-water gill net was set as part of this assessment in an attempt to sample trout, but none were captured.  <br> \n</p>",
