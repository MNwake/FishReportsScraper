Net catches fell between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for lakes of this type.The northern cisco net catch indicates a continued high population of healthy triaenophorus-free fish.  The size range was from 9.0-17.9, but all but one fish was 13.0 inches or longer and the cisco's mean weight was 1.2 pounds.Since our initial survey in 1970 the northern pike population has remained relatively stable, ranging from 3.67 per gillnet in 1970 to 6.33 in 1987.  Size range in the nets was 15.0 to 22.9 inches long and a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.  Age classes II-IV were represented in the nets and all indicated average growth rates in comparison to the statewide averages.The bluegill population has declined from the previous two surveys to an existing moderate population.  Year classes represented in the nets were V-VIII with all indicating a slow growth rate in comparison to statewide averages.The black crappie population remained unchanged from past surveys.  Year classes V-VIII were represented in the nets with all classes indicating a normal or growth rate in comparison to statewide averages.  The mean size was about 0.26 pounds.  The yellow perch population has declined moderately from the high of 16.0 per gillnet in 1982 to the 5.7 per gillnet in 1987.  Year classes III-V were represented in the nets with the overall growth rate being slow. The walleye population showed no change from it's low abundance levels that existed in past surveys.</p>",

Bass is in the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 25, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 6 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Sixteen species were sampled, including 5 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 20-22, 2023, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth bass numbers looked good while electrofishing (72.0/hr run-time) and 93% were 12\" or larger.  Average length was 14.3\" and fish up to 18.1\" were measured.  The other species that seemed to have some potential for anglers was black crappie.  Numbers were high for this type of lake (2.4/net) and average size was decent at 8.5\".  Many of the crappies were over 8\" (77%).   <br> \n <br> \nMost of the other fish species were either low in number or probably too small to be of much interest to anglers.  Northern pike numbers were high (10.0/net), but size was small with a mean length of 19.8\" and only 13% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were low (7.7/net) and size was small.  Average length was only 5.2\" and none of the fish were over 7.6\".  Although walleyes have been stocked into Bass Lake (most recently in 2011), numbers have remained low with a catch rate of only 0.5/net in 2012. <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth Bass numbers looked good while electrofishing (124.0/hr run-time) and 74% were 12\" or larger.  Average length was 13.3\" and fish up to 19.7\" were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 5.5/gill net.  Average length was 22.1\", with 3% in the protected 22-26\" slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length accounted for 30% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in average numbers in gill nets (1.0/net) and in high numbers in trap nets (3.2/net), when compared to similar lakes.  Average lengths were 12.6\" for fish sampled in gill nets and 9.2\" for trap net sampled fish.  For both gears combined 74% measured at least 8\" in length, with the largest measuring 14.1\".  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 16.2/trap net.  Average length was 6.2\" with 34% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking was discontinued in 2011, because of low success.  The Walleye catch of 0.8/gill net was below average. The few Walleyes in Bass Lake are quite large with an average length of 27.9\",  Fish up to 31.3\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (cisco) were sampled in high numbers at 16.5/gill net.  Average length was 12.7\".  Tullibee (cisco) are important forage for Northern Pike and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Bass, but they are in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bass Lake was conducted on July 11-13, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations with three being boat assisted due to deep drop offs, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e. Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and zero species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types, trap net number eight was reset because it collapsed overnight and caught no fish. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Bass Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that is exceptionally high and exceeds the general use and exceptional use thresholds determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to the previous assessment which determined Bass Lake fully supported aquatic life use based on the FIBI. The recent survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
