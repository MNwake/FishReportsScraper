                "narrative": "<p>Shaokotan Lake is a 995 acre lake located in Lincoln County.  Shaokotan has 7.4 miles of shoreline,  a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, and is in lake class 41.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species and black bullhead as a secondary species.  Shaokotan is presently part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving MPCA, DNR and local groups and units of government.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  All actions had been implemented by late 1995.  These actions apparently resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading to the lake.The walleye population is considered above average for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The number of walleye have increased from 5.3 fish/net in 1992 to 13.8 fish/net in 1996.  The average weight of walleye was just over a pound.  Walleye lengths ranged from 6.5 to 20 inches and averaged about 14 inches.  Good natural reproduction of walleye was observed in 1996 from electrofishing efforts in the fall.  Local anglers reported many yellow perch and small walleye were caught during the spring of 1996.The black bullhead population is considered average to above average for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  Black bullhead numbers increased from 16.1 fish/net in 1992 to 29.5 fish/net in 1996.  The average weight of bullhead was almost ? pound.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 6 to 15 inches and averaged about 8.5 inches.  In recent years, local concerns over extensive removal of black bullhead by commercial fishermen have been raised.  It appears from the 1996 survey the black bullhead population is healthy and should provide good fishing opportunities.The yellow perch population is considered high for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  Yellow perch numbers have increased from 0 fish/net in 1992 to 24 fish/net in 1996.  The average weight of yellow perch was about 1/3 pound. Yellow perch lengths ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  Anglers should have good yellow perch fishing over the next few years.The northern pike population is considered average for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The average weight of northern pike was 4 pounds.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 13 to 30.5 inches and averaged about 25 inches.   The bluegill population is considered low for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  It appears the population may be on the rebound.  Clean Water Partnership efforts should improve the water quality and also spawning habitat for bluegill.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Shaokotan through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shaokotan is a 995 acre lake located in Lincoln County.  It has 7.4 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 10 feet and is in lake class 41.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while yellow perch and northern pike are managed secondarily.  Shaokotan is presently part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving MPCA, DNR, and local groups and units of government.  An extensive gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  All actions had been implemented by late 1995 and have resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading to the lake.  The walleye catch rate of 10.3 was normal for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The walleye catch rate was 13.7 in 1996.  The trapnet catch rate of 8.0 was high for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  High numbers of walleye near the shoreline during the survey may explain the high trapnet catch rates.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gillnets ranged from 9.6 to 23.4 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  Walleye natural reproduction has been well documented in Shaokotan.  The walleye young of the year electrofishing catch rate was 74.4 in 1996 indicating good natural reproduction.  Twenty five of the 114 walleye collected from trap and gillnets in 2000 were from the 1996 year class.  Successive year classes from 1993 through 2000 were collected during the survey.  The strongest year class (age 3 fish) sampled during the survey was a result of natural reproduction. The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 147.7 was high for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The gillnet catch rate was 24.0 in 1996.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in gillnets ranged from 6.2 to 10.4 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  The yellow perch population was dominated by age 2 fish (96.3% of the fish collected).The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 0.7 was low for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The gillnet catch rate was 0 in 1996.  Two northern pike were sampled during the survey and had lengths of 26.9 and 28.2 inches.The black bullhead trapnet catch rate of 362.3 was high for lakes similar to Shaokotan.  The trapnet catch rate was 29.5 in 1996.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged from 8.1 to 13.7 inches with and averaged 9.6 inches. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Shaokotan Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Shaokotan is a 995-acre lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County. Shaokotan has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet and has been aerated since 1981 in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkills. Shaokotan has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 9 to 1 and is situated in a watershed that is dominated by agriculture. Excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines likely contributes to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer. Lake Shaokotan's shoreline has been altered extensively, as it is one of the most residentially developed lakes in the Windom fisheries area. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Lake Shaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, local groups, and local units of government. An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics. After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991. Actions to reduce nutrient loading were in place by 1995. These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading into the lake. More recently, Lake Shaokotan was chosen to be included in another long term monitoring program, Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE). SLICE lakes are monitored more frequently to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, and to make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes. Lake Shaokotan is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Northern Pike. Walleye fry have been stocked frequently during the last decade (2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013) as fry have been stocked two out of three years beginning in 2006. Yellow Perch in Lake Shaokotan have sustained their population through natural reproduction, therefore they are not stocked. Northern Pike stocking occurred in 2004 and 2008, with some natural reproduction documented. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 28, 2013 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nSince surveys began on Lake Shaokotan in 1967, Walleye catch rates have averaged 16.2 per gill net and varied from 5.3 per gill net in 1992 to 34.5 per gill net in 1983. Since 2008, Walleye gill net catch rates have exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). The catch rate in 2014 was 10.7 per gill net, which is a decreased from 23.3 per gill net observed in 2013. Despite the decrease from the last several years, the 2014 catch rate of 10.3 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 23.8 inches and averaged 20.4 inches. A population abundance model was used to estimate a theoretical 2013 population estimate for Shaokotan Lake based on gill net catches of Walleye. The model estimated the population to be at 5,242 Walleye. Age estimates indicated that multiple year classes of Walleye were present, including year classes from 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Some natural reproduction does occur in Shaokotan Lake as the 2008 and 2011 year classes do not correspond to stocking events. Additionally, a nearshore survey conducted during August 2014 captured 13 young-of-the-year Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction occurred in 2014, a non-stocked year. A previous study conducted by the University of Minnesota also documented natural reproduction and suggested that up to 30 percent of the Shaokotan Lake Walleye population was from natural reproduction. Walleye growth in Shaokotan was average when compared to growth of Walleye in similar lakes, as mean lengths at age were 9.1 inches for age-1, 13.1 inches for age-2, 15.9 inches for age 3, 18.1 inches for age-4, 19.8 inches for age-5, and 20.3 inches for age-6. Walleye were plump, indicating that forage is not limited in Lake Shaokotan.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have occurred in low abundance in Lake Shaokotan. In 2014, the Northern Pike catch rate increased to 1.7 per gill net which is the second highest catch rate observed on Lake Shaokotan since 1967, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net). Northern Pike captured in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 8.5 to 36.9 inches and averaged 21.1 inches. The three Northern Pike less than 10.0 inches in length indicate that some natural reproduction occurs in Lake Shaokotan, as stocking has not occurred since 2008. Northern Pike were skinny, suggesting that forage is available but not highly abundant. The high abundance of small Yellow Perch should provide a good prey resource for Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have been highly variable in Lake Shaokotan, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 1992 to 147.7 per gill net in 2000, and averaging 38.9 per gill net since 1967. In 2014, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 43.3 per gill net, up from 15.7 per gill net in 2013, and much higher than similar lakes. Yellow Perch populations tend to be highly sporadic, where a strong year class is produced every 3 to 5 years, with that year class accounting for the majority of the population. Size structure of Yellow Perch in 2014 decreased dramatically from 2013, as average length decreased from 8.9 inches in 2013 to 6.8 inches in 2014. Quality sized perch should be available for anglers in one to two years, given that they typically grow fast in this system. Forage for Yellow Perch appears to be abundant in Lake Shaokotan, as Yellow Perch were extremely plump.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates have been highly variable in Lake Shaokotan, varying from 0.7 per trap net in 2009 to 606.7 per trap net in 1983. From 2008 to 2011, Black Bullhead catch rates were less than 1.7 per gill net and 1.0 per trap net. That trend changed in 2013 when Black Bullhead were captured at rates of 90.0 per trap net and 168.0 per gill net. Abundance of Black Bullhead decreased in 2014, as they were captured at rates of 2.0 per trap net and 64.3 per gill net, which are both within the expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes (1.3 to 78.1 per trap net and 4.6 to 83.0 per gill net). Black Bullhead ranged in length from 4.8 to 13.8 inches and averaged 8.3 inches. Black Bullheads are an important prey species for large predators such as Walleye in southwest Minnesota. Lake Shaokotan's Black Bullhead population is providing an excellent prey resource for Walleyes in this system and should provide a good angling opportunity for bullhead fishermen.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nLake Shaokotan continued to be without Common Carp, as no Common Carp were sampled in 2014. One 4.1 inch Bluegill was sampled, which is consistent with historic catch rates. One White Sucker and six Green Sunfish were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips,  <br> \ntargeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nLake Shaokotan is a 995-acre, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) class 41 lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  Shaokotan has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, with a majority of the lake between 5 and 8 feet.  Shaokotan has a watershed that is dominated by agriculture.  Excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines in the past has contributed to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer.  Lake Shaokotan's shoreline has been altered extensively, as it is one of the most residentially developed lakes in the Windom fisheries area.  In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer.  Lake Shaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MN PCA), MN DNR, local groups, and local units of government.  A watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  Actions to reduce nutrient loading were in place by 1995.  These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus inputs into the lake.  More recently, Lake Shaokotan was chosen to be included in another long term monitoring program, Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE).  SLICE lakes are monitored more frequently to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, and to make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes.  Lake Shaokotan is managed for Walleye, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  Walleye fry are presently stocked 2 of every 3 years (2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014).  Yellow Perch in Lake Shaokotan have sustained their population through natural reproduction, therefore they are not stocked.  Northern Pike stocking occurred in 2004 and 2008, with some natural reproduction documented since 2008.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 27, 2015 to monitor fish populations using 3 gill nets and 12 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nOver the past 3 years, the aquatic vegetation community in Lake Shaokotan has expanded.  Aquatic Vegetation surveys were done regularly as part of the SLICE monitoring program from 2008 to 2010.  The aquatic vegetation coverage expanded from 8% in 2008 to 16% in 2010.  Currently, the aquatic vegetation coverage was nearly 100% during August of 2015.  A committee representing the Lake Shaokotan Lake Association is currently working with the MN DNR to address the recreational conflict caused by the increase in aquatic vegetation and develop a lake vegetation management plan (LVMP).  The LVMP will potentially allow the Lake Association to chemically treat up to 15% of the lake with herbicide or 50% of the lake with mechanical methods, or a combination, to remove aquatic vegetation if deemed appropriate due to sustained coverage of aquatic vegetation.  The following information details the fish community information and the potential effect of increasing aquatic vegetation in Lake Shaokotan.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nSince 1967, Walleye catch rates have averaged 15.8 per gill net and varied from 5.3 per gill net in 1992 to 34.5 per gill net in 1983.  Since 2008, Lake Shaokotan has been surveyed annually except in 2012.  From 2008 to 2013 Walleye gill net catch rates exceeded the statewide expected catch rate of 15.3 per gill net for class 41 lakes.  In 2015 the catch rate was above the class 41 statewide average of 7.7 per gill net at 10.3 per gill net.  The 2015 trap net catch rate of 2.3 per trap net was above the expected range of catch rates for class 41 lakes statewide (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net).  Walleye ranged in length from just shy of 7 inches to nearly 28 inches and averaged 20 inches in gill nets and 16 inches in trap nets.  Twenty-eight percent of Walleye in the gill net and trap net sample were between 13 and 20 inches and 52% of the Walleye in the gill net and trap sample were over 20 inches.  The increase in vegetation in Lake Shaokotan corresponds to a drop in gill net catch rates from 18.3 to 23.3 per gill net from 2008 to 2013 to 10.6 and 10.3 in 2014 and 2015 respectively.  While the catch rates are down, the population may not be, it may simply be harder to catch the fish.  The catchability of walleye in gill nets could be affected by the abundant aquatic vegetation and thereby causing walleye to avoid the net.  There are good numbers of age groups of Walleye in Lake Shaokotan with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 year old fish present in the lake.  Some natural reproduction does occur in Lake Shaokotan as the 1, 4, and 7 year old fish do not correspond to stocking events.  A previous study conducted by the University of Minnesota also documented natural reproduction and suggested that up to 30 percent of the Lake Shaokatan Walleye population was from natural reproduction.  With 28% of Walleye between 13 and 20 inches and 52% of Walleye larger than 20 inches along with an average catch rate of 10.3 per gill net, anglers should have a good chance to have good walleye angling.  The 2013 and 2014 year classes appear to be high in abundance (36% of aged sample) and should help to add to the fishery as they age and become more susceptible to angler's lures.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have occurred in low abundance in Lake Shaokotan. In 2015, the Northern Pike catch rate increased to 4.0 per gill net which is the highest catch rate observed on Lake Shaokotan.  Northern Pike captured in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 9 to 36 inches and averaged 22 inches in gill nets and nearly 25 inches in trap nets.  Sampled Northern Pike less than 10 inches indicated some natural reproduction occurs in Lake Shaokotan (stocking has not occurred since 2008). Condition of Northern Pike was good suggesting that food is available and abundant. A high abundance of 5 to 6 inch Yellow Perch during the 2015 assessment should provide a good prey resource for Northern Pike for several years. Northern Pike catch rates have been increasing with the emergence of aquatic vegetation in Lake Shaokotan.  The future outlook for Northern Pike looks good and fishing should be excellent over the next several years.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in gill nets are up and down from year to year in Lake Shaokotan.  The historical long-term gill net catch rate average is 41.8 per gill net.  The long-term catch rate average is above the statewide expected catch rate range but within the SW MN expected catch rate range.  In 2015, the gill net catch rate was the 3rd highest on record at 80.0 per gill net exceeding both the statewide and the SW MN expected catch rate ranges.  The trap net catch rate was the highest ever observed at 53.8 per trap net.  From 1967 to 2013 the catch rate was typically within the quartile ranges.  Currently, the 2015 catch rate was above the statewide expected catch rate range.  Additionally, catch rates in gill nets and trap nets indicates a Yellow Perch population that may be at abundances never seen before.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches with an average length of nearly 8 inches in gill nets and just shy of 6 inches in trap nets.  Over the next year, the Yellow Perch should grow and provide good numbers of harvestable sized fish.  Finally, the increasing aquatic vegetation provides good spawning habitat for the high abundance Yellow Perch population to sustain itself.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were prevalent in Lake Shaokotan from 1983 to 2004.  However, from 2008 to 2011 the catch rates only ranged from 0 to 1.7 per gill net and 0.7 to 1.0 per trap net indicating a very low population.  The reduction in Black Bullhead from 2004 to 2008 is not fully understood, but may be due in part to a more stable large Walleye population that was an effective predator.  Another possibility is that water quality improved during those time frames that gave the predators in the system an upper hand in abundance.  In 2013, the catch rate returned to pre-2004 values with a catch rate of 168 per gill net and 90 per trap net.  In 2015 the Black Bullhead catch rate declined to 45.7 per gill net and 19.8 per trap net.  It appears that the Black Bullhead population was able to produce a successful spawn in 2011 or 2012 resulting in large numbers of Black Bullhead in 2013.  The recent declining trend may again be due to the large Walleye population eating the Black Bullhead and suppressing their population again.  The length of Black Bullhead in the 2015 sample ranged from 5 to just over 14.5 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  Future densities of Black Bullhead appear to be related to the number of large Walleye in Lake Shaokotan, therefore, the population abundance of Black Bullhead may continue to decline.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in Lake Shaokotan in 2015 were Bluegill, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish.  Bluegill are a low abundance member of the fish community in Lake Shaokotan.  Bluegill were only stocked once with 200 adults in 1980 but continue to maintain a population.  The current catch rate of 0.7 per trap net is below the expected catch rate range for class 41 lakes but the highest observed since 1983.  Habitat conditions are becoming more favorable for Bluegill and the population could see continued growth as the aquatic vegetation community persists.  The Green Sunfish population is currently at a high abundance with a catch rate of 3.0 per trap net.  The prevalent Green Sunfish population most likely was the cause of hybridization with Bluegill.  Hybrid Sunfish (Bluegill x Green Sunfish) in 2015 were caught at a rate of 0.7 per trap net.  Increasing hybridization indicates stress on the Bluegill population and potentially decreased success of spawning or a lack of spawning aged fish in the population.  When this happens, Bluegill are more likely to spawn with other sunfish.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 6.5 inches with an average length of nearly 4.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Shaokotan supports a healthy population of Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Anglers should be able to catch their limit of each species when the bite is hot.   Large Walleye and Northern Pike will also be a bonus for anglers and Yellow Perch perfect for the frying pan will be more abundant over the course of the next 2 years.  Anglers in SW MN should definitely target Lake Shaokotan, especially during the ice fishing season when aquatic vegetation abundance should decrease and open pockets for anglers to target.  The aquatic vegetation should be viewed as a positive addition to the lake, at times it can make it difficult to recreate and boat on the lake, but it provides good habitat for fish and results in clear water in the lake.  The Lake Shaokotan Lake Association along with the MN DNR will determine the best plan for managing the aquatic vegetation.  In the meantime, enjoy the Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike fishing.    <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shaokotan is a 995-acre, class 41 lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  Shaokotan Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and Bluegill (added as a management species in 2016).  Lake Shaokotan is part of an effort to enhance a unique strain of Walleye already found in the lake, and which is likely responsible for the sporadic natural reproduction that occurs (historically documented about 30% contribution).  The strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi Strain; LMS) is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction.  A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye, indicating that some natural reproduction has occurred for this strain to persist.  Lake Shaokotan was stocked with the Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the springs of 2015 and 2016 in an effort to supplement this strain that is already present in Shaokotan.  Lake Shaokotan was selected because it has traditionally supported a good walleye population, has habitat that is conducive to Walleye reproduction, and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction.  LMS Walleye fry will be stocked two out of three years beginning in 2015 (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, etc.) at a rate of 1000 per acre.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on October 13, 2016 to determine if the 2016 fry stocking was successful. <br> \n <br> \nZero young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured during the electrofishing survey indicating that the fry stocking was not successful and natural reproduction did not occur in 2016.  Both LMS fry stockings have been unsuccessful in Lake Shaokotan, creating two consecutive \"blank\" year classes.  Consideration is being given to stocking LMS fingerlings in the spring of 2017.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shaokotan is a 995 acre lake located in Lincoln County near the city of Ivanhoe.  The class 41 lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet with 8.73 miles of shoreline.  The lake shoreline is developed with many houses and a county park with a campground.  Lake Shaokotan is managed for Walleye primarily with Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and Bluegill secondarily.  Fish surveys with gill nets and trap nets are conducted regularly.  There was an initial survey in 1967 followed by 1983, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, annual surveys from 2008-2011, annual from 2013-2015, and 2018.  The Walleye relative abundance was at its peak in 1983 with a decline from 1989-2004 followed by another peak from 2008-2013 and another decline from 2014 until 2018.  Following 2013, there was a dramatic shift in water quality and clarity from a turbid water to clear water with abundant aquatic vegetation.  This shift resulted in improved conditions for Yellow Perch, Bluegill, and Northern Pike but resulted in a lower relative abundance of Walleye.  Particularly, Walleye recruitment from fry stocking to age 1 was lacking.  Walleye fry were extremely susceptible to predation from other species, with Yellow Perch being a potential major predator.  Therefore, Walleye stocking shifted to fall fingerling stocking instead of spring fry stocking.  In 2017 there were 4,326 Walleye fingerling stocked into Lake Shaokotan.  Those fish seemed to disappear as only 1 was recaptured in the 2018 survey.  In 2019 Walleye fry were stocked following a return of turbid water.  In order to follow the survival of the potential 2019 year class of Walleye night electrofishing was conducted September 16, 2019 to monitor the catch rate of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nTracking YOY Walleye is important for Walleye managed lakes.  It has been determined in southwest Minnesota that a catch rate less than 20 YOY Walleye per hour of electrofishing results in a poor year class.  Any catch rate above 20 YOY Walleye per hour of electrofishing has the ability to result in a strong year class, there are some exceptions to this rule, but for the most part it holds true.  Two hundred and seven YOY Walleye were captured in 41 minutes of electrofishing.  Extrapolated to 1 hour, the on-time catch rate was 302.93 YOY Walleye per hour of electrofishing.  Young-of-the-year Walleye ranged in length from 5.3 to 7.4 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Additionally, we captured 6 age-1 Walleye in 41 minutes of electrofishing for a 1 hour catch rate of 8.78 age-1 Walleye per hour.  The age-1 fish ranged in length from 11.8 inches to 13.4 inches with an average length of 12.9 inches.  Interestingly, the age-1 Walleye were from a naturally reproduced year class as no stocking was conducted in 2018.  It appears that the Walleye population is doing well, the 2018 (natural) and 2019 (stocked) year classes will help to add to an aging population of Walleye and add a future angling opportunity.  The 2019 stocked year class appears to be a strong year class, and they are Lower Mississippi Strain from the Lake Sarah egg take.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye may have an advantage in southwest Minnesota waters and provide a better chance of survival to older ages and larger sizes as well as a potential for increased natural reproduction potential.  Lake Shaokotan will continue to be monitored with a fish netting survey in 2021 and future YOY Walleye electrofishing sampling as needed.  Lake Shaokotan is a very unique lake in southwest Minnesota and the Walleye are an important species for the lake.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shaokotan is a 995-acre lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  Shaokotan has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 9 to 1 and is situated in a watershed that is dominated by agriculture.  Historically, excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines contributed to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer.  Lake Shaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, local groups, and local units of government.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  Actions to reduce nutrient loading were in place by 1995.  These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading into the lake.  More recently, Lake Shaokotan was chosen to be included in another long term monitoring program, Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE).  SLICE lakes are monitored more frequently to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, and to make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes.  Since 2015, aquatic vegetation coverage has been nearly 100%. In response to the increase in vegetation, a Lake Vegetation Management Plan was developed with the Lake Shaokotan Lake Association, outlining options to chemically or mechanically control some of the vegetation. As a result of the increased friction with high abundance of submergent vegetation, Lincoln County approved the creation of the Lake Shaokotan Improvement District which has taxing authority within a 1000 feet of the lakes water's edge.  Those dollars would be used per the Lake Vegetation Management Plan to chemically treat the lake in those designated areas.  Currently, Lake Shaokotan continues to be in a \"clear water state\" with abundant vegetation though out much of the year.  Lake Shaokotan is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of August 2, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2008 to 2013, Walleye abundance was commonly above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  As water quality improved and vegetation became more abundant (2014), Walleye catch rates have been below the upper end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (15.3 per gill net), and have averaged 9.1 per gill net since 2014.  Prior to Shaokotan changing to a clear water state, Walleye fry were stocked because they tend to do well in turbid water and can produce a big year class if successful.  After two consecutive years of unsuccessful fry stockings in 2015 and 2016, resulting in two missing year classes, the stocking regime was switched to fingerling stocking in 2017.  In 2019, because the water was turbid in the spring, Walleye fry were stocked and produced a strong year class (303.0 fingerlings per hour), which assigned genetically to two-thirds stocked Walleye and one-third naturally produced Walleye.  Walleye were not stocked in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor were fingerlings stocked in 2021 because a natural year class was produced (69.3 fingerlings per hour; mean length =7.9 inches).  Nine year classes of Walleye were sampled ranging in age from 0 to 15, with the age-2 year class comprising 30 percent of the sample. All other year classes present comprised 15 percent or less of the sampled Walleye.  Mean length at age-2 was 15.0 inches, indicating fast growth when compared to other Walleye in similar lakes.  Lengths of all sampled Walleye ranged from 6.6 to 28.0 inches and averaged 20.8 inches.  Walleye fingerling stocking at Lake Shaokotan will continue as long as the lake has clear water, with opportunistic fry stocking also being used if there is dirty water in the spring, as there was in 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Yellow Perch catch rate was 87.7 per gill net, a decrease from the 2018 catch rate of 147.0 per gill net, but exceeding the long term average of 51.2 per gill net since 1967, and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 9.6 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Mean lengths at age-1, 2, 3, and 4 were 5.9, 6.7, 8.0, and 8.8 inches, respectively, indicating good growth.  Ninety-three percent of Yellow Perch sampled in the gill net were age-2 or younger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in multiple years to 22.3 per gill net in 2018, and have averaged 2.7 per gill net since 1967.  The 2021 catch rate of 7.0 per gill net was a decrease from the 2018 catch rate of 22.3 per gill net, but above the long-term average.  Northern Pike abundance has increased since clear water and abundant vegetation has become the norm in Lake Shaokotan.  Lengths of all sampled Northern Pike ranged from 20.3 to 31.5 inches and averaged 26.6 inches.  Lake Shaokotan, which is in the southern zone of the Zonal Pike regulations, has a 24 inch minimum length limit and a possession limit of two.  Ample opportunity exists to harvest a legal pike, as 82 percent of the pike sampled were 24.0 inches or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2021, Bluegill have occurred in low abundance in Shaokotan Lake, with catch rates that were less than 2.7 per trap net.  In 2016, because there was favorable habitat available for Bluegill (clear water and vegetation), 1,800 adult Bluegill were stocked in Shaokotan Lake.  A large year class of Bluegill was produced as the 2021 catch rate was 84.4 per trap net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 14.9 per trap net).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 6.3 inches and averaged 4.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance continued to be within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net), with a 2021 catch rate of 42.33 per gill net.  Black Bullhead were large, with lengths that ranged from 11.0 to 13.8 inches and averaged 12.4 inches.  Other species sampled included White Sucker and Green Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured six species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=9), Black Bullhead (N=1), Fathead Minnow (N=249), Bluegill (N=102), Green Sunfish (N=8), and Yellow Perch (N=1,628).  Electrofishing captured five species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=13), Black Bullhead (N=59), Fathead Minnow (N=11), Green Sunfish (N=6), and Yellow Perch (N=41).  Reproduction exists for Yellow Perch in Buffalo Lake as, as young-of-the-year (YOY) Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling is used to determine the overall health of Lake Shaokotan.  The IBI score provides insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.  The IBI score at Lake Shaokotan was 20, which is below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shaokotan, located in Lincoln County, is a 995 acre lake with more than 7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  Primarily managed for walleye, Shaokotan is also managed for northern pike and yellow perch.  Following its current management plan, the lake is stocked with walleye fry every other year at the rate of 1000 fry per acre.  Yellow perch are stocked if catch rates fall below average for two consecutive assessments.  In addition, winter-rescue northern pike (rate = 1 pound per acre) or fingerlings (rate = 10 fish per acre) are stocked if gill net catch rates fall below 2 fish per net.The 2004 walleye gill net catch rate of 6 fish per net was average for lakes similar to Shaokotan, but down from the 2000 gill net catch rate of 10.33 fish per net.  The trap net catch rate of just under 6 fish per net is considered very high for lakes like Shaokotan, but was slightly lower than the 8 fish per net average of the 2000 survey.  High numbers of walleye near the shoreline during the assessments may explain these high trap net catch rates.  Lengths of captured walleyes in 2004 ranged from 11.5 inches to just over 23 inches, and most of the fish (94%) were longer than 12 inches and should provide some good angler entertainment.  Walleye natural reproduction has been well documented in Shaokotan in the past, and this assessment was no different.  Four strong age classes were captured in 2004, including a strong 2003 year class, a year in which the lake was not fry stocked.  Changing Shaokotan's walleye stocking regime to a two out of three years schedule with fry stocking one year and fingerling stocking the other is recommended to help keep the abundant black bullhead population in check. The northern pike gill net catch rate of less than one fish per net (0.67) in 2004 was nearly identical to the 2000 catch rate (0.7).  These catch rates are considered below average for lakes with characteristics similar to Shaokotan.  The two northern pike captured in the 2004 assessment had lengths just over 20 and 26 inches.2004 yellow perch gill net catch rates were also well below average for lakes similar to Shaokotan, with less than one fish per net captured (0.67).  This value is much lower than the 2000 catch rate of 147.67 fish per gill net.  The two yellow perch sampled in 2004 had lengths of just over 7 inches and just under 11 inches.  Because yellow perch populations tend to fluctuate naturally, results of the 2008 survey will be used to determine stocking needs. The black bullhead 2004 gill net catch rate was 287 fish per net, a slight increase from the 225 fish per net in 2000.  The trap net catch rate was just over 97 bullheads per net in 2004, a decrease from the 362 fish per net in 2000.  Regardless, 2004 catch rates greatly exceeded average values for lakes like Shaokotan.  Other species captured in the 2004 assessment were white suckers and bluegill.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Shaokotan through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

Lake Shaokotan is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Bluegill.  Lake Shaokotan has had sporadic natural reproduction by Walleye, but it is believed that the population is maintained mostly through stocking. Historically, excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines contributed to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer.  Following decades of Best Management Practices in Lake Shaokotan's watershed, there was dramatic shift in water quality and clarity in 2015, shifting from a turbid state to a clear water state with abundant aquatic vegetation.  This shift in water clarity resulted in unsuccessful fry stockings in consecutive years in 2015 and 2016.  Back to back missing year classes can be problematic, so fingerling stocking was started in 2017.  Turbid water returning in some years since 2019 has afforded the ability to stock Walleye fry with some success at times. Walleye fry (N=497,500 Lower Mississippi Strain) were stocked in 2023 and night electrofishing was conducted September 26, 2023 to determine if the stocking failed and Walleye fingerlings were needed for stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 catch rate off Walleye fingerlings in Lake Shaokotan was 838.0 per hour.  Age-0 Walleye lengths were variable. Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 6.9 inches and averaging 4.5 inches. Only 1 age-0 Walleye was over 6 inches and was probably a lone naturally reproduced fish. However, genetic analysis indicated that only 16% of the Walleye captured were stocked fish with the remaining fish from natural reproduction. In southwest Minnesota, a year class may be produced if the fall electrofishing catch rate is above 20.0 per hour.  Walleye fingerlings were not stocked in the fall of 2023 because a potential strong year class was produced via stocking. However, survival of age-0 Walleye can be low when the length is less than 5 inches during the first year of growth. Additional sampling will be conducted to determine the success of the Walleye population. The next standard gill net and trap net survey is during the summer of 2024.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shaokotan is a 995-acre lake located near the town of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  The lake has maximum depth of 10.0 feet, has 8.6 miles of shoreline and is a class 41 lake.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 9 to 1.   <br> \nShaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and local groups and units of government.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  All actions had been implemented by late 1995.  These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nShaokotan is currently managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike.  Shaokotan is presently stocked with walleye fry at 1,000 per littoral acre 2 of 3 years with the next non stocking year in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 catch rate of walleye was 18.0 fish per gill net which was greater than the expected range for this type of lake (15.3 walleye per gill net) and also greater than the long-term average catch rate of 15.6 walleye per gill net.  The average length of walleye in the gill nets was 16.4 inches with a range of 13.8 to 24.2 inches.  Additionally, 5 walleye greater than 24 inches were caught in the trap nets with a maximum length of 25.4 inches, which indicated larger walleye are present in the system.  Analyzing the size structure of all walleye in the sample showed that the walleye population is dominated by larger fish, particularly fish greater than 20 inches.  The overall condition of the walleye was good indicating the fish were foraging successfully.  Six different ages of walleye were present, 1 of those age groups were fish that were naturally reproduced.  Growth of walleye was adequate as the fish reached 13.5 inches by age 3.  The walleye population appears to be in high abundance with good condition and adequate growth.  Fishing for walleye in Shaokotan Lake should be good if not excellent in the years to come as your 1 fish over 20 inches should be easier to come by in Shaokotan. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2011 was 22.0 fish per gill net which is equal to the upper normal range for this type of lake.  Historically it was also half the long-term average gill net catch of 46.8 fish per net.  The average length of yellow perch was 9.9 inches with a range of 8.2 to 13.7 inches.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was excellent indicating that they are foraging successfully.  The yellow perch population appears to be at a normal to high normal abundance with good condition.  Fishing for yellow perch in Shaokotan should be good for the next couple of years as the fish have a large average size and will continue to get larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate (1.3 fish per net) in 2011 was in the normal range for the first time since sampling began in 1996 and a little more than 2.5 times the long-term average gill net catch rate of 0.5 fish per gill net.  The average length of northern pike was 21.7 and 27.3 inches for gill nets and trap nets respectively, with a range of 20.6 to 34.1 inches.  The sample of northern pike suggested that the population had an above average size structure.  The overall condition was good suggesting the northern pike population is foraging adequately.  In the 2010 survey the northern pike reached quality size by age 3, this did not appear to change in 2011 as the northern pike population continues to have good growth.  Overall, the northern pike condition and growth are good and the population appears to be maintaining itself at a low abundance with some natural reproduction.      <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in the nets were black bullhead, bluegill, green sunfish, white sucker, and orangespotted sunfish all at low abundance.  In nearshore index of biotic integrity (IBI) sampling with seines and backpack electrofishing we caught johnny darter, black bullhead, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, fathead minnow, green sunfish, and yellow perch.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall lake health of Shaokotan Lake.  It will give us insight into the overall water quality and if improvements can be made to the surrounding watershed or within the lake to improve the water quality of the lake and the overall fish community.      <br> \n <br> \nIncluding all types of sampling the total number of species in the sample was 11 indicating a simple fish community exists in Shaokotan.  Simple fish communities can be easily managed and manipulated to augment catch rates and in the same way they can be easily devastated with overfishing and habitat degradation.  Shaokotan Lake is currently in great condition and the fish community is thriving.  Future management of Shaokotan Lake should include habitat protection, habitat restoration, and promotion of best management practices within the watershed.  Catch-and-release fishing can help to preserve the fish community for years to come, consider releasing some of your catch, you may be releasing the next state record fish!   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \nNate Hodgins <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake has maximum depth of 10.0 feet, has 8.6 miles of shoreline and is a class 41 lake.  Shaokotan was chosen to be a Sentinal Lake and will be monitored annually to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of selected study lakes, make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes, and classify lakes according to their sensitivity to stressors.   <br> \n <br> \nShaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving MPCA, DNR and local groups and units of government.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  All actions had been implemented by late 1995.  These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading to the lake. <br> \n <br> \nFor many years Lake Shaokotan was (and occasionally still is) an important destination for bullhead anglers, especially those from out-of-state.  Two resorts on the lake catered to this trade in the past, with occasional walleyes, perch and northern pike caught in addition to the desired bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the early 1960's, considerable effort was directed toward developing a northern pike spawning area at the site where the county park is now located.  Our records don\u0019t offer any clues as to why this project never materialized, but several northern pike year-classes were present in 1996, and two year-classes were present in the 2000 and 2004 assessments, indicating that the lake\u0019s spawning habitat is at least somewhat adequate. <br> \n <br> \nShaokotan is currently managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike.  Shaokotan is presently stocked with walleye fry at 1,000 per littoral acre 2 of 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nShaokotan has a high walleye population according to results of netting in 2008.  We would expect to catch anywhere from 3.2 to 15.3 walleye per gill net.  In 2008 we averaged 19.7 walleye per gill net.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 8.0 to 23.2 inches and averaged 15.2 inches.  Six different ages of walleye were caught in our survey but the majority were age 4 and in the 17 to 18 inch range (68% of the walleye caught).  As part of the sampling protocol for Sentinel lakes, fall electrofishing for walleye is required.  The electrofishing catch per hour (CPH) using run time in 2008 was 248.2 compared to 2.4 in 1999, 259.5 in 1998 and 74.4 in 1996.  Initially all walleye were targeted; however, high numbers of young of the year (YOY) walleye shifted the netting protocol to just netting YOY walleye.  Lengths of walleye sampled electrofishing ranged from 4.84 to 11.38 inches with a mean length of 6.54 inches.  Walleye fry were not stocked in 2008 indicating good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in Shaokotan appeared to be low.  Lengths of northern pike  caught in our trap nets ranged from 6.1 to 35.8 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Since northern pike have had a history in Shaokotan, northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2008 to bolster the population.   <br> \n <br> \nShaokotan has an excellent yellow perch population according to our netting results in 2008.  We would expect to catch anywhere from 3.0 to 22.5 yellow perch per gill net and we caught 38.7 yellow perch per gill net in 2008.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets in 2008 ranged from 6.6 to 11.7 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  There were several yellow perch in the 10 to 11 inch range. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are down compared to previous surveys.  There were some nice sized black bullhead; however, with lengths that ranged from 6.7 to 14.5 inches and averaging 11.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in gill and trap nets included bluegill, white sucker and green sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Shaokotan Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nShaokotan Lake is a 995-acre lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County. Shaokotan Lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet and has been aerated since 1981 in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkills. Shaokotan has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 9 to 1 and is situated in a watershed that is dominated by agriculture. Excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines likely contributes to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer. Shaokotan Lake's shoreline has been altered extensively, as it is one of the most residentially developed lakes in the Windom fisheries area. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Shaokotan Lake was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, local groups, and local units of government. An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics. After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991. Actions to reduce nutrient loading were in place by 1995. These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading into the lake. More recently, Shaokotan Lake was chosen to be included in another long term monitoring program, Sustaining Lakes In a Changing Environment (SLICE). SLICE lakes are monitored more frequently to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, and to make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes. Shaokotan Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and northern pike. Walleye fry have been stocked frequently during the last decade (2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013) as fry have been stocked two out of three years beginning in 2006. Yellow perch in Shaokotan have sustained their population through natural reproduction, therefore they are not stocked. Northern pike stocking occurred in 2004 and 2008, with some natural reproduction documented. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 29, 2013 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE  <br> \nThe 2013 walleye catch rate was 23.3 per gill net, the second highest catch rate ever recorded in Shaokotan Lake, and an increase from the 2011 catch rate of 18.3 per gill net. Since 1967, walleye catch rates have averaged 16.7 per gill net and varied from 5.3 per gill net in 1992 to 34.5 per gill net in 1983. Since 2008, walleye gill net catch rates have been high when compared to similar lakes. The 2013 trap net catch rate also was high compared to similar lakes as walleye were captured at a rate of 2.5 per trap net, slightly below the long term average of 3.6 per trap net. Both gill net and trap net catch rates indicate that the walleye population is doing well in Shaokotan Lake. Walleye size structure was large, ranging in length from 9.8 to 28.0 inches and averaging 20.3 inches, with many of the fish being over 20 inches in length. A population abundance model was used to estimate a theoretical 2013 population estimate for Shaokotan Lake based on gill net catches of walleye. The model estimated the population to be at 10,079 walleyes. The Shaokotan Lake walleye population appears to be stable, as indicated by the wide range of lengths present. Age estimates indicated that multiple year classes of walleye were present, including year classes from 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. Some natural reproduction does occur in Shaokotan Lake as the 2008 and 2011 year classes do not correspond to stocking events. Walleyes grow fast in Shaokotan Lake, averaging 16.2 inches by age-3. Walleyes were plump, indicating that forage is not limited in Shaokotan Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE  <br> \nHistorically, northern pike have occurred in low abundance in Shaokotan Lake. In 2013, the northern pike catch rate was also low, being captured at a rate of 0.3 per gill net. The 2013 trap net catch rate of northern pike was 0.8 per trap net, slightly above the long term average of 0.7 per trap net, but within the historic range of catch rates (0.2 per trap net in 2009 to 1.9 per trap net in 1967) for Shaokotan Lake. Despite favorable habitat and stocking efforts, the northern pike population has existed at levels lower than expected. Size structure of northern pike was large ranging from 8.7 to 35.5 inches in length and averaging 22.7 inches. Four pike, 8.7 to 10.0 inches, were sampled in trap nets indicating that natural reproduction occurred in the spring of 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow perch catch rates have been highly variable in Shaokotan Lake, ranging from a low of 0.0 per gill net in 1992 to a high of 147.7 per gill net in 2000, and averaging 38.5 per gill net since 1967. In 2013, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 15.7 per gill net, a decrease from the 2011 catch rate of 21.7 per gill net, and the lowest recorded catch rate since 2004 (0.7 per gill net). The 2013 catch rate was well below the long-term average for Shaokotan Lake, but was within the expected range of catch rates (3.0 per gill net to 22.5 per gill net) for similar lakes. Yellow perch populations tend to be sporadic, where a strong year class is produced every 3 to 5 years, with the strong year class accounting for the majority of the population. This was evident in Shaokotan Lake as age-2 yellow perch (2011 year class) accounted for nearly 80 percent of the sample. In addition to the 2011 year class, perch from two other year classes were sampled including 2012 (age-1) and 2009 (age-4). Yellow perch grow fast in Shaokotan Lake as lengths averaged 6.1 inches at age-1, 8.0 inches at age-2, 10.7 inches at age-3, and 12.9 inches at age-4. Size structure of yellow perch was average ranging from 6.6 to 14.3 inches and averaging 8.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates have fluctuated greatly in Shaokotan Lake, from 0.7 per trap net in 2009 to 606.7 per trap net in 1983, and have averaged 139.3 per trap net since 1967. Catch rates of bullheads were at all-time lows from 2008 to 2011 as catch rates did not exceed 1.0 per trap net. This trend changed in 2013 as bullheads were captured at a rate of 90.0 per trap net, the highest catch rate since 2004 (97.3 per trap net). The 2013 black bullhead catch rate was below the long-term average of 139.3 per trap net, but was greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.3 to 78.1 per trap net). The 2013 gill net catch rate (168.0 per gill net) also indicated an increase in abundance, also high when compared to similar lakes. Size structure of black bullheads was small as black bullhead lengths ranged from 4.6 to 14.9 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. Ninety-six percent of the black bullheads were less than 10 inches in length, with the most abundant length being 7.0 to 8.0 inches. Black bullheads are one of the main prey species for larger predators such as walleye and northern pike. The abundant black bullhead population is providing an excellent prey resource for predators in this system.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOne 10.9 inch black crappie was caught which was the first time that black crappies have been sampled since 1992. Historically, bluegills have been captured in very low abundance; no bluegills were sampled in 2013. No white suckers were captured in 2013, but have historically occurred in low abundance in Shaokotan Lake. Shaokotan continued to be carp free, as no common carp were sampled in 2013, consistent with previous surveys. Anglers should take extra precaution to keep carp out of this system by not transporting fish from one basin to another, and by properly disposing of unused bait in the trash.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shaokotan is a 995-acre lake located near the City of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  Shaokotan has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 9 to 1 and is situated in a watershed that is dominated by agriculture.  Excessive nutrient runoff from neighboring agricultural fields and developed shorelines likely contributes to extensive algae blooms in the lake during the summer.  Lake Shaokotan was part of a Clean Water Partnership effort involving the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, local groups, and local units of government.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1991 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  After completion of the monitoring efforts, a watershed restoration program was initiated in late 1991.  Actions to reduce nutrient loading were in place by 1995.  These actions resulted in a 58% reduction in phosphorus loading into the lake.  More recently, Lake Shaokotan was chosen to be included in another long term monitoring program, Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE).  SLICE lakes are monitored more frequently to assess the past and present physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, and to make inferences about the current health of habitats and fish in Minnesota lakes.  Since 2015, aquatic vegetation coverage has been nearly 100%. In response to the increase in vegetation, a Lake Vegetation Management Plan was developed with the Lake Shaokotan Lake Association, outlining options to chemically or mechanically control some of the vegetation. In 2018, the coverage of vegetation substantially decreased and it appeared that the lake may be going back to a turbid state.  Lake Shaokotan is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of July 30, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 11 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has steadily declined from 23.3 per gill net in 2013 to 10.3 per gill net in 2015 to 7.3 per gill net in 2018.  Despite the declining trend in Walleye abundance, the 2018 catch rates of 7.3 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Stocking Walleye fry used to be effective; however, with the increase of aquatic vegetation and water clarity, the stocking strategy was changed to Walleye fingerlings in 2017.  Despite the change in strategy only one Walleye from the 2017 year class was sampled.  Recruitment of stocked fish to the population appears to be limited in recent years, as 56 percent of aged Walleye were age-9 to age-11.  The 2014 year class was not stocked, suggesting that some natural reproduction occurs.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.9 to 27.9 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Growth of Walleye was fast with mean lengths at age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 of 9.1 inches, 12.6 inches, 15.2 inches and 17.2 inches, respectively.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was the second highest on record at 147.0 per gill net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.0 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Growth of Yellow perch was slow as mean length-at-age-1 was 4.0 inches, age-2 was 6.0 inches, age-3 was 7.0 inches, age-4 was 8.5 inches, and age-5 was 9.5 inches.  For comparison, in 2009, age-2 Yellow Perch had a mean length of 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2018, the Northern Pike gill net catch rate varied from 0.0 to 4.0 per gill net and averaged 0.94 per gill net over 14 surveys.  In 2018 the Northern Pike catch rate was 22.3 per gill net, the highest catch rate ever recorded on Shaokotan Lake, and greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net).  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 14.0 to 35.7 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  Shaokotan Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released.  <br> \n <br> \nThroughout survey history on Shaokotan Lake, Bluegill catch rates have been less than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 14.9 per trap net).  The trend continued in 2018, despite the 2017 stocking of 1,800 adult Bluegill, as the catch rate was 0.8 per trap net. Length of sampled Bluegill ranged from 6.1 to 9.3 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  The lack of smaller Bluegill indicates that they are not naturally reproducing or recruiting to the population.  Bluegill were stocked in 2017 because clear water and vegetation tends to produce stable Bluegill populations, however it does not appear that a population is establishing at Shaokotan Lake, at this point. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate in 2018 increased to 98.3 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullheads range from 5.0 inches to 12.4 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  Green Sunfish was the only other species of fish sampled. <br> \n</p>",
