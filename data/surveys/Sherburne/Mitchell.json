                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 170 acre lake located in Sherburne County within the city limits of Big Lake. It is connected to Big Lake via a navigable channel. Mitchell Lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet and a small watershed primarily composed of development, open water, and row crops. A city owned public access is located at the southwest corner of Big Lake near Highway 10. Mitchell Lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2004. Anglers can expect good fishing for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nA few small stands of waterlilies were the only emergent or floating leaf vegetation found in the current survey. Submerged vegetation was widespread, but not surveyed. Chara, Curly leaf pondweed, Coontail, and Bushy pondweed were the dominant submerged species in 2004. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 11.0 feet in early August, similar to 2004 (10.5 feet). Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 18 feet in early August. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were lower than 2004, but still within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Pike size improved since the last survey; only 7% were 24 inches or longer in 2004, compared to 24% in 2017. Lengths ranged from 10.9 to 31.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 19. The catch rate of 59/hour was above the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43/hour. Lengths ranged from 5.7 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 13.7 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 42% were 15 inches or longer, an improvement from 2004 when only 11% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked intermittently through 1997, but were not stocked between 1997 and 2014. Since 2014, fingerling or larger Walleye have been stocked annually by either the DNR or the lake association. Walleye numbers were higher than 2004, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 8.9 to 22.8 inches with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.5 pounds. Walleye were either three or four years old and growth was fast, reaching 16 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2017 were lower than 2004, but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Mitchell. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 to 9.4 inches with an average length of 5.2 inches. Targeted sampling using trap nets was conducted in late May and early June (during spawning time) to better assess Bluegill numbers and size. The Bluegill catch rate was higher than the standard survey and Bluegill were larger. Two percent of Bluegill were eight inches or longer in the targeted survey, compared to less than one percent in the standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch was low, similar to results in 2004. Lengths ranged from 5.7 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches. A targeted survey near shore around spawning time is recommended to better assess Black Crappie abundance and size. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were very low in 2017 and have been low since 1983. High Northern Pike numbers likely limit Yellow Perch abundance. Only 11 Yellow Perch were caught in 2017 and ranged in length from 5.7 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Other species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. Surprisingly, Black Bullheads were caught in average numbers in 2004, but none were found in 2017. However, Yellow Bullhead numbers increased substantially.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on June 19, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations. A 15-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations and a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native fish species including two intolerant species (Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Mitchell Lake based on this survey is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

Mitchell Lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet and a small watershed. A city owned public access is located at the southwest corner of Big Lake near Highway 10. A standard survey was completed in 1983 to update fisheries data last collected in 1973. \n\nNorthern pike abundance in 1983 (11.3/gill net) increased significantly from 1973 (0.8/gill net). Growth was average. The 1980-81 year classes were dominant and were a result from improved accessibility of Black's Marsh for spawning. \n\nWalleye abundance in 1983 (13.2/gill net) increased significantly from 1973 (0.5/gill net). Growth was average. The 1978-79 year classes were dominant and a result from both fry and fingerling stockings. \n\nLargemouth Bass abundance in 1983 (2.3/gill net) increased from 1973 (0.3/gill net) and was above the expected range of values for the lake class.\n\nBluegill abundance has slowly decreased from high numbers in 1957 to average numbers in 1983. Growth is generally slow for most of the age classes. \n\nBlack Crappie abundance in 1983 (1.0/trap net) decreased from 1973 (6.2/trap net). Age two and three Black Crappie were sampled and growth was below average.\n\nYellow Perch abundance in 1983 (2.7/gill net) decreased from 1973 (42.5/gill net) and was low for the expected range of values for the lake class. Young of the year Yellow Perch were sampled in shoreline seining as well as several other forage species. \n\nOther fish sampled included: Black and Yellow Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Mitchell Lake from May 31 to June 1, 2017. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 261 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 2.3 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD-8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. Mitchell Lake PSD was 37 and RSD-8 was 2. So 37% of Bluegill were six inches or longer and 2% were eight inches or longer. These results seem average for overall size, but poor for larger Bluegill. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range from 26 to 95 and an RSD-8 range from 0 to 54. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish were also caught. A total of 36 Pumpkinseed and 98 Hybrid Sunfish were captured. Pumpkinseed lengths ranged from 4.7 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches. Hybrid Sunfish lengths ranged from 3.9 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches. A total of 6 Black Crappie were also caught; Black Crappie likely finished spawning earlier and were not targeted in the current survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 20, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Mitchell Lake from this survey is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Saint Cloud Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big and Mitchell Lakes are located within city of Big Lake in Sherburne County.  The two lakes are connected by a narrow channel on the north side of Big Lake.  Water quality is quite good, and the lakes are very popular for recreational use during the open water season.  More than three hundred boats were counted at docks along shore in 2004, and during summer weekends the two lakes are often very busy. A survey was conducted in the summer of 2004 to assess fish populations and included spring electrofishing and summer netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Big and Mitchell Lakes.  Results were also compared to past surveys of the two lakes to look for possible changes in the fish community. Shoreline seining was conducted to evaluate natural reproduction of prominent game fish. Watershed mapping and aquatic plant surveys were also part of the evaluation.In 2004, catch rates for northern pike more than doubled from 1994 for Big and Mitchell Lakes, and were higher than the range that is typical for lakes like these.  Catch rates were also more than twice the current management target.  Northern pike up to 31 inches were sampled during the summer netting, but most of the fish were 17-26 inches.  Average weight was 2.1 pounds. Walleye populations have been created on Big and Mitchell Lakes by occasional stocking of fingerlings, since natural reproduction does not appear to occur.  Big and Mitchell Lakes were stocked with walleye most recently in 1994 and 1997.  The summer catch rate of walleye in 2004 was low, but within the normal range for lakes like Big and Mitchell.  All of the walleyes sampled were found to be from years that stocking occurred.  The largest age class present was from the 1994 stocking, and averaged 22.8 inches.  A few individuals were determined to be from the 1990 stocking, and one individual was estimated to be from the 1986 stocking (18 years old).  Growth rates were found to be slow, and varied greatly among individuals.  This is probably due to the low density of suitable forage available; very few yellow perch, small white suckers or other appropriate-sized prey were sampled during the survey. Big and Mitchell Lakes are well suited for largemouth bass because of good water clarity and diverse aquatic vegetation.  The bass population appeared very high in 2004, based on night electrofishing.  Ninety-five bass per hour were sampled in Big Lake, while 153 bass per hour were sampled in Mitchell Lake.  The median catch rate for largemouth bass in area lakes is 52/hr.  The population was dominated by mid-sized fish (8-12 inches), while bass over 16 inches were rare. The catch rates of black crappies were low for both Big and Mitchell Lakes.  The average size of black crappie was also low when compared to other lakes similar to Big and Mitchell.  The bluegill catch on Big and Mitchell increased from 1994, and was within expected levels for lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size, however, was low, and growth rates were slow.  Other sunfish species (pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish) were also sampled in 2004. </p>",
