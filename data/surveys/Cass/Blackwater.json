                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 722-acre lake with a maximum depth of 67 feet.  It is located ten miles east and one mile south of Hackensack.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in lake class 25.  Approximately 47% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  There is a DNR public access on the north end of the lake of county road 11.Blackwater Lake is an all-around good fishing lake.  It has a good reputation for big northern pike and walleye.  In the spring, anglers do well catching black crappie.  All year anglers catch bluegill and other sunfish.  As a bonus, anglers also catch quality smallmouth bass.  Northern pike abundance was typical of past surveys and of other lake class 25 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 13.0 to 37.7 inches and had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2 pounds.  There appears to be abundant spawning areas within the lake as well as in Blackwater Creek.  Natural reproduction was consistent with a number of different ages (year classes) present in the sample.  Walleye abundance was typical of past surveys and of other lake class 25 lakes.  Walleye sampled showed excellent size and ranged in length from 2 to 28 inches.  The average length and weight were 17 inches and 2 pounds.  Both natural reproduction and stocking are producing walleye for anglers to catch.  Growth was typical of other area lakes in the same lake class.  Walleye was 18 inches long at five years old.Bluegill abundance was down from past surveys but was still typical of other lake class 25 lakes. Fish ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches and had an average length and weight of 5.8 inches and 0.16 pounds. The quality of bluegill has not decreased since 1959.  Natural reproduction was good with a number ages represented in the sampled fish.Yellow perch and cisco are the primary food fish for predator fish such as northern pike and walleye.  Yellow perch numbers has declined from past surveys.  There appears to be an abundant population of cisco.  Cisco ranged in length from seven to 17 inches.There is a population of smallmouth in Blackwater that is being caught by anglers.  Fish sampled showed good quality ranging in length from 11.7 to 17.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Other fish sampled were all three species of bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, white sucker, and bowfin (dogfish).Blackwater Lake is one of the most desirable lakes in the Longville  area to live on.  There is concern that this demand and development may be impacting the aquatic habitat.  There has been considerable bulrush removal by lakeshore owners around the lake. Activities such as aquatic vegetation removal and addition of sand to the shoreline have impacted habitats for several kinds of fish at different stages of their life cycles. To help maintain quality fish populations in Blackwater Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Blackwater Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Findings from 1996 creel surveys done on  Ten Mile, Pine Mountain, and Woman Lakes where anglers were interviewed, found that only 22% of the walleye 20 inches or longer were released.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake (DOW# 11-0274; lake class 25) is a 767-acre lake with 7.63 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet located South-west of Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the North shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, clear, and irregularly shaped. Other area lakes in this class include Birch, Boy, and Hand. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Secondary management species include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. An experimental regulation for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was modified in 2016 to a 14-20 inch protected slot limit with 1 over 20 inches in possession. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass in Blackwater Lake provide angling opportunities for quality fish of both species. Largemouth Bass are most abundant, and ranged in length from 8 to 17 inches with most fish measuring 14 inches or longer. Smallmouth Bass are present in lower numbers and fish up to 18 inches long were sampled. Northern Pike are abundant, with an average length of 21 inches and pike up to 32 inches were sampled; most fish are shorter than 24 inches. Walleye abundance was below the management goal of four fish per gillnet despite even-year fingerling stocking. The 2014 year class comprised the majority of the sample and averaged 18 inches long. Walleye ranged in length from 13 to 23 inches, with an average length of 18 inches. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers, with quality-sized fish present for both species. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include, Tullibee (Cisco), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Mule Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 722-acre lake with a maximum depth of 67 feet.  It is located nine miles east of Hackensack in northern Cass County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include Birch (located next to Hackensack), Big Boy (located seven miles north of Longville), Girl (located next to Longville), and Inguadona (located four miles east of Longville) Lakes.  There is a DNR public access on the east side of Blackwater Lake off of Co. Rd. 11.The 1995 northern pike catch rate was the highest of any previous surveys.  More than 50 percent of the northern pike captured were two-year-old fish.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14 to 37 inches with an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Even though there were a lot of small northern pike,  nice-sized fish were present.  Six percent of the captured northern pike were 28 inches or longer.  Growth was excellent with four-year-old northern pike averaging nearly 25 inches in length.A total of 49 largemouth bass were collected.  These bass ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches and had an average length of almost 13 inches.  Forty-seven percent of the bass were 12 inches or longer.  Growth was similar of other class 25 lakes.  Age five bass averaged more than 13 inches in length.Walleye abundance was similar to past surveys and class 25 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 to 25 inches and had an average length and weight of 19 inches and 3 pounds.  There was evidence that both natural reproduction and stocking were contributing to the walleye population of Blackwater Lake. Walleye are also likely  migrating to Blackwater Lake from Woman Lake via Blackwater Creek.  Most of the sampled walleye were larger adults and might have moved up the creek to Blackwater Lake during the spawning season.  Growth was good with age four walleye averaging 16 inches in length.A total of five smallmouth bass were captured.  Reports are that anglers who try for smallmouth bass are often very successful.A total of 15 black crappie were captured in 1995.  Most of these crappies were four-year-old fish.  Average length of four-year-old black crappie was  eight inches.  Black crappies are often difficult to sample consistently.Cisco (tullibee) and yellow perch are the two main food fish for predator fish.  Cisco are quite abundant in Blackwater Lake when compared to other class 25 lakes.  Cisco ranged in length from 6 to 17 inches and had an average size of 13 inches.  There were a number of cisco that would be of acceptable size to the angler.Yellow perch were sampled at a rate that was similar to past surveys and area class 25 lakes.  Perch ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches and had an average length of almost 7 inches.The only type of bullhead sampled was yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullhead is usually associated with good water quality.Other fish sampled include bowfin, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.To help maintain quality fish populations in Blackwater Lake, lake users should safeguard an aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect lakes from silt-laden runoff waters.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide and raise their young.  Protection of the Blackwater Lake watershed  is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Blackwater Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

Four-teen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of July 15, 2018 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 65, which was above both the impairment threshold (45) and the exceptional threshold (64) for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>DURING THE SPRING ELECTROFISHING, LMB RANGED 5.5 TO 19 INCHES LONG WITH A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THESE FISH OF ACCEPTABLE SIZES TO ANGLERS (PSD=25, RSD-15=7).  LMB TAKEN BY FALL ELECTRO- FISHING HAD A PSD OF 50 AND RSD-15 OF 6.  LMB GROWTH WAS COMPARABLE TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. AVERAGE LENGTH WHEN ANNULUS 4 WAS FORMED WAS 11.3 INCHES.  BLACKWATER'S BLC POPULATION COMPARED FAVORABLY IN ABUNDANCE TO OTHER CLASS 25 LAKES. NETTING DATA SHOWED NO MAJOR CHANGES IN NUMBERS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  ABOUT 89% OF THE NETTED BLC WERE 8 INCHES OR GREATER AND 13% WERE 10.0 INCHES OR MORE.  ABOUT HALF OF THE BLC TAKEN BY ELECTROFISHING WERE 8.0 INCHES OR LONGER.  BLC GROWTH RATES WERE SIMILAR TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES, WITH MEAN LENGTH AT AGE 4 OF 8.8 INCHES. THE NUMBER OF TLC CAUGHT DURING THE 1991 SURVEY WAS HIGHER THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS SURVEY OF BLACK- WATER AND WAS WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE FOR CLASS 25 LAKES.  THIS TLC POPULATION SHOULD PROVIDE A GOOD FORAGE BASE FOR NOP AND WAE .  THE 1991 NOP GILLNET CATCH (4.1 FISH/SET) WAS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND IS SIMILAR TO GILLNET CATCHES IN 1980 AND 1986.  NOP SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS VERY GOOD- PSD=66; RSD- 28=14.  GROWTH RATES WERE GOOD:  THE AVERAGE LENGTH AT FORMATION OF THE THIRD ANNULUS WAS 22.1 INCHES.  THE TRAPNET CATCH OF PMK IN 1991 (11.0 FISH/SET) WAS SIMILAR TO TRAPNET CATCHES IN MOST OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND WAS GREATER THAN PMK CATCHES IN MOST OTHER CLASS 25 LAKES.  OF THE PMK THE NUMBER OF TLC CAUGHT DURING THE 1991 SURVEY WAS HIGHER THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS SURVEY OF BLACK- WATER AND WAS WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE FOR CLASS 25 LAKES.  THIS TLC POPULATION SHOULD PROVIDE A GOOD FORAGE BASE FOR NOP AND WAE .  THE 1991 NOP GILLNET CATCH (4.1 FISH/SET) WAS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND IS SIMILAR TO GILLNET CATCHES IN 1980 AND 1986.  NOP SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS VERY GOOD- PSD=66; RSD- 28=14.  GROWTH RATES WERE GOOD:  THE AVERAGE LENGTH AT FORMATION OF THE THIRD ANNULUS WAS 22.1 INCHES.  THE TRAPNET CATCH OF PMK IN 1991 (11.0 FISH/SET) WAS SIMILAR TO TRAPNET CATCHES IN MOST OF THE PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND WAS GREATER THAN PMK CATCHES IN MOST OTHER CLASS 25 LAKES.  OF THE PMK TAKEN BY NETTING, 43% WERE 6 INCHES OR GREATER (PSD=43) AND 9% EQUALLED OR EXCEEDED 7 INCHES. THE BLG CATCH IN 1991 (42.6 FISH/SET) WAS SIMILAR TO CATCHES IN MOST PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND WAS IN THE MID-RANGE FOR LAKES IN THIS CLASS.  ANGLERS SHOULD FIND A GOOD SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF BLG AVAILABLE IN BLACKWATER, WITH 53% OF BLG TAKEN BY GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS EQUALLING OR EXCEEDING 6 INCHES IN LENGTH, AND 16% OF THE BLG GREATER OR EQUAL TO 7 INCHES.  BLG GROWTH APPEARED SLOW:  THE AVERAGE LENGTH WHEN THE FOURTH ANNULUS FORMED WAS 3.8 INCHES.  FEW LMB WERE COLLECTED BY NETTING, BUT GOOD NUMBER OF THEM WERE TAKEN BY NIGHT ELECTRO- FISHING, BOTH IN SPRING AND FALL.  ELECTROFISHING CATCH RATES IN 1991 RANGED FROM 31.1 FISH/HR. IN MAY TO 21.3 FISH/HR. IN OCTOBER.  BLACKWATER'S LMB POPULATION SHOWED A GOOD SIZE DISTRIBUTION. THE 1991 YEP GILLNET CATCH (4.9 FISH/SET) WAS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND WAS HIGH THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 25 LAKES.  PERCH TAKEN BY NETTING RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 8.4 INCHES. THE 1991 WAE GILLNET CATCH (4.0 FISH/SET) WAS SIMILAR TO MOST PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND WAS WITHIN THE INTERQUARTILE RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS. NETTED WAE RANGED FROM 13 TO 28 INCHES, AND HAD A PSD OF 91 AND RSD-20 OF 52.  THE GROWTH RATE OF WAE IS EXCELLENT.  BY CORRELATING AGE CLASSES OF WAE PRESENT DURING THE 1991 AND ALL PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS TO STOCKING RECORDS, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS MAINTAINING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION, IF NOT ALL, OF THE WAE POPULATION IN BLACKWATER LAKE.  THE 1988 YEAR CLASS APPEARS TO BE PARTICULARLY STRONG.  WAE FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED DURING 1988, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE FISH MAY BE THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION DURING 1988 WAS EXCELLENT IN MANY AREA LAKES (WOMAN, LEECH, ETC.).  WAE STOCKING MAY BE HAVING LITTLE INFLUENCE ON YEAR CLASS STRENGTH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 722-acre lake with a maximum depth of 67 feet.  The lake is located six miles southwest of Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota=s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25, which is made up of waters that are generally clear and deep, and have hard water and irregular shorelines.   Approximately 47% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR public access with a concrete ramp on the north shore of the east bay off of County Road 11.  Blackwater Lake provides fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye. Walleye abundance during the 2001 assessment was similar to most past surveys and similar to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 12.4 to 24.7 inches.  Walleye reproduce naturally in Blackwater Lake.  Walleye are stocked periodically in Blackwater Lake and DNR Fisheries personnel are studying to what extent walleye stocking may enhance the lake's walleye population.  Northern pike are abundant in Blackwater Lake and can offer anglers much action.  While many of the northern pike sampled by DNR in Blackwater Lake were less than 20 inches long, larger fish (up to 32 inches) were also found.  Many year classes were present in the sample indicating good natural reproduction. Bluegill are moderately abundant and fish from 3 to 9 inches long were found during the 2001 survey.  Largemouth bass are abundant in Blackwater Lake, and DNR personnel sampled largemouth up to 19 inches long. Smallmouth bass and black crappie are also present in Blackwater.  Other fish that make up the diverse fish community of this lake include bullheads, rock bass, white sucker, bowfin (dogfish) and cisco (tullibee).The number of lake homes on Blackwater Lake increased from 52 in 1959 to 122 in 1995.  The increasing number of lake homes points out the importance of each lakeshore owner protecting the natural shoreline along their property.  Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Lakeshore owners need to manage their shoreline in a natural condition if fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes are to remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through MN DNR Fisheries offices.    Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Blackwater Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 767-acre lake with 7.6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet located southwest of Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are characterized as Sunfish waters. Other area lakes in this class include Boy, Girl, Hand, Inguadona, Long, and Swift Lakes. Blackwater Lake possesses a highly developed shoreline. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. An experimental catch and release regulation for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass implemented in 2004 was modified to a 14-20-inch protected slot limit with 1 over 20 in 2016. The regulation was removed in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass in Blackwater Lake provide angling opportunity for quality fish of both species. Largemouth Bass are most abundant and ranged in length from 5 to 18 inches. Smallmouth Bass are present in lower numbers and fish up to 20 inches long were sampled. Northern Pike are abundant in the lake, exceeding the maximum management goal. Sampled pike ranged from 11 to 36 inches long, averaging 22 inches. Walleye abundance in the lake is low despite fingerling stocking efforts. Walleye lengths ranged from 14 to 28 inches and averaged 20 inches long. Bluegill catch rates fell below the target management range, though exceeded size goals. Black Crappie up to 13 inches were sampled. Tullibee (Cisco) have been present in the catch since initial surveying and catch rates exceeded the management goal in 2023. Yellow Perch abundance has remained low across historical surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter in Blackwater Lake include, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Bowfin, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, Rusty Crayfish are the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Blackwater Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 722-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 7.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the east shore off of County Road 11.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco), and yellow perch.    Northern pike are abundant in Blackwater Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 22 inches and fish up to 35 inches were sampled.  Walleye are present in Blackwater Lake, but this catch rate was lower than historical catches.  The mean length and weight were 21 inches and 3 pounds.  Fish up to 25 inches were sampled.  The size structure for walleye consisted of larger fish with 73% of the walleye sampled greater than 20 inches. Largemouth bass are fairly abundant in Blackwater Lake.  They had a mean length of 13 inches with fish up to 21 inches long sampled.  In 2004, a catch-and-release of all bass (largemouth and smallmouth) was implemented on Blackwater Lake.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Blackwater Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 766.7-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 7.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the north shore of the east bay off County Road 11.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlackwater has been known as an excellent lake to catch quality-sized largemouth bass, and the lake has a special regulation for bass requiring all bass caught greater than 12 inches to be released.  Largemouth bass sampled by the DNR in 2011 were abundant and had an average length of 14 inches with fish up to 19 inches long sampled.  Anglers fishing the deepwater structure might catch a bonus smallmouth bass, which also has to be released if greater than 12 inches due the special regulation.  The black crappie population is in good condition and anglers targeting black crappie may find an excellent evening bite during early spring.  Anglers should be careful to avoid over-harvesting crappie at such times.  The walleye population is moderately abundant with excellent size structure.  The 2011 gill net catch rate of 3.75 fish/net was similar to historical catch rates.  Lengths of walleye sampled ranged from 7 to 28 inches and averaged 17 inches.  The size structure for walleye consisted of larger fish with 38% of the walleye sampled greater than 20 inches.  Anglers targeting northern pike have often been successful in Blackwater Lake, frequently catching small to medium size fish which can be excellent candidates for pickling or baking.  Northern pike are abundant in Blackwater Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 21 inches and fish up to 31 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Blackwater Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackwater Lake is a 722-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 7.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the north shore of the east bay off County Road 11.  The DNR has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlackwater is known as an excellent lake to catch some nice largemouth bass, and the lake has a no-kill regulation for bass requiring all bass caught to be released.  Largemouth bass sampled by the DNR in 2008 had a mean length of 13 inches with fish up to 18 inches long sampled.  Anglers fishing the deepwater structure might catch a bonus smallmouth bass, which also has to be released due the no-kill regulation.  Angler targeting black crappie may find a good evening bite during early spring.  Walleye are present in Blackwater Lake and the catch rate was similar to historical catch rates.  The mean length and weight were 19 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  The size structure for walleye consisted of larger fish with 29% of the walleye sampled greater than 20 inches.  Northern pike are abundant in Blackwater Lake and the catch rate has been historically high compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes.  The mean length for northern pike was 21 inches and fish up to 29 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Blackwater Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local MNDNR Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nBlackwater Lake (DOW# 11-0274; Lake Class 25) is a 767-acre lake located near Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access on the northeast shore. Blackwater Lake has 7.63 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 67 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Blackwater Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are deep, clear, and irregularly shaped. <br> \n <br> \nBlackwater Lake is one of the top Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass lakes in the Walker Area. Blackwater has both quantity and quality with fish up to 20 inches. Northern Pike are abundant in Blackwater Lake and catch rates tend to range between 7 and 12 fish per gill net with Northern Pike up to 30 inches sampled. Walleye numbers in Blackwater Lake are moderate and Walleye sampled ranged in length from 8 to 24 inches, with a large percentage of Walleye sampled over 20 inches long. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers, with quality-sized fish present for both species.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish  Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasives have been identified in Blackwater Lake. AIS (aquatic invasive species) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
