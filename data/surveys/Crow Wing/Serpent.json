                "narrative": "<p>Serpent Lake is a 1,057 acre lake located in Crow Wing County.  It spans the cities of Crosby on the west shore and Deerwood on the east.  A public access is located in the Crosby city park on the west end.  Another access is located just north of Deerwood on the east shore.  Serpent reaches depths of 65' with 32% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 22.0'.  Development is heavy along the 8.9 miles of shoreline.  A 2009 survey found 31 species of aquatic plants.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked annually (338lbs/year) into Serpent.  The Walleye gill net catch was above average, when compared to similar lakes, at 6.8/gill net.  Average length was 16.5\", with the largest Walleye measuring 31.0\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average at 6.1/gill net.  Average length was 19.8\" with 11% in the 22\"-26\" protected slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length made up 10% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 3.0/gill net.  Average length was 10.2\".  Smallmouth Bass were captured in average numbers at 0.8/gill net.  Average length was 12.6\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were caught in average numbers at 0.6/gill net, and 0.5/trap net. Average length was 9.9\" for fish sampled in gill nets, and 8.4\" for trap nets.  Black Crappies up to 12.5\" were sampled.  For both gears combined 85% were 8\" or greater in length.  Bluegill numbers were average at 10.1/trap net.  Bluegills ran on the small side with an average length of 4.9\", and only 2% over 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Serpent Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Development is heavy, with about 250 homes/cabins and one resort located along the nine miles of shoreline.  The lake is 65 feet deep and about 32% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Lake water is moderately hard and fertility is also moderate.  Water clarity is somewhat above average for the area.  The bottom soils in water shallower than four feet are primarily sand and gravel.  Spawning habitat is present in adequate amounts for a variety of fish species.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  The variety of submergent and floating leafed species provide important food and cover for numerous fish species.  A variety of emergents help provide shoreline protection and enhance the quality of spawning habitat for largemouth bass and panfish.In 1997, testnetting produced catches of yellow perch, bluegills, pumpkinseeds and yellow bullheads which were in the \"low\" category when compared with similar type lakes.  Catches of largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, brown bullhead and burbot (eelpout) were in the \"average\" category.The northern pike catch of 5.6/gillnet was \"average\" and very similar to catches from 3 of 4 previous nettings.  Average size was 17 inches and 1.1 lbs.. Northern pike to age five were sampled.  Over half were from the 1994 year class.  Growth bordered on slow but was within the range seen in previous nettings.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked on a nearly annual basis for roughly fifty years.  The last stocking blank was in 1984.  The '97 catch of 4.8/gillnet was very similar to catches in 3 of 5 previous nettings and was in the \"average\" category.  Fish from ten differnt year classes were present and growth remained good.  The strongest year class was from 1991.  Walleyes averaged 17 inches and 2.2 lbs. in the '97 netting.Smallmouth bass were first sampled in 1992 and they continue to be caught in \"average\" numbers.  Largemouth bass numbers bordered of \"low\" but were similar to the '92 catch.  Young bass of both species were sampled by shoreline seine.The bluegill catch dropped into the \"low\" category in '97 but the catch was similar to the 1982 catch.  Five age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Both 1995 and 1994 provided strong year classes.  About 11% of bluegills measured to be at least 7.0 inches long, an improvement over the previous two nettings.  Black crappies were only sampled in gill nets and the catch was in the \"average\" category.Yellow perch, an important food source for northern pike and walleyes, was caught in \"low\" numbers, similar to catches in '87 and '92.  Only two age classes were sampled in gill nets.  Reasonable numbers of young perch continued to be found by shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Serpent Lake is a 1,057-acre lake located in Crow Wing County.  It spans the cities of Crosby on the west shore and Deerwood on the east.  A public access is located in the Crosby city park on the west end.  Another access is located just north of Deerwood on the east shore.  Serpent reaches depths of 65' with 32% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 21'.  Development is heavy along the 8.9 miles of shoreline.  A 2009 survey found 31 species of aquatic plants.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked annually (338lbs/year) into Serpent.  The Walleye gill net catch was average, when compared to similar lakes, at 3.7/gill net.  Average length was 16.8\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average at 3.9/gill net.  Average length was 22.3\" with 23% in the 22-26\" protected slot.  Northern Pike at least 26\" in length made up an additional 23% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 2.4/gill net.  Average length was 10.3\".  Smallmouth Bass were captured in average numbers at 0.7/gill net.  Average length was 12.4\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were caught in average numbers at 0.6/gill net. Average length was 9.9\".  Black Crappies at least 8\" in length made up 71% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Serpent Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Serpent lake is a 1,057 acre lake located between the towns of Crosby and Deerwood. There are two public accesses, one on the east shore and one on the northwest.  The lake is heavily developed with over 250 homes/cabins along 9 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 65 ft. and about 32% of the lake is 15 ft. deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 30 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are currently stocked as fingerlings at a rate of two pounds/littoral acre in alternate (odd numbered) years.  The 2008 walleye catch of 4.67/GN was average for the lake class and similar to catches going back to 1987.  The most abundant year class was from 2007 (48% of the catch).  As a result, average size dropped to 13.5 inches and 1.2 pounds compared to the 2002 average of 19.4\" and 2.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in \"average\" numbers in 2008 (6.42/GN) which was similar to the 2002 catch of 6.92/GN.  The 2006 and 2005 year classes were most abundant.  Average size increased from 20.1\" and 1.7 lbs in 2002 to 21.5\" and 2.3 lbs in 2008.  Pike growth remained \"average.\" <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass catch in trap nets showed a statistically valid increase from 0.5/TN to 1.17/TN in 2008.  The spring electrofishing catch increased from 43.4 to 72.0/hr.  Average size decreased slightly compared to 2002.  Smallmouth bass abundance (0.75/GN) increased into the \"average\" category in 2008.  The spring electrofishing catch rate (5.4/hr) was the same as in 2002.  Bass growth rates were \"average.\" <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch of 18.33/TN was similar to that of 2002 (17.58/TN) and was near the lake class median value of 19.83/TN.  Few bluegills of seven inches of longer were sampled in 2008.  Black crappie abundance was \"low\" in trap nets and \"average\" in gill nets.  Most crappies were at least eight inches long in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nTulibees and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's gamefish.  Catches of both were in the \"low\" category in 2008.  Perch, however, showed a statistically valid increase in abundance, compared to 2002. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Serpent Lake is about 1100 acres with a maximum depth of 65 feet; about 31% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Residential development and parkland is evident along most of the shoreline.  A survey targeting the near shore fish community was conducted on Serpent Lake on 16-17 June, 2014.  Sampling sites were 100 feet long and fourteen stations were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 14 stations, but sampling took place from the boat at 1 site where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining was conducted at 13 sites as emergent vegetation, soft sediments, and deep water prevented seining at 1 site.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured the following species of fish: (in alphabetical order) Banded Killifish, Black Crappie, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore survey captured several species that are intolerant of poor water quality and/or shoreline disturbance including: Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass.  Only one tolerant species (Fathead Minnow) was sampled in nearshore sampling.  It was noted that most of the intolerant species were sampled at stations with stands of native vegetation with minimal disturbance along the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The fish IBI score calculated from this survey suggests that Serpent Lake's fish community has not been degraded by excess watershed or shoreline stress to an extent such that it is below an impairment threshold identified for similar lakes in the state. <br> \n <br> \nThis sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   Serpent Lake is located in the Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Serpent Lake is a 1,057 acre lake located in Crow Wing County.  It spans the cities of Crosby on the west shore and Deerwood on the east.  A public access is located in the Crosby city park on the west end.  Another access is located just north of Deerwood on the east shore.  Serpent reaches depths of 65' with 32% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 20.0'.  Development is heavy along the 8.9 miles of shoreline.  A 2009 survey found 31 species of aquatic plants.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked into Serpent in odd-numbered years.  All walleyes aged were from stocked years.  The walleye gillnet catch was average, when compared to similar lakes, at 3.6/net.  Average size was 17.4\" and 2.1lbs, with the largest measuring 26.0\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were above average at 9.0/gillnet.  Average size was 20.5\" and 2.1lbs.  Some larger fish are present with 15% of northern pike being 24\" or greater in length, the largest being 36.7\".  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help keep a balanced northern pike population.  Eight year classes were present, with 75% of the catch being from the 2011 and 2012 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 154.5/hr.  Average size length was 10.4\", and 25% were 12\" or greater.  Largemouth were caught in above average numbers in gillnets at 2.1/net.  Largemouth caught in gillnets averaged 11.9\", with 56% measuring 12\" or greater.  Smallmouth bass were sampled during the spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 5.8/hr.  Average length was 12.9\" and 57% measured greater than 12\" in length.  Smallmouth were sampled in average numbers in gillnets at 1.3/net.  Average length of these fish was 16.2\" with 94% over 12\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were caught in average numbers at 1.6/gillnet, and 0.5/trapnet. Average length was 7.3\" for gillnet caught fish, and 8.8\" for trapnets.  Crappies up to 13.5\" were sampled.  For both gears combined 38% were 8\" or greater in length.  Bluegill numbers were below average at 7.2/trapnet.  Bluegills ran on the small side with an average length of 5.1\", and only 8% over 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Serpent Lake at this time, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Serpent Lake is a 1,057 acre lake located between the towns of Crosby and Deerwood.  There are two public accesses, one on the east and on on the west end of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with over 250 homes/cabins along 9 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 65' and about 32% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 30 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes are currently stocked as fingerlings at a rate of 1lb per littoral acre.  The 2002 walleye catch of 4.3/gill  net was average when compared to similar lakes and is similar to past catches.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes represented 59% of the catch and are approximately 17\" to 21\" in length.  Compared to 1997, average length and weight increased from 17.8\" and 2.2lbs to 19.4\" and 2.4lbs.Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2002 at 6.9/gill net, which is similar to past catches.  The 1999 and 2000 year classes contributed 76% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 17\" to 23\".  Compared to 1997, average length and weight increased from 17.6\" and 1.1lbs to 20.1\" and 1.7lbs.The largemouth bass catch of 0.5/trap net was similar to past catches on Serpent and similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 43.4/hr with an average length of 12.7\" and 60% measuring at least 12\".  Smallmouth bass abundance was below average at 0.2/gill net.  The electrofishing catch rate was 5.4/hr and the average length of these smallmouth bass was 15.2\".  About 93% of these fish were 12\" or larger.The bluegill catch of 17.6/trap net was average and 2.4% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 11% in 1997.  The 1998 and 1999 year classes represented 82% of the catch.  Black crappie abundance was average in 2002 at 0.9/trap net.  Average weight was 0.5lbs and 93% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's gamefish and were below average in numbers in 2002.  Only one tullibee was caught in 2002 and while small yellow perch were relatively abundant in shoreline seining, the 2002 abundance of 0.3/gill net was the lowest to date.</p>",

The bowfin, black, yellow and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye populations are average as indicated by the net catch rates, with net catches falling between the first and third quartile of Brainerd Area median for similar type lakes. The white sucker and black crappie net catches indicate low populations with catches below the first quartile of the area median. The northern pike population is up compared to the 1982 survey. The 1987 gillnet catch of 9.7/ lift is compared to 6.0 in 1982. The length- frequency range was good with fish from 9.0- 29.9 inches in the net catches. The bulk of the population was in the 17-18 inch size classes. They also exhibited very slow growth rates. The black, yellow and brown bullhead showed strong gains in populations present compared to previous surveys. The majority of the fish were in the 10- 12 inch range. The largemouth bass population also showed increases over the past two surveys (1974-1982), with catch rates at 1/lift in both trap and gillnets. The natural reproduction field check showed good recruitment of young-of-the-year class. The black crappie population remained very low and has remained low since the 1968 survey. The yellow perch population susceptible to our netting equipment is very low, yet the natural reproduction field check indicated good recruitment at young-of-the-year and yearling classes.  The walleye population is down as indicated by the net catches compared to previous surveys, yet our gillnet catches are higher than statewide medians with the length frequency range being excellent with sizes from 9.0 thru 24.9 inches. The distribution was relatively even from 14.0-21.0 inches. All year classes present showed slow to good growth rates as compared to statewide averages.</p>",

Other species were found at average abundances for the lake class.  The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether changes in northern pike and yellow perch catches represented changes in abundances since the 1987 netting.  Details are appended to the report. The catch of northern pike fell from 9.67/gillnet in 1987 to 6.11 in 1992.  Statistical comparison of individual net catches indicated (5% significance level) that abundance of northern pike was not different from 1987.  Ages 2-5 were sampled, growth was good and mean size rose to 1.65 lbs (1.25 lbs in 1987), average for the lake class.  Walleye abundance (5.0/gillnet) remained high and similar to 1987 (4.89/gillnet).  Ages 1-7 and 9-10 were sampled. The one missing year class, 1984, was the one year walleyes were not stocked.  Growth was good and stocking success appeared to be fairly consistent. The largemouth bass catch (0.2/trapnet) was low in 1992.  A sample composite from all nets provided bass aged yoy (young of year)-5 which had good growth.  Smallmouth bass was first sampled in 1992, and abundance (0.56/gillnet) was average.  Ages yoy-4 were present in the sample. Bluegill abundance (20.5/trapnet) was average and similar to 1987 (20.1/trapnet).  Only 1.7% of bluegills measured from trapnet were at least 7.0 inches (2.8% in 1987), but bluegills to 9.0-9.4 inches were sampled by gillnet.  Black crappie (0.2/trapnet) remained low in abundance, but averaged 0.23 lb.  Average abundance (1.9/trapnet) and size (0.17 lb.) was average for the lake class.  Yellow perch (1.33/gillnet) had low abundance.  Statistical comparison of individual net catches indicated (5% sig. level) that abundance of perch was not different from 1987 (3.22/gillnet), ages 3-4 were present in 1992, while ages yoy and 3-8 were found in 1987.  Perch growth was good in 1992.  White sucker (0.33/gillnet) had low abundance and a small average size (1.33 lbs). Bowfin (0.10/trapnet) was caught in low numbers and size was large (6.3 lbs).  Brown bullhead (1.2/trapnet) had high abundance, while yellow bullhead (1.6/trapnet) was average in abundance.  Black bullhead (0.33/lift) was caught only in gillnets.</p>",
