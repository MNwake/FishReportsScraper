                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake is a 423 acre lake located just north of Osage in Becker County.  Straight Lake is a narrow lake with an outlet dam that maintains the lake about 13 feet above its natural level. Straight Lake provides a fine fishery for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.The 1995 walleye gillnet catch of 9.6/net is the highest catch in six surveys dating back to 1955.  The previous survey in 1990 had a gillnet catch of 4.6/net, while the previous high gillnet catch was 7.0/net in 1973 and 1980. Average size of walleye was large, 2.2 lbs and 17.8 inches, with fish measured up to 27.0 inches.  Thirty-six percent of the sampled walleye were 20.0 inches or larger.  Walleye were in excellent body condition (weight and size) due to the abundant forage base of tullibee (cisco) and yellow perch.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Straight Lake every other year on even numbered years.  The walleye population is maintained by stocking with little or no natural reproduction, as evidenced by the fact that all walleye sampled correspond to years of walleye stockings.  No walleye were sampled from non-stocked years.Straight Lake has a history of having an abundant northern pike population, and the 1995 survey showed no difference, with a gillnet catch of 12.9/net.  Historical northern pike gillnet catches have fluctuated from high to moderate levels.  The two previous surveys had a northern pike gillnet catch of 10.0/net in 1990 and 6.5/net in 1985.  Northern pike had an average size of 2.3 lbs and 21.3 inches.  Sixteen percent of the sample was 25.0 inches or larger, with northern pike measured up to 30.5 inches.Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers at 19.1/trapnet, similar to previous surveys.  Size of sampled bluegills was fair, averaging 5.6 inches in the trapnets and 6.1 inches in the gillnets.  Five percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or larger.Straight Lake has populations of both largemouth bass and black crappie.  Standard survey gear is usually not effective in evaluating populations of these species, however some general inferences can be made.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (1.3/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Black crappie catches were low, similar to past surveys with fish sampled up to 9.9 inches.Yellow perch catches were high at 55.1/gillnet.  Historical gillnet catches have fluctuated from 10.6/net in 1990 to 151.3/net in 1955.  Size of yellow perch was small, with an average length of 7.0 inches and with only 2% of the sample 9.0 inches or larger.  Yellow perch up to 10.1 inches were sampled. Both yellow and brown bullheads were sampled.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers at 2.5/gillnet, while brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers at 0.1/gillnet.  Both bullhead species were large in size.Pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), and hybrid sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers.  White sucker catches were high at 5.0/gillnet, similar to past surveys.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake is located in Osage, in eastern Becker County.  Straight has a surface area of 471 acres and a maximum depth of 63 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Straight is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), with very irregularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, Island, Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Mantrap, Ojibway, Spider, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance decreased during the 2020 survey but was in the upper range of similar lakes in lake class 25.  A typical walleye caught by an angler will be in the 14-23 inch range.  The average length of walleye surveyed was 19 inches, with the largest sampled being 27.6 inches.  Yellow Perch are an important forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Perch abundance was down from previous surveys, but it is comparable for other similar lakes.  However, Yellow Perch were small with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is going to be high, and the size is going to be on the small side.  The average length and weight was 22.3 inches and 2.62 pounds respectively.  The largest Northern Pike sampled was 36 inches. <br> \n <br> \nStraight Lake has been a popular lake for panfish, especially during the winter.  Angling opportunities include Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Black Crappie were sampled ranged from 3.5-11.5 inches in length, but anglers can find acceptable size Crappies in the 9-11.5 inch range.  Most Bluegill sampled were 4-7 inches with some sampled over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee have a sport gill netting season in December on Straight Lake.  They are an important forage species for larger Walleye and Northern Pike.  Tullibee abundance was the highest ever recorded with an average length of 10.5 inches and the largest sampled was 15.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPurple loosestrife is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Straight Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Catch of largemouth bass was very high; black crappie catch is within normal range for lake of this type.Management Recommendations:With the high population of small panfish and yellow perch, rescue northern pike and large fingerling walleye can be stocked every other year.  No other management needed.  The stocking of musky for an additional fisheries has been suggested but due to small size of the lake and a good northern pike population muskellunge should not be considered.Population of yellow perch markedly lower than in previous survey.  White suckers, pumpkinseeds, bluegills, and largemouth bass are far more abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake is located in eastern Becker County, adjacent to the town of Osage.  Straight Lake has a surface area of 423 acres and a maximum depth of 63 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located at the south end of the lake.  Straight Lake has good walleye and northern pike populations and is a very popular lake for panfishing.  The south end of the lake (\"Mill Pond\") is a popular location for ice fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types base on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Straight Lake is in class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Spider, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Straight Lake has a very good walleye population.  Walleye abundance (8.7 walleye/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  Surveys since 1995 have had similar walleye abundance, with gillnet catch rates above the current management goal.  Big walleyes are found in Straight Lake with walleye measured up to 29.1 inches.  Straight Lake has good populations of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) that provide an excellent forage base for producing large walleye.  Straight Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate of 5.7 pike/gillnet was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance from 1990 to 2005 was higher, with gillnet catch rates above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.7 inches.   The number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) sampled was higher than past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are highly sought by anglers on Straight Lake.  Bluegill abundance (14.1 bluegill/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappies were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-12 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during spring electrofishing (82/hr).  While abundance was good, the number of larger bass (> 15.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Straight Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of hybrid sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead, brown bullhead, and green sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake is located in eastern Becker County, adjacent to the town of Osage.  Straight Lake is formed by a dam on the Straight River that maintains the lake about 13 feet above its natural level.  Straight Lake has a surface area of 423 acres and a maximum depth of 63 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located at the south end of the lake.  Straight Lake has good walleye and northern pike populations and is a very popular lake for panfishing.  The south end of the lake (\"Mill Pond\") is a popular location for ice fishing.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Straight Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Eagle, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Spider, and Two Inlets.Walleye abundance was up, with the gillnet catch rate of 10.2 walleye/net the highest recorded for all surveys on Straight Lake dating back to 1955.  The 2005 walleye catch rate is above the current management goal of 7.0 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.8 pounds.  A very aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR is maintaining the walleye population in Straight Lake.  Age analysis from present and past surveys have shown that the majority of the walleye population is from years of walleye stocking.  Straight Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even years.  Straight Lake has an abundant forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco).  This abundant food supply results in good walleye growth rates.  Straight Lake has been identified as a lake that could benefit from increased walleye stocking due to excellent survival of stocked fish and an abundant forage base.  Starting in the fall of 2006, the walleye fingerling stocking rate will be increased on Straight Lake.Straight Lake has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 9.2 pike/gillnet is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) was low compared to other area lakes.  Panfish are highly sought by anglers on Straight Lake.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled during spring electrofishing (41 bass/hour).  While abundance was good, the number of larger bass (> 15.0 inches) was low compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Straight Lake.Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and rock bass, and moderate numbers of white sucker, hybrid sunfish, and brown bullhead.  Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tStraight Lake is located in Osage, in eastern Becker County. Straight has a surface area of 471 acres and a maximum depth of 63 feet. A state-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Straight is in lake class 25. Class 25 lakes generally have a very high percentage of littoral area (depths less than 15 feet), with very irregularly shaped shoreline. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Eagle, Island, Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Mantrap, Ojibway, Spider, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked. <br> \n\tWalleye abundance continues to be consistent since 1995, and well above similar lakes. Many Walleyes are a great size for anglers of 15-20 inches. The average length was 18 inches, with the largest sampled at 28.8 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Perch abundance was in line with similar lakes and past surveys. Most perch were small with an average size of 6 inches.  <br> \n\tNorthern Pike abundance was in line with similar lakes. The average size was 22 inches, and 2.5 lbs.  The largest Northern Pike sampled was 36 inches, with more large fish sampled than any past surveys. <br> \n\tAngling for panfish is popular on Straight Lake, especially during the winter. Fish sampled covered all year classes indicating good fishing for now, and for the future. Black Crappie abundance was comparable to past surveys and similar lakes, and fish were 4-10.5 inches in length. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was slightly lower than recent years, and most fish were 3-8.5 inches. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass abundance was lower than previous years, but the size was very good with an average size of 12 inches and fish sampled up to 17.5 inches. <br> \n\tTullibee require cold water with good dissolved oxygen to survive in lakes. Tulibee have a sport gill netting season in the fall and early winter on Straight Lake. They are an important forage species for larger Walleye and Northern Pike. Tulibee abundance was slightly lower than similar lakes but size was good, with an average size of 10.5 inches and the largest was 15 inches. <br> \n\tCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Straight. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

The long narrow basin presents a large area of productive littoral zone.Examination of the fish catch in the test nets indicates a high perch population and a good population of northern pike.  The walleye catch in the gillnets was near that of the state-wide median.  Perch and pumpkinseeds exhibit slow growth.  All other species examined appear to be growing at a rate near that of the state-wide average.Notes by Biologist:During the three year period of 1948 through 1950, 87,130 walleye fingerlings were stocked in Straight Lake.  This is a total of 157 fingerling per acre for the three year period.  Only 17 walleyes were taken in six gillnet lifts in the 1955 survey.  Ten of the seventeen walleyes taken in the survey, were from year classes in which there had been no stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake is located in eastern Becker County, adjacent to the town of Osage.  Straight Lake is formed by a dam on the Straight River that maintains the lake about 13 feet above its natural level.  Straight Lake has a surface area of 423 acres and a maximum depth of 63 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located at the south end of the lake.  Straight Lake has  good walleye and northern pike populations and is a very popular lake for panfishing.  The south end of the lake (\"Mill Pond\") is a popular location for ice fishing.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Straight Lake is in class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Eagle, Island, and Two Inlets.Good numbers of walleye were sampled (8.8 walleye/gillnet), similar to the previous survey in 1995.  This walleye catch rate is above the management goal of 6.5 walleye/gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  The walleye population in Straight Lake is maintained by a very successful stocking program conducted by the DNR.  Straight Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even years.  Straight Lake has an abundant forage base of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco).  This abundant food supply results in good walleye growth rates, however, walleye fishing can sometimes be difficult competing with all this forage.  In 1998 Straight Lake was identified as a lake that could benefit from increased walleye stocking due to excellent survival of stocked fish and an abundant forage base.  Starting in the fall of 2000 the walleye stocking rate was increased from 1 pound walleye/littoral acre to 1.5 pounds walleye/littoral acre.Straight Lake has an abundant northern pike population.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 11.4 pike/gillnet is above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have had similar northern pike abundance.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.  The number of larger pike (> 28.0) inches was low when compared to other area lakes.Panfish are highly sought after by anglers on Straight Lake.  Bluegill abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Good numbers of 6 to 7 inch bluegill are present as well as a few larger fish up to 9.3 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, similar to past surveys.  Average size of black crappie was 9.0 inches. Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Straight Lake to assess the largemouth bass population.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled (71.0 bass/hour).  While abundance  was good, bass were small in size.  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length of 9.5 inches and the number of bass over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  One 19.0 inch smallmouth bass was sampled during spring electrofishing.  This is the first time that smallmouth bass have been sampled in Straight Lake.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead, and low numbers of black bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, golden shiner, and green sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Straight Lake (03-0010-00) is a 471.44-acre lake with a maximum depth of 63 feet located next to Osage, MN.  Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 23, 2020 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, nine sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with one being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured thirteen species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Molted Sculpin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 24, 2020, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Straight Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Straight Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
