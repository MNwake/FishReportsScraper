                "narrative": "<p>Bachelor Lake is a moderately fertile 53 acre lake located in Aitkin County just southwest of the city of Aitkin.  The shoreline surrounding the lake has minimal development with most of the shoreline made up of marshland, undeveloped forest or woodland, and grassland.  The lake is characterized by a larger, deep basin connected to a small, shallow basin via a shallow, narrow channel.  Since 57% of the lake's surface area is made up of water depths less than 15 feet, there may be potential for a partial fish winterkill during favorable winterkill conditions.  However, a fish winterkill has never been reported.  Currently, management of the fishery is primarily for northern pike and black crappie with largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2001 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, three gill nets, nine trap nets, and two shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual for Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.  Northern pike abundance and an average weight of 2.8 pounds were within a normal range for this type of lake.  However, northern pike numbers have more than doubled since 1991.  Pike lengths ranged from 13.7 to 35.2 inches.  Bachelor Lake northern pike growth was normal when compared to statewide averages.  Spring night electrofishing and summer trap netting sampled 57 largemouth bass with lengths extending from 5.7 to 16.5 inches.  Bass abundance appears to be good with a broad range of sizes represented.  Black crappie numbers were found at above normal levels for this lake type.  When compared to historical assessments, crappie abundance in 2001 was the highest ever documented by DNR surveys.  Crappie lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.8 inches with 71% of the fish sampled between 7.0 and 8.5 inches.  Black crappie growth was normal at all ages.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were at normal abundance levels in 2001.  Bluegill lengths extended from 3.4 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches and pumpkinseed sunfish ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.   Sunfish growth was found to be normal at ages 1 and 6-9 and below normal at ages 2-5.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike, were sampled at a normal level for this lake type.  The sampled fish community in Bachelor Lake also included blackchin shiner, dog fish, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.An angler fishing Bachelor Lake will have to gain permission to access through private property since there is not a public access.  An abundance of northern pike and largemouth bass may be encountered with a good chance of hooking a memorable sized fish.  Fishing enthusiasts who target panfish can expect a fair number of black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish, but sizes are small.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns or crop land, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

The trap net indices for brown bullheads, rock bass and bluegill were below their respective lake class 33 first quartiles.  Northern pike (10 of 10 aged) ranged from two to seven years of age.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was faster than normal.  Growth rates for the fourth and fifth annual increments were slower than normal. Total length at formation at the fifth annulus was normal.  Bluegill (38 of 48 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987.  Growth rates for the first, second and third annual increments were slower than normal.  Growth rates for the fifth, sixth and seventh annual increments were faster than normal.  Total length at formation of the seventh annulus indicates slower than normal growth.  Largemouth bass (10 of 11 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age.  Growth rates for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth annual increments were normal.  Black crappie (8 of 8 aged) ranged from three to six years of age.
