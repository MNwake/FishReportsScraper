                "narrative": "<p>Fountain is a 430-acre lake located southeast of the City of Montrose in Wright County.  It is a relatively shallow and eutrophic lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet.   Fountain Lake has relatively large amounts of floating leaf and emergent plants such as yellow water lily, cattail and bulrush.  However, little submerged vegetation exists. Much of the bottom substrate is soft mud; but some areas of firmer sandy substrate were observed.  A state owned public access is located on the north side of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFountain Lake has experienced partial winterkills in the past.  It is presumed that low dissolved oxygen levels were experienced during the most recent severe winter of 2013-14.  Because of its intermittent connection to the Crow River, restocking has been unnecessary after periods of partial winterkill and no records of stocking for Fountain Lake exists. <br> \n <br> \nA brief investigation was conducted on September 11-12, 2017 using six standard lake survey trap nets to update records regarding the species composition of the lake. A limited variety of winterkill tolerant fish species were sampled as a result of this investigation. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch (71.5/trap net) was high while the average size (7.1 inches) was small. The Green Sunfish catch (39.7/trap net) was also high and fish ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.0 inches with an average length of 5.0 inches. Ten Common Carp were also sampled and ranged in length from 18.2 to 29.8 inches and averaged 20.1 inches. A total of only four Brown Bullhead were sampled averaged 12.6 inches in length.  A single 15.2 inch White Sucker was also sampled. <br> \n</p>",
