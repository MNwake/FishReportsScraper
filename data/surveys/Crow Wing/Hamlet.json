Bowfin, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass and black crappie are present in average numbers when compared with catch rates from lake class 23. Growth rates for northern pike were below average, and the individual sizes were small. Ages two thru seven were represented with three and four comprising 56% of the fish that were aged. Length frequencies ranged from 10 to 25 inches with 12 to 17 inch fish comprising 72% of the fish measured. Bluegill population numbers and individual sizes were average, but growth rates were slow and the age structure tended to be much older than normal. Ninety-seven percent of the fish aged were six years old and older and individual lengths of these fish were 5 to 6 inches. Largemouth bass numbers and individual sizes were average, but growth rates of the fish aged tended to be slow. Black crappie growth rates were average as well as numbers and individual sizes. Seven out of eight fish sampled were in the eight-inch length group.</p>",
