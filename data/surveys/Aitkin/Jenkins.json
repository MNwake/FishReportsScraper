Overabundance, coupled with low    lake productivity, results in slow growth, and bluegills in Jenkins Lake typify this pattern.    Bluegills in the trap nets averaged only 4.7 inches long and the largest fish was only 7.4    inches.  The largemouth bass are using the  abundant bluegills as forage and are doing well. Bass    up to 19 inches were caught in the nets. Northern pike are relatively abundant and are slow    growing. Few yellow perch and no white suckers have been caught in past surveys, indicating a    lack of prime forage for northern pike. The lack of prime forage results in slower pike growth.    Northern pike average only about 19 inches long. However, several larger northern pike (>28    inches) have been caught in various surveys, indicating the potential for good northern pike    fishing.  Black crappie abundance remains low, and the fish are often large, up to 13 inches.    Only two walleyes were caught in this assessment. Few walleyes were caught in previous surveys. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegills in Jenkins Lake have been decreasing in trap net catches for the past three surveys. The number of bluegills decreased from 78 per net in 1989 to less than 12 per net in 2004. The decrease in bluegill abundance has corresponded to a slight increase in bluegill size as the mean length increased from 4.7 inches in 1994 to 5.5 inches in 2004. There were also some hybrid sunfish sampled over 8 inches in length. Northern pike were common in the gillnet and one individual measured nearly 34 inches total length. Previous surveys have also documented the presence of some larger northern pike in this fishery. The low productivity, small size of lake, and lack of yellow perch and white sucker limits the ability of Jenkins Lake to produce any appreciable numbers of large northern pike.  Trace numbers of walleyes have been sampled in all surveys conducted on Jenkins Lake except for the initial survey conducted in 1970. Three walleyes were sampled in 2004 which translates to 0.5 walleye per gillnet lift. Only one largemouth bass was sampled in 2004, which is not surprising due to sampling limitations, however, there has been anecdotal reports of some decent largemouth bass caught by anglers.  The Jenkins Lake Association has been periodically stocking walleye and black crappie from private aquaculture since 1999 in an effort to supplement the existing populations.</p>",

The gillnet indices for yellow perch and walleye are below the first regional quartiles for these species. The trap net indices for bowfin, yellow bullhead, bluegill and largemouth bass are above the third regional quartiles for these species. Northern pike ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1983, 1984 and 1985. The third through the seventh growth increments showed a progressive decline in growth rates from twenty two percent slower than normal to thirty-six percent slower than normal. Bluegill ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1981, 1982 and 1983 and pre 1981. Growth rates for the first through the fifth growth increments ranged from twenty-six to sixty percent slower than normal with the second and third annual increments being sixty and fifty-four percent slower than normal respectively. Largemouth bass ranged from two to six years of age with seven of the fish sampled from the 1986 year class. The growth rates for the second and third growth increments were twenty-two and thirty-five percent faster than normal. Black crappie ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated from 1986. Growth rates were very variable with the first, second and sixth growth increments ranging from twenty-one to thirty percent slower than normal and the fourth and fifth growth increments thirty-seven and fifty percent faster than normal respectively.</p>",
