                "narrative": "<p>Minnow Lake is located just north of State Highway 2 and just west of the city of Bagley in Clearwater County.  It is an occasional winter kill lake, with a shallow basin, small surface area and lots of aquatic vegetation.  The size and numbers of fish found in Minnow Lake are determined by the frequency and severity of winter kill events.  The fish community of Minnow Lake can also be dominated by species that are more tolerant of low oxygen conditions and that can recolonize the lake through its connection to the Clearwater River.  These include Northern pike, Yellow perch, and Bullhead species.  The management plan for Minnow Lake includes re-stocking the lake with adult Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass after confirmed winter kill events.  When winter kill events occur less frequently, these species can become established, grow fairly quickly and provide good fishing opportunities until the next winter kill occurs.  The last stocking of these species occurred in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 fish population assessment of Minnow Lake found Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike in good numbers, but Largemouth Bass, which have been present in past assessments, were not captured in 2014.  Walleye have been nearly absent in the past two assessments despite regular fry stocking.  The catch rates for both Black Crappie and Bluegill were similar to average catch rates in other similar lakes.  Black Crappie up to 12.05 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 10.34 inches.  A total of 7 year classes of Black Crappie were identified, which indicates that the fish are reproducing successfully.  Black Crappie currently provide the most notable fishing opportunity in Minnow Lake.  Bluegill captured in the 2014 assessment had an average length of just 5.12 inches with some fish up to 7.7 inches in length present.   Northern pike catch rates were much higher than average for similar lakes but fish captured had a small average size (20.39 inches in length and 1.9 lbs/fish).  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2014 assessment was 35.98 inches in length.  Other species captured in the 2014 assessment were Yellow Perch and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnow Lake is three miles west of Bagley in west-central Clearwater County.  The state-owned public access is located on the northeast corner of the lake and consists of an earthen boat ramp with a gravel parking area.  To get there, follow Clearwater County 45 two and one-half miles west from Bagley, then south one-half mile. <br> \n <br> \nMinnow Lake is a 102 acre lake with a maximum depth of 24 feet and a moderately developed shoreline.  It is an occasional winterkill lake, characterized by a shallow basin, large amount of littoral (shallow water) area, and a fish community usually dominated by species more tolerant to low oxygen conditions such as northern pike, yellow perch, and bullheads.  It is managed primarily for walleye and yellow perch and secondarily for black crappie and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nMinnow Lake has a long history of low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter months.  Because of this, walleye fry stocking success has been variable.  The highest walleye abundance on record occurred in 1983 and was likely the result of stocking into a void created by a substantial winterkill event.  Conversely, there were no walleye captured in either the 1990 or 2009 assessments, while the 1999 assessment yielded walleye very close to the management goal.  Recent walleye fry stockings have not been very effective, most likely due to a lack of winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were extirpated from Minnow Lake in the late 1970s during a series of severe winterkill events, and were absent from the fish community until the mid-1990s.  By 2009, northern pike had become abundant and size structure of the population was good.  A typical Minnow Lake northern pike is about 23 inches long, and it reaches that size sometime during its fourth growing season.  Pike grow very fast in Minnow Lake, possibly due to their previous absence and subsequent reestablishment.  <br> \n <br> \nSpecies composition of Minnow Lake appears to have shifted due to a reduced frequency of winterkill events.  Prior to 2009, black crappie were captured in low numbers.  However, in 2009, black crappie abundance was high, although size structure of the population indicated many small fish, and growth rates are slow. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population appears to recover from winterkill events more slowly.  In 2009, bluegill abundance was low and average size was small.  Abundance and quality were considerably better in 1990; it is likely that some degree of winterkill that occurred after 1990 decimated the bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nIn Minnow Lake, yellow perch abundance fluctuates considerably.  In 2009, they were fairly abundant.  Ten percent of perch captured in 2009 were greater than nine inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe most dramatic fish community shift that has occurred recently is in the bullhead community.  Overall bullhead abundance has declined considerably since 1999, and species composition seems to have shifted from primarily black and brown bullhead to mostly yellow bullhead.  This is generally considered to be a positive indicator for water quality and the fish community as a whole. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnow Lake is north of State Highway 2 just west of the city of Bagley.  It is an occasional winterkill lake, characterized by a shallow basin, high littoral area, and a fish community dominated by species more tolerant to low oxygen conditions.  Active management is limited in scope to winter oxygen monitoring, with ensuing spring trap net assessments when fish kills are suspected, walleye fry stocking two out of three years, and reintroduction of adult largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie after winterkills.  Walleye fry are stocked at a heavier rate after winterkills.  A ditch outlet to the Clearwater River may allow some migration of fish into and out of the lake.Walleye are common but abundance and size are determined by the frequency of winterkills and the time elapsed since the last major winterkill.  All walleye sampled in the current assessment (n=19) were between 11.0 and 19.5 inches and most ages coincided with fry stocked years.Northern pike are abundant and reproduce naturally in the system.  The largest northern pike sampled was 34.8 inches but the average length was 21.6 inches.Bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass are currently present, but none are abundant.  Again, the population density and fish size are governed by the frequency and last occurrence of winterkills.  A few quality fish of each species are present.Bullheads are the only other species that were sampled in large numbers in the 1999 assessment.  Black bullheads are abundant, brown bullheads are common, and yellow bullheads are rare.  Most are small but some may be acceptable to anglers.  Other fish species sampled in small numbers in this assessment included yellow perch and white sucker.  Most of the fish sampled in this assessment were free of external parasites but most walleye had light black spot infestations.</p>",
