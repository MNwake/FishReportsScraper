Northern Pike (NOP) were the most abundant predator species sampled and at the highest gill net catch rate ever observed for this lake. The average size of NOP sampled was 19.35 inches and 1.77 pounds. Northern Pike 24.0 inches or larger made up 11.3% of the overall catch. Walleye were sampled on the low end of the normal range for abundance in lakes of this type. The average size of Walleye sampled was 15.8 inches and 1.65 pounds. Largemouth Bass (LMB) are present in good abundance. The electrofishing catch rate for LMB was 72.4 fish/hour with the average size being 10.14 inches and 0.69 pounds. Largemouth Bass up to 18.1 inches were observed during this survey. Growth rates for all major predator species are fair.Bluegill and Black Crappie were sampled within the normal range for abundance. Black Crappie averaged only 6.94 inches and 0.18 pounds each with 23.1% of all fish sampled being 8.0 inches or larger (largest sampled 10.4\"). Bluegill averaged 5.27 inches and 0.12 pounds with 36.1% of sampled fish being 6.0 inches or larger and 6.9% are 7.0 inches or larger (largest sampled 8.66 inches). Yellow perch are also present, but they have been sampled in low numbers for this lake since 1983.  </p>",

Northern Pike and Walleye are primary management species in Big Carnelian Lake, and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are secondary management species.   <br> \n <br> \nA near shore Index of Biotic Integrity survey (IBI) was conducted on August 8-9, 2016 to assess populations of non-game species, young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish, and overall lake health using backpack electrofishing and seining. Electrofishing with a backpack unit and seining were conducted at 10 stations around the perimeter of Big Carnelian Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nEleven different species of fish were captured during Nearshore IBI sampling: Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Largemouth Bass, Spotfin Shiner, Spottail Shiner, and Yellow Perch.  Catches were significantly higher in seine hauls than via backpack electrofishing, and Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, and Banded Killifish were the most common species sampled.  Four intolerant species and two tolerant species were sampled, and Big Carnelian Lake recieved an IBI score of 43.5 based on data from this survey and the 2015 standard survey.</p>",

Northern Pike (NOP) and Walleye (WAE) are primary management species in Big Carnelian Lake, and Largemouth Bass (LMB) and Bluegill (BLG) are secondary management species.  A 24-36 inch protected slot length for Northern Pike was implemented in 2003 with the intention of increasing the size of pike present in Big Carnelian Lake.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually at a rate of 1.5lbs fish/littoral acre (196lbs) in the fall. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 6.63 fish/net in gillnets, which is between the 2nd and 3rd quartiles for abundance in class 24 lakes.  This was the lowest gillnet CPUE for Northern Pike in Big Carnelian Lake since 1998, but within the historical ranges for the lake.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in 2015 was 17.2 inches.  Walleyes were sampled at 0.25 per gillnet, the lowest CPUE since 1993 and below the first quartile for class 24 lakes.  Only two Walleyes were sampled in this survey and both were over 20 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 87.88/hr by night-time electrofishing in the 2015 survey, and bass up to 19.21 inches were sampled.  The average size of bass sampled was 10.46 inches, 23% of sampled bass were longer than 12 inches and 7% were longer than 16 inches.  Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 6.67/net in trap nets and 8.88/net in gillnets during the 2015 survey.  This was the lowest trap net CPUE ever recorded for bluegill in Big Carnelian Lake, and was below the 1st quartile for abundance in class 24 lakes.   The average length of Bluegills in combined gillnet and trap net catches was 6.6 inches, with individuals up to 9 inches sampled and 48% of the catch was longer than 7 inches.   Black Crappies were sampled below the first quartile for abundance in trap nets (0.33/net) and gillnets (0.88/set).  Black Crappies up 10.67 inches were sampled, and 40% of sampled crappies were 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, and black crappies are present in lower numbers than the statewide median.  The northern pike population is much higher than in the early 1950's which is probably due to recent increased water levels allowing successful spawning to take place.  Yellow bullhead are the dominant species with brown bullhead having been previously reported (1952, 1973).  The bluegill is abundant with relatively few fish 6 inches or longer present.  As has been the case in previous investigations black crappie are not present in high numbers with some large fish being present.</p>",

A moderate number of walleye were captured.  All were between 16.5 and 18.5 inches.  Walleye are not stocked and have only been sampled occasionally in the past.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers.  They were small with lengths ranged from 3 to 7 inches, and an average of only 4.5 inches.  Black crappie were also sampled in moderate numbers.  Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 13 inches and averaged 8 inches.  Pumkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish were all sampled in moderate to high numbers.  Yellow perch, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead were all sampled in low numbers.  Bullhead were generally large - average length over 11 inches.

Analysis of past fisheries surveys resulted in a 24-36 inch protected slot length limit being proposed for this lake. Public meetings resulted in a favorable response from area angers and implementation of this regulation commenced with the 2003 fishing opener on May 10th. The specific objective of this regulation is to develop a Northern Pike population where 20% or more of the population measured by spring trap net sampling exceeds 30.0 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 spring sampling of the Northern Pike population resulted in a trap net catch of 1.98 fish/net.  The size of the pike sampled ranged from 7.83 inches to 30.83 inches. The average fish sampled was 16.56 inches long and 1.13 pounds. Only 21% of the pike sampld measured 21 inches or longer and none exceeded the protected slot limit length of 36 inches. 1% of the pike samped exceeded 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were also sampled during the assessment. They averaged 23.6 inches in length and weighed an average of 4.9 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

Analysis of past fisheries surveys resulted in a 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit being proposed. Public meetings resulted in a favorable response from area anglers and implementation of this regulation commenced with the 2003 fishing opener. The specific objective of this regulation is to develop a northern pike population where 20.0% of the population exceeds 30.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 spring sampling of the northern pike population resulted in a trap net catch of 2.31 fish /set. The size of northern pike sampled ranged from 7.44 to 30.2 inches in length. The average length of fish sampled was 18.04 inches and the average weight was 1.6 pounds. Of all the northern pike sampled, 16.7% measured 24.0 inches or larger and 3.33% were 30.0 inches or larger. None of the fish sampled exceeded the protected slot limit length of 36.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were also sampled during the assessment. Their numbers have increased since the 2003 netting. Annual walleye stocking commenced in 2001 and is most likely the reason for the increase.        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Recent management activities on Big Carnelian Lake have consisted of the implementation of a 24-36 inch protected slot length limit for Northern Pike (NOP) and the annual stocking of Walleye (WAE) fingerlings beginning in 2001. Presently, WAE are stocked at a rate of 1.5 pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre (196.0 lbs) annually.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in the highest abundance of any of the major predator species. The gill net catch rate was the second highest ever recorded on this lake and down slightly from the 2003 catch rate. The average size of gill net sampled NOP was 18.65 inches and 1.65 pounds. Approximately 16 percent of the captured NOP measured 24.0 inches in length or larger (the lower threshold of the protected slot size limit). No NOP were captured measuring 36.0 inches or longer. Growth rate of sampled NOP was good with the average fish reaching 25.2 inches in length by age five. Walleye were sampled within the normal range for abundance in the gill net sample. Despite increased stocking efforts, the WAE gill net catch has remained relatively stable since 1998. The average size of WAE sampled in 2009 was 18.0 inches and 2.4 pounds. Approximately 40 percent of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. Growth rate for WAE was found to be good as the average fish measured 16.1 inches in length by age four. The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has been historically low in this lake since 1983 and the average fish sampled measured 6.5 inches and 0.12 pounds. Largemouth Bass (LMB) were sampled above the median levels for abundance in both gill and trap nets. The average size of LMB captured was 10.3 inches and 0.87 pounds. Growth rates for LMB were found to be fair. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled in relatively low abundance but above average size. The average BLC captured was 8.3 inches long and 0.33 pounds. Bluegill were captured in numbers comparable to that observed in 2003 trap nets, but they averaged only 5.2 inches in length and 0.11 pounds. One individual measuring 8.9 inches in length was captured. Growth rates for BLC were found to be good through age four while growth rates for BLG were found to be below average. <br> \n</p>",

Analysis of past fisheries surveys resulted in a 24-36 inch protected slot length limit being proposed for this lake. Public meetings resulted in a favorable response from area angers and implementation of this regulation commenced with the 2003 fishing opener on May 10th. The specific objective of this regulation is to develop a Northern Pike population where 20% or more of the population measured by spring trap net sampling exceeds 30.0 inches in total length. <br> \nThe 2015 spring sampling of the Northern Pike population resulted in a trap net CPUE of 2.97 fish/net. This has increased from the 2014 ice-out netting (1.98/net). The size of the pike sampled ranged from 8.43 inches to 27.28 inches total length with an average of 14.58 inches.  No Northern Pike sampled in 2015 exceeded 30.0 inches. <br> \nWalleye trap net CPUE was 0.56 fish/net, down from 1.63 fish/net in 2014.  Sampled Walleyes ranged from 2.6 inches to 27.4 inches, with an average length of 22.7 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill ranged up to 7.6 inches in length, with an average length of 5.1 inches for trapnets and 6.0 inches for gillnets.  Growth of bluegill was slow, and below average for area lakes.  Black crappie catches were moderate (5.1/trapnet), with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Average size of black crappie in trapnets was 7.6 inches.  Pumpkinseed catches were moderate (4.9/trapnet), with fish up to 7 inches sampled.  Average size of pumpkinseed was small (5.5 inches).  Hybrid sunfish were abundant (7.7/trapnet), with fish up to 8 inches sample.  Northern pike catches were high (8.3/gillnet), however, average size was small (18.3 inches).  Northern pike up to 34.7 inches were sampled.  Big Carnelian has a good largemouth bass population.  Size structure of the sampled largemouth bass was good, with 26% of the bass above 12 inches.  Largemouth bass up to 16.7 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch catches were low (1.0/gillnet), an average size was small (6.6 inches).  Black bullhead and yellow bullhead catches were moderate, 10.0/gillnet and 1.6/gillnet, respectively.  Bullheads were of large size with fish over 13.0 inches sampled for both species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Carnelian Lake was conducted on June 19-20, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
