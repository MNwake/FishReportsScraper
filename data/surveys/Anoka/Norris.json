One on the north side of the lake on County Road 24 and on the east side off County Road 47. The most abundant species sampled during the survey was bluegill. While their population is high their average size is small. Bluegills up to 8.3 inches were sampled but anglers will have to do quite a bit of sorting. Other sunfish species sampled include hybrid and green sunfish. Black crappies were sampled in low numbers. Northern pike were found in average numbers but below average size. Yellow bullhead were caught in average numbers.       </p>",
