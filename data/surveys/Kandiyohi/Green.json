MEAN WEIGHT0 PER GN) AND WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES (9.67, 75% QUARTILE).  THE AGE- CLASS DISTRIBUTION APPEARS BALANCED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A WEAK 1991 YEAR CLASS (NO STOCKING IN 1991).  A STRONG 1986 YEAR CLASS SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE QUALITY FISH > 18.0 INCHES. PSD VALUES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT THE LAST THREE SURVEYS AND ARE IN THE 30-60% RANGE FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  WAE GROW RATES ARE BELOW-TO-AVERAGE WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR GREEN LAKE.  THE NOP CATCH INDEX (2.58 FISH PER GN, 2.83 LBS.  MEAN WEIGHT PER GN) WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE HISTORICAL MEAN FOR NUMBERS (2.83 FISH PER GN, 2.61 LBS.  MEAN WEIGHT PER GN) AND ALSO BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES.  THE HIGH PSD VALUE (>60) REFLECTS THE POOR NATURAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF NOP IN GREEN LAKE THE LAST FEW YEARS. HOWEVER, THE RSD-P OF 12 (PREFERRED FISH >28 INCHES/ STOCK SIZE FISH > 19 GREEN LAKE TO PRODUCE POTENTIAL TROPHYS.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE LOCAL AREA AND PREVIOUS SURVEYS.  BLC WAS ABSENT FROM THE GILL NET SETS AND ONLY 1 FISH WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAP NETS IN 1992, EVEN THOUGH THE 1990 YEAR CLASS APPEARED MODERATE-TO-STRONG IN THE 1991 SURVEY.  BLC GILL NET INDEX HAS BEEN BELOW AVERAGE THE LAST THREE SURVEYS.  SMB GILL NET INDEX (0.33 FISH PER GN) WAS AVEAGE COMPARED TO THE OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES.  THE SMB TRAPNET INDEX WAS 0.07 IN 1992 COMPARED TO 4.87 FISH IN 1991 AND 1.13 FISH IN 1990.  SMB (<AGE II) COMPRISED THE MAJORITY OF THE SMB CAUGHT IN THE TRAPNETS IN THE LAST THREE SURVEYS.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR BELOW AVERAGE FOR SMB AGES 2-7 WHICH COULD BE DUE TO THE DECREASED ABUNDANCE OF CRAYFISH THE LAST TWO YEARS.  SEINE HAULS INDICATE A MODERATE 1992 YEAR CLASS FOR SMB COMPARED TO THE STRONG 1991 AND WEAK 1990 YEAR CLASSES.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN 1992, THUS RELIABLE CATCH INDICES FOR ADULT SMB AND LMB ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND THE PRESENT STATUS OF THESE ADULT POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN.  BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (80.4 FISH PER TN) WAS ABOVE AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES.  THE BLG MEAN WEIGHT PER TRAPNET WAS 22 GRAMS.  GROWTH RATES ARE BELOW AVERAGE FOR BLG AGES 3-7.  THE MAJORITY OF BLG CAUGHT IN THE TRAPNETS WERE SMALL (<6.4 INCHES.  THE BLG AVERAGE PSD VALUE (12) OF THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN BELOW THE RECOMMENED RANGE (40-60) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  YEP GILLNET CATCH INDEX (13.83 FISH PER GN) WAS AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER LAKE CLASS 27 LAKES AND BELOW AVERAGE COMPARED TO THE HISTORICAL MEAN (17.9 FISH PER GN).  SEINE HAULS DOCUMENTED A MODERATE-TO-STRONG 1992 YEP YEAR CLASS.  GROWTH RATES ARE BELOW AVERAGE FOR YEP AGES 2-9.  THE AVERAGE YEP PSD VALUE (9) OF THE LAST THREE SURVEYS IS BELOW THE RECOMMENDED RANGE (30-50) FOR A BALANCED POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH GROWTH RATES ARE SLOW, THERE APPEARS TO BE MODERATE NUMBERS OF YEP > 7.0 INCHES.  FALL CISCO GILLNET CATCH INDEX (85.1 FISH PER GN) WAS ABOVE THE HISTORICAL MEAN (76.7 FISH PER GN).  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF CISCO HAS BEEN ABOUT 11.0 INCHES THE LAST THREE SURVEYS.  THE STRONG 1989 YEAR CLASS IS STILL APPARENT IN THE 1992 SURVEY. THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE MODERATE 1991 AND 1990 YEAR CLASSES OF CISCO.  CISCO GROWTH RATES APPEAR AVERAGE FOR GREEN LAKE.  THE CISCO POPULATION HAS REBOUNDED FROM THE PARTIAL 1988 SUMMERKILL AND HAS REMAINED STABLE THE LAST THREE YEARS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2005. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation is generally limited in the lake. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake. A Highway 23 four-lane construction project began in 2003 adjacent to Green Lake and was completed in the fall of 2005. Significant runoff (sediment) from the Highway 23 construction project drained into Green Lake during several large rainfall events in late June and early July of 2003. One of the positive aspects of the Highway 23 project was the construction of storm water retention ponds along the Highway 23 corridor to reduce or slow future runoff into Green Lake. Water clarity was poor during late August of 2003 (secchi=4.83 feet), but good during July of 2004 (secchi=13.5 feet) and July of 2005 (secchi=9.5 feet). Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Green Lake after successive walleye natural reproduction or fry stocking failures.Experimental regulations for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were enacted in Green Lake during 1997 as part of a statewide research study. The goals were to evaluate the success or failure of certain types of experimental regulations, and produce trophy fisheries of bass and northern pike in Green Lake. The northern pike experimental regulation (24 inch maximum size limit) prohibited the harvest of fish 24 inches and greater. The smallmouth and largemouth bass regulation was originally catch and release only. However, the bass regulation was modified to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit in 2001. The bass regulation was modified again in the 2003 fall to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit with one bass over 21 inches allowed. The bass regulation was changed because of increasing numbers of smallmouth bass and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population in Green Lake. A public input meeting in regards to the Green Lake experimental regulations occurred during the 2005 fall. In December of 2005, the DNR decided to end experimental regulation for both smallmouth bass and northern pike and return to statewide regulations as of the May 13, 2006 for northern pike and May 27, 2006 for bass. This decision was based both on public input and the analyzed data collected from netting and creel surveys.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2005 (28.57 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average (49.49 fish/trapnet) for Green. The 2005 bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.14 pounds and 5.7 inches) from the trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 8.5 inches in the 2005 assessment. Black crappie numbers were moderate to abundant in 2005 (1.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the historical average (0.57 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2005 black crappie average size was small to moderate (0.20 pounds and 7.0 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 7.7 inches from gillnets in Green. Northern pike numbers were low to moderate in 2005 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and slightly below the historical average (2.91 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2005 northern pike average size was moderate (3.30 pounds and 24.0 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 22.4 inches from gillnets. The northern pike captured in 2003-2005 surveys were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. The DNR creel clerk and local anglers observed low to moderate numbers of dead northern pike floating in Green Lake from spring to mid summer of 2005. The majority of these fish died from a bacterial disease known as columnaris. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2005. Northern pike growth rates were within or below the normal ranges for Green. The 2002 northern pike year class comprised 38% of the 2005 total northern pike assessment catch. The largest northern pike captured was 33.5 inches in the 2005 assessment.Smallmouth bass numbers were high in 2005 (2.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the historical average (2.00 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2005 smallmouth bass average size was large (2.22 pounds and 15.6 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.4 inches from gillnets for Green. The 2000 and 1999 smallmouth bass year classes comprised 35% and 25% respectively of the total 2005 smallmouth bass assessment catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were below the normal ranges for Green. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were caught in low numbers in 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2004, 2003 or 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 11.4 crayfish/gillnet for Green. The largest smallmouth captured was 18.5 inches in the 2005 assessment.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low to moderate in the 2005 (0.75 fish/gillnet) summer compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but below the historical average (2.57 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2005 summer tullibee average size was moderate (0.40 pounds and 9.4 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2005 (8.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and below the historical average (18.41 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.09 pounds and 6.3 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were within the normal ranges for Green. The 2002 yellow perch year class comprised 82% of the 2005 total yellow perch assessment catch.Walleye numbers were low in 2005 (4.42 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and below the historical average (9.00 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate (1.74 pounds and 16.0 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 14.7 inches from gillnets. The 2000 and 2004 year classes (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 19% and 22% respectively of the total 2005 walleye assessment catch. Walleye growth rates were generally above the normal ranges for Green. A 2005 fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2005 walleye fry stocking (3.76 million) in Green Lake. There were no young of year \"YOY\" walleye captured in 2005. Other walleye naturally reproducing area lakes also had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2005 fall electrofishing surveys. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 15.90 YOY/hour and 6.8 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 68.66 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches average size). Walleye frylings (666 fish, 2.4 pounds), fingerlings (5,466 fish, 264 pounds), yearlings (11,863 fish, 3,433 pounds), and adults (356 fish, 673 pounds) were stocked into Green during early October of 2005 in response to poor walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking results for 2003-2005. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry from 2000-2005 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 - 4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and fingerlings/yearlings/adults were stocked in 1994, 1992, 1990.Rock bass numbers were abundant in 2005 (10.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the historical average (7.26 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2005 rock bass average size was small to moderate (0.34 pounds and 7.5 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.43 pounds from gillnets.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2005 (0.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but above the historical average size (0.21 fish/gillnet). The 2005 largemouth bass average size was small (0.76 pounds and 10.4 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.65 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were below the normal ranges for Green. The 2002 largemouth bass year class comprised 40% of the 2005 largemouth bass Green Lake assessment catch.Current fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2006 spring ice out for northern pike, 2006 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2006 summer for all fish species by survey nets. A creel survey is proposed for the 2006-07 winter and 2007 summer.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2008. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water levels were normal during the early summer, but low by the fall of 2008. Water clarity was good (8.0- 10.0 feet) for Green Lake in the 2008 summer. Total phosphorus level was low (0.014 ppm) during early June of 2008. Ice out was late in 2008 (April 30th). Dissolved oxygen levels were above 4.0 ppm in depths down to 32 feet during late July of 2008. The shoreline is fully developed with the exception of the outlet area on the east side of the lake. There were 641 homes, 2 county parks, 1 bed & breakfast, 2 resorts (11 cabins), 13 apartment buildings, and 26 homes in a common interest community located within a connected bay (Indian Beach). The immediate watershed is varied with the City of Spicer, residential homes, wetlands, hardwood lots, and agricultural row crops. There are approximately 48 inlets (mostly small tiles) that drain into Green Lake. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (Nest Lake outlet) is the largest inlet that flows into Green Lake along the north shore at the Ye Olde Mill Inn Dam and exits along the east shore of Green Lake. Nutrient runoff is low to moderate primarily from nearby residential and city sources, and upstream sources from the Middle Fork of the Crow River via Nest Lake. Numerous storm water retention ponds were built during the 2003 State Highway 23 Four-Lane Project along the west side of Green Lake. There are six public access sites and one shore fishing site (outlet) on the lake. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n  <br> \nOverall aquatic vegetation trends for mean abundance and frequency occurrence were generally greater in 2008 than previous surveys. There were 27 aquatic vegetation species/groups sampled in 2008 compared to 22 in 1994, 31 in 2003, and 21 in 2007. Water level and precipitation conditions were normal during the early summer, but dry conditions were the rule during the late summer of 2008. Water clarity was poor during the late summer of 2003 (4.83 feet) compared to 1994 (7.50 feet), 2007 (7.20 feet) and 2008 (9.0 feet). Aquatic vegetation densities generally increase during low water due to increased water clarity conditions and light penetration to substrate surface areas that were previously inaccessible. The maximum depth of vegetation was the greatest in 2007 (40 feet) compared to 2008 (31 feet), 2003 (30 feet) or 1994 (35 feet). The 2008 aquatic vegetation species trends for frequency occurrence and mean abundance include increases of river pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian milfoil, flat-stem pondweed, Fries' pondweed, water celery, stonewort, Robbins' pondweed, muskgrass, narrow-leaf pondweed, and bladderwort. Chara (muskgrass) frequency occurrence was slightly higher in 2008 (98%) than 2007 (94%), 2003 (96%) and 1994 (92%). Mean abundance of muskgrass was 49.0% for 2008, 32.1% for 1994, 29.3% for 2003, and 44.3% for 2007. Stonewort (nitella) appreciably increased in 2008 (50% occurrence, 24.3 mean abundance) compared to previous surveys. Vegetation species that were relatively unchanged in frequency occurrence or mean abundance from 2003 to 2007 were curly-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, and hardstem bulrush. Current notable vegetation species that trends decreased in frequency occurrence and mean abundance included filamentous algae, sago pondweed, water moss, variable-leaf pondweed, hardstem bulrush, clasping-leaf pondweed, leafy pondweed, naiad, and waterlily species.  <br> \n <br> \nLow densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate various Eurasian water milfoil stands were overall unsuccessful in 2000, 2001, 2007, and 2008. Eurasian milfoil occurred in 20% (10 transects) of the 2008 transects, 16% (8) of the 2007 transects, and 4%(2) of the 2003 transects. It is not surprising that frequency occurrence has increased probably due to the ease of Eurasian milfoil fragmenting and colonizing new suitable areas. Mean abundance of Eurasian milfoil within the transects increased from 1.3% in 2003, to 5.3% in 2007, and to 6.0% in 2008. It appears that Eurasian milfoil mean abundance has increased at a slower rate from 2007 to 2008 than from 2003 to 2007. Widely scattered Eurasian milfoil stands were observed in off shore \"break\" areas at a mean depth of 8.6 feet during 2007. Most large stands of Eurasian milfoil on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will be important for controlling Eurasian milfoil in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoalwater areas.  <br> \n <br> \nExperimental regulations for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were enacted in Green Lake during 1997 as part of a statewide research study. The goals were to evaluate the success or failure of certain types of experimental regulations, and produce trophy fisheries of bass and northern pike in Green Lake. A public input meeting in regards to the future of Green Lake experimental regulations occurred during the 2005 fall. In December of 2005, the DNR decided to end all experimental regulations on Green Lake (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and northern pike) and return to statewide regulations on May 13, 2006 for northern pike and May 27, 2006 for bass. This decision was based both on public input and the analyzed data collected from netting and creel surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (47.60/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake (25th=28.04, 50th=47.60, 75th=65.77 fish/trapnet) for Green Lake and similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 49.28 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.54 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (16.80 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average (11.65 fish/trapnet). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill (0.40 fish/trapnet) was low. Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 2-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 1 and 6-8. The 2005 year class comprised 35% of the 2008 total bluegill gillnet and trapnet catch. Low young of year \"YOY\" bluegill numbers (3.30 fish/seine haul) were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (1.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake (25th=0.08, 50th=0.42, 75th=1.54 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The Green Lake black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.81 fish/gillnet. The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.60 pounds and 9.50 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 7.88 inches from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was moderate (1.17 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (0.26 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were between the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, and above the normal range for age 5. Growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-2 and above the normal ranges for ages 3-6. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised 65% of the 2007 black crappie survey catch and 50% of the 2008 survey catch. No YOY black crappie were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2008 (1.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green (25th=2.25, 50th=2.75, 75th=3.25 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.78 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate (3.65 pounds and 24.92 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight and length are 3.09 pounds and 23.13 inches from gillnets. Northern pike captured in 2003-2006 surveys were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Large northern pike (>24 inches) condition factors (Fulton K-factor) were near or below the Green normal range (0.591 - 0.662 K-factor) for 2008 (0.605 K-factor) and every year since 1999 except 2001 and 2002. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2008. The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low to moderate (0.42 fish/gillnet) and near the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). Spearing pressure and harvest of large northern pike was high during the 2006-07 winter following the return to statewide regulations. Northern pike growth rates were within or above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3 and below the 25th quartiles for ages 4-6. Growth rates were generally near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2004 year class comprised 31% of the 2008 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2008 (1.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green Lake (25th=0.54, 50th=1.67, 75th=2.58 fish/gillnet) but above the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.97 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2008 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.81 pounds and 14.24 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.55 pounds and 13.44 inches from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass (1.00 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (1.27 fish/gillnet). Several moderate smallmouth year classes (2005, 2001, 2000) comprised the 2008 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 2-7. The 2008 smallmouth bass condition factor (Fulton K-Factor) was 1.410. Smallmouth bass condition factors have been near or below the Green normal range since 2000. YOY smallmouth bass numbers was low in 2008 shoreline seine hauls (0.90 fish/seine haul, 1.93 inches average length). Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2008 or 2007, low numbers in 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2004, 2003 or 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 9.0 crayfish/gillnet for Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were moderate to abundant in the 2008 summer (2.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green Lake (25th=0.50, 50th=1.00, 75th=2.68 fish/gillnet) similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.42 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. All of the tullibee were captured in one gillnet station located along the east portion of the lake located in 30-40 feet deep. The 2008 summer tullibee average size was large (1.42 pounds and 14.35 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.51 pounds from gillnets. Tullibee growth rates were below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-2, within the normal ranges for ages 3-6, and above the normal range for age 7. The 2004 and 2003 year classes each comprised 37% of the 2008 tullibee summer gillnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2008 (4.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake (25th=6.67, 50th=15.80, 75th=23.13 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 16.54 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2008 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.31 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low (0.25 fish/gillnet). Yellow perch growth rates were generally below both the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 (52%)and 2004 (36%) yellow perch year classes comprised the majority of the 2008 yellow perch gillnet catch. The 2008 yellow perch condition factor (Fulton K-Factor) was 1.084. Yellow perch condition factors have been near or below the Green normal range since 2003. YOY yellow perch abundance was low (0.20 fish/seine haul, 1.85 inches average length) in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2008 (8.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake (25th=7.69, 50th=9.42, 75th=9.96 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.12 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2008 walleye average size was moderate (1.56 pounds and 15.35 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.66 inches from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (3.92 fish/gillnet) was near the historical average (3.87 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake.  An unexpected number of older walleye from the 1994, 1995, 2000, and 2001 year classes were captured in the 2008 gillnets and trapnets. The walleye year classes of 2006 (30%), 2005 (23%), and 2004 (19%) comprised the majority of the 2008 gillnet catch. The 2004 year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 41% of the total 2007 walleye assessment gillnet catch. The recent walleye year classes since 2001 are probably due mostly to stocking. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and within the normal ranges for ages 4-8. However, growth rates were near or above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-9. The 2008 walleye condition factor (Fulton K-Factor) was 0.932. Walleye condition factors have been above the Green Lake normal range since 1999. <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey of Green Lake was conducted during early October of 2008. The 2008 fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2008 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked walleye fry (approximately 1.03 million/year) were stocked during 2007 and 2008. The walleye fry were stocked as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (7.00 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches average length) captured in 2008. Marked fish from 2007 and 2008 fry stockings accounted for 43% of YOY walleye catch and 33% of the yearling walleye catch in the 2008 fall electrofishing. Marked yearling walleye accounted for 29% of the 2008 summer yearling walleye gillnet catch. A marked three-year old walleye from a small stocking (666 frylings) was also captured in the 2008 summer gillnets. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 14.29 YOY/hour and 6.79 inches. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 76.32 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings (51,641 fish, 3,105 pounds), yearlings (5,016 fish, 209 pounds), and fry (1,028,856 fish) were stocked into Green during early April-November of 2008. There were 30,787 marked OTC stocked in Green during the fall of 2008. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry from 2000-2008 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 -4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and fingerlings/yearlings/adults were stocked in 1994, 1992, 1990. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were abundant in 2008 (13.83 fish/gillnet) and the highest recorded value for Green Lake. The 2008 rock bass abundance was above the normal ranges for Green Lake (25th=4.48, 50th=8.11, 75th=10.25 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.59 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2008 rock bass average size was moderate (0.40 pounds and 7.63 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.43 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate to abundant in 2008 (0.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green (25th=0.00, 50th=0.13, 75th=0.50 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.53 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2008 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.87 pounds and 11.18 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.65 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2005 largemouth bass year class comprised 46% of the 2008 largemouth bass assessment gillnet and trapnet catch. YOY largemouth bass abundance was low (2.40 fish/seine/haul, 1.83 inches average length) in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2009 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2009 summer for all fish species by survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in early August of 2010. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water levels were normal to high during the 2010 summer. Water clarity was moderate (8.5 feet) for Green Lake on August 2, 2010. The 2010 summer weather was moderate during the early months, but warm by late July and early August. Dissolved oxygen levels were below 2.0 ppm in depths below 30 feet during early August of 2010. A combination of inadequate oxygen levels (< 2ppm) and potentially lethal high temperatures (> 72 F) in water depths below 30 feet were conducive for a tullibee \"cisco\" fish kill during a relatively short time period of early August of 2010, but no dead fish were observed in Green Lake. A minor summerkill of cisco occurred during the same time period on nearby Lake Koronis in 2010. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, cisco \"tullibee\", bluegill, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n  <br> \nThe threats of present (Eurasian water milfoil, curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. zebra mussels, quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Eurasian water milfoil \"EWM\" was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Initial DNR attempts to chemically eradicate EWM were unsuccessful. Eurasian water milfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" areas since 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake association has continued to chemically and physically eradicate various EWM stands in recent years with relatively minimal long term success. New developments in chemical control of EWM (i.e. granular triclopyr treatment) were attempted in Green Lake during 2010, but initial results appear to be also unsuccessful in eradicating EWM probably due to continual mixing and wave action, which probably dilutes the herbicide concentrations in EWM infested areas. EWM and curly-leaf pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previously chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal. Many large stands of EWM on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling EWM in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of EWM on the surface is unlikely to occur throughout Green Lake unlike some milfoil infested lakes with protected bay areas (i.e. Minnetonka) due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoal water areas of Green Lake. DNR Aquatic invasive species interns will continue to randomly monitor boats entering and leaving the many access sites in an attempt to educate and prevent the spread of exotics into Kandiyohi County Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nExperimental regulations for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were enacted in Green Lake during 1997 as part of a statewide research study. The goals were to evaluate the success or failure of certain types of experimental regulations, and produce trophy fisheries of bass and northern pike in Green Lake. In December of 2005, the DNR decided to end all experimental regulations on Green Lake (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and northern pike) and return to statewide regulations on May 13, 2006 for northern pike and May 27, 2006 for bass. This decision was based both on public input and the analyzed data collected from netting and creel assessments. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (49.33/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges of Green Lake and similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 48.43 fish/trapnet. The 2010 bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.86 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (24.10 fish/trapnet) was high compared to the historical average (12.20 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (2.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of Green Lake and similar lakes. The Green Lake black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.90 fish/gillnet. The 2010 black crappie size was small (0.33 pounds and 7.63 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 7.95 inches from gillnets in Green.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (2.92 fish/gillnet) compared the normal range and historical average (2.73 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake, but below the normal range for similar lakes. The 2010 northern pike average size was moderate from gillnets (3.28 pounds and 23.17 inches) and similar to the historical average size (3.11 pounds and 23.21 inches). Total numbers of larger (>24 inches) northern pike appear to have rebounded in 2010 compared to 2008-09. Northern pike captured in 2003, 2004 2005, 2007 and 2009 assessments were notably lean in appearance (poor condition) compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. However, condition factors improved in 2010 for northern pike and were above the Green Lake normal range. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee) were generally documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2010. Northern pike growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2007 year class comprised 33% of the 2010 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were abundant in 2010 (2.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.94 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2010 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.37 pounds and 12.51 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.57 pounds and 13.48 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2010 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass (1.08 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the historical average (1.22 fish/gillnet). The smallmouth bass condition factor was low in 2010. Smallmouth bass condition factors have been near or below the Green Lake normal ranges since 2000. The 2005-2008 year classes each comprised about 20% of the 2010 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8.  <br> \n <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2002-2004 and 2007-2009. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2010 (0.3 crayfish/gillnet), 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). The crayfish historical average catch rate is 7.9 crayfish/gillnet for Green.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" were moderately abundant in the 2010 summer (4.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.43 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A majority of the tullibee were captured in two summer gillnet stations located along the east and south portions of the lake at a depth of approximately 30 feet. The 2010 summer tullibee average size was small (0.69 pounds and 10.46 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.57 pounds from gillnets. Summerkill potential was high during late July of 2010, but there were no reports of dead tullibee floating in Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThere were low numbers of tullibee (3.8 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2010 fall special assessment. The 2010 tullibee average size was small (0.77 pounds and 11.66 inches) for Green in the 2010 fall. The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 79.9 fish/gillnet and 12.44 inches for Green Lake. The 2010 fall tullibee condition factor (1.096) was below the 25th quartile for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were below the Green Lake 25th quartiles for ages 1-5. The 2007 and 2006 year classes comprised 41% and 27% of the 2010 fall tullibee catch in Green Lake. The lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of 2010 as sampled by both DNR and private netters during the open season is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Green Lake if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2010 (2.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 15.41 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2010 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.11 pounds and 6.49 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was nonexistent (0.00 fish/gillnet). Yellow perch condition factors have been near or below the Green Lake normal range since 2003. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3, but below the normal range for age 4. The 2007 yellow perch year classes comprised the 88% of the 2010 yellow perch gillnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (11.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 8.95 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2010 walleye average size was moderate (1.26 pounds and 14.72 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.68 inches from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (5.08 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (3.81 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2010 walleye condition factor was below the normal range for Green. Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. Growth rates were generally within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 3-8 and below the normal ranges for ages 1-2. The recent walleye year classes since 2001 are due mostly to stocking. The 2008 and 2007 walleye year classes each comprised about 25% of the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted during early October of 2010. The 2010 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2010 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Two million OTC marked walleye fry were stocked in Green during 2009 and 2010. The walleye fry were stocked in part as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (11.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches average length) captured in 2010. Walleye yearling numbers were moderate (9.00 fish/hour, 9.18 inches average length) in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. Marked fish from 2009 and 2010 stockings accounted for 55% of YOY walleye catch and 13% of the yearling walleye catch in the 2010 fall electrofishing. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY walleye catch rate and length are 13.54 YOY/hour and 6.76 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings (70,714 fish, 3,086 pounds), yearlings (840 fish, 253 pounds), and fry (2,220,806 fish) were stocked into Green during early April-November of 2010. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry (1-2 million) from 2000-2009 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 - 4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and larger walleye (fingerlings and adults) were stocked in 1994, 1992, 1990.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (8.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green Lake and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.67 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2010 rock bass average size was moderate (0.36 pounds and 7.48 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant in 2010 (2.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.65 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2010 largemouth bass average size was small (0.66 pounds and 9.68 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.67 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates were generally below the normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2008 largemouth bass year class comprised 36% of the 2010 largemouth bass assessment gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2011 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2011 summer for all fish species by assessment nets.  <br> \n</p>",

A targeted fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 17, 2020 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A targeted fall gillnetting survey was conducted for Walleye (late September) in 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during 2019 summer and 2019-2020 winter.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. The 2020 summer was dryer with normal temperatures. Water levels were low during 2020. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters into the Middle Fork Crow River. There were marginal dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) and temperature conditions (<74 F) for Tullibee survival at depths of 40-44 feet during 2020 survey. There were adequate dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions at depths of 20-30 feet during 2019 survey, 20-35 feet during the 2018 survey, 27-36 feet during the 2017 survey, and 40-60 feet during the 2016 survey. Submergent vegetation appeared less dense in 2019 than previous survey years. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble and boulder. Recent ice on dates were December 19, 2020; December 2, 2019; November 27, 2018; December 12, 2017; December 10, 2016; and December 27, 2015. Recent ice off dates were April 8, 2020; April 23, 2019; May 7, 2018; March 21, 2017; and March 22, 2016 for Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (Zebra Mussels, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. Starry Stonewort, Quagga Mussels, Spiny Water Flea, Faucet Snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Climate change and invasive species effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (filamentous algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas due to warmer waters and increased near shore nutrient deposition. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such as Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". Furthermore, increased densities of submergent vegetation species such as invasive Eurasian watermilfoil since 2000 have provided added habitat/cover for many warm water fish species. Eurasian watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. It was more prevalent in water depths greater than 10 feet and less frequent in shallower water during 2018-2020. Zebra Mussels have decreased free open water green algal abundance resulting in lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from open water to bottom habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased fish condition factors and also increased water clarity since 2014. Several other area lakes (Andrew, Diamond, Eagle, Elkhorn, George, Nest, Norway and Games) were recently reported as infested with Zebra Mussels in 2017-2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2020 (0.58 fish/gillnet, 0.20 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 1.30 fish/gillnet and 0.78 fish/trapnet. The 2020 Black Crappie average sizes were large from gillnets (0.54 pounds and 9.62 inches) and trapnets (0.57 pounds and 10.08 inches). The Black Crappie historical average lengths are 8.00 inches for gillnets and 8.09 inches for trapnets in Green. The largest Black Crappie captured was 10.91 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2020 (32.07 fish/trapnet). The Green Lake Bluegill historical average catch rate is 42.78 fish/trapnet. The 2020 Bluegill average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.69 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. The 2020 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches and larger) Bluegill (5.87 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (13.27 fish/trapnet). The largest Bluegill captured was 8.91 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were low in 2020 (0.42 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.87 fish/gillnet). The 2020 Largemouth Bass average size was large (1.48 pounds and 13.70 inches) from gillnets. The Largemouth Bass historical average weight is 0.73 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth Bass growth rates are slow in Green. The 2018 and 2013 year classes comprised 33% and 25% respectively of the 2020 Largemouth Bass summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high in 2020 (4.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (2.88 fish/gillnet). The 2020 Northern Pike average size was small (1.96 pounds and 20.24 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight and length are 3.12 pounds and 23.25 inches from gillnets. The 2020 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) Northern Pike (0.25 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (0.46 fish/gillnet). The largest Northern Pike captured was 31.38 inches in 2020 survey. Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003 Low numbers of forage fish (Yellow Perch and Tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2020. Northern Pike growth rates were generally slow for younger fish (ages 1-4), but near the normal ranges for older fish (ages 5-8). The 2018 and 2017 year classes comprised 44% and 26% of the 2020 Northern Pike summer catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were abundant in 2020 (11.58 fish/gillnet). The Rock Bass historical average catch rate is 9.22 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2020 Rock Bass average size was large (0.60 pounds and 8.78 inches) from gillnets. The Rock Bass historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were moderate in 2020 (1.42 fish/gillnet). The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 1.76 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2020 Smallmouth Bass size was large (2.27 pounds and 15.63 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average weight and length are 1.57 pounds and 13.44 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2020 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches and larger) Smallmouth Bass was (1.08 fish/gillnet) was near the historical average (1.06 fish/gillnet). The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 19.09 inches in the 2020 survey. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were slow in Green. There were no dominant Smallmouth Bass year classes in the summer gillnet catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nLarge sized Northern Crayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999. Moderate numbers of Northern Crayfish were captured in both 2020 (1.92 crayfish/gillnet) and 2019 (2.17 crayfish/gillnet) summer surveys. Low numbers (<1.00 crayfish/gillnet) or no Northern Crayfish were captured from 2002-2018 gillnets. The Northern Crayfish historical average catch rate is 5.08 crayfish/gillnet for Green. Research has identified Crayfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish as predators on smaller Zebra Mussels. We did observe numerous small sized Northern Crayfish in the stomachs of Smallmouth Bass and Rock Bass. Northern Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to a new forage species \"Zebra Mussel\" present in Green. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the 2017-2020 summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.82 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A November targeted gillnet survey was last conducted for Tullibee in 2019. Tullibee numbers were low in 2019 November survey (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.92 inches). Tullibee numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) in the previous 2017 November targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) fall surveys. The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 67.43 fish/gillnet and 12.56 inches for Green Lake. Green Lake has not been opened for Tullibee public gillnetting since 2011 due to the low Tullibee numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish, especially for larger Northern Pike and Walleye in Green. Tullibee can also provide a secondary fishing opportunity during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2020 (1.25 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.43 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.13 pounds and 6.86 inches) from gillnets for Green Lake. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow in Green. The 2016 year class comprised 50% of the 2020 Yellow Perch summer survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nLocal anglers have reported in past years seeing numerous small Yellow Perch amongst the Chara \"Muskgrass\" beds with cameras during the summer or while spearing in the winter. Our standard gillnets may not effectively sample these small (<5.0 inches) Yellow Perch. Predation pressures from various species (i.e. Rock Bass, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, etc.) may have also selected for smaller sized and earlier reproducing Yellow Perch restricted to near bottom habitat containing dense Chara beds in Green. A statewide study will examine Yellow Perch catchability, growth and maturity using small mesh gillnets in Green and other lakes in 2019 and the future. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013, 2016, and 2018. Fry were marked with OTC to document the contribution to the Walleye population versus natural reproduction or fingerling stockings in later surveys. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer Strain Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adult (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung of Year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (<5.00 YOY/hour) were captured in 2013-2019 fall electrofishing surveys. Although, fall electrofishing survey techniques may be less effective for sampling YOY Walleye in large multi contoured lakes with high water clarity. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) and 2011 (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% of the 2012 fall electrofishing survey catches. OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2020 summer gillnets (4.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 8.29 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. However, abundant Walleye numbers (8.25 fish/gillnet) were captured in the 2020 September gillnetting survey. The discrepancies between low summer and high fall gillnets catches is due in part to younger fish growing to larger sizes during late summer and early fall, which makes them more susceptible to capture in our fall gillnets. The 2020 Walleye average size was moderate (2.01 pounds and 17.42 inches) from the summer gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight and length are 1.32 pounds and 14.91 inches from summer gillnets. The 2020 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye (2.83 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (3.55 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The largest Walleye captured was 27.17 inches in the 2020 summer survey. Walleye growth rates were slow in Green compared to other area lakes, but within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4. A variety of Walleye year classes were captured in the 2020 summer survey. Recent YOY Walleye catch rates from 5-30 fish per hour due to fry stockings or natural reproduction may be adequate for providing a moderate year class in larger or clearer lakes. Recent fry stockings (2013, 2016 and 2018) have contributed between 29% and 57% of the fish caught from fry stocked year classes during the 2020 summer survey. However, Zebra Mussels may negatively affect future Walleye fry stockings and natural reproduction by reducing zooplankton food availability, thus causing poor Walleye first year survival. Continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. The new Walleye bag limit was reduced from six to three fish on Green Lake starting in 2021. Only 1 Walleye over 20 inches is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of White Sucker (0.67 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.27 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed (0.13 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (3.87 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (0.33 fish/gillnet) during 2020. Moderate numbers of large Yellow Bullhead were also captured in 2020 (2.33 fish/gillnet, 0.82 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2021 for YOY Walleye abundance, 2022 fall for Tullibee and the summer of 2021 for all fish species by standard survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey in Green Lake was conducted during mid-September of 2023 using lake survey gillnets and trapnets. Standard surveys were done during the last week of July or first week of August prior to 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Standard surveys have been conducted during or after the fall turnover since 2021. We set 12 gillnets at standard summer stations during mid-September of 2023. A thermocline still existed at the start of the 2023 September survey between 35-45 feet depth. The surface temperature was 71 F with dissolved oxygen of 7.9 ppm. Dissolved oxygen was at least 5.0 ppm down to 35 feet deep. The water temperatures were between 62-57 F and <1.0 ppm dissolved oxygen at depths greater than 45 feet deep. A temperature oxygen profile was also taken on July 28, 2023. Adequate temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) were present for Tullibee survival at depths of 20-40 feet deep during the critical late July and early August time period in Green Lake. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2019. The month of June had warmer air temperatures (up to 90 F) and drier (< 2 inches of rain) than normal conditions during 2020-2022. July air temperatures were below or near normal during those same years. The 2023 summer was warmer and drier than normal especially for June, but no tullibee summerkills were observed in Green or Koronis. The secchi reading was 10.0 feet during the mid-September survey and 8.0 feet during late July of 2023. Total phosphorus was low (0.018 ppm) on September 11, 2023. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on October 8, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A targeted Tullibee gillnetting survey was conducted in late November of 2023. A creel survey was last conducted on Green Lake during the 2019 summer and 2019-2020 winter. <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil (2000) and Zebra Mussels (2014). Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Water levels were low during 2020-2023. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters the Middle Fork Crow River. Submergent vegetation appeared less dense from 2021-2023 than previous survey years. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Zebra mussels were abundant on shoalwater substrates such as rubble and boulder throughout the littoral areas. Zebra Mussels have decreased free open water green algal abundance. This has resulted in lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from open water to bottom habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased some fish species condition factors, and increased water clarity since 2014. Several other area lakes (Andrew, Diamond, Eagle, Elkhorn, George, Nest, Norway, and Games) were recently reported as infested with Zebra Mussels during 2017-2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trapnet catch rate was high (5.73 fish/trapnet), but low in the gillnets (0.25 fish/gillnet) during the 2023 fall standard survey. The historical average catch rate is 0.97 fish/trapnet. The 2023 Black Crappie average sizes were large for fall gillnets (0.97 pounds and 11.22 inches), but moderate for fall trapnets (0.50 pounds and 9.48 inches). The historical average lengths are 8.11 inches and 8.22 inches respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The 2023 Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches plus) was moderate (1.33 fish/trapnet). The largest Black Crappie captured was 13.39 inches in the 2023 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trapnet catch rate (47.80 fish/trapnet) was similar to the historical average (45.01 fish/trapnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. Bluegill average size was small (0.12 pounds and 5.34 inches) from trapnets. The historical average length is 5.48 inches from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 8.31 inches. The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) was low (8.81 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) was also low (0.07 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gillnet catch rate (0.42 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (0.83 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. The 2023 Largemouth Bass gillnet average size was moderate (1.48 pounds and 13.09 inches). Moderate numbers of small sized Largemouth Bass (1.53 fish/trapnet, 6.71 inches average) were captured in the 2023 fall trapnets. The Largemouth Bass historical average trapnet catch is 0.51 fish/trapnet. The historical average lengths are 10.54 inches and 8.86 inches respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The largest Largemouth Bass captured was 16.54 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gillnet catch rate (2.17 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (2.83 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. The 2023 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.83 pounds and 23.07 inches). The historical average length is 23.17 inches. The 2023 Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches plus) was low (0.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). The largest Northern Pike captured was 33.86 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass gillnet catch rate (6.00 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (9.09 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. The 2023 Rock Bass gillnet average size was moderate (0.38 pounds and 7.23 inches). The historical average length is 7.77 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet catch rate (1.75 fish/gillnet) was the same as the historical average in the 2023 fall standard survey. The 2023 Smallmouth Bass gillnet average size was moderate (0.85 pounds and 10.80 inches). The historical average length is 13.18 inches. The 2023 Smallmouth Bass fall catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches plus) was moderate (0.42 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (1.00 fish/gillnet). The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 19.37 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Crayfish (important prey species for Smallmouth Bass) numbers were high during the 2023 (10.58 crayfish/gillnet), 2022 (20.50 crayfish/gillnet) and 2021 (16.58 crayfish/gillnet) fall surveys compared to previous surveys from 2002-2020 (<3.00 crayfish/gillnet). Zebra Mussels are an important forage prey for Northern Crayfish. Zebra Mussels may cause a shift to greater numbers of benthic species such as Northern Crayfish and Yellow Perch which would be beneficial to Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n  <br> \nTullibee gillnet catch rate was low (0.67 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. Tullibee numbers were also low in 2022 (0.08 fish/gillnet) and 2021 (0.17 fish/gillnet) fall standard surveys. Tullibee were absent in the 2020 September and summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average standard survey catch rate is 1.70 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. Tullibee numbers were also low in the 2023 November Tullibee survey (4.00 fish/gillnet, 10.77 inches). The Tullibee average size was small (0.32 pounds and 9.65 inches) in the 2023 fall standard survey. The Tullibee historical average length is 10.67 inches. Tullibee growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges. The 2022 year class comprised 50% of the 2023 fall standard survey. Tullibee growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gillnet catch rate was low (5.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (10.83 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. However, the 2023 gillnet catch rate was the highest recorded value since 2006. The 2023 Yellow Perch average size (0.13 pounds and 6.59 inches) was above the historical average size (0.11 pounds and 6.46 inches). The 2023 fall Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches plus) was low (0.17 fish/gillnet). The largest Yellow Perch captured was 8.98 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked into Green with mostly Spicer and Pike River strains of varied amounts (0.5 to 2.5 million fish) from 2000-2013. Approximately 1 million Spicer strain fry were most recently stocked in 2016 and 2018. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked in Green during 2000-2013, 2016 and 2018. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults were stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Pike River was the primary Walleye fingerling strain that was available and stocked into Green from 2000-2014. Spicer Area Walleye fingerling rearing ponds have been stocked with primarily the Spicer strain since 2015. Both Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped (right ventral) age 3+ adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and ages 1+ fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Fin clipped (left ventral) Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adults (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). Green was stocked with 2,500 Spicer strain fin clipped (right ventral) Walleye (1,050 pounds) after the 2021 fall standard survey. Adults and yearlings comprised 1,844 fish (911 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. Fingerlings comprised 656 fish (139 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. In October of 2022, Walleye stocked (right ventral fin clipped) included adults (115 fish, 172 pounds), yearlings (342 fish, 145 pounds) and fingerlings (425 fish, 104 pounds). Walleye adults (109 fish, 115 pounds) and yearlings (341 fish, 149.5 pounds) were fin clipped (left ventral) and stocked during the 2023 fall. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (23.40 YOY/hour, 5.13 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye numbers were abundant (31.20 fish/hour, 7.51 inches) in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Growth was slow for the 2022 year class in 2023. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (65.54 YOY/hour, 5.24 inches) due to natural reproduction in the 2022 fall electrofishing survey. The 2022 fall electrofishing survey had the highest historical recorded YOY Walleye catch rate for Green Lake. Young of Year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were moderate (10.50 YOY/hour, 7.39 inches) in 2021. YOY Walleye were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (<5.00 YOY/hour) were captured in 2013-2019 fall electrofishing surveys. Although, fall electrofishing survey techniques may be less effective for sampling YOY Walleye in large multi contoured lakes with high water clarity. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) and 2011 (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% of the 2012 fall electrofishing survey catches. OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gillnet catch rate (10.17 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (8.26 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 fall standard survey. The 2023 Walleye average size was moderate (1.59 pounds and 15.46 inches). The historical average length is 14.99 inches. The 2023 Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) was high (5.58 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (3.64 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Walleye fall catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches plus) was moderate (1.83 fish/gillnet). The largest Walleye captured was 27.36 inches. Walleye growth rates were good for ages 1-4, but slow for ages 5-8. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2023 Walleye fall standard survey catch was comprised primarily of 2019 (37%), 2021 (27%) and 2022 (26%) year classes. Approximately 27% of 2019 Walleye year class (age 4) were stocked fin clipped fish in the 2023 Walleye fall survey catch. Zebra Mussels may negatively affect future Walleye fry stockings or natural reproduction/recruitment by reducing zooplankton food availability, thus causing poor survivability or growth. However, if benthic forage species such as Yellow Perch begin to rebound then yearling/adult Walleye recruitment and growth may also respond positively. It is encouraging that good Walleye natural reproduction success was documented in 2022 and 2023. If fingerling recruitment to adult size is poor, then continued Walleye yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. The new Walleye bag limit was reduced from six to three fish on Green Lake in 2021. Only 1 Walleye over 20 inches is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2023 fall standard survey included low numbers of White Sucker (0.17 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.40 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (3.67 fish/trapnet) and Bigmouth Buffalo (0.07 fish/trapnet). Abundant numbers of moderate sized Yellow Bullhead (12.00 fish/gillnet, 0.79 pounds) were captured in the 2023 fall standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2024 for YOY Walleye abundance, and mid-September of 2024 for all fish species by standard survey nets. Tullibee will be sampled by vertical gillnetting and hydroacoustic methods in June of 2024, and November gillnetting in 2025 for both Green and Koronis. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (maximum depth 110 feet), lake located near Spicer,MN in Kandiyohi County. Green has excellent water quality (good clarity, low levels ofnutrients) compared to most other lakes in Kandiyohi County. The Middle Fork of the CrowRiver (MFCR) inlet via Mud Lake (34-158) and Nest Lake (34-0154) is a constant source ofmoderate nutrient loading to Green Lake. So far Green has been able to assimilate incomingnutrients without any appreciable increase in productivity. Green is heavily developed with663 homes, several resorts/motels/bed&breakfasts, several condominiums/apartment buildings,a bible camp, county park, city park, and the city of Spicer along the southwest shoreline.Structure is varied on Green with several long shallow bars (Hultgren's, Lone Tree, Grate's,Castle Flats) located in the lake. Emergent vegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush and commoncattail) are restricted to the outlet area and a small stand near the \"Spicer Castle\" alongthe south shore. There is a variety of submergent vegetation species, but the density islight throughout most of the lake with the exception of the outlet bay area. Green Lake hasbeen intensively stocked with a variety of species, densities, and frequencies over theyears. Smallmouth bass were introduced in the early 1940's. Cisco \"tullibee\" were thought tobe introduced into Green during the late 1800's. In the last ten years, stocking efforts havebeen devoted mostly to walleye. Presently, walleye are stocked (about 2000 lbs) every evenyear. Fall electrofishing surveys have been conducted since 1993 to assess the contributionsof natural reproduction and stocking to the walleye fishery in Green. Green is a popular lakefor walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill angling. In addition, tullibeegillnetting is allowed for a two-three week period in mid to late November. In recent years,Green has been intensively surveyed to provide a better data base for developing future longterm management goals and objectives. Furthermore, experimental fishing regulations areplanned to be implemented in 1997 for developing trophy northern pike and smallmouth bassopportunities.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (9.6 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range for similarlakes, but slightly above the historical average of 8.2 fish/gillnet. The 1994 average size(15.4 inches, 1.4 lbs) was above the historical average (14.5 inches, 1.3 lbs). The walleyepopulation size structure and abundance has been fairly constant over the past ten years.Significant natural reproduction was documented in 1993 (46.0 fingerlings/hour) and in 1994(52.7 YOY/hour). The 1994 stocked fingerlings accounted only 2.4% (1.3 fingerlings/hour) ofthe total fingerling production in Green during 1994 (natural and stocked= 54.0fingerlings/hour). It appears that stocking contributes minimally to the walleye populationduring years when good natural reproduction occurs.      Northern pike abundance in 1994 (1.8 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range forsimilar lakes and below the historical average (2.7 fish/gillnet). The largest fish capturedin the summer survey was 31.6 inches. The average size in 1994 (21.3 inches, 2.8 lbs) wassimilar to the historical average (21.7 inches, 2.6 lbs.). Spawning runs occur in severalinlet marshes (Alvig Slough, East Woodcock Lake), and also a large run at the outlet marsharea. Spring monitoring of the northern pike spawning runs have occurred in 1994 and 1995 toprovide information for the evaluation of upcoming northern pike experimental regulationsstudy.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (23.6 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range forsimilar lakes and comparable to the historical average (20.2 fish/gillnet). The average sizein 1994 (6.5 inches) was similar to the historical average (6.4 inches).     Cisco \"tullibee\" abundance in 1994 summer survey (3.6 fish/gillnet) was within thenormal range for similar lakes and comparable to the historical average (4.0 fish/gillnet).Abundance was down in 1994 compared to 1993 (10.2 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1994(9.2 inches) was slightly below the historical average (9.4 inches).     Smallmouth bass abundance in the 1994 spring electrofishing survey (13.7 fish/hour) wasabove the historical average (12.5 fish/hour) and above the 1993 spring survey (1.9fish/hour). Low spring electrofishing catch rates in 1993 were probably due to poor shockingconditions (high winds, precipitation, higher water levels). The average size caught in the1994 spring electrofishing survey was 12.1 inches. The largest smallmouth bass caught was18.7 inches during the summer survey.     Largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate in 1994 was 1.0 fish/hour. Previouselectrofishing catch rates include 1.9 fish/hour in 1993, 8.0 fish/hour in 1991, and 57.7fish/hour in 1990. The average size was 11.3 inches in 1994.     Rock bass abundance in 1994 (8.4 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range for similarlakes and above the historical average (6.8 fish/gillnet). The average size in 1994 (8.5inches, 0.5 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (8.1 inches and 0.4 lbs).      Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.1 fish/gillnet, 0.0 fish/trapnet) was below thenormal range and below the historical average (0.8 fish/gillnet, 0.6 fish/trapnet). Blackcrappie populations throughout most of Kandiyohi County have been low in recent years.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (84.6 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range for similarlakes and above the historical average (66.3 fish/trapnet). The average size in 1994 (5.4inches) was above the historical average (4.9 inches). It appears that the average size hasincreased slightly from 1993 (average size=4.7 inches). Important bluegill habitat includebulrush stands on the south shore (Spicer Castle) and the northeast outlet bay area.     Green is a challenging lake to fish, but fishing deep water near structure (shallowbars, reefs) is the key for catching larger walleye during the day. Also, walleye anglershave good success trolling the shallow flats in 8-10 ft of water during June and July.Anglers generally have good success for bluegill in the outlet bay area. Smallmouth bassanglers usually have success near Grate's Bar, Hultgren's Bar, Lone Tree Bar, and thenortheast portion of Green. Northern pike anglers have good success near the Castle Flats,Peck's Bar, and the northwest portion of the lake. Green has the habitat, water quality, andforage base to potentially produce trophy northern pike and smallmouth bass. In the past,abundant crayfish populations have been important forage for producing smallmouth bass. Otherabundant forage (cisco, yellow perch) have the potential to produce trophy northern pike. In addition, there usually is a cool, oxygenated layer present when the lake stratifies inmid summer which is conducive for producing trophy northern pike. A statewide experimentalregulation study for various species will include Green Lake. Experimental regulations willbe proposed for smallmouth bass and northern pike by the beginning of 1997 fishing opener.Related experimental regulations study activities include upcoming creel surveys in 1995-1996, annual spring bass electrofishing, and annual northern pike spawning run assessment.In addition, ice out trapnetting and tagging of walleye will be conducted to get moreinformation about population size and angler exploitation in conjunction with the creelsurveys being conducted. Other priority management activities will include protecting presentwater quality, protecting and expanding existing stands of hardstem bulrush, maintainingaccess to inlet and outlet marshes for northern pike spawning, yearly evaluation of ciscopopulation through fall gillnetting, and yearly evaluation of walleye natural reproductionthrough fall electrofishing. Walleye fingerling stocking on Green should only be consideredafter successive years of poor natural reproduction as determined by fall electrofishing. Thebenefits of stocking as needed (successive years of poor natural reproduction) rather thanon a prescribed schedule (stocking every even year) is that the valuable walleye fingerlingresource can be used more efficiently and effectively (higher rates) for other lakes.Furthermore, survival and growth of walleye in a lake may decrease when stocking occurs ontop of good natural reproduction due to more competition for limited resources (forage,habitat, etc.).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (maximum depth 110 feet), mesotrophic lake locatednear Spicer, MN in Kandiyohi County. The littoral area comprises 38% of the total surfacearea. Green has excellent water quality compared to most other lakes in Kandiyohi County.Water clarity is excellent (historical average secchi=9 ft). Nutrient levels are low (totalphosphorous=0.015 on 6/13/94). The Middle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) inlet via Mud Lake(34-158) and Nest Lake (34-0154) is a constant source of moderate nutrient loading to GreenLake. So far Green has been able to assimilate incoming nutrients without any appreciableincrease in trophic status. In addition to MFCR, there are seven other inlets of which allbut one connect to shallow permanent lakes/marshes. The outlet (MFCR) is located on thenortheast side of the lake and connects to Calhoun Lake (34-0062) via a marsh. The immediatewatershed types are primarily municipal (residential homes), mixed hardwoods, and marshlands.Green is heavily developed with 663 homes, several resorts/motels/bed&breakfasts, severalcondominiums/apartment buildings, bible camp, county park, city park, and the city of Spiceralong the southwest shoreline. Only a small portion of the lake near the outlet isundeveloped. Shoalwater substrates are dominated by sand and gravel throughout most of thelake with boulder and rubble common along several long shallow bars (Grate's, Hultgren's) andadjacent shoreline areas. Marl and silt are common in the outlet bay area. Emergentvegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush with some common cattail, cane, and reed canary grass)is restricted to the outlet area and a small stand near the \"Spicer Castle\" along the southshore. There is a variety of submergent vegetation species, but the density is lightthroughout most of the lake with the exception of the outlet bay area. Water controlstructures affecting Green Lake water levels include the MFCR/Mud Lake Reservoir Dam at NewLondon, a stoplog dam at the MFCR inlet to Green Lake, a Type C with stoplogs south ofCalhoun, and a Type C solid sill at the Calhoun outlet. Green Lake has been stocked with avariety of species and densities over the years. Smallmouth bass were introduced in the early1940's. Tullibee \"cisco\" were thought to be introduced into Green during the late 1800's. Inthe last ten years, stocking efforts have been devoted mostly to walleye. Historically,rescue operations have been common in adjacent connected winterkill lakes/marshes fornorthern pike. Prior to 1991, walleye were stocked almost every year. The current lakemanagement plan is to stock walleye (about 2000 lbs) only after two consecutive poor naturalyear classes documented by fall electrofishing. Fall electrofishing surveys have beenconducted since 1993 to assess the contributions of natural reproduction and stocking to thewalleye fishery in Green. Commercial removal has been limited in the last ten years to carp(16,160 lbs) and suckers (2,900 lbs). About 111 lbs of tullibee were removed by state crewsfor an initial stocking at an East Metro Fisheries Area lake. In 1989, 310 northern pike wereremoved by state crews for stocking local northern pike spawning areas (NPSA). Walleye eggs(90,000 to 28,000,000 per take) were removed by state crews for fingerling production in1971, 1978-80, 1986, and 1996 during years when eggs were not available from traditional eggtake stations. Green was stocked with 10% of the hatched walleye fry in 1996 from the GreenLake egg take. Green is a popular lake for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, andbluegill angling. In addition, tullibee gillnetting is allowed for a two-three week periodin mid to late November. In recent years, Green has been intensively sampled (consecutivelake surveys since 1989, spring electrofishing surveys for smallmouth and largemouth bass,fall electrofishing surveys for YOY/Yearling walleye, creel surveys in 1995 and 1996, springnorthern pike assessment, ice out walleye trapnetting, fall cisco gillnetting) to provide abetter data base for developing future long term management goals and objectives.Furthermore, experimental fishing regulations (24 inch maximum size for northern pike, catchand release fishing only for smallmouth and largemouth bass) will be implemented in May of1997 for developing trophy northern pike and smallmouth bass opportunities.     Walleye abundance in the 1996 summer survey (12.1 fish/gillnet) was above the 1st and3rd median interquartile range (4.0 - 9.6 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22, and slightly abovethe historical average (8.8 fish/gillnet). The walleye population size was determined in 1995by marking 573 walleye (12 inches or greater captured during ice out trapnetting) withDennison tags. Walleye caught by anglers were inspected for marks during the 1995 summer(1,596 fish observed, 14 recaptures) and 1995-96 winter (328 fish observed, 5 recapture)creel surveys. A simple Petersen estimate of the walleye population (fish > 12 inches) was58,024 fish (37,245 - 95,865 fish, 95% confidence limits) with an annual fishing mortalityrate of 34% (19,759 fish harvested) from the combined 1995 summer (fish > 12 inches) and1995-96 winter (fish > 14 inches) creels (Coahran, D.A. 1996. Green Lake (Lake CalhounIncluded) Creel Survey, Summer of 1995 and Winter of 1995-96, Statewide ExperimentalRegulations Project, MNDNR, Section of Fisheries.). The 1996 average size (0.9 lbs fromgillnets) was below the historical average (1.3 lbs). The largest walleye captured in the1996 summer survey was 27.0 inches. The 1996 summer PSD and RSD-P was 20.5 and 4.6 (fromgillnets and trapnets) respectively. The historical average PSD and RSD-P was 49.6 and 9.0respectively. The catch rate of quality size plus (> or = 15 inches) walleye in the 1996summer survey (2.6 fish/net, gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historical average(4.4 fish/net). Growth rates appear slightly below average for ages II-III and VIII-XIcompared to other area lakes. Fall electrofishing surveys have been conducted since 1993 todocument young of year \"YOY\" walleye abundance due to natural reproduction in Green Lake. The1996 YOY walleye abundance from fall night electrofishing (33.0 YOY/hour) was within the 1stand 3rd median interquartile range (10.9 - 55.6 YOY/hour) for area lakes with potentialnatural reproduction (Table 1.). The overall median YOY catch rate for Green Lake is 39.5YOY/hour. The 1996 YOY average size (5.9 inches) was slightly below the Green Lake historicalaverage (6.2 inches), and below the overall average (6.8 inches) for lakes with naturalreproduction (Table 2.). The 1996 yearling walleye catch rate from fall electrofishing (28.0fish/hour) was similar to the Green Lake historical average (24.7 fish/hour), but above theoverall average (13.8 fish/hour) for area lakes (Table 3.). The 1996 yearling average size(8.7 inches) was below the Green Lake historical average (9.2 inches), and below the overallaverage (10.6 inches) for area lakes (Table 4.).     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (3.7 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.0 - 7.9 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22, but slightly above thehistorical average (2.8 fish/gillnet). Northern pike (600 fish, size range=11.5 - 35.8inches) were tagged with Dennison tags at several inlet spawning marsh sites in the springof 1995. Northern pike were observed for tags during the 1995 open water creel survey (123fish observed, 4 tagged fish) and the 1995-96 winter creel survey (142 fish observed, 2tagged fish). The northern pike population in Green Lake was estimated at 26,500 fish (7,557- 72,273 at 95% confidence limits) from a 1995 simple Petersen population estimate (Coahran1996). It is our opinion that this northern pike population size is an over estimate due topotential loss of fish or delay of fish returning from spawning areas. It was observed thatnorthern pike were being harvested by shore anglers at the East Woodcock spawning marsh fromthe May opener to early June of 1997. The 1996 average size (2.9 lbs from gillnets) was abovethe historical average (2.6 lbs). The largest northern pike captured in the 1996 survey was36.6 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (56.3 and 10.4 from gillnets and trapnets) were similarto the historical averages (57.1 and 11.5 respectively). Growth rates appear slightly aboveaverage compared to other local lakes. There are several significant natural spawning runsthat occur into marsh areas adjacent to Green Lake (outlet marsh area, East Woodcock inletmarsh area, and Alvig Slough area). The 1996 YOY northern pike abundance (3.0 YOY/hour) fromfall night electrofishing was above the Green Lake historical average (1.3 YOY/hour) andabove the overall average (2.0 YOY/hour) for area lakes (Table 5.). The 1996 YOY average size(10.1 inches) was below the overall average (10.9 inches) for area lakes (Table 6.). GreenLake has been noted as a trophy northern pike fishery in the past. Abundant tullibee \"cisco\"within Green provides an excellent forage base for producing trophy northern pike. Theexperimental regulation concerning northern pike in Green Lake will require that all northernpike 24 inches or greater in length are to be immediately released into Green Lake and thepossession limit remains unchanged at 3 northern pike. This experimental regulation isintended to increase the number of 6 - 15 lb northern pike within Green Lake. Theeffectiveness of this regulation will be evaluated eight years from implementation.     Smallmouth bass abundance in the 1996 spring electrofishing survey (18.8 fish/hour) wasabove the historical average (12.2 fish/hour). The 1996 spring electrofishing average weight(1.0 lbs) was slightly below the historical average (1.2 lbs.). The 1996 spring averagelength (11.7 inches) was slightly below the historical average (12.4 inches). The largestsmallmouth bass captured during the spring survey was 19.7 inches. The 1996 spring PSD andRSD-P was 53.1 and 22.4 respectively. The historical spring PSD and RSD-P was 67.7 and 30.2respectively. The 1996 spring catch rate of preferred size (> 14 inches) smallmouth bass (4.1fish/hour) was slightly above the historical catch rate (3.4 fish/hour). Growth rates appearaverage for smallmouth bass compared to other area lakes. About 38% of the fish captured inthe spring survey belonged to the 1994 year class. An experimental regulation will go intoeffect on the bass opener on May 31, 1997 for both smallmouth and largemouth bass on GreenLake. The regulation will require the immediate release of all smallmouth and largemouth basscaught in Green Lake. No possession (on person or in the vehicle) of bass is allowed whilefishing in or on Green Lake. This regulation is intended to increase the number of 3-5 lbbass within the lake. The effectiveness of this regulation will be evaluated eight years fromimplementation.     Largemouth bass abundance in the 1996 spring electrofishing survey (3.4 fish/hour) wasabove the last three surveys (< 2.0 fish/hour from 1993-1995), but below the historicalaverage (12.0 fish/hour). The 1996 spring largemouth bass average size (8.5 inches) was belowthe historical average (10.7 inches). The largest largemouth bass captured during the springsurvey was 13.0 inches. The 1996 spring PSD and RSD-P was 20.0 and 0 respectively. Growthrates appear average for largemouth bass compared to other area lakes. About 89% of the fishcaptured in the spring survey belonged to the 1994 year class.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (17.6 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (7.1 - 33.9 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22, and similar to thehistorical average (20.2 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.8 inches from gillnets andtrapnets) was slightly above the historical average (6.4 inches). The 1996 PSD and RSD-P(from gillnets and trapnets) was 20.0 and 1.9 respectively. Growth rates appear average foryellow perch compared to other area lakes.     Tullibee \"cisco\" abundance in the summer gillnets (0.6 fish/gillnet) was within the 1stand 3rd median interquartile range (0.5 - 5.2 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22, but below thehistorical average (4.0 fish/gillnet). The 1996 summer average size (0.5 lbs from gillnets)was similar to the historical average (0.4 lbs). A two-three week gillnetting season isopened each fall during mid November to allow harvest (personal use only) of tullibee fromGreen Lake.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (23.3 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.7 - 42.9 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 22, but below the historicalaverage (59.1 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (6.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was above the historical average (5.0 inches). The largest bluegill captured in the 1996survey was 8.3 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (from gillnets and trapnets) was 57.9 and 0.6respectively. The historical PSD and RSD-P was 22.0 and 0.4 respectively. Growth rates appearaverage compared to other local lakes. There were reports of good angler success forbluegills during the 1996 open water season.     Rock bass abundance in 1996 (3.4 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 - 6.6 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22, but below the historicalaverage (6.0 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (8.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets) wassimilar to the historical average (7.9 inches).     Black crappie abundance in 1996 (1.7 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.3 - 1.7 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 22, but above the historicalaverage (0.7 fish/trapnet). The highest documented black crappie abundance occurred in 1991(2.2 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (7.4 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined)was similar to the historical average (7.9 inches). Black crappie growth rates appear belowaverage for age III compared to other area lakes. Numerous black crappie were harvestedduring the open water creel survey on Green in 1982 (9,185 fish) and 1983 (2,644 fish) eventhough the 1982 summer survey catch rate was low (1.1 fish/trapnet) compared to other locallakes. The 1995 estimated open water creel harvest was only 10 black crappie.     The walleye population abundance has been fairly stable during the last fifteen years,however the average size slightly decreased in 1996. Walleye management will continue to bea high priority even though additional effort has been put on trophy northern pike andsmallmouth bass management. Green has the habitat, water quality, and forage base topotentially produce trophy northern pike and smallmouth bass. In the past, abundant crayfishpopulations have been important forage for producing smallmouth bass. Other abundant forage(cisco, yellow perch) have the potential to produce trophy northern pike. In addition, thereusually is a cool, oxygenated layer present when the lake stratifies in mid summer (asevidence by the cisco population and relatively few summerkill events) which is conducive forproducing trophy northern pike. A statewide experimental regulation study for various speciesincludes Green Lake. Experimental regulations will be implemented for smallmouth bass andnorthern pike by the beginning of the 1997 fishing opener. Related experimental regulationsstudy activities include upcoming creel surveys in 2001-2002, annual spring basselectrofishing surveys, and annual northern pike spawning run assessment netting. Inaddition, ice out trapnetting and tagging of walleye will be conducted to get moreinformation about population size and angler exploitation in conjunction with the creelsurveys being conducted. Other priority management activities will include protecting presentwater quality by encouraging area landowners to practice best management practices(conservation tillage, planting buffer strips, wetland restoration, proper feedlot and manuremanagement, using low/no phosphorus lawn fertilizers, etc.), protecting and expandingexisting stands of hardstem bulrush, yearly assessment of cisco populations through fallgillnetting, and yearly evaluation of walleye natural reproduction through fallelectrofishing. Walleye fingerling stocking on Green will only be considered after twosuccessive years of poor natural reproduction as determined by fall electrofishing. Thebenefits of stocking as needed (two successive years of poor natural reproduction) ratherthan on a prescribed schedule (stocking every even year) is that the valuable walleyefingerling resource can be used more efficiently and effectively (potentially higher rates)for other lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large, deep, moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Greenis a popular walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and smallmouth bass fishery. Local anglersreported good fishing success for catching walleye (1-2 lbs.) and smallmouth in 2000. Greenhas good quality walleye spawning habitat of abundant rock and gravel shoalwater areas.  Fallelectrofishing surveys since 1997 have documented generally low walleye young of year \"YOY\"numbers due to natural reproduction, however moderate yearling walleye numbers weredocumented during ensuing fall electrofishing surveys. Experimental fishing regulations wereenacted during 1997 in order to increase the quality of size for northern pike and smallmouthbass in Green Lake. Initially, the bass experimental regulation allowed for catch and releasefishing only for both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. The northern pike experimentalregulation prohibited the harvest of northern pike 24.0 inches or greater. In 2001, the bassregulation was changed to a maximum harvest length of 14 inches for both smallmouth andlargemouth bass. The bass regulation was modified due to booming high numbers of smallmouthpresent in Green and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population.     Walleye were moderately abundant in the 2000 summer assessment (9.92 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average (9.70 fish/gillnet). The 2000 walleye average size wasmoderate (1.40 lbs. and 15.49 inches, gillnets). The largest walleye captured in the 2000assessment nets was 25.83 inches. Walleye growth rates were below normal for ages 1-8compared to area lakes, but were similar to previous Green Lake surveys. Walleye fry werestocked into Green during 1996 and 2000 as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken from Green forthe 1996 and 2000 statewide hatching quotas. The 2000 spring walleye fry stocking (1.7million fry marked with oxytetracycline) was unsuccessful. Walleye natural reproduction wasalso poor in 2000. The 2000 YOY walleye abundance (11.33 YOY/hour) due to fry stockingand natural reproduction in the 2000 fall electrofishing survey was below the historicalaverage (24.26 fish/hour). The 2000 YOY walleye average length (6.13 inches) from the fallelectrofishing survey was small compared to the historical average (6.63 inches). Moderateyearling (1999 year class) walleye numbers were present in the 2000 fall electrofishingsurvey (13.33 fish/hour, 10.44 inches average size). The Spicer Fisheries Office stockedapproximately 100,000 walleye fingerlings into Green during October of 2000 in response tothe low YOY walleye numbers captured in the 2000 September electrofishing survey.     Smallmouth bass were abundant in the 2000 summer assessment (3.58 fish/gillnet) comparedto the historical average  (1.77 fish/gillnet). Smallmouth bass abundance was greater in 1999(9.00 fish/gillnet) than 2000. The 2000 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.51 lbs.and 13.58 inches, gillnets). The largest smallmouth bass captured in the 2000 assessment netswas 17.32 inches. The 1996 year class comprised 44% of the total 2000 gillnet and trapnetsmallmouth bass catch. Growth rates appeared good for smallmouth bass in Green Lake. Animportant smallmouth bass forage species, crayfish, was less numerous (3.2 crayfish/gillnet)in 2000 than previous surveys in Green Lake (20.6 crayfish/gillnet, historical average).     Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2000 (3.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (3.01 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pike average size was also moderate(2.84 lbs. and 22.55 inches, gillnets), but above the historical average (21.55 inches). Thelargest northern pike captured in 2000 assessment nets was 37.20 inches. Growth rates werenormal or above normal for northern pike in Green compared to area lakes. The 1998 year classcomprised 66% of the total 2000 northern pike catch.     Yellow perch abundance was low in 2000 (9.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the historicalaverage (21.08 fish/gillnet). The 2000 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.15 lbs. and6.93 inches, gillnets).     Bluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (49.80 fish/trapnet) and nearlyidentical to the historical average (49.81 fish/trapnet). The 2000 bluegill average size wassmall (0.10 lbs and 4.87 inches, trapnets).     Other fish species captured in the 2000 summer assessment nets included low numbers oftullibee \"cisco\" (0.42 fish/gillnet); moderate numbers of rock bass (5.50 fish/gillnet),hybrid sunfish (2.93 fish/trapnet), pumpkinseed sunfish (5.07 fish/trapnet), and blackcrappie compared to the Green Lake historical averages. The 2000 rock bass (0.58 lbs. and8.30 inches, gillnets) and pumpkinseed sunfish (0.28 lbs., 6.18 inches, trapnets) sizes weremoderate compared to previous surveys.     The Green Lake fishery appears to be in good condition for walleye, northern pike,smallmouth bass numbers. Forage species (yellow perch, tullibee, crayfish) abundance waslower than the previous year in Green. Future walleye fingerling stocking may take place inGreen if consecutive poor natural year classes occur and the summer gillnet catches fallbelow target levels. The change in the smallmouth bass regulation should allow harvest ofnumerous smaller bass in the fishery, protect and improve numbers of quality (>14 inches) andpotential trophy size smallmouth bass, and limit potential competition with walleye in GreenLake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor Green Lake fish populationnumbers through annual summer netting surveys, spring bass electrofishing surveys and ice outnorthern pike trapping every two years, and annual YOY walleye fall electrofishing surveysin order to evaluate the effectiveness of current management practices and experimentalregulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Green Lake was conducted during late July and early August of 2013. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie (recent years) and bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff into the Middle Fork Crow River. Water levels were low during the 2012 fall, normal during the 2013 spring thru late-summer, but low by fall. Nutrient levels were relatively low during June of 2013 (total phosphorus=0.015 ppm, chlorophyll-a=6.3 ppb). Water clarity was moderate (11.0 feet) for Green Lake on August 1, 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nClimate change effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas. This has favored warm water species (black crappie, bass, bluegill, rock bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such walleye and tullibee. In addition, increased densities of submergent vegetation such as invasive Eurasian watermilfoil have provided added habitat/cover for warm water fish species. The 2013 most frequently observed submergent and algal vegetation species or groups included chara, stonewort, Eurasian watermilfoil, river pondweed, water moss, clasping-leaf pondweed, sago pondweed and curly-leaf pondweed. Emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is also present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, rubble, gravel and boulder. The ice out of May 9th was the latest recorded date since 1897 for Green Lake. The 2013 spring/early summer weather was cold/cool with above normal precipitation, whereas, the late summer and early fall was noticeably warmer with minimal precipitation. Ice on was relatively early (November 27) during 2013 for Green.  <br> \n <br> \nA broad band (3-36 feet) of ideal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (>3 ppm) for tullibee were present in Green during late July and early August of 2013. Although conditions were present for a major tullibee summerkill in 2012, none was observed probably due to low numbers of adults present in the population. A few local residents reported a minor summerkill of dead tullibee near shore areas of Green during 2011. We observed only a few dead tullibee during the 2011 population assessment. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred during the same time period on nearby Lake Koronis in 2011. Green had been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Green Lake was not opened for tullibee gillnetting in 2012 or 2013 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Green.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe threats of present (Eurasian watermilfoil, curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. zebra mussels, quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Both DNR and private attempts to chemically eradicate EWM permanently have been unsuccessful. Private applicators are currently using agricultural based global positioning techniques to better target a specific granular herbicide to known EWM stands. Unfortunately, Eurasian watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. The frequency of occurrence of EWM in near shore transects has increased from 4 sites in 2003, 16 sites in 2007, 20 sites in 2008 and 28 sites in 2013. EWM mean abundance at transect sites has also increased in a similar trend from 2003 (1.3%) to 2013 (12.0%). <br> \n <br> \nEWM and curly-leaf pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previous chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal. Many large stands of EWM on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling EWM in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of EWM on the surface is unlikely to occur throughout Green Lake unlike some milfoil infested lakes with protected bay areas (i.e. Minnetonka) due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels, and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoal water areas of Green Lake. DNR Aquatic invasive species interns will continue to randomly monitor boats entering and leaving the many access sites in an attempt to educate and prevent the spread of exotics into Kandiyohi County Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2013 (33.00/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but below Green Lake historical average (46.76 fish/trapnet). The 2013 bluegill average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.90 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>6.0 inches) bluegill was high (15.86 fish/trapnet). The 2013 catch rate of large (>8.0 inches) bluegill was low (0.64 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-6, but above the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2010 and 2008 year classes comprised 54% and 25% respectively of the 2013 bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (4.33 fish/gillnet) and above the Green Lake historical average (1.20 fish/gillnet). The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate from gillnets (0.44 pounds and 8.08 inches). Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within or above the normal ranges for ages 4-7. The 2012 and 2008 year classes comprised 33% and 22% respectively of the 2013 black crappie catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (3.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green Lake historical average (2.75 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was moderate (3.23 pounds and 24.06 inches) from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of large (>28 inches) northern pike (0.42 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). Northern pike captured in 2003-2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012-2013 assessments were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2013. Northern pike growth rates were generally near or below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 2-8. However, growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 and 2008 year classes comprised 27% and 25% respectively of the 2013 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes, but below the Green Lake historical average (1.92 fish/gillnet). The 2013 smallmouth bass average size was moderately large (1.57 pounds and 12.70 inches) and similar to the historical average (1.55 pounds and 13.36 inches) from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2013 catch rate of large (>14 inches) smallmouth bass (0.75 fish/gillnet) was moderate, but slightly below the historical average (1.17 fish/gillnet). Smallmouth bass condition factors have been poor since 2000 except for 2004 and 2011. Smallmouth bass growth rates were within both the Green Lake and Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2012 and 2008 smallmouth bass year classes comprised 29% and 21% respectively of the 2013 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. <br> \n  <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2007-2009 and 2012-2013. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2011 (1.1 crayfish/gillnet), 2010 (0.3 crayfish/gillnet), 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2002-2004 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 6.7 crayfish/gillnet for Green.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in the 2013 summer (0.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green Lake historical average summer catch rate (2.24 fish/gillnet). The 2013 summer tullibee average size was large (1.13 pounds and 14.57 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical summer average weight is 0.62 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nThere were low numbers of tullibee (16.50 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2013 fall using specialized gillnets (200 feet length, 6 feet deep, 1.75 inch bar mesh) that target adult spawning tullibee. The 2013 fall tullibee average size was large (1.42 pounds and 14.61 inches) for Green. Tullibee growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1 and 6, but below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2008 year class comprised 88% of 2013 fall tullibee catch. Low numbers of tullibee (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches average length) were also captured in the 2012 fall survey of Green Lake using standard graduated mesh lake survey nets. The 2008 year class comprised 76% of the 2012 fall tullibee catch in Green Lake. Low numbers of tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis (5.33 fish/gillnet, 14.91 inches average length) in the 2012 fall standard lake survey gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nThe lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of 2010-2013 as sampled by DNR or private netters during the open season is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in good hatches and survival of tullibee in Green Lake if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (1.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Green Lake historical average (13.90 fish/gillnet). The trend of low yellow perch numbers have been reported in other statewide lakes during recent years. The 2013 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 6.25 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were near the upper ends of the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-2. All yellow perch captured in the 2013 gillnets were from the 2011 year class.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2013 (8.58 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes, but slightly below the Green Lake historical average (9.17 fish/gillnet). The 2013 walleye average size was moderate (1.49 pounds and 15.36 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.27 pounds and 14.67 inches from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>15 inches) walleye was moderate (4.42 fish/gillnet) and slightly above the historical average (3.89 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2013 catch rate of large (>20 inches) walleye (0.92 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (0.77 fish/gillnet). Walleye condition factors were fair to poor in 2013. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. Growth rates were generally above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 3-8. Recent walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2011 and 2009 year classes each comprised about 18% of the 2013 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Other moderate walleye year classes present included 2006-2008, 2010 and 2012. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 33% of the 2013 walleye gillnet catch of 9-14 inch size range (2012-2010 year classes). <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. OTC marked walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001 and 2007-2013. Approximately 2.0 million OTC marked walleye fry were stocked in Green during 2013. The walleye fry were stocked in part as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Marked OTC walleye fingerlings (30,787 fish) accounted for 60% of the fingerlings stocked (51,641 fish) in Green during the 2008 fall. Walleye unmarked fingerlings (91,716 fish, 3,208 pounds) and OTC marked fry (1,999,770 fish) were stocked into Green during 2013. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and larger walleye (fingerlings and adults) were stocked in 1994, 1992 and 1990. <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted on October 7, 2013 to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2013 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches average length). OTC marked fish comprised 40% (2013 fry stocked year class) of the 2013 fall YOY walleye catch. OTC marked fish (2012 fry stocked year class) comprised 55% (6.60 YOY/hour) of the 2012 YOY fall walleye catch (12.00 YOY/hour). Moderate numbers of YOY walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY walleye catch rate and length are 13.89 YOY/hour and 6.73 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Yearling walleye numbers were low (1.00 fish/hour, 8.58 inches) in the 2013 fall survey. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were abundant in 2013 (10.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and Green Lake historical average (8.04 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2013 rock bass average size was small (0.35 pounds and 7.18 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Green Lake historical average (0.74 fish/gillnet). The 2013 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.07 pounds and 11.38 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.70 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates were generally below or near both the Green Lake and Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 2-5. The 2011 and 2008 largemouth year classes comprised 42% and 25% respectively of the 2012 largemouth bass gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of white sucker (1.00 fish/gillnet), carp (0.14 fish/trapnet), pumpkinseed sunfish (0.79 fish/trapnet), hybrid sunfish (1.36 fish/trapnet) and black bullhead (0.14 fish/trapnet). Moderate numbers of large yellow bullhead were captured in 2013 (3.33 fish/gillnet, 1.01 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2014 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2014 summer for all fish species by assessment nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Green Lake was conducted during late July to early August of 2018. A targeted fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 18, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A targeted fall gillnetting survey was conducted for Walleye during late September of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A creel survey was last conducted on Green Lake during 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Water clarity was excellent (14.5 feet) for Green Lake on August 2, 2018. Submergent vegetation frequencies appeared higher for several species (various pondweeds, milfoil species and coontail) in Green during the 2018 summer compared to previous surveys. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble and boulder.  <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (Zebra Mussels, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. Starry Stonewort, Quagga Mussels, Spiny Water Flea, Faucet Snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Climate change and invasive species effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas due to warmer waters and increased near shore nutrient deposition. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". Furthermore, increased densities of submergent vegetation species such as invasive Eurasian Watermilfoil since 2000 have provided added habitat/cover for many warm water fish species. Eurasian Watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. It was more prevalent in water depths greater than 10 feet and less frequent in shallower water during 2018. Zebra Mussels have decreased green algal abundance resulting in lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from pelagic to benthic habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased fish condition factors and also increased water clarity since 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2018 gillnets and trapnets for Green compared to the historical averages and similar lakes. The Black Crappie population is made up of mostly smaller sized fish (< 8.0 inches) and younger year classes (2016 and 2015). Although, larger sized (>10.0 inch) fish are present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in the 2018 trapnets compared to the historical average and similar lakes. The Bluegill average size was excellent (0.24 pounds and 6.4 inches), but 42% of the catch were 6 years and older fish. Growth rates were below average for younger fish, but better for older fish. Anglers generally have good success catching larger Bluegill near Eurasian Watermilfoil patches or break off areas in 10-15 feet of water during the summer on Green.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers continue to be abundant in Green due to increased habitat (i.e. Eurasian Watermilfoil). The average size is small (0.55 pounds and 9.3 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers (3.42 fish/gillnet) were moderate compared to similar lakes, but above average for Green in 2018.  The 2018 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.78 pounds and 22.3 inches) from gillnets, but below the historical average (3.18 pounds and 23.5 inches). Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (Yellow Perch and Tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2018. Green Lake is one of the few local lakes that still have trophy size Northern Pike (>40.0 inches) present. The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2018 gillnets was 37.6 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were abundant and above both the Green Lake historical average and normal range for similar lakes. The 2018 Rock Bass average weight and length were 0.47 pounds and 8.1 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers (0.67 fish/gillnet) were lower in 2018 compared to the historical average (1.79 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2018 Smallmouth Bass average size (1.60 pounds and 13.5 inches) was large, but similar to the historical average. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 17.2 inches in the 2018 survey. Large sized Crayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999, but were more abundant in our 2018 gillnets compared to previous surveys. We did observe numerous small sized crayfish in the stomachs of Smallmouth Bass and Rock Bass. Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to a new forage species \"Zebra Mussel\" present in Green. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the 2018 or 2017 summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.93 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A November targeted gillnet survey was not conducted for Tullibee in 2018, but will be scheduled for 2019. Tullibee numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.3 inches) in the most recent 2017 November targeted survey. Green Lake has not been opened for Tullibee public gillnetting since 2011 due to the low Tullibee numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish, especially for larger Northern Pike and Walleye in Green. Tullibee can also provide a secondary fishing opportunity during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low in 2018 (1.50 fish/gillnet). Yellow Perch abundance has been less than 10.00 fish/gillnet every survey since 2002. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow. The average size was small (0.09 pounds and 6.4 inches) during 2018. Local anglers have reported in past years seeing numerous small Yellow Perch amongst the Chara \"Muskgrass\" beds with cameras during the summer or while spearing in the winter. Our standard gillnets may not effectively sample these small (<5.0 inches) Yellow Perch. Predation pressures from various species (i.e. Rock Bass, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, etc.) may have also selected for smaller sized and earlier reproducing Yellow Perch restricted to near bottom habitat containing dense Chara beds in Green. A statewide study will examining Yellow Perch catchability, growth and maturity using small mesh gillnets in Green and other lakes in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013, 2016-2018. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 or 2015 due to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and yearling plus fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction and fry stocking success has been minimal at best since 2012. Low Young of Year \"YOY\" or fingerling sized Walleye numbers were captured in the 2018 (1.00 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches), 2014 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches), 2013 (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches), and 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured during the 2017, 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2018 summer gillnets (3.25 fish/gillnet) was below historical average catch rate of 8.51 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2018 Walleye average size was moderate (1.94 pounds and 17.18 inches) but above the historical average from gillnets. Recent Walleye year classes have been due to some limited natural reproduction, but mostly to fingerling and fry stockings from 2001-2014. Fingerling and yearling stockings have primarily contributed to the recent year classes since 2015. The 2018 walleye survey catch was comprised of 2011 (10%), 2012 (21%), 2013 (3%), 2014 (8%), 2015 (19%), 2016 (24%) and 2017 (2%) year classes. The 2011 Walleye year class was successful in many area lakes. OTC marked Walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 60%, 36%, 8% and 0% respectively of the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 year classes caught in the 2018 Walleye combined summer and fall survey catches. YOY Walleye catch rates from 5-30 fish per hour due to fry stockings or natural reproduction may be adequate for providing a moderate year class in larger or clearer lakes. However, future Walleye fry stockings and natural reproduction may be less successful in Green due to poor survival from potential negative effects on zooplankton populations by Zebra Mussels. Continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of White Sucker, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish and Black Bullhead during 2018. Moderate numbers of large Yellow Bullhead were also captured in 2018 (3.25 fish/gillnet, 0.94 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2019 for YOY Walleye abundance, 2019 fall for Tullibee and the summer of 2019 for all fish species by standard survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Green Lake during September 17, 2020. Previous fall electrofishing surveys were conducted at six stations for a total of 60 minutes. The 2020 survey was conducted as part of a larger statewide research study to evaluate fall electrofishing catch effectiveness for different total shocking times. Nine stations were sampled for a total of 120 minutes in 2020. The water temperature was 64 F. Water levels were low during 2020. Shocking was difficult due to numerous docks and lifts still in the water during the survey. We observed abundant numbers of Brook Silverside, Bluegill, Rock Bass and small Yellow Perch in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. A standard summer survey was done in early August of 2020. A targeted fall gillnetting survey for Walleye was done in late September of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013, 2016 and 2018. OTC is an antibiotic. Fry are immersed in an OTC bath for several hours prior to stocking. It leaves a noticeable ring on the ear bone \"otolith\" which distinguishes it from natural or non-marked fish. A sample of Walleye are sacrificed from surveys for inspection of marks in order to estimate a ratio of stocked versus natural Walleye in a lake. This determines if fry stocking is necessary for a lake. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020, 2019, 2017, 2015 or 2014 due in part to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were mostly part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped age 3+ adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and ages 1+ fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer Strain Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adult (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low yearling/adult Walleye numbers were caught in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2019 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.24 inches), 2018 (1.00 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches), 2014 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches), 2013 (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches) and 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured during the 2017, 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% (6.60 YOY/hour) of the 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY Walleye catch rate and length are 10.74 YOY/hour and 6.81 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches). Yearling Walleye numbers were moderate to low in the 2014 (6.00 fish/hour), 2016 (3.00 fish/hour) and 2018 (2.00 fish/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2017 and 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the 2020 fall survey (8.25 fish/gillnet) was higher than the summer survey (4.00 fish/gillnet). The 2020 Walleye average sizes were similar for the fall (1.91 pounds and 17.25 inches) and summer surveys (2.01 pounds and 17.42 inches). The 2020 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye was higher for fall (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to summer (2.83 fish/gillnet). The 2020 fall catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches and larger) Walleye (1.75 fish/gillnet) was higher than the summer catch rate (0.83 fish/gillnet) Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2021 for YOY Walleye abundance, 2022 fall for Tullibee and the summer of 2021 for all fish species by standard survey nets. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (maximum depth 110 feet), low-moderate productive lake located near Spicer, MN in Kandiyohi County. Green has excellent water quality compared to most other lakes in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity is excellent (secchi disk reading 12.0 feet on 6-16-92). Nutrient levels are low. However, the Middle Fork of the Crow River via Mud Lake (34-0158) and Nest Lake (34-0154) is a constant source of moderate nutrient loading to Green Lake. So far Green has been able to assimilate these incoming nutrients without an appreciable change in productive status. In addition to the Middle Fork of the Crow River, there are seven other inlets which all but one connect to shallow permanent lakes/marshes. The outlet (Middle Fork of the Crow River) is located on the northeast side of the lake and connects to Lake Calhoun (34-0062) via a marsh. The immediate watershed types are primarily municipal (residential homes), mixed hardwoods, and marshlands. Green is heavily developed. The lake substrate is composed of about 37% sand, 29% gravel, 25% rubble, 7% boulder, 1% clay, and 1% marl. There are several long shallow bars (Hultgren's, Lone Tree, Grate's, Castle Flats) located in the lake. Emergent vegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush with some common cattail, cane, and reed canary grass) are restricted to the outlet area and a small stand near the \"Spicer Castle\" along the south shore. There is a variety of submergent vegetation species, but density is light throughout most of the lake with the exception of the northeast shore (outlet). Green has been intensively stocked with a variety of species (primarily walleye, northern pike), densities, and frequencies over the years. Smallmouth bass were introduced in the early 1940's. Tullibee (cisco) were thought to be introduced into Green during the late 1800's. Historically, rescue operations have been common in adjacent connected winterkill lakes/marshes for northern pike and walleye. In the last ten years, stocking efforts have been devoted to walleye and winter rescue northern pike. In the fall of 1993, fall electrofishing was begun to assess the contributions of natural reproduction and stocking to the walleye fishery in Green. Commercial removal has been limited in the last ten years to some carp (16,160 lbs) and suckers (2,900 lbs). Green is a popular lake for walleye, northern pike, and smallmouth bass angling. In addition, tullibee \"cisco\" gillnetting is allowed for a two week period usually during mid to late November.     Walleye abundance in 1993 (9.3 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.7 - 10.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (8.0 fish/gillnet). The 1993 average size was the same as the historical average (1.3 lbs). Growth rates appear average compared to other local lakes. Significant natural reproduction was documented in 1993. Fall electrofishing catch rates in 1993 were 46.0 young of year walleye/hour and 30.3 yearling walleye/hour. Natural reproduction in 1992 probably contributed to most of the yearling catch in 1993, however stocking in the fall 1992 (2,056 lbs, 90,670 fish) may also have contributed.      Northern pike abundance in 1993 (3.1 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 - 8.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and similar to the historical average (2.9 fish/gillnet). The largest northern pike caught in the gillnets was 32.0 inches. The 1993 average weight (2.5 lbs) was similar to the historical average (2.6 lbs). Growth rates appear good compared to local lakes, however no fish over five years old were caught in the survey gear. There are several inlets marshes (Alvig Slough, East Woodcock Lake) and the outlet marsh area which northern pike spawning occurs.     Yellow perch abundance in 1993 (32.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (8.1 - 50.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical abundance (19.8 fish/gillnet). Gillnet catch rates have ranged from a low of 4.7 fish/gillnet in 1979 to a high of 32.7 fish/gillnet in 1993. The 1993 average size was 6.5 inches. Growth rates appear slightly below average compared to other local lakes.     Tullibee \"cisco\" abundance in 1993 summer survey (10.2 fish/gillnet) was the highest recorded value and also above the normal range (0.7 - 6.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The historical average is 4.0 fish/gillnet. The 1993 average size (0.4 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (0.3 lbs). Growth rates appear similar to previous surveys. About 66% of the fish caught were from the 1992 year class. Cool summers and good dissolved oxygen levels throughout the water column the past two years probably contributed to the increased survival and recruitment of tullibee. A partial summerkill of tullibee occurred in 1988 and 1983 probably due to higher water temperatures/lower dissolved oxygen levels during the late summer in those years.     Smallmouth bass abundance (1.2 fish/gillnet) in 1993 was the highest recorded value and was above the normal range (0.2 - 0.7 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The historical average gillnet catch was 0.5 fish/gillnet. The largest fish captured in the summer survey was 18.3 inches. Growth rates appear average. Although the 1993 summer catch was the highest recorded value, the 1993 spring electrofishing abundance rating (1.9 fish/hour) was below previous spring estimates (1991= 26.5 fish/hour, 1990= 8.0 fish/hour). The 1993 spring electrofishing estimates may have been negatively influenced by poor shocking conditions (high winds, frequent precipitation, higher water levels) that occurred in May and June of 1993. Smallmouth anglers tend to have the greatest success along the long shallow bars and the northeast side of the lake.      Largemouth bass 1993 spring electrofishing catch rate (1.9 fish/hour) was poor compared to previous surveys (1991= 8.0 fish/hour, 1990= 57.7 fish/hour). Poor shocking conditions may have also influenced the low largemouth bass catch rate in 1993. The 1993 average weight (0.6 lbs) was similar to the historical average (0.7 lbs).      Rock bass abundance in 1993 (10.1 fish/gillnet) was the highest recorded value and was above the normal range (0.6 - 4.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. The historical average was 6.6 fish/gillnet. The 1993 average weight (0.5 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (0.4 lbs). The 1993 average size was 8.6 inches.      Black crappie abundance (0.3 fish/trapnet) was slightly within the normal range (0.2 - 1.5 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (0.7 fish/trapnet). The 1993 average weight was the same as the historical average (0.3 lbs). Black crappie were most abundant in the 1982 survey (1.1 fish/trapnet). Growth rates appear below average compared to other local lakes.      Bluegill catch rates (96.8 fish/trapnet) in 1993 were above the normal range (3.1 - 47.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (64.1 fish/trapnet). The average size was 4.7 inches. The optimal density and population size structure occurred in 1986 (31.5 fish/trapnet, 35% of fish were greater than 6 inches). Anglers generally have the greatest success for catching bluegill along the bulrush fringes of the northeast shore area.     Black bullhead abundance (1.3 fish/trapnet) in 1993 was within the normal range (0.3 - 2.9 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and slightly below the historical average (1.9 fish/trapnet). The 1993 average black bullhead weight was the same as the historical average (0.4 lbs). Yellow bullhead abundance in 1993 (0.7 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.1 - 4.8 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (0.5 fish/trapnet). The 1993 yellow bullhead weight (0.9 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (0.7 lbs).     The 1993 bowfin \"dogfish\" catch rate (2.0 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.3 - 1.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and slightly above the historical average (1.7 fish/trapnet). The 1993 average weight (4.3 lbs) was similar to the historical average (4.6 lbs).     Green has a variety of fishing opportunities (walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie), especially for those anglers who prefer the challenge of fishing a large lake with lots of structure. Green is a popular lake among local and non local anglers. Night fishing (trolling, casting) for walleye along the shallow bars is quite popular, but deep jigging is also a successful technique during the daytime. Unlike other area lakes where walleye fishing may slow down during mid summer, anglers often continue having success on Green. The abundant forage base of tullibee and yellow perch has the potential of producing trophy walleye and northern pike. Priority management activities should include maintaining present water quality conditions, protecting and expanding hardstem bulrush stands, maintaining inlet access for northern pike to make natural spawning runs (Alvig Slough, East Woodcock, Outlet marsh), winter rescue of northern pike when necessary, evaluating the contributions of walleye stockings and the necessity of further stockings through fall electrofishing and lake surveys, determine the extent of angler exploitation on smallmouth bass populations, biannual sampling of bass populations through spring electrofishing, enacting experimental regulations if necessary for smallmouth bass and northern pike to create more trophy fish available. Another option would be to introduce muskellunge to Green. The size, structure, habitat, and available forage (tullibee) has the possibility of producing a viable population of trophy muskellunge for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in mid July of 2002. Green is a large, deep, low-moderate productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation is generally limited in the lake. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, fishing pier, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake. The dominant substrates (rock, rubble, gravel) present in the shoal water areas are not suitable for aquatic vegetation establishment. Experimental regulations for both northern pike and smallmouth bass were enacted in 1997 in order to increase the average size and produce trophy fisheries of smallmouth bass and northern pike in Green Lake. The northern pike experimental regulation (24 inch maximum size limit) prohibits the harvest of fish 24 inches and greater. The smallmouth and largemouth bass regulation was originally catch and release only. However, the bass regulation was modified to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit in 2001. The bass regulation was changed because of increasing numbers of smallmouth bass and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population in Green Lake. A summer creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during the 2001 summer (May 10 - September 30) as an on going evaluation of the two experimental regulations.Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2002 (63.9 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average catch rate (51.1 fish/trapnet) for Green. The 2002 bluegill average size was small (0.09 lbs. and 4.7 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.1 inches from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 9.3 inches from the 2002 summer assessment. The 2002 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (8.3 fish/trapnet) in the 2002 summer assessment. Northern pike numbers were low to moderate in 2002 (2.8 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average catch rate (3.0 fish/gillnet) for Green. The northern pike average size was moderate to large (4.45 lbs. and 24.8 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 21.7 inches from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured was 38.3 inches in the 2002 summer assessment. Northern pike growth rates in Green were above the normal ranges for ages 1-7 compared to area lakes. The Green Lake northern pike population is also evaluated every other spring through ice out trapping. The northern pike average size has increased both in the summer and spring ice out assessments since the experimental regulation was enacted in 1997. Smallmouth bass numbers were abundant in 2002 (3.2 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average catch rate (1.92 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2002 smallmouth bass average size was moderate to large (1.87 lbs. and 14.5 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.2 inches from gillnets for Green. The largest smallmouth bass captured was 19.1 inches from the 2002 summer assessment. The 2002 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was high (2.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (1.19 fish/gillnet). About 31% of the smallmouth bass captured in the 2002 summer assessment were from a 1997 year class. Smallmouth bass growth rates calculated in the Green 2002 summer assessment were generally below the normal ranges compared to Green Lake historical growth data. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not caught in the 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 15.7 crayfish/gillnet. Local anglers have reported excellent success catching large smallmouth bass in recent years. However, local anglers have expressed concern over the relatively high smallmouth population effect via competition on the presently low walleye population in Green Lake.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in 2002 (0.3 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average catch rate (2.9 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2002 tullibee average size was moderate (0.56 lbs. and 11.00 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average length is 10.1 inches from gillnets. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and large walleye.Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2002 (21.1 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average catch rate (20.7 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2002 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 lbs. and 6.4 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average length is 6.6 inches from gillnets. The largest yellow perch captured was 9.7 inches in the 2002 summer assessment. Walleye numbers were low in 2002 (6.3 fish/gillnet) and below the historical average catch rate (9.4 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2002 walleye average size was moderate (1.27 lbs. and 14.3 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 14.6 inches from gillnets for Green. The largest walleye captured was 24.3 inches in the 2002 summer assessment. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye in 2002 (2.8 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (4.1 fish/gillnet) for Green. Walleye growth rates calculated in the Green 2002 summer assessment were below the normal ranges for ages 1-8 compared to area lakes, but similar to the Green Lake historical growth rate data. Local anglers reported below average walleye angling success for numbers, although smaller sized walleye were reported being caught with greater frequency than the previous year.Walleye natural reproduction in Green was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers from 1993-1996 based on previous fall and summer surveys. However, walleye natural reproduction has been fair to poor from 1997-2002. Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked into Green every year from 2000-2002 because of poor walleye natural reproduction. No young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in the 2002 fall night electrofishing survey. The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 18.7 fish/hour for non stocked fish in Green Lake. All small walleye sampled in the 2002 fall night electrofishing survey (16.0 yearlings/hour) were marked fish from the 2001 stocking of walleye fry (1.04 million fish). The 2001 walleye fry stocking was from a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for statewide hatching operations. Unmarked walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked during the 2001 fall (144,386 fingerlings, 4,162 lbs.; 104 yearlings, 26 lbs.) and the 2002 fall (5,976 fingerlings, 432 lbs.; 12,617 yearlings, 3,127 lbs.) because of low documented YOY walleye numbers due to poor natural reproduction.Rock bass numbers were abundant in 2002 (13.7 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average catch rate (6.4 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2002 rock bass average size was small to moderate (0.37 lbs. and 7.3 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 8.1 inches from gillnets. The largest rock bass captured was 11.3 inches from the 2002 summer assessment.Current fish management activities on Green include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian water milfoil if possible within and out of Green Lake, participating in the Middle Fork of the Crow River Watershed Project, monitoring both smallmouth bass and northern pike populations for the experimental regulations study, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Green Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2003 spring for smallmouth bass and the 2003 summer for all species. Ice out trapping assessment for northern pike will occur in 2003. A fall electrofishing for young of year walleye will occur in 2003.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Green Lake was conducted in early August of 2003. Green is a large, deep, low-moderate productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, fishing pier, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake.  Water levels were normal during the spring and early summer, but low by fall due to drought conditions in 2003. Thirty-two inlets/tiles/culverts were identified draining into Green Lake during the 2003 resurvey. The largest inlet is the Middle Fork of the Crow River, which enters Green along the north shore via the Old Mill Inn Dam. The Middle Fork of the Crow River outlets near the northeast corner of Green and connects to Calhoun Lake. A Highway 23 four-lane construction project began adjacent to Green Lake during 2003. Significant runoff (sediment) from the Highway 23 construction project drained into Green during several large rainfall events in late June and early July of 2003. One of the few positive aspects of the Highway 23 project was the construction of retention ponds along the Highway 23 corridor to reduce or slow future runoff into Green Lake. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.016) and clarity (13.00 ft on 6/9/2003) readings taken during early June of 2003 indicated good results, but water clarity (secchi=4.83 ft on 8/4/2003) was significantly reduced by August of 2003. The most frequently occurring shoalwater substrates noted in the 2003 resurvey were sand, gravel, rubble, and boulder. The most frequently occurring submergent vegetations species present in 2003 included muskgrass (chara), filamentous algae, stonewort, water moss, sago pondweed, and variable pondweed. Hardstem bulrush stands were present in the outlet bay area and south shore near an area called the Spicer Castle.Experimental regulations for both northern pike and smallmouth bass were enacted in 1997 in order to increase the average size and produce trophy fisheries of smallmouth bass and northern pike in Green Lake. The northern pike experimental regulation (24 inch maximum size limit) prohibits the harvest of fish 24 inches and greater. The smallmouth and largemouth bass regulation was originally catch and release only. However, the bass regulation was modified to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit in 2001. The bass regulation was modified again in the 2003 fall to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit with one bass over 21 inches allowed. The bass regulation was changed because of increasing numbers of smallmouth bass and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population in Green Lake. A summer creel survey will be conducted on Green Lake during 2004-2005 as an on going evaluation of the two experimental regulations. A public input meeting will occur during the 2005 fall to determine the fate of current experimental regulations for northern pike and bass on Green for 2006 and beyond.Bluegill numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (60.6 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges (25th=26.6, 50th=55.2, 75th=74.3 fish/trapnet) for Green and similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 51.7 fish/trapnet. The 2003 bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 4.8 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.1 inches from trapnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (17.1 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were generally below the normal ranges compared to area lakes. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2003 (2.9 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range (25th=2.6, 50th=3.0, 75th=3.6 fish/gillnet) for Green, but below the normal range for similar lakes. The Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate is 3.0 fish/gillnet. The 2003 northern pike average size were moderate (3.66 pounds and 24.9 inches) from gillnets. However, the northern pike captured in 2003 were notably lean in appearance and poor condition compared to fish captured in the previous 2002 assessment. The northern pike historical average length is 22.0 inches from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Green were within or above the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. The 2001 Northern pike year class comprised 48% of the 2003 total northern pike survey catch. The northern pike average size has increased both in the summer and spring ice out surveys since the experimental regulation was enacted in 1997. The largest northern pike captured in the 2003 summer survey was 39.5 inches.Smallmouth bass numbers were moderate to high in 2003 (2.4 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges (25th=0.4, 50th=1.0, 75th=2.7 fish/gillnet) for Green and for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.9 fish/gillnet from Green. No spring electrofishing surveys for bass were conducted in 2003. The 2003 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.32 pounds and 12.0 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.1 inches from gillnets for Green. The 2003 catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches) and larger smallmouth bass was moderate (1.1 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green historical average (1.2 fish/gillnet). The 2002 smallmouth bass year class comprised 47% of the total 2003 smallmouth bass survey catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates calculated in 2003 from Green were generally below or near the low end of the normal ranges for ages 1-3, but above the normal ranges for ages 4-5 compared to Green Lake historical growth data. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not caught in the 2003 or 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 15.7 crayfish/gillnet.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in 2003 (0.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges (25th=0.4, 50th=1.7, 75th=3.4 fish/gillnet) for Green and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average catch rate is 2.8 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2003 tullibee average size was small (0.27 pounds. and 9.4 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average length is 10.0 inches from gillnets. Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and large walleye.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (5.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges (25th=14.1, 50th=19.1, 75th=26.2 fish/gillnet) for Green and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 19.7 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2003 yellow perch average size was moderate to small (0.12 pounds. and 6.6 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were variable compared to area lakes. The 2000 yellow perch year class comprised 82% of the 2003 total yellow perch survey catch.Walleye numbers were moderate in 2003 (9.4 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range (25th=7.9, 50th=9.5, 75th=10.0 fish/gillnet) for Green, but high compared to similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.4 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2003 walleye average size was moderate (1.38 pounds. and 15.1 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 14.6 inches from gillnets. The 2003 catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye in 2003 (4.7 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (4.2 fish/gillnet) for Green. The 2001 year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 42% of the total 2003 walleye survey catch. Walleye growth rates calculated from the 2003 Green survey were below the normal ranges for area lakes, but similar to historical growth rates for Green. Walleye natural reproduction in Green was generally both frequent and adequate to sustain walleye numbers based on previous fall and summer surveys from 1993-1996. However, walleye natural reproduction has been fair to poor from 1997-2003. Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked in Green every year from 2000-2003 because of poor walleye natural reproduction. Walleye fry (1,768,781 fry) were stocked during the 2003 spring. Low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (4.0 YOY walleye/hour, 8.5 inches average size) were captured in the 2003 fall night electrofishing survey. The YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 18.6 YOY walleye/hour for Green Lake. Approximately 3,550 pounds of walleye adults/yearlings (18,597 fish) and 654 pounds of walleye fingerlings (18,650 fish) were stocked during 2003 spring and fall.   Rock bass numbers were high in 2003 (12.6 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges (25th=3.5, 50th=6.4, 75th=8.7 fish/gillnet) for Green and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 6.8 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2003 rock bass average size was moderate to small (0.27 pounds. and 6.7 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average length is 8.0 inches from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Green include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian water milfoil if possible within and out of Green Lake, participating in the Middle Fork of the Crow River Watershed Project, monitoring both smallmouth bass and northern pike populations for the experimental regulations study, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Green Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2004 spring for smallmouth bass and the 2004 summer for all species. Ice out trapping assessment for northern pike will occur in the 2004 spring. A fall electrofishing survey for young of year walleye will occur in 2004. A creel survey will be conducted during 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the bass and northern pike experimental regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Green Lake was conducted during early August of 2014. Green is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie (recent years) and bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff into the Middle Fork Crow River. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014 from inlets due to rain events, but low by fall. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. High water levels caused some shoreline erosion in addition to many docks and boat lifts floating away from their moorings. Nutrient levels were relatively low during June of 2013 (total phosphorus=0.015 ppm, chlorophyll-a=6.3 ppb). Water clarity was poor (5.5 feet) for Green Lake on August 6, 2014. Water clarity ranged from 5.5-13.3 feet during bi-monthly sampling from June-August of 2014. <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil, and curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Both DNR and private attempts to chemically eradicate EWM have been unsuccessful. Eurasian watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. EWM and curly-leaf pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previous chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal.  <br> \n <br> \nOne adult zebra mussel was found on a dock along the southeast shore of Green during the early summer of 2014. No additional zebra mussels were found until the fall of 2014. Numerous small young zebra mussels were found attached on docks and boat lifts scattered throughout Green Lake. Zebra mussel eradication techniques (e.g. potassium chloride \"potash\", zequanox, copper sulfate, etc.) have been recently tried in metro area lakes where populations have not spread throughout the lake. Zequanox is a combination of specific dead bacteria cells which are toxic to zebra mussels. Eradication of zebra mussels is improbable once mussels spread throughout a lake due to their ability to reproduce large numbers of young zebra mussel \"veligers\" by a small number of adults. Green Lake will continue to be monitored to document the impacts zebra mussels may have on the lake ecology (i.e. water clarity, substrate effects, aquatic vegetation, plankton abundance, native species responses, etc.). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2014 (29.60/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 46.16 fish/trapnet. The 2014 bluegill average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 6.18 inches), but above the historical average weight of 0.13 pounds from trapnets. Abundant numbers of moderate sized (6.00 plus inches) bluegill (16.87 fish/trapnet) were captured in the 2014 trapnets. However, only low numbers of larger (8.00 plus inches) bluegill (0.80 fish/trapnet) were captured in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2014 (2.67 fish/gillnet, 2.13 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical averages of 1.25 fish/gillnet and 0.76 fish/trapnet. The 2014 black crappie average sizes were moderate from gillnets (0.35 pounds and 7.68 inches), but slightly larger from trapnets (0.43 pounds and 8.70 inches). The black crappie historical average lengths are 7.85 inches for both gillnets and trapnets. Black crappie growth rates are excellent for ages 2+ fish in Green. The 2012 and 2011 year classes combined comprised 70% of the black crappie captured in 2014 survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderately abundant in 2014 (3.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 2.77 fish/gillnet. The 2014 northern pike average size was moderate (3.36 pounds and 24.10 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight and length are 3.15 pounds and 23.37 inches from gillnets. The 2014 catch rate of larger (28.00 plus inches) northern pike (0.58 fish/gillnet) was moderate and similar to the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). The largest northern pike captured was 35.1 inches from a gillnet in 2014. Northern pike growth rates were low to moderate especially for ages 1-5, but better for ages 6+ fish. Northern pike captured have been notably lean in appearance during most recent surveys compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2014. The 2011 year class comprised 30% of the 2014 northern pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were low in 2014 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 1.88 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2014 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (0.92 pounds and 11.38 inches), but smaller than the historical average size of 1.53 pounds and 13.28 inches from gillnets. Low numbers of larger (14.00 inch plus) smallmouth bass (0.33 fish/gillnet) were captured in 2014 gillnets. Smallmouth bass growth rates were poor. <br> \n <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 2002. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2014 (0.08 crayfish/gillnet. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 6.4 crayfish/gillnet for Green. Research has identified crayfish and pumpkinseed sunfish as predators of smaller zebra mussels. Crayfish numbers may increase in Green due a new species present \"zebra mussel\" which crayfish may readily prey upon. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for smallmouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in the 2014 summer (0.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.16 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2014 summer tullibee average size was small (0.26 pounds and 8.62 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical summer average weight is 0.60 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nVertical gillnets were set for tullibee at three deepwater (60-105 feet deep) sites which included the north side adjacent to Hultgren's Bar (deepest part), southwest side and southeast side during late August of 2014. There were 153 tullibee captured in 15 vertical gillnets. Tullibee captured with this gear averaged 9.8 inches and ranged from 3.2 to 16.5 inches. Approximately 39% of the tullibee captured were likely young of year fish and 44% were probably ages 6+ to 8+ (2006-2009 year classes) based on historical growth data. The tullibee average depth at capture was 27.9 feet during late August. The thermocline in Green was set up at 49 feet over the deepest area of the lake (105 feet) and the temperature when dissolved oxygen dropped to 3.0 ppm was 72.5 F. Tullibee were sampled in waters from 3.3 to 32.8 feet deep. These waters ranged in temperatures from 60 to 75 F and dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.07 to 7.95 ppm. <br> \n <br> \nNo fall tullibee sampling was conducted in 2014 due to early onset of ice conditions during the peak spawning time period. There were low numbers of tullibee (16.50 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2013 fall using specialized gillnets (200 feet length, 6 feet deep, 1.75 inch bar mesh) that target adult spawning tullibee. The 2013 fall tullibee average size was large (1.42 pounds and 14.61 inches) for Green. The 2008 year class comprised 88% of 2013 fall tullibee catch. Low numbers of tullibee (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches average length) were also captured in the 2012 fall survey of Green Lake using standard graduated mesh lake survey nets. Low numbers of tullibee were also captured in nearby Lake Koronis in the 2014 summer (0.20 fish/gillnet, 8.74 inches average length) and fall (6.00 fish/gillnet, 15.95 inches average length) using standard lake survey gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was not opened for public tullibee gillnetting in the 2013 or 2014 fall due to low numbers in recent surveys. The lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of 2010-2013 as sampled by DNR or private netters during the open season is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in good hatches and survival of tullibee in Green Lake if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2014 (2.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 13.53 fish/gillnet. The 2014 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.26 inches), but similar to the historical average size (0.12 pounds) from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were poor. Local anglers have reported seeing numerous small yellow perch (<6 inches) with cameras amongst the chara beds along the bottom during winter and summer. Intense predation by walleye, bass and northern pike on larger yellow perch may explain the low catches of moderate to larger perch in summer gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2014 (6.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 9.07 fish/gillnet, but near the median catch rate for similar lakes. The 2014 walleye average size was moderate (1.36 pounds and 15.21 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.27 pounds and 14.69 inches from gillnets. Low numbers of moderate sized (15.00 plus inches) walleye (2.83 fish/gillnet) were captured from gillnets in 2014. Walleye growth rates were poor for ages 1-8 compared to other Spicer Area lakes, but moderate for ages 3-6 compared to Green Lake historical growth data. The 2011 and 2012 year classes comprised about 35% and 14% respectively of the 2014 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Recent walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001.   <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake had been stocked annually with walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. No walleye fry were stocked in 2014 due to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were part of a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Walleye fingerlings (41,344 fish, 3,652 pounds) were stocked into Green during 2014. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted on October 7, 2014 to evaluate walleye natural reproduction in Green Lake. Low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches average length). Low numbers of YOY walleye (< 15 YOY/hour) were captured in previous surveys since 1996 with the exception of 2011. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY walleye survey catch. The 2011 walleye year class was successful in many area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were abundant in 2014 (13.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 8.23 fish/gillnet. The 2014 rock bass average size was moderate (0.37 pounds and 7.37 inches) and similar to the historical average size of 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant in 2014 (1.42 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 0.76 fish/gillnet. The 2014 largemouth bass average size was small (0.55 pounds and 9.14 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.69 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were fair. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of white sucker (1.08 fish/gillnet), carp (0.00 fish/trapnet), pumpkinseed sunfish (0.53 fish/trapnet), hybrid sunfish (1.27 fish/trapnet) and black bullhead (0.17 fish/gillnet). Moderate numbers of large yellow bullhead were captured in 2014 (2.42 fish/gillnet, 0.98 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2015 for walleye natural reproduction, and summer of 2015 for all fish species by assessment nets.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large, deep, moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Greenis a popular walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and smallmouth bass fishery. Local anglersreported good fishing success for catching both smallmouth and walleye in 1999. Local anglersreported that walleye average sizes improved in 1999. Green had good walleye naturalreproduction during past years in the abundant rock and gravel shoal water areas. However,walleye natural reproduction has been poor since 1997 in Green. Green Lake was last stockedwith walleye fingerlings (43,827  right pelvic fin clipped fish, 2,027 lbs.) in 1994. GreenLake was stocked with 2,699,904 walleye fry in the 1996 spring which was a 10% return of thewalleye eggs taken from Green Lake for the 1996 state wide walleye hatching quotas.Experimental fishing regulations were enacted during 1997 in order to increase the qualityof size for northern pike and smallmouth bass in Green Lake. The smallmouth bass experimentalregulation allows for catch and release fishing only. The northern pike experimentalregulation prohibits the harvest of northern pike 24.0 inches or greater. The northern pikeexperimental regulation will be evaluated in 2008 at which time it will be maintained,modified, or removed depending on the effectiveness of the regulation and public support. Thesmallmouth bass regulation may be modified by 2001 pending comments from a public reviewmeeting in August of 2000 and the analysis of data collected from the 2000 summer fishsampling survey of Green Lake.      Walleye were abundant (15.58 fish/gillnet) and the average size (15.15 inches, gillnets)increased in 1999 compared to previous surveys (9.71 fish/gillnet and 14.51 inches historicalaverages). Four walleye year classes (18% for 1994, 18% for 1995, 36% for 1996, 21% for 1997)comprised most of the 1999 walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction was good to fair in1993 (46.00 YOY/hour), 1994 (52.70 YOY/hour), 1995 (22.00 YOY/hour) and 1996 (33.00YOY/hour). Poor walleye natural reproduction was documented by fall electrofishing in 1997(13.00 YOY/hour), 1998 (4.50 YOY/hour) and 1999 (11.54 YOY/hour). Although YOY walleyenumbers were low in 1997, these fish were moderately abundant as yearlings in the 1998 fallelectrofishing survey (22.50 yearlings/hour). Fingerling stocking in 1994 contributed to lessthan 3% of the total 1994 year class catch in previous Green Lake surveys and no stocked fishwere observed in the 1999 survey.     Northern pike were moderately abundant (4.00 fish/gillnet), but small (19.88 inches,2.10 lbs from the gillnets) in 1999 due the presence of large numbers of young fish (1998year class comprised 44% of total northern pike catch). The largest northern pike capturedin the 1999 survey was 34.25 inches.     Smallmouth bass were abundant in both the 1999 gillnets (9.00 fish/gillnet) and 1999spring electrofishing survey (35.00 fish/hour) compared to the historical averages (1.61fish/gillnet, 16.56 fish/hour). The 1999 smallmouth bass average weight was 1.36 lbs. fromthe gillnets. The 1999 smallmouth bass average length (12.47 inches, gillnets) was slightlybelow the Green historical average (13.06 inches). The largest smallmouth bass captured inthe 1999 survey was 17.91 inches. The 1996 year class comprised 36.1% of the 1999 smallmouthbass gillnet catch. Crayfish is an important forage species for smallmouth bass in Green.Crayfish numbers were abundant (61.0 crayfish/gillnet) in the 1999 gillnets.     Sunfish were moderately abundant (27.50 bluegill/trapnet, 16.21 hybrid sunfish/trapnet)within Green during 1999. The 1999 bluegill average length was small (4.46 inches and 0.08lbs from trapnets). The 1999 hybrid sunfish average size (0.21 lbs., 5.88 inches) in Greenwas greater than the bluegill average size. Rock bass were also moderately abundant in Greenduring 1999 (5.83 fish/gillnet, 0.57 lbs average weight).      Forage fish species such as yellow perch (33.42 fish/gillnet) and tullibee (2.50fish/gillnet) were moderately abundant within Green during 1999. The 1999 yellow perchaverage length (6.65 inches) from gillnets was similar to the historical average (6.58inches). The 1999 tullibee average weight from gillnets was 1.02 lbs. Tullibee provide animportant forage base for large northern pike in Green Lake.     The Green Lake fishery appears to be in good condition for walleye, northern pike,smallmouth bass numbers. In addition, there are abundant forage species (yellow perch,tullibee, crayfish) present in Green. Bluegill numbers rebounded in 1999 compared to 1998,but the average size was small. If walleye natural reproduction is poor again in 2000, thenwalleye fingerling stocking will take place in the fall of 2000. Local anglers have recentlyvoiced concern over the increasingly abundant smallmouth bass numbers in Green and thepossible affect on the walleye population. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue tomonitor Green Lake fish population numbers through annual summer netting surveys, spring basselectrofishing surveys and ice out northern pike trapping every two years, and annual YOYwalleye fall electrofishing surveys in order to evaluate the effectiveness of currentmanagement practices and experimental regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2006. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake. The dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the shoalwater areas are not suitable for aquatic vegetation establishment. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nExperimental regulations for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were enacted in Green Lake during 1997 as part of a statewide research study. In December of 2005, the DNR decided to end all experimental regulations on Green Lake (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and northern pike) and return to statewide regulations as of the May 13, 2006 opener for northern pike and May 27, 2006 opener for bass. This decision was based both on public input and the analyzed data collected from netting and creel surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high in 2006 (44.47/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but similar to the Green historical average catch rate (49.25 fish/trapnet). The 2006 bluegill average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 5.87 inches from the trapnets). The bluegill historical average length is 5.19 inches from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (21.97 fish/trapnet) in the 2006 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in 2006 (3.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and the highest recorded value for Green Lake (historical average catch rate=0.73 fish/gillnet). The 2006 black crappie average size was small (0.26 pounds and 7.14 inches from gillnets). The black crappie historical average length is 7.65 inches from gillnets in Green.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2006 (1.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average catch rate (2.86 fish/gillnet). The 2006 northern pike average size was large (5.05 pounds and 27.29 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average length is 22.71 inches from gillnets. The northern pike captured in 2003-2006 surveys were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2006. The 2004 and 2002 northern pike year classes comprised 30% and 26% respectively of the 2006 total northern pike assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were high in 2006 (2.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but similar to the Green historical average catch rate (2.01 fish/gillnet). The 2006 smallmouth bass average size was moderate (1.61 pounds and 12.28 inches from gillnets). The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.29 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2005 and 2000 smallmouth bass year classes comprised the majority of the total 2006 smallmouth bass assessment catch. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were caught in low numbers in 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). The crayfish historical average catch rate is 10.5 crayfish/gillnet for Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in the 2006 (0.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average summer catch rate (2.48 fish/gillnet). The 2006 summer tullibee average size was moderate (0.73 pounds and 11.31 inches from gillnets). The tullibee historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2006 (3.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average catch rate (17.71 fish/gillnet). The 2006 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.28 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. The 2003 and 2002 yellow perch year classes comprised the majority of the 2006 total yellow perch assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (9.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but similar to the Green historical average catch rate (9.03 fish/gillnet). The 2006 walleye average size was moderate (1.24 pounds and 13.89 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average length is 14.67 inches from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye in 2006 (3.00 fish/gillnet). The 2004 and 2000 year classes (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised the majority of the total 2006 walleye assessment catch.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey of Green Lake was conducted during early October of 2006. The 2006 fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2006 walleye fry stocking (2.06 million) in Green Lake. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (9.00 YOY/hour, 7.46 inches average length) captured in 2006. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 15.40 YOY/hour and 6.84 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 70.35 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were high in 2006 (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but similar to the Green historical average catch rate (7.24 fish/gillnet). The 2006 rock bass average size was moderate (0.40 pounds and 7.72 inches from gillnets). The rock bass historical average weight is 0.43 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were high in 2006 (4.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the Green historical average catch rate (0.42 fish/gillnet). The 2006 largemouth bass average size was small (0.48 pounds and 8.50 inches from gillnets). The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.64 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2007 spring ice out for northern pike, 2007 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2007 summer for all fish species by survey nets. A creel survey was conducted for the 2006-07 winter and scheduled for the 2007 summer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2009. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water levels were below normal during the summer, but normal by the late fall of 2009. Water clarity was good (12.0 feet) for Green Lake on July 23, 2009. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 4.0 ppm in depths down to 46 feet during late July of 2009. The shoreline is fully developed with the exception of the outlet area on the east side of the lake. The immediate watershed is varied with the City of Spicer, residential homes, wetlands, hardwood lots, and agricultural row crops. There are approximately 48 inlets (mostly small tiles) that drain into Green Lake. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (Nest Lake outlet) is the largest inlet that flows into Green Lake along the north shore at the Ye Olde Mill Inn Dam and exits along the east shore of Green Lake. Nutrient runoff is low to moderate primarily from nearby residential and city sources, and upstream sources from the Middle Fork of the Crow River via Nest Lake. Numerous storm water retention ponds were built during the 2003 State Highway 23 Four-Lane Project along the west side of Green Lake. There are six public access sites and one shore fishing site (outlet) on the lake. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n  <br> \nLow densities of Eurasian water milfoil had been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate various Eurasian water milfoil stands were overall unsuccessful in 2000, 2001, 2007, and 2008. Small widely scattered Eurasian milfoil stands were observed in off shore \"break\" areas at a mean depth of 8.6 feet during 2007. Most large stands of Eurasian milfoil on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling Eurasian milfoil in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoalwater areas.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2009 (27.87/trapnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 48.39 fish/trapnet. The 2009 bluegill average size was moderate to small (0.17 pounds and 5.81 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches and larger) bluegill (10.33 fish/trapnet) was moderate and similar to the historical average (11.58 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in 2009 (1.67 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The Green Lake black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.85 fish/gillnet. The 2009 black crappie average size was moderate to large (0.55 pounds and 9.09 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 7.97 inches from gillnets in Green. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches and larger) black crappie (1.08 fish/gillnet) was high and above the historical average (0.30 fish/gillnet). Black crappie growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised 37% of the 2009 black crappie assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2009 (1.42 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.72 fish/gillnet. The 2009 northern pike average size was moderate (3.50 pounds and 24.62 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight and length are 3.10 pounds and 23.21 inches from gillnets. Northern pike captured in 2003-2005, 2007 and 2009 assessments were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. The 2009 northern pike condition factor (0.577) was below the Green Lake normal range (0.605 -0.630). Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2009. The 2009 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) northern pike (0.42 fish/gillnet) was near the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). Spearing pressure and harvest of large northern pike was high during the 2006-07 winter following the return to statewide regulations. Northern pike growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4, but below the normal ranges for ages 5-8. Growth rates were also below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2008 year class comprised 22% of the 2009 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2009 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches, but abundant compared to similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.93 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2009 smallmouth bass average size was large (1.99 pounds and 15.11 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.57 pounds and 13.53 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2009 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches and larger) smallmouth bass (0.58 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (1.23 fish/gillnet). The 2005 year class comprised 36% of the 2009 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were generally below the both Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2009 smallmouth bass condition factor (1.418) was poor. YOY smallmouth bass numbers was low in 2009 shoreline seine hauls (0.90 fish/seine haul, 1.93 inches average length).  <br> \n <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured from 2007-2009. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2002-2004 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 8.4 crayfish/gillnet for Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in the 2009 summer (0.17 fish/gillnet)  compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.33 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. All of the tullibee were captured in one gillnet station located along the east portion of the lake at 30-40 feet deep. The 2009 summer tullibee average size was large (1.74 pounds and 15.00 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.56 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2009 (2.58 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 15.96 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2009 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.23 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. The 2009 yellow perch condition factor (Fulton K-Factor) was 1.102. Yellow perch condition factors have been near or below the Green normal range since 2003. Yellow perch growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2006 (56%) and 2005 (31%) yellow perch year classes comprised the majority of the 2009 yellow perch gillnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2009 (2.83 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 8.86 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2009 walleye average size was moderate (1.38 pounds and 15.03 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.68 inches from gillnets. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) walleye (1.50 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (3.75 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The walleye year classes of 2008 (12%), 2007 (21%), 2006 (35%), 2005 (9%), and 2004 (6%) comprised the majority of the 2009 gillnet catch. The recent walleye year classes since 2001 are due mostly to stocking. Walleye growth rates were within the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The condition factor for walleye greater than 12 inches (0.901) was at the lower end of the Green Lake normal range (0.901 -  0.938). <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted during early October of 2009. The 2009 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2009 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Approximately one million OTC marked walleye fry were stocked each year during 2007 and 2008. Marked OTC walleye fingerlings (30,787 fish) accounted for 60% of the fingerlings stocked (51,641 fish) in Green during the 2008 fall. Two million OTC marked walleye fry were stocked in Green during 2009. The walleye fry were stocked in part as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length) captured in 2009. Walleye yearling numbers were also low (3.00 fish/hour, 9.44 inches average length) in the 2009 fall electrofishing survey. Marked fish from 2008 and 2009 stockings accounted for 50% of YOY walleye catch and 0% of the yearling walleye catch in the 2009 fall electrofishing. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY walleye catch rate and length are 13.69 YOY/hour and 6.46 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings (74,082 fish, 3,081 pounds), yearlings (12 fish, 6 pounds), and fry (2,110,771 fish) were stocked into Green during early April-November of 2009. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry from 2000-2009 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 -  4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and fingerlings/yearlings/adults were stocked in 1994, 1992, 1990. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were moderate to abundant in 2009 (8.92 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.64 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2009 rock bass average size was small (0.30 pounds and 6.93 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant in 2009 (1.17 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.56 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2009 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.97 pounds and 11.10 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.67 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were within the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for age 1-7. The 2003 and 2006 largemouth bass year classes each comprised 20% of the 2009 largemouth bass assessment gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2010 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2010 summer for all fish species by assessment nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted during late July and early August of 2012. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Water levels were high to normal during the 2012 spring but 1-2 feet below normal by late summer due to drought conditions. Water clarity was moderate (10.5 feet) for Green Lake on July 30, 2012. Climate change effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas. This has favored warm water species (black crappie, bass, bluegill, rock bass) which are nest spawners that guard and fan the eggs, unlike broadcast spawners such walleye and tullibee. In addition, increased densities of submergent vegetation such as invasive Eurasian watermilfoil have provided added habitat/cover for warm water fish species. The 2012 summer weather was dry and hot with many days of high temperatures above 90 F during several weeks of July. Narrow bands (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<23.5 C) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) for tullibee were present at depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 23.5 C for tullibee on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. No summerkill events were reported or observed in Green or nearby Lake Koronis in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nA few local residents reported a minor summerkill of dead tullibee near shore areas of Green during 2011. We observed only a few dead tullibee during the 2011 population assessment. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred during the same time period on nearby Lake Koronis in 2011 with pelicans feeding greatly on the dead fish. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Green Lake was not opened for tullibee gillnetting in 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in 2012 and recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Green.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe threats of present (Eurasian watermilfoil, curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. zebra mussels, quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Both DNR and private attempts to chemically eradicate EWM permanently have been unsuccessful. Eurasian watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nEWM and curly-leaf pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previously chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal. Many large stands of EWM on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling EWM in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of EWM on the surface is unlikely to occur throughout Green Lake unlike some milfoil infested lakes with protected bay areas (i.e. Minnetonka) due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoal water areas of Green Lake. DNR Aquatic invasive species interns will continue to randomly monitor boats entering and leaving the many access sites in an attempt to educate and prevent the spread of exotics into Kandiyohi County Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2012 (34.00/trapnet) and within the normal ranges for similar lakes and Green. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 47.26 fish/trapnet. The 2012 bluegill average size was large (0.27 pounds and 6.82 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (27.93 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (13.29 fish/trapnet). The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill (4.57 fish/trapnet) was also high compared to the historical average (0.54 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2012 gillnets (3.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. Black crappie abundance in the 2012 trapnets (0.86 fish/trapnet) was near the upper normal range for Green Lake. The Green Lake black crappie historical average catch rates are 1.08 fish/gillnet and 0.70 fish/trapnet. The 2012 black crappie average sizes were moderate from gillnets (0.42 pounds and 8.22 inches, but larger from trapnets (0.55 pounds and 9.75 inches). The black crappie historical average lengths are 7.85 inches for gillnets and 7.76 inches for trapnets in Green. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie (0.71 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (0.35 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2012 (3.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green Lake, but near the low end of the normal range for similar lakes. The Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.74 fish/gillnet. The 2012 northern pike average size was moderate (3.33 pounds and 24.13 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight and length are 3.14 pounds and 23.31 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike (0.58 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). Northern pike captured in 2003-2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012 assessments were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. The 2012 northern pike condition factor (0.602) was below the Green Lake normal range (0.604-0.634). Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2012. Northern pike growth rates were generally below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-7. However, growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2009 year class comprised 52% of the 2012 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2012 (2.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green, but above the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.94 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2012 smallmouth bass average size was small (0.89 pounds and 11.09 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.55 pounds and 13.39 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass (0.50 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (1.19 fish/gillnet). The 2012 smallmouth bass condition factor (1.309 Fulton K-Factor) was below normal range (1.401-1.536) for Green. Smallmouth bass condition factors have been near or below the Green normal ranges since 2000 except for 2004 and 2011. Smallmouth bass growth rates were generally below both the Green Lake and Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, within the normal ranges for ages 5-6 and above the normal ranges for age 7. Three smallmouth bass year classes (2011, 2009 and 2008) each comprised approximately 30% of the 2012 smallmouth bass gillnet catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2007-2009 and 2012. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2011 (1.1 crayfish/gillnet), 2010 (0.3 crayfish/gillnet), 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2002-2004 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 7.1 crayfish/gillnet for Green.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" abundance in the 2012 summer (0.25 fish/gillnet) was below the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.31 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A majority of the tullibee were captured in summer gillnet stations located along the east and south portions of the lake at depths between 25-30 feet. The 2012 summer tullibee average size was moderate to large (0.94 pounds and 12.83 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical summer average weight is 0.60 pounds from gillnets. All tullibee captured in the 2012 summer gillnets were from the 2009 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nThere were low numbers of tullibee (8.33 fish/gillnet) captured in the 2012 fall special assessment. The 2012 fall tullibee average size was moderate to large (1.06 pounds and 13.61 inches) for Green. Tullibee growth rates were within or above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1 7. The 2008 year class comprised 76% of the 2012 fall tullibee catch in Green Lake. There were no tullibee from 2009-2011 year classes present in the 2012 fall catch. Low numbers of tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis (5.33 fish/gillnet, 14.91 inches average length) in the 2012 fall. The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 76.5 fish/gillnet and 12.52 inches for Green Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of 2010-2012 as sampled by both DNR and private netters during the open season is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in good hatches and survival of tullibee in Green Lake if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2012 (0.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 14.38 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2012 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 6.25 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was 0.00 fish/gillnet. The 2012 yellow perch condition factor (0.858 Fulton K-Factor) was below the normal range (1.081-1.246) for Green. Yellow perch condition factors have been near or below the Green normal ranges since 2003 except for 2004 and 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2012 (10.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green Lake and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.19 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2012 walleye average size was moderate (1.19 pounds and 14.18 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.64 inches from gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (3.42 fish/gillnet) was near the historical average (3.86 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches) and larger walleye (1.17 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historical average (0.76 fish/gillnet). The 2012 walleye condition factor (0.857 Fulton K-Factor) was below the normal range (0.873-0.907) for Green. Walleye growth rates were generally below both the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 6-8. Recent walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2010 and 2009 walleye year classes comprised about 29% and 20% respectively of the 2012 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. The 2011 and 2008 year classes each comprised 16% of the 2012 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. OTC marked walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 86% of the 2011, 9% of the 2010, and 33% of the 2009 year classes captured in the 2012 gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2012 except for 2002. OTC marked walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001 and 2007-2012. The walleye fry were stocked in part as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Marked OTC walleye fingerlings (30,787 fish) accounted for 60% of the fingerlings stocked (51,641 fish) in Green during the 2008 fall. Walleye unmarked fingerlings (59,672 fish, 3,081 pounds) and OTC marked fry (1,827,749 fish) were last stocked into Green during 2012. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and larger walleye (fingerlings and adults) were stocked in 1994, 1992 and 1990. <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted on October 3, 2012. The 2012 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2012 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Low numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in 2012 fall electrofishing survey (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches average length). OTC marked fish (2012 fry stocked year class) comprised 55% of the 2012 YOY walleye catch in the 2012 walleye fall electrofishing survey. Moderate numbers of YOY walleye were captured in the previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall survey catch. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 81.31 YOY/hour. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY walleye catch rate and length are 14.33 YOY/hour and 6.75 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Yearling walleye numbers (10.91 fish/hour, 9.79 inches) in the 2012 fall survey were comparable to the Green historical average (11.83 fish/hour, 9.64 inches average size). OTC Marked fish (2011 fry stocked year class) comprised approximately 80% of the yearling walleye captured in the 2012 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were abundant in 2012 (10.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.93 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2012 rock bass average size was small (0.32 pounds and 6.97 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant in 2012 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.73 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2012 largemouth bass average size was small (0.60 pounds and 9.15 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.68 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates were generally below both the Green Lake and Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-5.  The 2011 and 2008 largemouth year classes comprised 42% and 25% respectively of the 2012 largemouth bass gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted from July 20-23, 2012 on Green Lake to compare small fish species presence versus lake characteristics (i.e. water quality, size, depth, productivity, etc.). Seine hauls were conducted with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Near shore electrofishing was conducted with a back-pack unit in water depths less than 2 feet deep. There are 20 stations that were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats and each station was approximately 100 feet long, but only 19 stations were sampled with both seining and electrofishing gears due to water levels, emergent vegetation, or unsuitable substrates for walking. Approximately 22 different fish species (19 species from electrofishing, 19 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. smallmouth bass and largemouth bass), panfish (bluegill, yellow perch, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish), large non-gamefish (yellow bullhead) and small non-gamefish (Iowa darter, johnny darter, banded killifish, longnose dace, tadpole madtom, pugnose shiner, golden shiner, spottail shiner, blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, brook silverside, brook stickleback and logperch). Young of year species captured included largemouth and smallmouth bass in seine hauls. Green Lake has greater numbers of fish species present than most other Spicer Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2013 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2013 summer for all fish species by assessment nets. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Green Lake was conducted during mid-late November of 2015 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and possibly spring electrofishing for bass). <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), and deep (110 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Tullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Green during the 1880's. Koronis is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Green and Koronis during recent years have been covered by periphyton/algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Green Lake if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. The last reported summerkill on Green prior to 2011 was a minor event during 1995. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present at depths where preferred adult Tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 74 F on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2015. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were moderate in a 2014 special assessment (mid-August) using vertical gillnets (51.0 fish/gang, 153 Tullibee total). There were five gillnets set per gang at three different deep water sites from the surface to bottom. Fish ranged in size from 3.2 to 16.5 inches from the seven different mesh sized panels of vertical gillnets. Young of year Tullibee (2014 year class) and age 6+ year classes comprised the majority of the 2014 vertical gillnet catch. Unlike vertical gillnets, standard summer lake survey gillnets are comprised of five different mesh sizes per net, 250 feet long and set in water depths with adequate oxygen levels (usually 10-40 feet deep) encompassing 6 feet of depth up from the bottom. Fall gillnet assessments utilize standard summer gillnets, but are set along shallow (< 6 feet) boulder bars during mid/late November when water temperatures are below 41 F. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee abundance in the 2015 summer standard gillnets (0.9 fish/gillnet) was near the 50th quartile for Green Lake (25th=0.3, 50th=0.8, 75th=2.6 fish/gillnet) and above the 25th quartile (0.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 22 lakes. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.1 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2015 Tullibee average size was small (0.79 pounds and 10.7 inches). The Tullibee historical average weight is 0.61 pounds from summer gillnets. Approximately 73% of Tullibee captured were from the 2012 year class in the summer gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low (10.3 fish/gillnet, 13.7 inches) in the 2015 fall assessment. Tullibee abundance was similar (8.3 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) in the 2012 fall special assessment. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis (19.7 fish fish/gillnet, 14.2 inches) in the 2015 fall. The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 76.5 fish/gillnet and 12.5 inches for Green Lake. The 2015 fall Tullibee condition factor (1.136) was at the 75th quartile for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were near the Green Lake 25th quartiles for ages 1-3, near the 50th quartile for age 4, and above the 75th quartiles for ages 4 and 5-7. The 2008 and 2009 year classes comprised 55% combined of the 2015 fall Tullibee catch in Green Lake. The 2012 and 2013 year classes comprised 26% and 13% respectively of the 2015 fall Tullibee catch. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and adequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Green. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Green is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall gillnetting season will probably be postponed until the adult population rebounds to adequate levels. Current fish management activities on Green include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2016 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Green Lake was conducted during early August of 2017. A targeted fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 27, 2017 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. Targeted fall gillnetting surveys were conducted for Walleye during late September of 2017 and Tullibee during mid to late November of 2017. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A creel survey was last conducted on Green Lake during 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters into the Middle Fork Crow River. Water clarity was excellent (18.0 feet) for Green Lake on July 31, 2017. There were adequate dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) and temperature conditions (<74 F) for Tullibee survival at depths of 27-36 feet during the 2017 survey and 40-60 feet during the 2016 survey. Submergent vegetation densities appeared lower in Green and other Spicer Area lakes during the 2017 summer. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble and boulder. The 2017 summer weather was moderate to cooler compared to previous summers. Recent ice on dates were December 12, 2017, December 10, 2016 and December 27, 2015. Snow and mild temperatures resulted in poor conditions (<6 inches of ice), thus limiting access on Green and many other local lakes during December of 2016. Similar poor ice conditions occurred during early to mid-December of 2017. Several vehicles went through the ice adjacent to ice heaves near the Spicer public access during January of 2018. Recent ice off dates were March 21, 2017 and March 22, 2016 which were the second and third earliest occurrences for Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nClimate change and invasive species effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". Increased densities of submergent vegetation such as invasive Eurasian Watermilfoil have provided added habitat/cover for many fish species. The most frequently observed submergent and algal vegetation species or groups for Green have included Chara, Stonewort, Eurasian Watermilfoil, River Pondweed, Water Moss, Clasping-leaf Pondweed, Sago Pondweed and Curly-leaf Pondweed.  <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Both DNR and private attempts to chemically eradicate it have been unsuccessful. Private applicators are currently using agricultural based global positioning techniques to better target a specific granular herbicide to known Eurasian Watermilfoil stands. Unfortunately, Eurasian Watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previous chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling it in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of Eurasian Watermilfoil on the surface is unlikely to occur throughout Green Lake unlike some Eurasian Watermilfoil infested lakes with protected shallow bay areas (i.e. Minnetonka) due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels, and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoal water areas of Green Lake. The frequency of occurrence of Eurasian Watermilfoil in transects had increased from 4 sites in 2003, 16 sites in 2007, 20 sites in 2008 and 28 sites in 2013. Mean abundance at transect sites has increased in a similar trend from 2003 (1.3%) to 2013 (12.0%). <br> \n  <br> \nThe threats of present (Zebra Mussels, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. Starry Stonewort, Quagga Mussels, Spiny Water Flea, Faucet Snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. One adult Zebra Mussel was found on a dock along the southeast shore of Green during the early summer of 2014. No additional Zebra Mussels were found until the fall of 2014. Numerous small young Zebra Mussels were found attached on docks and boat lifts scattered throughout Green Lake in 2015. Zebra Mussels were abundant within Green Lake during 2017, especially small mussels attached to aquatic vegetation (chara). Water clarity greatly increased during 2017 in response to the high densities of Zebra Mussel. The secchi reading was 18 feet on July 31, 2017.  Eradication techniques (e.g. potassium chloride \"potash\", zequanox, copper sulfate, etc.) have been recently tried in metro area lakes where Zebra Mussel populations have not spread throughout the lake. Zequanox is a combination of specific dead bacteria cells which are toxic to Zebra Mussels. Eradication of Zebra Mussels is improbable once mussels spread throughout a lake due to their ability to reproduce large numbers of young Zebra Mussel \"veligers\" by a small number of adults. Green Lake will continue to be monitored to document the impacts Zebra Mussels may have on the lake ecology (i.e. water clarity, substrate effects, aquatic vegetation, plankton abundance, native species responses, etc.). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2017 trapnets (0.87 fish/trapnet), but the average size was moderate (0.44 pounds, 9.04 inches). There were moderately abundant numbers of small sized (0.23 pounds and 6.66 inches) Black Crappie caught in the 2017 gillnets (2.50 fish/gillnet). Most of these small fish in gillnets were from the 2016 year class. The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 1.30 fish/gillnet and 0.77 fish/trapnet. Growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2016 year class comprised 38% of the 2017 Black Crappie summer gillnet and trapnet survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2017 (21.53 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Green Lake Bluegill historical average catch rate is 44.65 fish/trapnet. The 2017 Bluegill average size was large (0.26 pounds and 6.72 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of 8.00 inches and larger Bluegill (3.19 fish/trapnet) in the 2017 trapnets. The 2017 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches and larger) Bluegill growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2011 year class comprised 30% of the 2017 Bluegill summer gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance in 2017 (2.50 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles for Green (25th=0.06, 50th=0.41, 75th=1.10 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 22 lakes (75th=1.20 fish/gillnet). The Largemouth Bass historical average catch rate is 0.84 fish/gillnet. The 2017 Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 0.95 pounds and 11.34 inches from gillnets. The Largemouth Bass historical average weight is 0.70 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth Bass growth rates were near the Green Lake 75th quartiles for ages 1-7, but near or below the Spicer Area 50th quartiles. The 2013 and 2014 year classes each comprised 24% of the 2017 Largemouth Bass summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2017 (4.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green Lake historical average catch rate (2.75 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.94 pounds and 24.96 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight and length are 3.19 pounds and 23.49 inches from gillnets. The 2017 catch rate of 28.00 inches and larger Northern Pike (1.33 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (0.46 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance or poor condition compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Smaller sized Northern Pike (<24.00 inches) were in poor condition, but not larger fish (>24.00 inches) in 2017. Low numbers of forage fish (Yellow Perch and Tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2016. Growth rates were below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2014 year class comprised 30% of the 2017 Northern Pike summer catch. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass abundance in 2017 (13.08 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles (25th=5.75, 50th=8.65, 75th=11.90 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake and Lake Class 22 lakes (75th=6.63 fish/gillnet). The Rock Bass historical average catch rate is 8.73 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2017 Rock Bass average weight and length were 0.48 pounds and 8.20 inches from gillnets. The Rock Bass historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were moderately abundant in 2017 (1.83 fish/gillnet). The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 1.83 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2017 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (1.70 pounds and 13.66 inches) from gillnets. Growth rates were generally within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2010 and 2011 year classes each comprised 23% and 18% respectively of the 2017 Smallmouth Bass summer gillnet catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nCrayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2017 (0.17 crayfish/gillnet), 2015 (0.08 crayfish/gillnet), 2014 (0.08 crayfish/gillnet), 2011 (1.1 crayfish/gillnet), 2010 (0.3 crayfish/gillnet), 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-13 and 2016 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 5.5 crayfish/gillnet for Green. Research has identified crayfish and Pumpkinseed as predators on smaller Zebra Mussels. We did observe numerous small crayfish in the stomachs of Smallmouth Bass. Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to a new forage species \"Zebra Mussel\" present in Green. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the 2017 summer gillnet catch. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.06 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A targeted September gillnetting survey was conducted primarily to assess the Walleye population. There were 12 gillnets set at standard summer stations during September of 2017. In addition, 2 special gillnets were also set in deeper water (40-50 feet deep), adjacent to standard sets near Hultgren's and Gratz's Bars. Tullibee (5.50 fish/special gillnet, 11.43 inches) were only captured at these two sites during the September targeted gillnetting survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) in the 2017 November survey. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) fall surveys. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis (19.67 fish fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) in the 2015 fall, but low numbers in 2017 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.41 inches). The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 70.30 fish/gillnet and 12.48 inches for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1 5. The 2012 year class comprised 45% and 100% respectively of the 2017 September and November Tullibee survey catches. There were adequate dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) and temperature conditions (<74 F) for Tullibee survival at depths of 27-36 feet during the 2017 survey and 40-60 feet during the 2016 survey. Green Lake has not been opened for Tullibee public gillnetting since 2011 due to the low Tullibee numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish, especially for larger Northern Pike and Walleye in Green. Tullibee can also provide a secondary fishing opportunity during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2017 (0.42 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 12.34 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. Yellow Perch catch rates have been <10.00 fish/gillnet since 2003. Local anglers have reported in past years seeing numerous small Yellow Perch amongst the chara beds with cameras during the summer or while spearing in the winter. Our standard gillnets may not effectively sample these small (<5.0 inches) Yellow Perch. Predation pressures from various species (i.e. Rock Bass, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, etc.) may have also selected for smaller sized and earlier reproducing Yellow Perch restricted to near bottom habitat containing dense chara beds in Green. The 2017 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.09 pounds and 6.23 inches) from gillnets. The 2014 year class comprised 80% of the 2017 Yellow Perch summer survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013 and 2016. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 or 2015 due to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were mostly part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Walleye unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings (18,413 fish, 1,784 pounds) were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall. Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and yearlings (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye were captured during the 2017, 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2014 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches average length) and 2013 (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. \"OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% (6.60 YOY/hour) of the 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY Walleye catch rate and length are 11.83 YOY/hour and 6.77 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Yearling Walleye numbers were moderate to low in the 2014 (6.00 fish/hour) and 2016 (3.00 fish/hour) fall surveys. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2017 and 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2017 summer gillnets (4.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green historical average catch rate (8.68 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Walleye average size was moderate (1.40 pounds and 15.65 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight and length are 1.27 pounds and 14.70 inches from gillnets. The 2017 catch rate of 15.00 inches and larger Walleye (2.33 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (3.68 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 3-8. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2017 walleye survey catch was comprised primarily of 2011 (15%), 2012 (11%), 2013 (15%), 2014 (20%), 2015 (25%) and 2016 (8%) year classes. The 2011 Walleye year class was successful in many area lakes. OTC marked Walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 43%, 22%, 17% and 100% respectively of the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016 year classes caught in the 2017 Walleye combined summer and fall survey catches. YOY Walleye catch rates from 5-30 fish per hour due to fry stockings or natural reproduction may be adequate for providing a moderate year class in larger or clearer lakes. However, future Walleye fry stockings and natural reproduction may be less successful in Green due to poor survival from potential negative effects on zooplankton populations by Zebra Mussels. Continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of White Sucker (0.25 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.80 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed (0.33 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (2.27 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (0.08 fish/gillnet) during 2017. Moderate numbers of large Yellow Bullhead were also captured in 2017 (2.67 fish/gillnet, 0.96 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2018 for YOY Walleye abundance, and the summer of 2018 for all fish species by standard survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Green Lake was conducted during late July to early August of 2019. A targeted fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 7, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. Targeted fall gillnetting surveys were conducted for Yellow Perch (mid-September) and Walleye (late September) in 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets, and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during 2019 summer and scheduled for 2019-2020 winter.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. The 2019 summer was cooler with more rainfall than normal. The secchi reading was 9.7 feet on July 30, 2019. Water levels were above normal during 2019. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters into the Middle Fork Crow River. There were adequate dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) and temperature conditions (<74 F) for Tullibee survival at depths of 20-30 feet during 2019, 20-35 feet during the 2018 survey, 27-36 feet during the 2017 survey, and 40-60 feet during the 2016 survey. Submergent vegetation appeared less dense in 2019 than previous survey years. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, gravel, rubble and boulder. Recent ice on dates were December 2, 2019; November 27, 2018; December 12, 2017; December 10, 2016; and December 27, 2015. Recent ice off dates were April 23, 2019; May 7, 2018; March 21, 2017; and March 22, 2016 for Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (Zebra Mussels, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. Starry Stonewort, Quagga Mussels, Spiny Water Flea, Faucet Snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Climate change and invasive species effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (filamentous algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas due to warmer waters and increased near shore nutrient deposition. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". Furthermore, increased densities of submergent vegetation species such as invasive Eurasian watermilfoil since 2000 have provided added habitat/cover for many warm water fish species. Eurasian watermilfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" (10-15 feet deep) areas since 2000. It was more prevalent in water depths greater than 10 feet and less frequent in shallower water during 2018 and 2019. Zebra Mussels have decreased free open water green algal abundance resulting in lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from open water to bottom habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased fish condition factors and also increased water clarity since 2014. Several other area lakes (Andrew, Diamond, Eagle, Elkhorn, George, Nest, Norway and Games) were recently reported as infested with Zebra Mussels in 2017-2018.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2019 gillnets (2.08 fish/gillnet and 1.73 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates are 1.32 fish/gillnet and 0.80 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Black Crappie average sizes were large from gillnets (0.56 pounds and 9.75 inches), but moderate from trapnets (0.41 pounds and 8.99 inches). In recent years, Black Crappie have been targeted more frequently by both summer and winter anglers based on anecdotal and creel survey reports. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2019 (30.20 fish/trapnet). The Green Lake Bluegill historical average catch rate is 43.09 fish/trapnet. The 2019 Bluegill average size was small (0.12 pounds and 5.17 inches) from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 9.37 inches in the 2019 summer survey. Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2015 year class comprised 29% of the 2019 Bluegill summer gillnet and trapnet catch. Bluegill ages 6 and older comprised 16% of the 2019 Bluegill summer catch. Anglers often target Eurasian watermilfoil stands when fishing for Bluegill in Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2019 (1.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (0.88 fish/gillnet). The 2019 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (0.92 pounds and 11.51 inches) from gillnets. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slow for ages 1-7. The 2016 year class comprised 32% of the 2019 Largemouth Bass summer survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2019 (5.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate is 2.84 fish/gillnet. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was small (2.44 pounds and 21.33 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight and length are 3.16 pounds and 23.37 inches from gillnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 40.55 inches from the 2019 summer survey. Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (Yellow Perch and Tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2019. Northern Pike growth rates were slow for ages 1-5. The 2016 year class comprised 26% of the 2019 Northern Pike summer catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were abundant in 2019 (19.25 fish/gillnet) and the highest recorded catch for Green. The Rock Bass historical average catch rate is 9.15 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. Rock Bass catch rates were rarely greater than 10.00 fish/gillnet prior to 2001. The 2019 Rock Bass average size was large (0.57 pounds and 8.69 inches) from gillnets. The Rock Bass historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were low in 2019 (1.08 fish/gillnet). The Smallmouth Bass historical average catch rate is 1.77 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2019 Smallmouth Bass average size was large (1.45 pounds and 12.20 inches) from gillnets. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges. There were no dominant Smallmouth Bass year classes in the summer gillnet catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nLarge sized Crayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999. Moderate numbers of crayfish were captured in both 2019 summer and fall gillnet surveys (2.17 crayfish/gillnet). Low numbers (<1.00 crayfish/gillnet) or no crayfish were captured from 2002-2018 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 5.20 crayfish/gillnet for Green. Research has identified crayfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish as predators on smaller Zebra Mussels. We did observe numerous small sized crayfish in the stomachs of Smallmouth Bass and Rock Bass. Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to a new forage species \"Zebra Mussel\" present in Green. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the 2017-2019 summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.88 fish/gillnet for Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA November targeted gillnet survey was conducted for Tullibee in 2019. Tullibee numbers were low in 2019 November survey (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.92 inches). Tullibee numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) in the previous 2017 November targeted survey. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) fall surveys. The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 67.43 fish/gillnet and 12.56 inches for Green Lake.  Tullibee growth rates were slow for ages 1 5. The 2014 year class comprised 57% of the 2019 November Tullibee survey catch. Green Lake has not been opened for Tullibee public gillnetting since 2011 due to the low Tullibee numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish, especially for larger Northern Pike and Walleye in Green. Tullibee can also provide a secondary fishing opportunity during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (2.25 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.73 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.48 inches) from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were slow for ages 1-4. The 2015 year class comprised 64% of the 2019 Yellow Perch summer survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nLocal anglers have reported in past years seeing numerous small Yellow Perch amongst the Chara \"Muskgrass\" beds with cameras during the summer or while spearing in the winter. Our standard gillnets may not effectively sample these small (<5.0 inches) Yellow Perch. Predation pressures from various species (i.e. Rock Bass, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, etc.) may have also selected for smaller sized and earlier reproducing Yellow Perch restricted to near bottom habitat containing dense Chara beds in Green. A statewide study will examining Yellow Perch catchability, growth and maturity using small mesh gillnets in Green and other lakes in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013 and 2016-2018. Fry were marked with OTC to document the contribution to the Walleye population versus natural reproduction or fingerling stockings in later surveys. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2019, 2014 or 2015 due in part to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were mostly part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adult (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2019 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.24 inches), 2018 (1.00 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches), 2014 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches), 2013 (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches) and 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No YOY Walleye were captured during the 2017, 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% (6.60 YOY/hour) of the 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY Walleye catch rate and length are 11.14 YOY/hour and 6.81 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2019 summer gillnets (5.17 fish/gillnet), but higher than the 2017 (4.25 fish/gillnet) and 2018 (3.25 fish/gillnet) summer survey numbers. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 8.42 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.56 pounds and 15.57 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight and length are 1.29 pounds and 14.82 inches from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were slow compared to Spicer Area Lakes, but above the normal ranges for Green Lake. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2019 walleye summer survey catch was comprised of a variety of year classes with 68% of the fish coming from 2015-2018 year classes. OTC marked Walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 78% respectively of the 2018 year class caught in the 2019 Walleye summer and fall survey catches. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) made up 36% of the total Walleye catch from marked year classes in the 2019 fall and summer gillnets combined. Population estimates were made from the 2017 fall stocking of 3,936 yearling fin clipped Walleye and the 2018 and 2019 summer and fall survey combined catches. We estimated a 2018 fall Walleye population of 15,390 age 2 fish. A 2019 fall Walleye population was estimated at 8,311 age 3 fish. YOY Walleye catch rates from 5-30 fish per hour due to fry stockings or natural reproduction may be adequate for providing a moderate year class in larger or clearer lakes. However, Zebra Mussels may negatively affect future Walleye fry stockings and natural reproduction by reducing zooplankton food availability, thus causing poor Walleye first year survival. Continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of White Sucker (0.33 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.40 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed (0.40 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (2.53 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (0.25 fish/gillnet) during 2019. Abundant numbers of large Yellow Bullhead were also captured in 2019 (6.42 fish/gillnet, 0.70 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2020 for YOY Walleye abundance, 2022 fall for Tullibee and the summer of 2020 for all fish species by standard survey nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Green Lake was conducted during mid-late November of 2019 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), and deep (110 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. A standard survey (summer gillnets and trapnets) of Green Lake was also conducted during late July through early August of 2019.  A targeted fall gillnetting and boom electrofishing survey were conducted for small sized Yellow Perch in mid-September of 2019. A targeted  gillnetting survey was conducted for Walleye during late September of 2019. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 7, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Green during the 1880's. Koronis is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Green and Koronis during recent years have been covered by periphyton/filamentous algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Increased phosphorus inputs or availability often result in greater blue-green and filamentous algae blooms. Climate changes (e.g. warmer temperatures, additional growing days, increased storm/runoff activity, etc.) coupled with continued nutrient inputs and Zebra Mussel impacts may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction and recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (e.g. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Green Lake if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. The last reported summerkill on Green prior to 2011 was a minor event during 1995. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present at depths where preferred adult Tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis' islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 74 F on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2019.  <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels were first observed in Green Lake in 2014. Presently, Zebra Mussels are abundant within the lake. It is unknown the extent Zebra Mussels will affect Tullibee and the corresponding forage base. Green was the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year from the late 1980's to 2011. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy Northern Pike in Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the 2017-2019 summer standard survey catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.88 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A targeted September gillnetting survey was conducted primarily to assess the Walleye population. There were 12 gillnets set at standard summer stations during September of 2017-2019. In addition, 2 special gillnets were also set in deeper water (40-50 feet deep), adjacent to standard sets near Hultgren's and Gratz's Bars during 2017. Tullibee (5.50 fish/special gillnet, 11.43 inches) were only captured at these two sites during the 2017 September gillnetting survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low in 2019 (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.94 inches) and 2017 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) November surveys. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) November surveys. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis in 2019 (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.75 inches) and 2015 (19.67 fish fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches), but low numbers in 2017 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.41 inches). The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 67.43 fish/gillnet and 12.56 inches for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were slow in the November survey gillnet catches. The 2014 year class comprised 57% of the 2019 November Tullibee survey catch. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and inadequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Green. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Green is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall gillnetting season will probably be postponed until the adult population rebounds to adequate levels. Current fish management activities on Green include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2020 summer for all fish species. Tullibee will be sampled by November gillnetting in 2022 for both Green and Koronis. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey in Green Lake was conducted during early September of 2021 using lake survey gillnets and trapnets. Standard surveys were done during the last week of July or first week of August prior to 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Targeted surveys were conducted to determine if September gillnetting would more effectively sample the Walleye population than the standard July-August surveys in Green Lake during 2017-2020. Current and past September gillnetting surveys occurred during or after the fall turnover. We set 12 gillnets at standard summer stations during early September of 2021. Green Lake was partially mixed from surface to 55 feet deep with water temperatures near 70 F; dissolved oxygen was 8.3 ppm near the surface, 4.8 ppm at 55 feet deep and 0.4 ppm near the bottom. The secchi reading was 13.0 feet during the early September survey. Fine meshed gillnetting (4 sets) was conducted during late September for estimating sex/maturity of Yellow Perch as part of a University of Minnesota study. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 18, 2021 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during the 2019 summer and 2019-2020 winter. <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil (2000) and Zebra Mussels (2014). Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Water levels were low during 2020 and 2021. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters the Middle Fork Crow River. Submergent vegetation appeared less dense in 2021 than previous survey years. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Zebra mussels were abundant on shoalwater substrates such rubble and boulder throughout the littoral areas. Zebra Mussels have decreased free open water green algal abundance which as caused lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from open water to bottom habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased some fish species condition factors, and increased water clarity since 2014. Several other area lakes (Andrew, Diamond, Eagle, Elkhorn, George, Nest, Norway, and Games) were recently reported as infested with Zebra Mussels in 2017-2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gillnet catch rate (0.33 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (1.28 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. Black Crappie trapnet catch rate was 1.20 fish/trapnet in the 2021 fall survey. The 2021 Black Crappie average sizes were moderate for fall gillnets (0.50 pounds and 8.61 inches), but large for fall trapnets (0.88 pounds and 11.43 inches). The 2021 Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.00 plus inches) was moderate (1.13 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates near the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2016 year class comprised 68% of the 2021 Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trapnet catch rate (38.67 fish/trapnet) was near the historical average (42.67 fish/trapnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. Bluegill trapnet average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.80 inches). The largest Bluegill captured was 9.76 inches. The 2021 Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.00 plus inches) was low (0.53 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were less or near the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4, near the 50th quartiles for age 5 and near the 75th quartiles for ages 6-8. The 2018 year class comprised 88% of the 2021 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gillnet catch rate (1.93 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (0.44 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Largemouth Bass gillnet average size was large (1.44 pounds and 13.09 inches). The 2015 year class comprised 43% of the 2021 Largemouth Bass gillnet catch. Abundant numbers of small sized Largemouth Bass (1.93 fish/trapnet, 7.13 inches average) were captured in the 2021 fall trapnets. Two-year-old fish or younger comprised 89% of the Largemouth Bass trapnet catch. Largemouth Bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but below the normal ranges for ages 7-8. Growth rates were generally above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-6 and within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gillnet catch rate (2.75 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (2.87 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Northern Pike average size was small (1.92 pounds and 20.56 inches). The 2021 Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.00 plus inches) was naught (0.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.44 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2017 year class comprised 36% of the Northern Pike gillnet catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass gillnet catch rate (7.83 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (9.18 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Rock Bass gillnet average size was large (0.55 pounds and 8.53 inches). <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet catch rate (1.25 fish/gillnet) was lower than the historical average (1.75 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Smallmouth Bass gillnet average size (0.67 pounds and 10.14 inches) was small. The 2021 Smallmouth Bass fall catch rate of preferred size (14.00 plus inches) was low (0.09 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (1.03 fish/gillnet). A minor summerkill of adult Smallmouth Bass was noted in Green due to a viral outbreak during July/August of 2021. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were less or near than the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5, within the normal ranges for ages 6-7 and above the normal range for age 8. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Crayfish (important prey species for Smallmouth Bass) numbers were high during the 2021 fall survey (16.58 crayfish/gillnet) compared to previous surveys from 2002-2020 (<3.00 crayfish/gillnet). Zebra Mussels are an important forage prey for Northern Crayfish. Zebra Mussels may cause a shift to greater numbers of benthic species such as Northern Crayfish and Yellow Perch which would be beneficial to Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n  <br> \nTullibee gillnet catch rate was low (0.17 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. Tullibee were absent in the 2020 September or summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.78 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2021 Tullibee average size was small (0.11 pounds and 7.13 inches). Tullibee growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gillnet catch rate was low (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (11.19 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.14 pounds and 6.64 inches) in the early September survey. The 2021 fall catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches and larger) Yellow Perch was also low (0.25 fish/gillnet). Yellow Perch growth rates were generally less than the Spicer Area normal ranges. Growth rates were generally below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2018 year class comprised 73% of the total fall standard survey catch. Female mature Yellow Perch comprised 100% of the total fall standard survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant Yellow Perch numbers (121.00/gillnet, 4.82 inches average length) were captured in the late September fine meshed gillnet survey. Approximately 86% of the Yellow Perch captured were less than 4.50 inches in this late September survey. Fall electrofishing also sampled moderate numbers of small Yellow Perch. Female mature fish comprised 71.6% of the Yellow Perch total catch (fine mesh gillnets and fall electrofishing) with an average length of 4.69 inches. <br> \n <br> \nVarious combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults were stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Pike River was the primary Walleye fingerling strain that was available and stocked into Green from 2000-2014. Spicer Area Walleye fingerling rearing ponds have been stocked with primarily the Spicer strain since 2015. Both Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped (right ventral) age 3+ adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and ages 1+ fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Fin clipped (left ventral) Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adults (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). Green was stocked with 2,500 Spicer strain fin clipped (right ventral) Walleye (1,050 pounds) after the 2021 fall standard survey. Adults and yearlings comprised 1,844 fish (911 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. Fingerlings comprised 656 fish (139 pounds) of the 2021 stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung of Year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were moderate (10.50 YOY/hour, 7.39 inches) in 2021. YOY Walleye were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (<5.00 YOY/hour) were captured in 2013-2019 fall electrofishing surveys. Although, fall electrofishing survey techniques may be less effective for sampling YOY Walleye in large multi contoured lakes with high water clarity. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) and 2011 (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% of the 2012 fall electrofishing survey catches. OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gillnet catch rate (6.67 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the historical average (8.25 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Walleye average size was moderate (1.56 pounds and 16.15 inches). The 2021 catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) Walleye (3.25 fish/gillnet) was similar to the historical average (3.54 fish/gillnet). The 2021 fall catch rate of preferred size (20.00 plus inches) Walleye was low (0.42 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4, but within the normal ranges for ages 5-8. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, but below the normal ranges for ages 3-8. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2021 Walleye fall standard survey catch was comprised of 2007 (1%), 2011 (3%), 2012 (1%), 2013 (5%), 2014 (2%), 2015 (8%), 2016 (12%) and 2017 (7%), 2018 (17%) and 2019 (38%) year classes. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 100%, 0%, 50%, 28.6% and 38.5% respectively of the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2018 year classes caught in the 2021 Walleye fall standard survey catches. OTC marked fish (fry stocked) made up 15.5% of the total Walleye catch from marked year classes in the 2021 fall standard survey gillnets. Walleye yearlings and adults were marked by a fin clip (right ventral) when stocked into Green during 2017 and 2020. Approximately 29.7% of combined Walleye Ages 2-5 were fin clipped fish in the 2021 Walleye fall standard survey catch. Fin clipped fish comprised 42% and 25% respectively of the 2019 and 2016 year classes in the 2021 Walleye fall standard survey catch. Zebra Mussels may negatively affect future Walleye fry stockings and natural reproduction by reducing zooplankton food availability, thus causing poor Walleye first year survival. However, if benthic forage species such as Yellow Perch begin to rebound then yearling/adult Walleye recruitment and growth may also respond positively. Continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. The new Walleye bag limit was reduced from six to three fish on Green Lake in 2021. Only 1 Walleye over 20 inches is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2021 fall standard survey included low numbers of White Sucker (0.67 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.20 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (0.08 fish/gillnet). Abundant numbers of large Yellow Bullhead (6.08 fish/gillnet, 0.96 pounds) were captured in the 2021 fall standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2022 for YOY Walleye abundance, and early September of 2021 for all fish species by standard survey nets and late November for Tullibee.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (maximum depth=110 feet), and moderately productivelake located near Spicer, MN in Kandiyohi County. Green Lake has excellent water quality and clarity (secchi disk=9 feet). The Middle Fork of the Crow River \"MFCR\" flows into Mud Lake(34-158), Nest Lake (34-154), and eventually into Green Lake along the northwest side. TheMFCR is a constant source of moderate/low nutrient loading to Green Lake. The immediatewatershed is primarily residential homes, mixed hardwoods, and wetlands. Green is highlydeveloped (663 homes, several resorts, county and city parks, a bible camp, and the city ofSpicer). The MFCR exits Green Lake along the northeast shore and connects to Lake Calhoun(34-0062). Water control structures affecting Green Lake water levels include the MFCR/MudReservoir Dam at New London, a dam at the MFCR inlet to Green Lake, a dam in the MFCR eastof Green and south of Calhoun, and a dam at the outlet of Calhoun. Shoalwater substrates aremostly sand and gravel in the lake. Boulder and rubble are common along several long shallowbars (Grate's,  Hultgren's) and adjacent shoreline point areas. Marl and silt are common inthe outlet bay area. Hardstem bulrush stands are found in the outlet bay area and a smallstand along the south shore. There are various submergent vegetation species found withinGreen, however densities are light throughout most of the lake except for the outlet bayarea. Green Lake has been stocked with a variety of fish species and densities over theyears. Smallmouth bass were introduced in the 1940's. Tullibee \"cisco\" were introduced intoGreen during the late 1800's. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in the past with thegreatest frequency compared to all other fish species. Experimental regulations (24 inchmaximum size for northern pike, catch and release fishing only for smallmouth and largemouthbass) were implemented in 1997 for developing trophy northern pike and smallmouth bassopportunities. Green Lake is a popular walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegillfishery. In addition, a two-three week gillnetting season is allowed for tullibee in mid tolate November each year.     Walleye numbers within Green Lake have been both abundant and relatively stable duringthe last sixteen years. Likewise, anglers have experienced good walleye fishing in Greenthroughout the same time period. The 1997 walleye abundance (13.5 fish/gillnet) was above thehistorical average (9.2 fish/gillnet). However, the walleye average size has been small (<1.0 lbs.) the last two years. Walleye growth rates are slightly below average in Greencompared to other area lakes. The majority of walleye captured in the 1997 survey belongedto the 1994 year class which was due primarily to natural reproduction. Green Lake walleyefishing is often good throughout the entire summer unlike other area lakes. Green can be achallenging lake to fish for walleye due to the complex underwater structure present in thelake.     Northern pike numbers in 1997 (3.4 fish/gillnet) were normal compared to similar lakesand the Green Lake historical average (2.9 fish/gillnet). However, the northern pike averageweight from the gillnets was small (1.8 lbs.). The largest northern pike caught and releasedfrom the trapnets was 37.7 inches. Anglers often have good success catching northern pike bytrolling near the shallow flats along the south portion of the lake during late summer.     Smallmouth bass abundance in the 1997 spring electrofishing survey (25.1 fish/hour) wasabove the historical average (14.1 fish/hour). The 1997 smallmouth bass average size fromspring electrofishing was 12.2 inches. The largest smallmouth caught and released from springelectrofishing was 18.8 inches. Anglers have good success fishing for smallmouth bass alongthe northeast portion of Green Lake.     Other fish species that provide good fishing success for anglers include bluegill,rockbass, and occasionally yellow perch and black crappie. Bluegill numbers in 1997 (11.9fish/trapnet) were below the historical average (55.1 fish/trapnet), however the average sizewas good (6.1 inches). The largest bluegill captured and released in the 1997 survey was 9.1inches. Anglers have the best success catching bluegill near the outlet bay area adjacent tothe bulrush stands.     Green Lake is one of the most popular lakes both for fishing and recreational activities (i.e., boating, swimming, water skiing) in Kandiyohi County. The walleye population abundancehas been stable the last sixteen years. Although, the walleye average size has beenrelatively small (< 1.0 lbs.) the last two years. Green Lake has good walleye naturalreproduction. Current plans are to stock Green with walleye fingerlings only after twoconsecutive poor walleye natural year classes as documented by annual fall electrofishingsurveys. Priority management in Green will continue for walleye. Green Lake has the habitat,water quality, forage base (tullibee), and historical precedence to produce trophy northernpike. The 24 inch maximum size limit experimental regulation should enhance opportunities fornorthern pike to reach the trophy size range in Green. Likewise, Green has produced fairnumbers of large smallmouth bass in the past. The catch and release experimental regulationfor smallmouth bass should also enhance numbers of trophy sized fish within Green. Both thenorthern pike and smallmouth bass experimental regulations are part of a statewide study thatwill be finalized and evaluated in 2006. These regulations may remain in effect, modified,or removed depending upon how the regulations meet the specified goals for Green Lake. Othermanagement priorities for Green include protecting the existing stands of hardstem bulrush,assessing the tullibee population through annual fall gillnetting surveys, assessing  walleyenatural reproduction by fall electrofishing surveys, assessing adult fish populations throughannual summer assessments, and protecting water quality by encouraging local landowners toimplement best management practices within the watershed (i.e. conservation tillage, plantingbuffer strips, restoring wetlands, proper manure/feedlot management, proper shorelandmanagement, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers, etc.). </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large, deep, moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Greenis a popular walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and smallmouth bass fishery. Walleye fishinghas been good in recent years, however the average size has been small (< 1.25 lbs.). Greenhas good walleye natural reproduction occurring during most years in the abundant rock andgravel shoal water areas. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers were abundant to moderate from1993-1996. Poor walleye natural reproduction was documented in 1997. Green Lake was laststocked with walleye fingerlings (43,827 marked fish 2,027 lbs.) in 1994. Green Lake wasstocked with 2,699,904 walleye fry in the 1996 spring which was a 10% return of the walleyeeggs taken from Green Lake for the 1996 state wide walleye hatching quotas. Experimentalfishing regulations were enacted during 1997 in order to increase the quality of size fornorthern pike and smallmouth bass in Green Lake. The smallmouth bass experimental regulationallows for catch and release fishing only. The northern pike experimental regulationprohibits the harvest of northern pike 24.0 inches or greater. The two experimentalregulations will be evaluated in 2008 at which time they will be maintained, modified, orremoved depending on the effectiveness of the regulations and public support. Local residentsreported excellent fishing success for catching smallmouth bass in 1998.      Walleye abundance in 1998 (9.83 fish/gillnet) was similar to the Green historicalaverage (9.26 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average weight (0.99 lbs., gillnets) was belowthe Green historical average (1.19 lbs.), but above the two previous surveys. Three walleyeyear classes (24% for 1996, 30% for 1995, 31% for 1994) comprised most of the 1998 walleyegillnet catch. There were no 1994 stocked walleye observed in the 1998 summer survey nets.Yearling walleye were abundant in the 1998 fall electrofishing survey (22.5 fish/hour,average length=10.1 inches). However, YOY walleye numbers were low (4.5 YOY/hour, averagelength=7.5 inches) in the 1998 fall night electrofishing survey.     Northern pike abundance in 1998 (2.58 fish/gillnet) was similar to the Green historicalaverage (7.89 fish/gillnet). The northern pike average weight was 2.56 lbs in 1998. Thelargest northern pike captured in the 1998 survey nets was 40.0 inches.     There were abundant numbers of smallmouth bass (4.25 fish/gillnet) and yellow perch(32.33 fish/gillnet) present in 1998. The smallmouth bass average size (11.7 inches, gillnetsand trapnets combined) increased in 1998 compared to the Green historical average (9.2inches). The largest smallmouth bass captured in the 1998 survey was 17.6 inches. Low numbersof bluegill (5.20 fish/trapnet) and rock bass (2.83 fish/gillnet) were present in 1998.However, the bluegill average size improved in 1998 (6.0 inches) compared to the Greenhistorical average (5.2 inches). Tullibee numbers (2.25 fish/gillnet) were present inmoderate numbers during 1998. Tullibee are an important forage fish for large northern pike.     The Green Lake fishery appears to be in good condition for walleye, northern pike, andsmallmouth bass numbers. In addition, there are abundant forage species (yellow perch,tullibee, crayfish) present in Green. Although bluegill numbers are presently low, theaverage size has improved. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office will continue to monitor GreenLake fish population numbers through annual summer netting surveys, spring basselectrofishing surveys and ice out northern pike trapping every two years, and annual YOYwalleye fall electrofishing surveys in order to evaluate the effectiveness of currentmanagement practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey in Green Lake was conducted during mid-September of 2022 using lake survey gillnets and trapnets. Standard surveys were done during the last week of July or first week of August prior to 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Targeted surveys were conducted to determine if September gillnetting would more effectively sample the Walleye population than the standard July-August surveys in Green Lake during 2017-2020. Current and past September gillnetting surveys occurred during or after the fall turnover. We set 12 gillnets at standard summer stations during early September of 2022. Green Lake was mixed from surface to 98 feet deep with water temperatures near 71 F.; dissolved oxygen was 8.9 ppm near the surface, 8.4 ppm at 50 feet deep and 7.5 ppm near the bottom. The secchi reading was 9.0 feet during the early September survey. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 20, 2022 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A creel survey was last conducted on Green Lake during the 2019 summer and 2019-2020 winter. <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil (2000) and Zebra Mussels (2014). Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Water levels were low during 2020-2022. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters the Middle Fork Crow River. Submergent vegetation appeared less dense in 2021 and 2022 than previous survey years. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is present along the southeast shore. Zebra mussels were abundant on shoalwater substrates such as rubble and boulder throughout the littoral areas. Zebra Mussels have decreased free open water green algal abundance. This has resulted in lower densities of zooplankton, shifted energy and nutrient transfers from open water to bottom habitats, altered predator-prey relationships, decreased some fish species condition factors, and increased water clarity since 2014. Several other area lakes (Andrew, Diamond, Eagle, Elkhorn, George, Nest, Norway, and Games) were recently reported as infested with Zebra Mussels during 2017-2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gillnet catch rate (0.67 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (1.26 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall survey. Black Crappie trapnet catch rate was moderate (2.47 fish/trapnet) in the 2022 fall survey. The 2022 Black Crappie average sizes were small for fall gillnets (0.20 pounds and 7.2 inches), but moderate for fall trapnets (0.29 pounds and 7.8 inches). The historical average lengths are 8.0 inches and 8.2 inches respectively from gillnets and trapnets. The 2022 Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.0 inches plus) was low (0.33 fish/trapnet). The largest Black Crappie captured was 12.2 inches. Black Crappie growth rates were slow compared to Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-7. The 2019 year class comprised 60% of the 2022 Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trapnet catch rate (126.73 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (44.94 fish/trapnet) in the 2022 fall survey. Bluegill average size was small (0.09 pounds and 4.7 inches) from trapnets. The historical average length is 5.5 inches from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 10.7 inches. The 2022 Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches plus) was low (0.60 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were moderate compared to the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5, but above the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2019 year class comprised 59% of the 2022 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gillnet catch rate (0.08 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (0.85 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Largemouth Bass gillnet average size was large (2.04 pounds and 15.6 inches). Abundant numbers of small sized Largemouth Bass (1.73 fish/trapnet, 5.9 inches average) were captured in the 2022 fall trapnets. The historical average lengths are 10.4 inches and 8.7 inches respectively from gillnets and trapnets. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slow compared to other Spicer Area lakes. The 2020 year class comprised 67% of the 2022 survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gillnet catch rate (2.08 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (2.85 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.80 pounds and 23.4 inches). The historical average length is 23.2 inches. Northern Pike appeared thin for their length in recent years. The 2022 Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.0 inches plus) was low (0.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (0.43 fish/gillnet). The largest Northern Pike captured was 30.0 inches. Northern Pike growth rates were slow compared the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2019 year class comprised 41% of the 2022 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Green in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass gillnet catch rate was high (8.92 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historical average (9.18 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Rock Bass gillnet average size was large (0.45 pounds and 7.7 inches). The historical average length is 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet catch rate (2.08 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the historical average (1.75 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Smallmouth Bass gillnet average size (1.11 pounds and 11.1 inches) was moderate. The historical average length is 13.3 inches. The 2022 Smallmouth Bass fall catch rate of preferred size (14.0 inches plus) was moderate (0.67 fish/gillnet), but below the historical average (1.02 fish/gillnet). A minor summerkill of adult Smallmouth Bass was noted in Green due to a viral outbreak during July/August of 2021. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-4, but within or above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2020 year class comprised 66% of the 2022 Smallmouth Bass survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Crayfish (important prey species for Smallmouth Bass) numbers were high during the 2022 fall survey (20.50 crayfish/gillnet) compared to previous surveys from 2002-2020 (<3.00 crayfish/gillnet). There were also abundant Northern Crayfish (16.58 crayfish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall survey. Zebra Mussels are an important forage prey for Northern Crayfish. Zebra Mussels may cause a shift to greater numbers of bottom species such as Northern Crayfish and Yellow Perch which would be beneficial to Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n  <br> \nTullibee gillnet catch rate was low (0.08 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. Tullibee numbers were also low (0.17 fish/gillnet) in the 2021 fall survey. Tullibee were absent in the 2020 September and summer gillnet catches. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 1.73 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2022 Tullibee average size was small (0.33 pounds and 9.1 inches). The historical average length is 10.70 inches. Tullibee growth rates were below the Spicer Area and Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-2. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gillnet catch rate was low (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (10.98 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.5 inches). The historical length is 6.5 inches. The 2022 fall catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches plus) Yellow Perch was also low (0.17 fish/gillnet). Yellow Perch growth rates were slow for ages 1-6. The 2018 year class comprised 65% of the 2022 Yellow Perch survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked into Green with mostly Spicer and Pike River strains of varied amounts (0.5 to 2.5 million fish) from 2000-2013. Approximately 1 million Spicer strain fry were recently stocked in 2016 and 2018. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked in Green during 2000-2013, 2016 and 2018. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults were stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Pike River was the primary Walleye fingerling strain that was available and stocked into Green from 2000-2014. Spicer Area Walleye fingerling rearing ponds have been stocked with primarily the Spicer strain since 2015. Both Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped age 3+ adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and ages 1+ fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Fin clipped Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adults (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). Green was stocked with 2,500 Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye (1,050 pounds) after the 2021 fall standard survey. Adults and yearlings comprised 1,844 fish (911 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. Fingerlings comprised 656 fish (139 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. In October of 2022, Walleye stocked (fin clipped) included adults (115 fish, 172 pounds), yearlings (342 fish, 145 pounds) and fingerlings (425 fish, 104 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (65.54 YOY/hour, 5.2 inches) due to natural reproduction were captured in 2022 fall electrofishing survey. This was the highest historical recorded YOY Walleye catch rate for Green Lake. Young of Year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to natural reproduction were moderate (10.50 YOY/hour, 7.4 inches) in 2021. YOY Walleye were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (<5.00 YOY/hour) were captured in 2013-2019 fall electrofishing surveys. Although, fall electrofishing survey techniques may be less effective for sampling YOY Walleye in large multi contoured lakes with high water clarity. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2012 (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) and 2011 (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% of the 2012 fall electrofishing survey catches. OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gillnet catch rate (6.92 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the historical average (8.21 fish/gillnet) in the 2022 fall standard survey. The 2022 Walleye average size was moderate (1.49 pounds and 15.7 inches). The historical average length is 15.0 inches. The 2022 catch rate of quality size (15.0 plus inches) Walleye (4.67 fish/gillnet) was above the historical average (3.58 fish/gillnet). The 2022 fall catch rate of preferred size (20.0 inches plus) Walleye was low (0.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were excellent compared to the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8. However, Walleye growth rates were fair to poor compared to Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2022 Walleye fall standard survey catch was comprised of 2004 (1%), 2012 (2%), 2013 (2%), 2014 (1%), 2015 (2%), 2016 (1%) and 2017 (7%), 2018 (21%), 2019 (31%), 2020 (0%) and 2021 (30%) year classes. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye (fry stocked) accounted for 28% of 2018 year class caught in the 2022 Walleye fall gillnet and trapnet catches. No other OTC marked fish from other year classes were captured in the 2022 fall gillnet and trapnets. Approximately 31% of 2019 Walleye year class (age 3) were fin clipped fish (yearling/adult stockings) in the 2022 Walleye fall survey catch. Fin clipped Walleye accounted for 7% of 2021 year class (656 fingerlings stocked) captured in the 2022 fall survey catch. All Walleye from the 2016 and 2014 year classes were fin clipped (yearling/adult stockings) in the 2022 survey catch. Zebra Mussels may negatively affect future Walleye fry stockings or natural reproduction by reducing zooplankton food availability, thus causing poor Walleye first year survival. However, if bottom forage species such as Yellow Perch begin to rebound then yearling/adult Walleye survival and growth may also respond positively. It is encouraging that good Walleye natural reproduction success was documented in 2022. If fingerling survival to adult size is poor, then continued Walleye fingerling or yearling stockings may be necessary to maintain adequate Walleye numbers in Green. The new Walleye bag limit was reduced from six to three fish on Green Lake in 2021. Only 1 Walleye over 20 inches is allowed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the 2022 fall standard survey included low numbers of White Sucker (0.25 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.17 fish/gillnet) and Black Bullhead (1.00 fish/gillnet). Abundant numbers of moderate sized Yellow Bullhead (12.42 fish/gillnet, 0.64 pounds) were captured in the 2022 fall standard survey. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2023 for YOY Walleye abundance, and early September of 2023 for all fish species by standard survey nets and late November for Tullibee.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2001. Green is a large, deep, low-moderate productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Also, Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation is generally limited in the lake. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake near the Spicer public access and swimming beach since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake. The dominant substrates (rock, rubble, gravel) present in the shoal water areas are not easily suitable for aquatic vegetation establishment. Experimental regulations for both northern pike and smallmouth bass were enacted in 1997 in order to increase the average size and produce trophy fisheries of smallmouth bass and northern pike in Green Lake. The northern pike experimental regulation (24 inch maximum size limit) prohibits the harvest of fish 24.0 inches and greater. The smallmouth and largemouth bass regulation was originally catch and release only. However, the bass regulation was modified to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit in 2001. The bass regulation was changed because of increasing high numbers of smallmouth bass and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population in Green Lake. A summer creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during the 2001 summer (May 10 - September 30) as an on going evaluation of the two experimental regulations.Bluegill numbers were high in 2001 (61.4 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average (50.4 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.10 lbs. and 4.8 inches from trapnets). Bluegill growth rates were below average for fish 3 years and younger, but generally above average for fish 4 years and older compared to Spicer Area lakes. There were moderate numbers of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill in the 2001 summer assessment (8.2 fish/trapnet). The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 9.9 inches. Northern pike numbers were low in 2001 (3.0 fish/gillnet), but the same as the historical average. The northern pike average size was moderate (3.57 lbs. and 24.2 inches from gillnets). Northern pike growth rates were generally above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The northern pike population is also evaluated every other spring through ice out trapping at several major spawning runs. The northern pike average size has increased both in the summer and spring ice out assessments since the experimental regulation was enacted in 1997. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 34.3 inches.Smallmouth bass numbers were high in 2001 (2.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). The 2001 smallmouth bass average size was moderate to large (1.34 lbs. and 12.3 inches from gillnets). Smallmouth bass numbers of large fish (>14.0 inches) was also high for Green. Smallmouth bass growth rates were below average for fish 2 years and younger, but average or above for fish 3 years and older compared to the Green Lake historical averages. Smallmouth bass forage such as crayfish, were low in 2001 (1.7 crayfish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (17.9 crayfish/gillnet). Local anglers have reported excellent success catching large smallmouth bass in recent years. However, local anglers have expressed concern over the relatively high smallmouth population effect via competition on the presently low walleye population in Green Lake.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers in 2001 (0.3 fish/gillnet) were below the historical average (3.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 tullibee average size was moderate (0.59 lbs. and 10.6 inches from gillnets). Tullibee are an important forage species for both large northern pike and walleye.Yellow perch numbers were low to moderate in 2001 (14.9 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (20.7 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 lbs. and 6.5 inches from gillnets). Walleye numbers were low to moderate in 2001 (7.8 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (9.6 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.34 lbs. and 14.9 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. Walleye numbers of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger fish (4.2 fish/gillnet) were moderate for Green. Local anglers reported below average walleye angling success for numbers, but larger fish were the norm compared to previous years. Fishing pressure was low in 2001 for Green Lake.Walleye natural reproduction in Green is generally both frequent and good based on previous fall and summer surveys. However, walleye natural reproduction has been fair to poor in recent years. Low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (4.7 YOY walleye/hour, 7.1 inches average size) were captured in the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey. The Green Lake historical average catch rate for YOY walleye in fall electrofishing surveys is 22.2 YOY walleye/hour. All YOY walleye sampled in the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey were marked fish from a 2001 stocking of walleye fry (1.04 million fish). The walleye fry stocking in 2001 was a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for statewide hatching operations. There were moderate yearling walleye numbers captured (19.0 yearling walleye/hour, 9.0 inches average length) during the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey. All yearling walleye were marked fish from fry (1.7 million fish) or fingerling (100,000 fish; 2,058 lbs.) stockings done in 2000. Unmarked walleye fingerlings (145,000 fish; 4,188 lbs.) were stocked during October of 2001 after the fall night electrofishing survey because of low documented YOY walleye numbers. Current fish management activities on Green include protecting the important aquatic vegetation such as bulrush through the permit process, monitoring and preventing the spread of Eurasian water milfoil if possible within and out of Green Lake, participating in the Middle Fork of the Crow River Watershed Project, monitoring both smallmouth bass and northern pike populations for the experimental regulations study, modifying the experimental regulations if necessary in the future for either smallmouth bass or northern pike, and stocking walleye fingerlings after two consecutive years of poor natural reproduction as documented by fall night electrofishing surveys. The Green Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2002 spring for smallmouth bass and the 2002 summer for all species. Ice out trapping assessment for northern pike will occur in 2003.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (7.56 PER GN, MEAN WEIGHT PER GN CAUGHT WAE WAS 1.37 LBS.) WAS VERY NEAR THE HISTORICAL MEANS (7.61 PER GN, MEAN WEIGHT PER GN CAUGHT WAE WAS 1.26 LBS.) AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 27 LAKES.  THE SIZE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION WAS WELL BALANCED AND IT APPEARS THAT THE 90,89, AND 88 YEAR-CLASSES WERE ALL MODERATE- TO-STRONG.  THE 86 AND 85 YEAR-CLASSES APPEAR TO ALSO BE MODERATE-TO-STRONG AND COULD PROVIDE SOME QUALITY SIZE (>18.0 INCHES) FISH.  WAE GROWTH RATES WERE BELOW THE LOCAL AVERAGE WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR GREEN LAKE.  THE 1991 NOP CATCH INDEX (2.78 PER GN, MEAN WEIGHT PER GN CAUGHT NOP WAS 2.38 LBS.) WAS SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL MEANS (2.87 PER GN, MEAN WEIGHT PER GN CAUGHT NOP WAS 2.58 LBS.) BUT IS BELOW THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 27 LAKES IN TERMS OF NUMBERS.  THE 1990 YEAR-CLASS LOOKED WEAK COMPARED TO THE 1989 YEAR- CLASS (DATA FROM 1990 SURVEY SUBSTANTIATES) WHICH SHOULD DOMINATE THE FISHERY IN 1992 (20-25 INCH FISH).  THE GROWTH RATES OF NOP WERE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-2 AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 3-4.  THE 1991 BLC TRAPNET CATCH INDEX WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED (2.20 PER TN), HOWEVER, TRAPNETS GENERALLY CATCH SMALLER/YOUNGER BLC THAN GILLNETS IN GREEN LAKE (GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS 0.22 WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO THE 1990 SURVEY).  THE DECLINE IN THE BLC FISHERY THROUGH THE 1980'S MAY GET A BOOST FROM THE RELATIVELY LARGE 1990 YEAR-CLASS IN 1994-1995 BASED ON THIS INFORMATION.  GROWTH RATES FOR BLC WERE BELOW AVERAGE-TO-AVERAGE.  BASED ON THE RELATIVELY LARGE 1991 TRAPNET CATCH INDEX COMPRISED PREDOMINANTLY OF YOUNG SMB (4.87 PER TN, 0.10 LBS. PER FISH), 1990 COULD BE A STRONG YEAR- CLASS.  TIMING DURING SPRING ELECTROFISHING APPEARS VERY CRITICAL FOR LMB/SMB RESULTS (1990- 14.43 LMB PER HOUR, 2.00 SMB PER HOUR:  1991 - 26.40 SMB PER HOUR, 8.00 LMB PER HOUR).  GROWTH RATES FOR SMB WERE AVERAGE AND GROWTH RATES FOR LMB WERE BELOW AVERAGE.  THE SEEMINGLY HIGH ABUNDANCE OF CRAYFISH MAY BE A KEY FACTOR IN THE RELATIVELY FASTER SMB GROWTH RATES.  THE 1991 BLG TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (109.67 PER TN) WAS THE HIGHEST RECORDED FOR GREEN LAKE AND IS HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 27 LAKES.  OVERALL, GROWTH RATES ARE BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 1-3 AND AVERAGE FOR AGE 4, HOWEVER, THERE APPEARS TO BE A WIDE DIVERGENCE IN GROWTH RATES WITHIN A YEAR- CLASS.  ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF BLG WERE BELOW 6 INCHES, THERE WAS A FAIR NUMBER IN THE 6-7.5 RANGE.  THE BLG (> 8 INCHES) THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT HAVE NOT BEEN SAMPLED WELL IN GREEN LAKE. THERE APPEARS TO BE A RELATIVELY LARGE 1987 YEAR- CLASS (1990 SURVEY RESULTS ALSO SUBSTANTIATE THIS) THAT COULD PROVIDE THE 1991 FALL TLC TESTNETTING RESULTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE 1990 RESULTS IN TERMS OF RELATIVE DENSITY AND SIZE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES.  ALTHOUGH THE 1991 YEP GILLNET CATCH INDEX WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE 1990 INDEX (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY AT THE END), THE DIFFERENCE DOES NOT APPEAR SIGNIFICANT AND IS WITHIN THE RANGE FOR MOST CLASS 27 LAKES.  THE AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION SHOWED POSSIBLE LOW YEAR- CLASS STRENGTHS IN 1990 AND 1989 (1+ AND 2+ YEAR OLDS ARE GENERALLY SAMPLED MODERATELY WELL IN GREEN LAKE).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (maximum depth 110 feet), moderately productivelake located near Spicer, MN in Kandiyohi County. Green has excellent water quality comparedto most other lakes in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity is excellent and nutrient levels aremoderate to low. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) inlet via Mud Lake (34-158) andNest Lake (34-0154) is a constant source of moderate nutrient loading to Green Lake. So farGreen has been able to assimilate incoming nutrients without any appreciable increase inproductivity. In addition to MFCR, there are seven other inlets of which all but one connectto shallow permanent lakes/marshes. The outlet (MFCR) is located on the northeast side of thelake and connects to Calhoun Lake via a marsh. The immediate watershed types are primarilymunicipal (residential homes), mixed hardwoods, and marshlands. Green is heavily developedwith 663 homes, several resorts/motels/bed&breakfasts, several condominiums/apartmentbuildings, bible camp, county park, city park, and the city of Spicer along the southwestshoreline. Only a small portion near the outlet is undeveloped. The lake shallow watersubstrate is dominated by sand and gravel throughout most of the lake, boulder and rubblecommon in various areas (shallow bars, shoreline), marl and silt in the outlet bay. There areseveral long shallow bars (Hultgren's, Lone Tree, Grate's, Castle Flats) located in the lake.Emergent vegetation (primarily hardstem bulrush with some common cattail, cane, and reedcanary grass) are restricted to the outlet area and a small stand near the \"Spicer Castle\"along the south shore. There is a variety of submergent vegetation species, but the densityis light throughout most of the lake with the exception of the outlet bay area. Water controlstructures affecting Green Lake water levels include the MFCR/Mud Lake Reservoir Dam at NewLondon, a stoplog dam at the MFCR inlet to Green Lake, a Type C with stoplogs south ofCalhoun, and a Type C solid sill at the Calhoun outlet. Green Lake has been intensivelystocked with a variety of species, densities, and frequencies over the years. Smallmouth basswere introduced in the early 1940's. Cisco \"tullibee\" were thought to be introduced intoGreen during the late 1800's. In the last ten years, stocking efforts have been devotedmostly to walleye. Historically, rescue operations have been common in adjacent connectedwinterkill lakes/marshes for northern pike. Prior to 1991, walleye were stocked almost everyyear. The current lake management plan is to stock walleye (about 2000 lbs) only after twoconsecutive poor natural year classes documented by fall electrofishing. Fall electrofishingsurveys have been conducted since 1993 to assess the contributions of natural reproductionand stocking to the walleye fishery in Green. Commercial removal has been limited in the lastten years to carp (16,160 lbs) and suckers (2,900 lbs). About 111 lbs of cisco were removedby state crews for an initial stocking at an East Metro Fisheries Area lake. In 1989, 310northern pike were removed by state crews for stocking local northern pike spawning areas(NPSA). Small amounts of walleye eggs (90,000 to 1,985,940) were removed by state crews forfingerling production in 1971, 1978-80, and 1986. Green is a popular lake for walleye,northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill angling. In addition, tullibee gillnetting isallowed for a two-three week period in mid to late November. In recent years, Green has beenintensively sampled (consecutive lake surveys since 1989, spring electrofishing surveys forsmallmouth and largemouth bass, fall electrofishing surveys for YOY/Yearling walleye, creelsurveys in 1995 and 1996, spring northern pike assessment, ice out trapnetting for walleye,fall cisco gillnetting) to provide a better data base for developing future long termmanagement goals and objectives. Furthermore, experimental fishing regulations are plannedto be implemented in 1997 for developing trophy northern pike and smallmouth bassopportunities.     Walleye abundance in 1995 (11.4 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (4.0 - 9.6fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average of 8.5 fish/gillnet. The1995 average size (14.5, 1.2 lbs) was similar to the historical average (14.6 inches, 1.3lbs). The walleye population size structure has been fairly constant. Growth rates appearaverage to good. The largest fish caught was 24.2 inches in 1995. Walleye naturalreproduction was good in 1993 (46.0 YOY/hour) and 1994 (52.7 YOY/hour), but low in 1995 (22.0YOY/hour). Local lakes with documented natural reproduction averaged 51.0 YOY/hour in 1995.Green Lake walleye yearling abundance was 30.3 YRL/hour in 1993, 17.3 YRL/hour in 1994, and23.0 YRL/hour in 1995. The average size of young of year and yearling walleye caughtelectrofishing in 1995 was 6.2 and 9.2 inches respectively. The 1995 local lake young of yearand yearling walleye average sizes were 6.7 inches and 11.2 inches respectively. Green wasstocked with 43,827 pelvic fin clipped fingerlings (2,047 lbs = 1 lb/littoral acre) duringthe fall of 1994. Stocked fingerlings accounted for only 2.4% (1.3 YOY/hour) of the totalfingerling production in Green during 1994 (natural and stocked= 54.0 YOY/hour). However,this estimate may be conservative due to unequal spatial distributions and handling stressof stocked fish when fall electrofishing occurred two weeks after stocking in 1994.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 -7.9 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and comparable to the historical average (2.8fish/gillnet). The largest fish captured in the summer survey was 34.6 inches. The averagesize in 1995 (20.9 inches, 2.6 lbs from gillnets) was similar to the historical average (21.7inches, 2.6 lbs.). Growth rates appear average to above average. Spawning runs occur inseveral inlet marshes (Alvig Slough, East Woodcock Lake), and also a large run at the outletmarsh area. Spring monitoring of the northern pike spawning runs have occurred from 1994-1996to provide information for the northern pike experimental regulations study. During thespring of 1994, 376 northern pike captured were marked with a left pelvic fin clip. About 22%(4 fish) of the northern pike (> 9 inches) captured in the 1994 summer survey nets had finclips. In the spring of 1995, 721 fish were tagged with a blue plastic spaghetti tag. About8% (3 fish) of the northern pike captured in the 1995 summer survey nets had a blue tag.There were no YOY northern pike caught during the fall electrofishing survey in 1995.      Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (22.7 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range forsimilar lakes (7.1 - 33.9 fish/gillnet), and comparable to the historical average (20.4fish/gillnet). Yellow perch abundance was also similar in 1995 compared to 1994 (23.6fish/gillnet). The average size in 1995 (6.7 inches) was similar to the historical average(6.4 inches). Growth rates appear slightly below average compared to other local lakes.     Cisco \"tullibee\" abundance in 1995 summer survey (7.7 fish/gillnet) was above the normalrange (0.5 - 5.2 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (4.3fish/gillnet). Abundance was up in 1995 compared to 1994 (3.6 fish/gillnet). The average sizein 1995 (12.0 inches) was above the historical average (9.6 inches).     Smallmouth bass abundance in 1995 (0.4 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 0.9 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and comparable to the historical average (0.5fish/gillnet). Smallmouth bass abundance in the 1995 spring electrofishing survey (9.0fish/hour) was also similar to the historical average (10.9 fish/hour). The average sizecaught in the 1995 gillnets was 13.3 inches. The average size caught in the 1995 springelectrofishing survey was 14.8 inches. The largest smallmouth bass caught was 18.5 inches(summer survey). Crayfish (important forage species of smallmouth bass) did not appearabundant in the 1995 survey (0.7 crayfish/gillnet). Green Lake will be part of a statewideexperimental regulations study on smallmouth bass in 1997.      Largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate in 1995 was 0.4 fish/hour. Previouselectrofishing catch rates included 0.7 fish/hour in 1994, 1.9 fish/hour in 1993, 8.0fish/hour in 1991, and 57.7 fish/hour in 1990. The average size was 12.2 inches in the 1995electrofishing survey.     Rock bass abundance in 1995 (1.6 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 6.6fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (6.2 fish/gillnet). Theaverage size in 1995 (8.3 inches, 0.7 lbs) was slightly above the historical average (7.9inches, 0.5 lbs).      Black crappie abundance in 1995 (0 fish/gillnet, 0.3 fish/trapnet) was below the normalrange (0.2 - 1.1 fish/gillnet, 0.3 - 1.7 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and below thehistorical average (0.7 fish/gillnet, 0.6 fish/trapnet). Black crappie populations throughoutmost of Kandiyohi County have been low in recent years.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (29.5 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (3.7 - 42.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (62.7 fish/trapnet). Theaverage size in 1995 (5.8 inches) was above the historical average (4.9 inches). It appearsthat the population size structure and average size has improved slightly from previoussurveys. Important bluegill habitat include bulrush stands on the south shore (Spicer Castle)and the northeast outlet bay area.     Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (4.1 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.3  -2.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (1.9 fish/trapnet). Theaverage size in 1995 (6.2 inches) was below the historical average (8.7 inches). Yellowbullhead abundance in 1995 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (0.9 - 4.8fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (0.5 fish/trapnet). Brownbullhead abundance in 1995 (0.6 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.3 - 1.7fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and the same as the historical average.     Bowfin \"dogfish\" abundance in 1995 (0.4 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.3 - 1.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (1.5 fish/trapnet).The average weight was 5.3 lbs in 1995 which is above the historical average (4.7 lbs).     Carp abundance in 1995 (0.5 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.2 - 1.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (0.9 fish/trapnet). Theaverage size of carp caught in the trapnets was 11.7 lbs. One bigmouth buffalo (11.9 lbs) wascaught in a trapnet near the Spicer Castle.     Green has the habitat, water quality, and forage base to potentially produce trophynorthern pike and smallmouth bass. In the past, abundant crayfish populations have beenimportant forage for producing smallmouth bass. Other abundant forage (cisco, yellow perch)have the potential to produce trophy northern pike. In addition, there usually is a cool,oxygenated layer present when the lake stratifies in mid summer (as evidenced by the ciscopopulation and relatively few summerkill events) which is conducive for producing trophynorthern pike. A statewide experimental regulation study for various species will includeGreen Lake. Experimental regulations will be implemented for smallmouth bass and northernpike by the beginning of the 1997 fishing opener. Related experimental regulations studyactivities include upcoming creel surveys in 1996-1997, annual spring bass electrofishingsurveys, and annual northern pike spawning run assessment netting. In addition, ice outtrapnetting and tagging of walleye will be conducted to get more information about populationsize and angler exploitation in conjunction with the creel surveys being conducted. Otherpriority management activities will include protecting present water quality, protecting andexpanding existing stands of hardstem bulrush, maintaining access to inlet and outlet marshesfor northern pike spawning, yearly assessment of cisco populations through fall gillnetting,and yearly evaluation of walleye natural reproduction through fall electrofishing. Walleyefingerling stocking on Green should only be considered after successive years of poor naturalreproduction as determined by fall electrofishing. The benefits of stocking as needed(successive years of poor natural reproduction) rather than on a prescribed schedule(stocking every even year) is that the valuable walleye fingerling resource can be used moreefficiently and effectively (higher rates) for other lakes. Furthermore, survival and growthof walleye in a lake may decrease when stocking occurs on top of good natural reproductiondue to more competition for limited resources (forage, habitat, etc.).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2004. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Approximately 628 homes/cabins were counted along the first tier shoreline area in addition to one bible camp, 22 condominiums/apartment buildings, one city park, and two county parks. There are six public access sites on Green Lake. Aquatic vegetation is generally limited in the lake. Low densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate Eurasian water milfoil have been unsuccessful. Widespread and extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake. The dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the shoalwater areas are not suitable for aquatic vegetation establishment. Thirty-two inlets/tiles/culverts were identified draining into Green Lake during the 2003 resurvey. The largest inlet is the Middle Fork of the Crow River, which enters Green along the north shore via the Old Mill Inn Dam. The Middle Fork of the Crow River outlets near the northeast corner of Green and connects to Calhoun Lake. A Highway 23 four-lane construction project began adjacent to Green Lake during 2003. Significant runoff (sediment) from the Highway 23 construction project drained into Green Lake during several large rainfall events in late June and early July of 2003. One of the positive aspects of the Highway 23 project was the construction of retention ponds along the Highway 23 corridor to reduce or slow future runoff into Green Lake. Water clarity was poor during late August of 2003 (secchi=4.83 feet), but good during July of 2004 (secchi=13.20 feet). Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Green Lake after successive walleye natural reproduction or fry stocking failures.Experimental regulations for both northern pike and smallmouth bass were enacted in 1997 in order to increase the average size and produce trophy fisheries of smallmouth bass and northern pike in Green Lake. The northern pike experimental regulation (24 inch maximum size limit) prohibits the harvest of fish 24 inches and greater. The smallmouth and largemouth bass regulation was originally catch and release only. However, the bass regulation was modified to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit in 2001. The bass regulation was modified again in the 2003 fall to a 14 inch maximum harvest size limit with one bass over 21 inches allowed. The bass regulation was changed because of increasing numbers of smallmouth bass and the perceived negative effects on the walleye population in Green Lake. A summer creel survey will be conducted on Green Lake during 2005 as an on going evaluation of the two experimental regulations. A public input meeting will occur during the 2005 fall to determine the fate of current experimental regulations for northern pike and bass on Green for 2006 and beyond.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2004 (31.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 50.60 fish/trapnet. The 2004 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.92 inches) from the trapnets. The catch rate of quality size bluegill 6.00 inches and larger was low to moderate (6.93 fish/trapnet) in the 2004 assessment. The largest bluegill captured in the 2004 assessment was 9.02 inches from Green Lake. Northern pike numbers were low in 2004 (2.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and below the Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate (2.95 fish/gillnet). The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate to large (3.86 pounds and 26.38 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 22.29 inches from gillnets. The northern pike captured in 2003 and 2004 were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in 2003 and 2002 Green Lake surveys. Northern pike growth rates in Green were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2001 northern pike year class comprised 30% of the 2004 total northern pike assessment catch. The northern pike population is also evaluated every other spring (2005) through ice out trapping. The northern pike average lengths have generally increased both in the summer and spring ice out surveys since the experimental regulation was enacted in 1997. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 assessment was 40.94 inches from Green Lake.Smallmouth bass numbers were moderate to abundant in 2004 (2.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.96 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2004 smallmouth bass average size was large (1.95 pounds and 14.70 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.19 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The largest smallmouth bass captured in the 2004 assessment was 18.70 inches from Green Lake. The catch rate of smallmouth bass 14.00 inches and larger was moderate (1.67 fish/gillnet). The 2000 smallmouth bass year class comprised 18% of the total 2004 smallmouth bass assessment catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates in Green were below the Green Lake normal ranges for age 2-4. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not caught in the 2004, 2003 or 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 12.6 crayfish/gillnet.Tullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low in 2004 (0.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green Lake tullibee historical average catch rate (2.67 fish/gillnet). The 2004 tullibee average size was small (0.25 pounds and 8.66 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.43 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2004 (2.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 18.96 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2004 yellow perch average size was small (0.12 pounds and 6.38 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in Green were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2000 yellow perch year class comprised 32% of the 2004 total yellow perch assessment catch.Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (6.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the Green Lake walleye historical average catch rate (9.25 fish/gillnet). The 2004 walleye average size was moderate (1.25 pounds and 14.53 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 14.63 inches from gillnets. The catch rate of walleye 15.00 inches and larger in 2004 (2.58 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (4.05 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2001 year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 28% of the total 2004 walleye assessment catch. Walleye growth rates calculated from the 2004 Green assessment were above the Green Lake normal range for ages 1-8. A fall electrofishing survey of Green Lake was conducted on October 5, 2004. The 2004 fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2004 walleye fry stocking (2.06 million) in Green Lake. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (2.54 YOY/hour, 5.97 inches average length) captured in 2004. Other walleye naturally reproducing area lakes also had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2004 fall electrofishing surveys. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 17.22 YOY/hour and 6.78 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 70.22 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green Lake occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings (63,160 fish, 2,383 pounds), yearlings (1,022 fish, 171 pounds), and adults (444 fish, 751 pounds) were stocked into Green Lake during early October of 2004 in response to poor walleye natural reproduction and fry stocking results for 2003 and 2004. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry from 2000-2004. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 - 4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake.Rock bass numbers were abundant in 2004 (12.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.07 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2004 rock bass average size was small (0.36 pounds and 7.36 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.45 pounds from gillnets.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2004 (0.42 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Green Lake largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.18 fish/gillnet. The 2004 largemouth bass average size was small to moderate (0.95 pounds and 11.35 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.64 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2005 spring ice out for northern pike, 2005 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2005 summer for all fish species by survey nets and creel survey. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Green Lake was conducted in late July of 2007. Green is a large (5,406 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, tullibee, bluegill, and smallmouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall aquatic vegetation densities and frequency of occurrences were generally greater in 2007 than 2003. Water level and precipitation conditions were higher during 2003 compared to drought conditions in 2007 summer. Water clarity was poor during the late summer of 2003 (4.83 feet) compared to 2007 (7.20 feet). The water clarity average from June-September of 2007 (11.5 feet) for Green was above the historical average (10.8 feet). Aquatic vegetation densities generally increase during low water due to increased water clarity conditions and light penetration to substrate surface areas that were previously inaccessible. The maximum depth of vegetation was greater in 2007 (40 feet) than in 2003 (30 feet) or 1994 (35 feet). Aquatic vegetation species that increased in frequency occurrence and mean abundance from 2003 to 2007 included clasping-leaf pondweed, coontail, river pondweed, bushy pondweed, Eurasian milfoil, and bladderwort. Chara (muskgrass) frequency occurrence remained relatively unchanged in 2007 (94%) compared to 2003 (96%) and 1994 (92%), but mean abundance in the transects was 32.1% for 1994, 29.3% for 2003, and 44.3% for 2007. Vegetation species that were relatively unchanged in occurrence or mean abundance from 2003 to 2007 were curly-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil, and hardstem bulrush. Notable vegetation species that decreased in frequency and mean occurrence from 2003 to 2007 included filamentous algae, sago pondweed, water moss, variable-leaf pondweed, and stonewort.  <br> \n <br> \nLow densities of Eurasian water milfoil have been documented in Green Lake primarily near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, and several isolated areas since 2000. Efforts to chemically eradicate various Eurasian water milfoil stands were unsuccessful in 2000, 2001 and 2007. Eurasian milfoil occurred in 16% of the 2007 transects compared to 4% in the 2003 transects. Mean abundance of Eurasian milfoil within the transects increased from 1.3% in 2003 to 5.3% in 2007. Small widely scattered new Eurasian milfoil stands were observed in off shore \"break\" areas at a mean depth of 8.6 feet during 2007. Most large stands of Eurasian milfoil on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will be important for controlling Eurasian milfoil. Widespread-extensive matting of Eurasian water milfoil is unlikely to occur through out Green Lake due to the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the shoalwater areas.  <br> \n <br> \nExperimental regulations for northern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were enacted in Green Lake during 1997 as part of a statewide research study. The goals were to evaluate the success or failure of certain types of experimental regulations, and produce trophy fisheries of bass and northern pike in Green Lake. A public input meeting in regards to the future of Green Lake experimental regulations occurred during the 2005 fall. In December of 2005, the DNR decided to end all experimental regulations on Green Lake (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and northern pike) and return to statewide regulations as of the May 13, 2006 for northern pike and May 27, 2006 for bass. This decision was based both on public input and the analyzed data collected from netting and creel surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high in 2007 (51.64/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but comparable to the Green historical average (49.36 fish/trapnet). The 2007 bluegill average size was moderate (0.13 pounds and 5.54 inches) from the trapnets. The bluegill historical average length is 5.21 inches from trapnets. There were moderate numbers of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (16.38 fish/trapnet) in the 2007 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate to high in 2007 (1.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the Green historical average (0.78 fish/gillnet). The 2007 black crappie average size was moderate (0.47 pounds and 8.85 inches) from gillnets. The black crappie historical average length is 7.75 inches from gillnets in Green. There were moderate to high numbers of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie (1.25 fish/gillnet) in the 2007 gillnets. Growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised 65% of the 2007 black crappie gillnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2007 (1.92 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average (2.82 fish/gillnet). The 2007 northern pike average size was large (5.14 pounds and 28.12 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 23.03 inches from gillnets. Northern pike captured in 2003-2006 surveys were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Large northern pike (>24 inches) condition factors were near or below the Green normal range since 1999 except for 2001 and 2002. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2007. There were moderate to high numbers of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike (0.83 fish/gillnet) in the 2007 gillnets. Spearing pressure and harvest of large northern pike was high during the 2006-07 winter following the return to statewide regulations. Northern pike growth rates were near or above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3, near or below the normal ranges for ages 4-6, and within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. Growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. Several year classes (2001-2004) were present in similar numbers during the 2007 gillnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were high in 2007 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the Green historical average (1.98 fish/gillnet). The 2007 smallmouth bass size was large (2.00 pounds and 15.19 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average length is 13.40 inches from gillnets. There were moderate to high numbers of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass (1.25 fish/gillnet) in the 2007 gillnets. The 2002 smallmouth bass year class comprised 63% of the 2007 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were near or below the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 6-7. Smallmouth bass condition factors have been near or below the Green normal ranges since 2000. Crayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2007, low in 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2004, 2003 or 2002 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 9.7 crayfish/gillnet for Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were low to moderate in the 2007 (1.00 fish/gillnet) summer compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average (2.41 fish/gillnet). The 2007 summer tullibee average size was large (1.28 pounds and 14.10 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.47 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2007 (3.75 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and below the Green historical average (17.08 fish/gillnet). The 2007 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.12 pounds and 6.59 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges, but above the Green normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 (56%)and 2004 (33%) yellow perch year classes comprised the majority of the 2007 yellow perch gillnet catch. Yellow perch condition factors have been near or below the Green normal range since 2003. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were high in 2007 (12.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the Green historical average (9.17 fish/gillnet). The 2007 walleye average size was moderate to small (1.10 pounds and 13.86 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average length is 14.62 inches from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (3.25 fish/gillnet) in the 2007 gillnets. The 2004 year class (stocked and natural reproduction) comprised 41% of the total 2007 walleye gillnet catch. The 2006 and 2005 year classes comprised 24% and 20% respectively of the 2007 gillnet catch. Walleye growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8, but at or above the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8. Walleye condition factors have been above the Green normal range since 1999. <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey of Green Lake was conducted during early October of 2007. The 2007 fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2007 walleye fry (OTC marked) stocking (1.04 million) in Green Lake. The walleye fry were stocked as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. There were low young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.01 inches average length) captured in 2007. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 14.78 YOY/hour and 6.85 inches. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 71.24 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye fingerlings (50,385 fish, 2,640 pounds), yearlings (27,232 fish, 3,279 pounds), and adults (4,270 fish, 2,281 pounds) were stocked into Green during early April-November of 2007. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry from 2000-2007 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked yearly (2,000 \u0013 4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990\u0019s, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and fingerlings/yearlings/adults were stocked in 1994, 1992, 1990. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were high in 2007 (8.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the Green historical average (7.31 fish/gillnet). The 2007 rock bass average size was moderate (0.33 pounds and 7.10 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.43 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were high in 2007 (2.58 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, and above the Green historical average (0.52 fish/gillnet). The 2007 largemouth bass average size was small (0.56 pounds and 9.25 inches) from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were below or near the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-6, but within the Green normal ranges. The 2005 largemouth bass year class comprised 55% of the 2007 largemouth bass assessment gillnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2008 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2008 summer for all fish species by survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

Water clarity was moderate (8.0 feet) for Green Lake on August 3, 2011. The 2011 summer weather was wet and hot with high temperatures above 90 F during several weeks during July. Dissolved oxygen levels were below 2.0 ppm in depths below 32 feet during early August of 2011. A combination of inadequate oxygen levels (< 2ppm) and potentially lethal high temperatures (> 72 F) in water depths below 30 feet were conducive for a tullibee \"cisco\" fish kill during a relatively short time period of late July thru early August of 2011. A few local residents reported dead tullibee near shore areas of Green during 2011. We observed only a few dead tullibees during the 2011 population assessment. A major summerkill of tullibee occurred during the same time period on nearby Lake Koronis in 2011 with pelicans feeding greatly on the dead fish. Green is a popular fishery for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Green Lake receives high recreational use during the summer months. Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, yellow perch, cisco \"tullibee\", bluegill, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n  <br> \nThe threats of present (Eurasian water milfoil, curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. zebra mussels, quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. Eurasian water milfoil \"EWM\" was first documented in Green Lake at several isolated sites during 2000. Initial DNR attempts to chemically eradicate EWM were unsuccessful. Eurasian water milfoil has spread throughout the lake in scattered stands especially near the Spicer public access, swimming beach, city dock, Indian Beach Lagoon, storm water inlet areas and off shore \"break\" areas since 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake association has continued to chemically and physically eradicate various EWM stands in recent years with relatively minimal long term success. New developments in chemical control of EWM (i.e. granular triclopyr treatment) were attempted in Green Lake during 2010, but initial results for 2010 appeared to be unsuccessful in eradicating EWM probably due to continual mixing and wave action, which probably dilutes the herbicide concentrations in EWM infested areas. In 2011, Eurasian milfoil stands appeared less prevalent than during previous years. It is unknown if chemical treatments in 2010 and 2011 or high water conditions negatively affected the establishment of Eurasian milfoil stands. Submergent vegetation densities are often greater during low water level years due to increased light penetration to previously deeper substrate areas of the lake. Often times, algal populations dominate over submergent vegetation in a lake during high water level conditions due to an influx of nutrients (phosphorus) and more turbid water conditions. <br> \n <br> \nEWM and curly-leaf pondweed tend to thrive in disturbed areas (i.e. previously chemically or mechanically treated areas, storm water inlets) or during years of minimal snowfall and maximum light penetration when competition from native species is minimal. Many large stands of EMW on Green Lake have been located near storm water inlets. Watershed projects that may reduce sediment and nutrient inputs from storm water inlets will also be important for controlling EMW in these patchy areas. Widespread-extensive matting of EMW on the surface is unlikely to occur throughout Green Lake unlike some milfoil infested lakes with protected bay areas (i.e. Minnetonka) due to frequent windswept conditions, the presence of relatively low nitrogen (ammonium) nutrient levels and unsuitable dominant substrates (boulder, rubble, gravel) present in the majority of shoal water areas of Green Lake. DNR Aquatic invasive species interns will continue to randomly monitor boats entering and leaving the many access sites in an attempt to educate and prevent the spread of exotics into Kandiyohi County Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2011 (31.47/trapnet) and within the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The Green Lake bluegill historical average catch rate is 47.77 fish/trapnet. The 2011 bluegill average size was moderate (0.20 pounds and 6.08 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2011 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill (20.38 fish/trapnet) was high and above the historical average (12.59 fish/trapnet). The 2011 catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill (0.80 fish/trapnet) was low.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in 2011 gillnets (3.08 fish/gillnet) and trapnets (3.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The Green Lake black crappie historical average catch rates are 0.99 fish/gillnet and 0.69 fish/trapnet. The 2011 black crappie average sizes were small for gillnets (0.16 pounds and 5.99 inches), but moderate for trapnets (0.45 pounds and 8.95 inches). The black crappie historical average lengths are 7.82 inches for gillnets and 7.66 inches for trapnets in Green. The 2011 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches and larger) black crappie (2.93 fish/trapnet) was high and above the historical average (0.34 fish/trapnet).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low to moderate in 2011 (2.33 fish/gillnet) and near the low ends of the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The Green Lake northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.72 fish/gillnet. The 2011 northern pike average size was moderate (3.76 pounds and 24.39 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight and length are 3.28 pounds and 23.17 inches from gillnets. The 2011 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike (0.33 fish/gillnet) was low, but similar to the historical average (0.42 fish/gillnet). Northern pike captured in 2003, 2004 2005, 2007 and 2009 assessments were notably lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. The 2011 northern pike condition factor (0.658) was above the Green Lake normal range. Low numbers of forage fish (yellow perch and tullibee) were documented in Green Lake assessments from 2003-2011. Northern pike growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2007-2009 year classes each comprised 24% of the 2011 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass numbers were moderate in 2011 (1.83 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Green, but above the normal range for similar lakes. The smallmouth bass historical average catch rate is 1.94 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2011 smallmouth bass average size was moderate to large (1.37 pounds and 12.51 inches) from gillnets. The smallmouth bass historical average weight and length are 1.76 pounds and 13.92 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. The 2011 catch rate of preferred size (14.00 inches) and larger smallmouth bass (1.25 fish/gillnet) was high, but near the historical average (1.22 fish/gillnet). The 2011 smallmouth bass condition factor (1.472) was within the normal range for Green. Smallmouth bass condition factors have been near or below the Green Lake normal ranges since 2000 except for 2011. The 2005 year class comprised 32% of the 2011 smallmouth bass gillnet catch. Smallmouth bass growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-2, but below the normal ranges for ages 3-8.  <br> \n  <br> \nCrayfish, an important smallmouth bass forage species, were not captured in 2007-2009. Low numbers of crayfish were captured in 2011 (1.1 crayfish/gillnet), 2010 (0.3 crayfish/gillnet), 2006 (0.1 crayfish/gillnet) and 2005 (0.2 crayfish/gillnet). No crayfish were caught in the 2002-2004 gillnets. The crayfish historical average catch rate is 7.5 crayfish/gillnet for Green.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee \"cisco\" numbers were moderate in the 2011 summer (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.39 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A majority of the tullibee were captured in summer gillnet stations located along the east and south portions of the lake at a depth of approximately 30 feet. The 2011 summer tullibee average size was moderate (0.96 pounds and 12.65 inches) from gillnets. The tullibee historical average weight is 0.58 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nThere were low numbers of tullibee in 2011 DNR fall test nets and 2010 fall special assessment (3.8 fish/gillnet). The 2010 tullibee average size was small (0.77 pounds and 11.66 inches) for Green in the 2010 fall. The fall tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 79.9 fish/gillnet and 12.44 inches for Green Lake. The 2007 and 2006 year classes comprised 41% and 27% of the 2010 fall tullibee catch in Green Lake. In 2011 fall, private netters had poor netting success for tullibee. The lack of adult tullibee on the spawning grounds from early November to early December of 2010 and 2011 as sampled by both DNR and private netters during the open season is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the tullibee population in Green Lake. Hopefully, cool summers will occur during the next several years, which may result in a good hatch and survival of tullibee in Green Lake if adequate brood stock numbers are still present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2011 (2.50 fish/gillnet) and below the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 14.91 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2011 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.17 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets. There were no yellow perch of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger in the 2011 gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were below the Green Lake and Spicer Area lakes normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2006 and 2007 yellow perch year classes each comprised about 30% of the 2011 yellow perch gillnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were high in 2011 (14.42 fish/gillnet) and above the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.16 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2011 walleye average size was moderate (1.18 pounds and 14.15 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.66 inches from gillnets. The 2011 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye (5.25 fish/gillnet) was moderate, but above the historical average (3.88 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2011 catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches) and larger walleye (1.00 fish/gillnet) was low, but similar to the historical average (0.74 fish/gillnet). The 2011 walleye condition factor (0.914 Fulton K-Factor) was above the normal range for Green. Growth rates were within the Green Lake normal ranges for ages 1-3 and above the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The recent walleye year classes since 2001 are due mostly to stocking of fingerlings and fry. The 2008 and 2009 walleye year classes comprised about 28% and 23% respectively of the 2011 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing assessment of Green Lake was conducted on September 27, 2011. The 2011 fall electrofishing assessment was conducted to evaluate walleye natural reproduction and a 2011 walleye fry stocking in Green Lake. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked walleye fry (about 2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2009-2011. The walleye fry were stocked in part as a 10% return of walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured in 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall survey catch. Yearling walleye numbers (3.00 fish/hour, 9.71 inches) were low in the 2011 fall survey. There were low numbers of YOY walleye (11.00 YOY/hour, 6.60 inches average length) captured in 2010. Walleye yearling numbers were low to moderate (9.00 fish/hour, 9.18 inches average length) in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. Marked fish from 2009 and 2010 stockings accounted for 55% of YOY walleye catch and 13% of the yearling walleye catch in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 82.54 YOY/hour. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY walleye catch rate and length are 14.46 YOY/hour and 6.74 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches average size). Walleye unmarked fingerlings (66,000 fish, 3,081 pounds) and OTC marked fry (2,357,895 fish) were stocked into Green during early April-November of 2011. Green Lake has been stocked annually with walleye fry (1-2 million) from 2000-2011 except for 2002. Various combinations of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake. During the 1990's, walleye fry were stocked in 1996 and larger walleye (fingerlings and adults) were stocked in 1994, 1992 and 1990. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were high in 2011 (11.75 fish/gillnet) and above the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The rock bass historical average catch rate is 7.83 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2011 rock bass average size was moderate (0.34 pounds and 7.09 inches) from gillnets. The rock bass historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2011 (0.42 fish/gillnet) and within the normal ranges for Green and similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 0.64 fish/gillnet for Green. The 2011 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.90 pounds and 11.28 inches) from gillnets. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.68 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates were generally below the Green Lake and Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2012 fall for walleye natural reproduction, and 2012 summer for all fish species by assessment nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Green Lake was conducted during early August of 2015. A creel survey was also conducted on Green Lake during 2014-15 winter and 2015 summer. Green is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. It is a popular recreational lake. Green is also a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. A broad band (3-36 feet) of ideal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (>3 ppm) for tullibee were present in Green during late summers for 2013-2015. Water clarity was moderate (8.5 feet) for Green Lake on August 3, 2015. Local residents reported excellent water clarity (>20 feet deep) during the 2015-16 winter. Late ice on (December 27, 2015) and poor ice conditions occurred which resulted in reduced observed winter angling pressure (fish house counts) on Green and many other local lakes during the early part of the 2015-16 winter. Ice off occurred on March 22, 2016 which was the second earliest occurrence for Green Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nClimate change effects have been noticeable for ice covered days, water clarity, habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, bass species, Bluegill and Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such as Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". In addition, increased densities of submergent vegetation such as invasive Eurasian watermilfoil have provided added habitat/cover for all fish species. Water clarity and occasional late summer blue-green algae bloom events are also expected to increase in the future due to the effects of the recent zebra mussel infestation in Green during 2014. <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil, and curly-leaf pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. starry stonewort, quagga mussels, spiny water flea, faucet snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. One adult zebra mussel was found on a dock along the southeast shore of Green during the early summer of 2014. No additional zebra mussels were found until the fall of 2014. Numerous small young zebra mussels were found attached on docks and boat lifts scattered throughout Green Lake in 2015. Eradication of zebra mussels is improbable once mussels spread throughout a lake due to their ability to reproduce large numbers of young zebra mussel \"veligers\" by a small number of adults. Green Lake will continue to be monitored to document impacts zebra mussels may have on the lake ecology (i.e. water clarity, substrate effects, aquatic vegetation, plankton abundance, native species responses, etc.). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant (44.87 fish/trapnet) in 2015. Bluegill average size was moderate (5.8 inches) and has improved in recent years. Black Crappie numbers (1.75 fish/gillnet) and average size (0.4 pounds and 8.0 inches) have also improved in Green. Abundant numbers of small sized (10.1 inches average) Largemouth Bass are also present in Green. Rock Bass numbers (14.67 fish/gillnet) were at a historical high in 2015. Scattered patches of submergent vegetation (Eurasian watermilfoil) and edges of weed lines (10-15 feet deep) have provided good habitat and fishing areas for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie. In recent years, good crappie fishing has occurred during the spring and fall on Green. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers (1.50 fish/gillnet) were below the normal range in 2015. The Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.9 pounds and 25.0 inches). Green has the ability to produce trophy size Northern Pike due in part to the tullibee forage base. However, Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the surveys prior to 2003. Important forage fish numbers of Yellow Perch (1.67 fish/gillnet) and Tullibee (0.92 fish/gillnet) were low in Green Lake during 2015 and previous assessments since 2003.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers in 2015 (1.08 fish/gillnet) were moderate compared to previous years. The Smallmouth Bass average size is large (1.58 pounds and 13.85 inches). Green is a popular fishing lake for large sized Smallmouth Bass by local and tournament anglers. Crayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999. Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to an abundant new forage species \"zebra mussel\" present in Green. Research has identified crayfish and Pumpkinseed as potential predators on smaller zebra mussels. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2015 (5.25 fish/gillnet) were within the normal range but below the Green Lake historical average (8.94 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.1 pounds and 14.0 inches). The 2011 and 2013 year classes comprised the majority of the Walleye survey catch in 2015. Local anglers had moderate Walleye fishing success during the 2014-15 winter, 2015 summer and fall as reported to creel clerks. Natural reproduction has been poor since the mid 1990's as measured by fall electrofishing surveys. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. Green Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 or 2015 due to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Walleye fingerlings (38,121 fish, 3,057 pounds) were last stocked into Green during 2015. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be surveyed again in the 2016 summer for all fish species by assessment nets and the 2016 fall for Walleye natural reproduction by electrofishing.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Green Lake was conducted during early August of 2016. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 28, 2016 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. A creel survey was conducted on Green Lake during 2015. Green is a large (5,561 acres), deep (110 feet maximum), highly developed (690 homes) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. There are approximately 48 inlets that enter Green Lake. The Middle Fork Crow River is the largest inlet and enters Green along the north shore and exits along the east side eventually flowing into Calhoun Lake. Direct nutrient runoff into Green is primarily from highway runoff and residential sources, which include lake homes and the city of Spicer. There is also upstream agricultural row crop runoff that enters into the Middle Fork Crow River. Water levels were high during the summer and fall of 2016 due to frequent rainfall events. Water clarity was excellent (12.7 feet) for Green Lake on July 28, 2016. A broad band (3-36 feet) of ideal temperatures (<74 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\") and dissolved oxygen levels (>3 ppm) for Tullibee were present in Green during late summers for 2013-2015. There was adequate dissolved oxygen (>3 ppm) and temperature conditions (<74 F) for Tullibee at depths of 27-35 feet during the August 2015 survey and 40-60 feet during the 2016 survey. The most frequently observed submergent and algal vegetation species or groups included Chara, Stonewort, Eurasian Watermilfoil, River Pondweed, Water Moss, Clasping-leaf Pondweed, Sago Pondweed and Curly-leaf Pondweed. Emergent vegetation such as Hardstem Bulrush is abundant in the outlet bay. A moderate stand of bulrush is also present along the southeast shore. Shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, rubble, gravel and boulder. Recent ice on dates were December 10, 2016 and December 27, 2015. Snow and mild temperatures resulted in poor conditions (<6 inches of ice), thus limiting access on Green and many other local lakes during December of 2016. Recent ice off dates were March 21, 2017 and March 22, 2016 which were the second and third earliest occurrences for Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nClimate change effects have been noticeable for both habitat and species density changes in Green Lake during recent decades. Periphyton (algae, diatoms) and dead plant material now cover the boulder/rubble substrates generally all year long with the exception of some narrow (<1 foot deep) windswept near shore areas. This has favored warm water species (Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass) which are nest spawners, unlike broadcast spawners such Walleye and Tullibee \"Cisco\". In addition, increased densities of submergent vegetation such as invasive Eurasian Watermilfoil (first documented in 2000) have provided added habitat/cover for all fish species.  <br> \n <br> \nThe threats of present (Zebra Mussels, Eurasian Watermilfoil, and Curly-leaf Pondweed) and potential exotic invasive species introductions (i.e. Starry Stonewort, Quagga Mussels, Spiny Water Flea, Faucet Snail, etc.) are of a major concern to local residents in Kandiyohi County. One adult Zebra Mussel was found on a dock along the southeast shore of Green during the early summer of 2014. No additional Zebra Mussels were found until the fall of 2014. Numerous small young Zebra Mussels were found attached on docks and boat lifts scattered throughout Green Lake in 2015. Eradication of Zebra Mussels is improbable once Mussels spread throughout a lake due to their ability to reproduce large numbers of young Zebra Mussel \"veligers\" by a small number of adults. Green Lake will continue to be monitored to document impacts Zebra Mussels may have on the lake ecology (i.e. water clarity, substrate effects, aquatic vegetation, plankton abundance, native species responses, etc.). Water clarity and occasional late summer blue-green algae bloom events are also expected to increase in the future due to the potential effects of the recent Zebra Mussel infestation in Green. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2016 (23.53 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average (45.39 fish/trapnet). Bluegill average size was large (0.28 pounds and 7.0 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of Bluegill (20.92 fish/trapnet) 6.0 inches and larger in the trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in 2016 (0.92 fish/gillnet, 1.07 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical averages (1.26 fish/gillnet and 0.77 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie average sizes were moderate from gillnets (0.57 pounds and 9.3 inches), but slightly smaller from trapnets (0.37 pounds and 8.0 inches). Black Crappie growth rates were excellent.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2016 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (2.71 fish/gillnet). Northern Pike average size was moderate (2.89 pounds and 23.4 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight and length are 3.17 pounds and 23.4 inches from gillnets. Northern Pike have been generally lean in appearance compared to fish captured in the assessments prior to 2003. Low numbers of forage fish (Yellow Perch and Tullibee) have been documented in Green Lake surveys from 2003-2016. Northern Pike growth rates were poor for ages 1-3, but moderate for ages 4-7. The 2013 year class comprised 39% of the 2016 Northern Pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers were low in 2016 (1.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (1.82 fish/gillnet). Smallmouth Bass average size was large (2.16 pounds and 15.6 inches) from gillnets. The Smallmouth Bass historical average weight and length are 1.55 pounds and 13.4 inches from gillnets for Green Lake. Smallmouth Bass condition factors have been generally poor since 2001. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were poor for ages 1-7. Crayfish, an important Smallmouth Bass forage species, have been present in low numbers since 1999. Crayfish numbers may increase in the future due to a new forage species \"Zebra Mussel\" present in Green. In response, this may also provide a greater forage base \"crayfish\" for Smallmouth Bass. The 2010 and 2011 year classes each comprised 29% of the 2016 Smallmouth Bass gillnet catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nTullibee numbers were low in the 2016 summer survey (0.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (2.06 fish/gillnet). The 2016 summer Tullibee average size was small (0.42 pounds and 10.8) inches from gillnets. The Tullibee historical summer average weight is 0.60 pounds from gillnets. The 2012 Tullibee year class comprised 100% of the 2016 Tullibee summer survey catch. Tullibee numbers were also low (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.7 inches average) in the 2015 fall assessment. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and inadequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee populations in Green. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2016 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (12.73 fish/gillnet). Local anglers have reported seeing numerous small Yellow Perch amongst the chara beds with cameras during the summer or while spearing in the winter. Our standard gillnets may not effectively sample these small (<5.0 inches) Yellow Perch. Predation pressures from various species (i.e. Rock Bass, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, etc.) may have also selected for smaller sized and earlier reproducing Yellow Perch restricted to near bottom cover consisting of dense chara beds in Green. Yellow Perch average size was moderate to small (0.11 pounds and 6.6 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2016 (5.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (8.82 fish/gillnet) for Green Lake. The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate (1.21 pounds and 14.8 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight and length are 1.26 pounds and 14.7 inches from gillnets. Walleye condition factors were poor in 2016. Growth rates were also poor compared to other Spicer Area lakes, but variable by age compared to Green Lake historical values. Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. The 2016 walleye survey catch was comprised primarily of 2011 (19%), 2012 (19%), 2013 (32%) and 2014 (19%) year classes. The 2011 Walleye year class was successful in many area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. OTC marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013 and 2016. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 or 2015 due to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were mostly part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program. Walleye unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings (18,413 fish, 1,784 pounds) were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults have been stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) since 2000 into Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNo YOY Walleye were captured during the 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2014 (4.0 YOY/hour, 7.6 inches average length) and 2013 (5.0 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% of the 2013 and 55% (=6.6 YOY/hour) of the 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in a previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.0 YOY/hour, 6.5 inches average length). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63% (=19.6 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY Walleye catch rate and length are 12.3 YOY/hour and 6.8 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.0 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches average size). Yearling Walleye numbers were moderate to low in the 2014 (6.0 fish/hour) and 2016 (3.0 fish/hour) fall surveys. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass numbers were abundant in 2016 (13.08 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. It was the highest recorded value for Green Lake. The Rock Bass historical average catch rate is 8.59 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. The 2016 Rock Bass average size was moderate (0.41 pounds and 7.8 inches from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2016 (1.17 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (0.79 fish/gillnet). Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (0.72 pounds and 10.5 inches) from gillnets. The Largemouth Bass historical average weight is 0.69 pounds from gillnets. Largemouth Bass growth rates were poor for ages 1-5, but moderate for older fish.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included low numbers of White Sucker (0.50 fish/gillnet), Common Carp (0.27 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed (0.07 fish/trapnet), Hybrid Sunfish (1.40 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (0.17 fish/gillnet). Moderate numbers of large Yellow Bullhead were captured in 2016 (3.00 fish/gillnet, 1.01 pounds average weight). <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biotic Integrity \"IBI\" survey was conducted from August 2-3, 2016 on Green Lake. One measure of a lake's health is the community of fish, plants and aquatic life it sustains. Certain species can't survive without clean water and a healthy habitat while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions. Examples of fish that require clean water are Tullibee, Rock Bass, and Bluegill.  Species that are tolerant to degraded habitat are Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish.  The more intolerant fish to degraded habitat you have in the sample, the higher the score will be.  An index of biological integrity (IBI) is a score that compares the types and numbers of fish or plants observed in a lake to what is expected for a healthy lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSeine hauls were conducted at 24 IBI stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at 23 of 24 IBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. One electrofishing station was not sampled due to windy conditions. The 24 IBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 21 different fish species (14 species from back-pack electrofishing, 19 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), large non-gamefish (Yellow Bullhead) and small non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Brook Silverside, Blacknose Shiner, Banded Killifish, Golden Shiner, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Spotfin Shiner, Spottail Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow and Tadpole Madtom). Young of year species captured included Brook Silverside, Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass in seine hauls. Rock Bass and Yellow Bullhead were only captured by electrofishing. The various species captured in Green is indicative of species present in most riverine connected Spicer Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2017 for YOY Walleye abundance, and the summer of 2017 for all fish species by standard survey nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Green Lake was conducted during mid-late November of 2017 using lake survey gillnets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), and deep (110 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. A standard survey (summer gillnets and trapnets) of Green Lake was also conducted during late July through early August of 2017. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 27, 2017 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. Another targeted fall gillnetting survey was conducted for Walleye during late September of 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Green during the 1880's. Koronis is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Green and Koronis during recent years have been covered by periphyton/algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Climate changes may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction/recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (i.e. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Green Lake if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer temperatures than adult Tullibee. The last reported summerkill on Green prior to 2011 was a minor event during 1995. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present at depths where preferred adult Tullibee temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 74 F on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2017.  <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels were first observed in Green Lake in 2014. Presently, Zebra Mussels are abundant within the lake. It is unknown the extent Zebra Mussels will affect Tullibee and corresponding forage base. Green has been the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year since the late 1980's. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in Green. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were not present in the previous 2017 summer standard survey catch. The Tullibee historical average summer catch rate is 2.06 fish/gillnet for Green Lake. A targeted September gillnetting survey was conducted primarily to assess the Walleye population. There were 12 gillnets set at standard summer stations during September of 2017. In addition, 2 special gillnets were also set in deeper water (40-50 feet deep), adjacent to standard sets near Hultgren's and Gratz's Bars. Tullibee (5.50 fish/special gillnet, 11.43 inches) were only captured at these two sites during the September gillnetting survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) in the 2017 November survey. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) fall surveys. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis (19.67 fish fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches) in the 2015 fall, but low numbers in 2017 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.41 inches). The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 70.30 fish/gillnet and 12.48 inches for Green Lake. The 2017 fall Tullibee condition factor (0.934 K-factor) was below the 25th quartile (1.098 K-factor) for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were below the Green Lake 25th quartiles for ages 1 5 in both the September and November survey gillnet catches. The 2012 year class comprised 45% and 100% respectively of the 2017 September and November Tullibee survey catches. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and inadequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long term population in Green. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Green is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Public fall gillnetting season will probably be postponed until the adult population rebounds to adequate levels. Current fish management activities on Green include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2018 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil (2000) and Zebra Mussels (2014). Green is a popular fishery for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie (recent years) and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Lake was stocked annually with Walleye fry (1-4 million) from 2000-2013 except for 2002. Spicer strain Walleye fry were primarily stocked since 2005. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked Walleye fry (1-2 million) were stocked in Green each year during 2000-2001, 2007-2013, 2016 and 2018. No Walleye fry were stocked in 2020, 2019, 2017, 2015 or 2014 due in part to the cessation of egg take operations on Green Lake. Walleye fry stocked during previous years were mostly part of a 10% return of Walleye eggs taken for the statewide propagation program.  <br> \n <br> \nVarious combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults were stocked annually (2,000-4,000 pounds/year) from 2000-2017 into Green Lake. Pike River was the primary Walleye fingerling strain that was available and stocked into Green from 2000-2014. Spicer Area Walleye fingerling rearing ponds have been stocked with primarily the Spicer strain since 2015. Both Unmarked Spicer and Pike River Walleye strains were stocked into Green during 2015 (36,723 fingerlings, 2,497 pounds; 1,400 yearlings, 560 pounds). Unmarked Spicer strain fingerlings and yearlings were stocked into Green during the 2016 fall (26,365 fingerlings, 1,647 pounds; 4,641 yearlings, 828 pounds). Green Lake was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped age 3+ adults (196 pounds, 192 fish) and ages 1+ fish (2,081 pounds, 3,936 fish) in the 2017 fall. Spicer strain (1,173 pounds, 16,064 fish) and Pike River strain (117 pounds, 936 fish) fingerlings were also stocked in the 2017 fall. Walleye yearlings (701 fish, 150 pounds) and adults (300 fish, 150 pounds) were stocked by private sources in 2019. In 2020 fall, Green was stocked with Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye adults (76 pounds, 39 fish) and yearlings (3,411 pounds, 7,765 fish). In 2021 fall, Green was stocked with 2,500 Spicer strain fin clipped Walleye (1,050 pounds). Adults and yearlings comprised 1,844 fish (911 pounds) of the 2021 stocking. Fingerlings comprised 656 fish (139 pounds) of the 2021 stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate Young of Year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers (10.50 YOY/hour, 7.39 inches) for Green Lake were captured in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye were absent in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low yearling/adult Walleye numbers were caught in the 2020 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2019 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.24 inches), 2018 (1.00 YOY/hour, 7.13 inches), 2014 (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.62 inches) and 2013 (5.00 YOY/hour, 6.40 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.87 inches) were captured in 2012 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY Walleye were captured during the 2017, 2016 or 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. OTC marked fry captured as fingerlings comprised 40% (2.00 YOY/hour) of the 2013 and 55% (5.50 YOY/hour) of the 2012 fall electrofishing surveys. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey (31.00 YOY/hour, 6.46 inches average length). OTC marked YOY Walleye (fry stocked) comprised 63.3% (19.62 YOY/hour) of the 2011 fall YOY Walleye survey catch. The Green Lake fall electrofishing historical average YOY Walleye catch rate and length are 10.73 YOY/hour and 6.84 inches. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye for Green occurred in 1994 (54.00 YOY/hour, 6.15 inches). Yearling Walleye numbers were moderate to low in the 2014 (6.00 fish/hour), 2016 (3.00 fish/hour) and 2018 (2.00 fish/hour) fall electrofishing surveys. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2017 and 2015 fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was 6.67 fish/gillnet in the 2021 fall standard survey. The 2021 Walleye average size was (1.56 pounds and 16.15 inches). The 2021 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye was low (3.25 fish/gillnet). The 2021 fall catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches and larger) Walleye was also low (0.42 fish/gillnet). Recent Walleye year classes have been due mostly to stocking since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Green Lake include monitoring the fish population on an annual basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives to maintain or improve water quality, and stocking Walleye to meet long-range goals. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2022 fall by electrofishing for YOY Walleye abundance, 2022 fall by gillnets for Tullibee and 2022 early fall by standard survey nets for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of Tullibee (Cisco) in Green Lake was conducted during mid-late November of 2023 at four lake survey special gillnet stations. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nGreen is a large (5,561 acres), and deep (110 feet maximum) lake located in Kandiyohi County. Green is currently infested with invasive species such as Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels. A standard survey (summer gillnets and trapnets) of Green Lake was also conducted during mid-September of 2023. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on October 8, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Green Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were believed to be initially introduced into Green and Koronis during the 1880's. Koronis is the only other Spicer Area lake with a self-sustaining Tullibee population. Tullibee spawn in 3-6 feet of water over bottom substrates consisting of large rock during late November to early December when the water temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit \"F\" or less. Spawning substrates in both Green and Koronis during recent years have been covered by periphyton/filamentous algae except in shallow (<1 foot) windswept shoal areas. Increased phosphorus inputs or availability often result in greater blue-green and filamentous algae blooms. Climate changes (e.g. warmer temperatures, additional growing days, increased storm/runoff activity, etc.) coupled with continued nutrient inputs and Zebra Mussel impacts may be negatively affecting Tullibee natural reproduction and recruitment success in these lakes due to degrading spawning habitat and increasing numbers of warm water fish species (e.g. Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, etc.) which prey upon Tullibee eggs, fry or fingerlings.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Tullibee are susceptible to summerkill in Green Lake if oxygen levels drop (<2 ppm) in the cooler deeper areas (<74 F) of the lake for an extended time (1-3 weeks) during late July to early August. Young Tullibee can tolerate warmer water temperatures than adult Tullibee. The last reported summerkill on Green prior to 2011 was a minor event during 1995. Low dissolved oxygen (<2 ppm) levels were present at depths where preferred adult Tullibee water temperatures (<74 F) occurred for a short time period in the 2010 late summer. Although no summerkill of Tullibee was reported for Green, a minor summerkill of adult Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2010. A major summerkill of Tullibee occurred in Koronis during 2011, but only a minor kill occurred in Green during the 2011 summer. Drought conditions and extremely high air temperatures were the norm for the Spicer Area during July and early August of 2012. There were no apparent summerkills in Green or Koronis during 2012, but adult numbers were so low that summerkill events may not have been recognizable, especially due to the large numbers of pelicans living on Lake Koronis' islands. A narrow band (1-3 feet) of marginal water temperatures (<74 F) and dissolved oxygen levels (1-3 ppm) was present in depths of 25-30 feet in Green during late July and early August of 2012. Dissolved oxygen levels and water temperatures in Green were at potential summerkill levels of 2 ppm and 74 F on both July 30th and August 9th of 2012. Summer temperature and oxygen conditions were more conducive for Tullibee survival during 2013-2019. The month of June had warmer air temperatures (up to 90 F) and drier (< 2 inches of rain) than normal conditions during 2020-2022. July air temperatures were below or near normal during those same years. The 2023 summer was warmer and drier than normal overall especially for June, but no tullibee summerkills were observed in Green or Koronis. Adequate water temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels were present from 20 feet depth (73 F, 8 ppm) to 40 feet depth (60 F, 3 ppm) for tullibee survival on July 28, 2023. <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels were first observed in Green Lake in 2014. Presently, Zebra Mussels are abundant within the lake. It is unknown the extent Zebra Mussels will affect Tullibee and the corresponding forage base. Green was the only lake in the Spicer Area open to the public for fall gillnetting of Tullibee during late November or early December each year from the late 1980's to 2011. Green Lake has been closed for Tullibee gillnetting since 2012 due to the low numbers sampled in recent years. Tullibee are an important forage fish for trophy northern pike in both Green and Koronis. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee eggs were collected using a 300 foot gillnet (2.25-2.5 bar mesh) on November 18, 2022 at Lake Koronis for a doctoral research project. A total of 88 tullibee were captured in the overnight gillnet set. Approximately 2 quarts were stripped from 15 females and fertilized with 30 plus males on Koronis. One third of these eggs were immediately shipped to the University of Ohio-Miami. The remaining eggs were incubated in Muskellunge jars at the New London Hatchery for several weeks at 40 F river water and later shipped to the same research facility. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of UV light on cisco egg hatching and fry survival. The hatch rate was moderately successful. Local tullibee propagation (incubation, hatching and rearing to fryling stage) is possible at the New London Hatchery using a recirculation system and a dry diet regime until fish can be stocked in the spring following ice out. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were present (0.67 fish/gillnet, 9.65 inches average length) in the 2023 summer survey. Low numbers of Tullibee were caught in 2021 (0.17 fish/gillnet) and 2022 (0.08 fish/gillnet). Tullibee were not present in the 2017-2020 summer standard survey catches. The Tullibee historical average August/September catch rate is 1.70 fish/gillnet for Green Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee numbers were low in 2023 November survey (4.00 fish/gillnet, 10.77 inches). Tullibee numbers were also low in 2019 (1.75 fish/gillnet, 13.94 inches) and 2017 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 11.25 inches) November surveys. Tullibee abundance was higher in the 2012 (8.33 fish/gillnet, 13.61 inches) and 2015 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 13.66 inches) November surveys. The highest recorded tullibee catch was 195.17 fish/gillnet on Green during 1994. Low tullibee numbers (5.00 fish/gillnet, 16.41 inches) were also caught in Koronis during 2023. Moderate numbers of Tullibee were captured in nearby Lake Koronis in 2019 (27.50 fish/gillnet, 15.75 inches) and 2015 (19.67 fish fish/gillnet, 14.17 inches), but low numbers in 2017 (10.33 fish/gillnet, 14.41 inches). The fall Tullibee historical average catch rate and average length are 64.89 fish/gillnet and 12.48 inches for Green Lake. Tullibee growth rates were good for ages 1-4 in the 2023 November survey gillnet catches. The 2020 and 2018 year classes comprised 56% and 38% respectively of the 2023 November Tullibee survey catch. The inconsistency of Tullibee natural reproduction and inadequate adult Tullibee numbers on the spawning grounds as sampled by the DNR is not a good indication for the long term sustainability of the Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Hopefully, consecutive cool summers will continue to occur periodically, which may result in a good hatch, recruitment and survival of Tullibee to maintain a long-term population in Green. <br> \n <br> \nImproving and maintaining good water quality in Green is the key for Tullibee numbers to survive and flourish. Tullibee propagation is an option for maintaining a viable population. Other sampling methodology such as fall electrofishing and summer vertical gillnetting may better sample Tullibee populations in Green and Koronis. Public fall gillnetting season will probably be postponed until the adult population rebounds to adequate levels. Current fish management activities on Green include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel with invasive species monitoring and education, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Green Lake fishery will be sampled during mid-September of 2024 summer for all fish species. Tullibee will be sampled by vertical gillnetting and hydroacoustic methods in June of 2024, and November gillnetting in 2025 for both Green and Koronis. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
