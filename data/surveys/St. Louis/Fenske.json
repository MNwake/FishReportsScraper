                "narrative": "<p>Fenske Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Fenske Lake has clearer water and a more irregular shoreline shape than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Fenske Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nFenske Lake was thermally stratified on 06/07/2007 with a surface temperature of 63 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was present to a depth of 33 ft, where the temperature was 43 F. Fenske Lake has three inlets; two drain local swamps and the third, from Little Sletten Lake, has beaver dams that limit fish movement.  The outlet, to Everett Lake, also has beaver dams that limit fish movement. Aquatic plant growth is sparse in the main basin of Fenske Lake, primarily because the shoreline is rocky and drops off quickly.  Aquatic plant growth is lush in the shallow east and west ends of the lake, where they grow to a depth of 9 ft; watershield, waterlilies, floatingleaf burreed, and bladderwort are the most common plants.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Fenske Lake are mostly ledge rock, boulder, and rubble in the main basin, and muck or silt in the shallow east and west ends. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a public access with a gravel boat ramp off the Echo Trail (CSAH 116), and portages to Little Sletten and Everett Lakes.  About a third of the shoreline of Fenske Lake is in private ownership, primarily along the north shore.  Riparian development increased from one resort with 12 cabins, a girl scout camp, and a U.S. Forest Service campground in 1960; to one resort with 7 cabins, the Forest Service campground, and 6 private cabins in 1979; and to two resorts with 9 cabins, the Forest Service campground (with 16 campsites), and 7 private cabins in 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2007 fisheries lake survey was done with six gillnets, nine standard trapnets, and four small mesh (1/4\" bar) trapnets used for catching small fish.  Nine previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1960, used 3-6 gillnets and 2-10 trapnets.  Most of these investigations were done in July or August, but the 2007 investigation was done in June due to scheduling considerations and because panfish are more easily captured early in the summer.  Most of the trapnets were set in the shallow east and west basins of the lake, while the gillnets were set in the deeper main basin of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2007 of 3 fish/net (6 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median total catch of 5 fish/net (8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  The gillnet catch in 2007, as in previous investigations on this lake, was dominated by northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2007 of 24 fish/net (10 lb/net) was very similar to the median total catch in all investigations on this lake of 21 fish/net (4 lb/net).  The trapnet catch in 2007, as in previous investigations on this lake, was dominated by bluegill sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class, but were higher than the median catch of 1.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Fair numbers of pike (2.4/net) were also caught in the trapnets in 2007.  Pike sizes in the gillnets averaged 22.6\" (2.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 28.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2007, caught in a trapnet, was 32.9\".  Pike growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2007 (18.7/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class, and were similar to the median catch of 16.3/trapnet in all investigations on this lake. Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 6.4\" (0.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average bluegill size of 5.8\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2007 was 8.7\".  Most bluegill were ages five and six, and fair numbers of young-of-year bluegill were caught in the small mesh trapnets.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2007 (1.4/trapnet), as in previous investigations, were quite low.  Large crappie (up to 12\") were caught in most investigations on this lake, but the largest crappie in 2007 was 10.8\".   <br> \n <br> \nBass populations in Fenske Lake are likely more abundant than indicated by the net catches.  Bass are \"net-shy\" and tend to avoid standard sampling nets.  Some young-of-year largemouth were captured in the small mesh trapnets in 2007. <br> \n  <br> \nMost of the game fish examined in 2007 were free of diseases or parasites.  A few bluegill were infected with neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fenske Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Fenske Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class, except that it has clearer water and a more irregular shoreline shape than most.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in Minnesota, in terms of the numbers and biomass of fish present.Fenske Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) below 29 ft, where the water temperature is 45 F.  Aquatic plant growth is sparse in the main basin, but dense in the shallow east and west end basins of the lake.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft; waterlilies, watershield, and burreeds are the most common plants.  The end basins have a muck bottom, while the main basin shoreline has a boulder and rubble bottom.  The inlet from Little Sletten Lake has a rocky rapids that limits fish movement, while the outlet to Everett Lake has a beaver dam.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 5 fish/net (11 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class.  However, the 1997 catch was similar to the long term average catch of 7 fish/gillnet (11 lb/gillnet) in eight previous gillnettings in Fenske Lake dating back to 1960.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 of 17 fish/net (7 lb/net) was very similar to the long term average catch in Fenske Lake of 21 fish/net (5 lb/net).Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by northern pike and bluegill sunfish.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (1/gillnet) were lower than normal for this lake class, but were the same as the long term average catch of 1/gillnet in previous gillnettings in this lake.  Fair numbers of pike were also captured in the trapnets in 1997.  Pike sizes in the gillnets averaged 29\"; the largest was 33.7\".  All eight pike captured in the gillnets were ages four through seven, although some smaller pike were captured in the trapnets, but were not aged.  Pike growth (25\" at age four) was faster than normal for the area. Bluegill numbers in 1997 (11/trapnet) were normal for this lake class, but were lower than the long term average catch of 17/trapnet for this lake.  Bluegill sizes averaged 5\"; the largest was 7.9\".  All bluegill except one were from the 1991, 1994, and 1995 year classes.  As with many area lakes, few panfish in Fenske Lake reproduced successfully during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Bluegill growth (3\" at age two, 6\" at age six) was normal for the area. Most gamefish in 1997 were examined externally for diseases and parasites; northern pike, cisco, and smallmouth bass were examined internally as well.  Most species appeared to be free of diseases and parasites, but 20 percent of bluegill had Neascus (black spot) in their skin, and 60 percent of smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their abdominal cavity.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are common parasites in the area, cannot infect humans, are killed by cooking, and are usually removed by filleting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fenske Lake is located approximately 8 miles N of Ely within the Superior National Forest. There are several cabins around the lake and a small resort is located near the NW corner. The USFS operates a campround near the NW corner as well. \n\nThere is a gravel boat ramp near the campground off CR 116 (Echo Trail) for public access. The parking area is limited in space for launching and storing vehicles. A wheelchair accessible fishing pier is located at the campground for use. There are portages from Little Sletten and Everett Lakes where visitors can also access Fenske Lake by canoe.\n\nEight species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Fenske Lake. Northern pike (65%) were the most common species sampled in the gill nets and small bluegill (84%) dominated the trap net catch. Smallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled in relatively low numbers in 2017. Several black crappie were also sampled in the trap nets.\n\nNorthern pike numbers in 2017 (2.2/gill net) were slightly higher than the historic average (1.3/gill net) on this lake and slightly lower to the average catch of 2.8/gill net when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled measured 26 inches which is smaller than the historic average of 28.4 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2017 was a respectable 40.2 inches long.\n\nBluegill numbers in 2017 (15.9/trap net) were identical to the historic average for Fenske Lake and above average (10.3/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes. The average bluegill sampled was 5.6 inches which is similar to the historic average of 5.8 inches. Only one bluegill over 8 inches was sampled in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",
